[[File:Pyramid abstract polytope.svg|thumb|340px|A square pyramid and the associated abstract polytope.]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''abstract polytope''' is an algebraic [[partially ordered set]] or poset which captures the [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] properties of a traditional [[polytope]], but not any purely geometric properties such as angles, edge lengths, etc.

An ordinary geometric polytope is said to be a ''realization'' in some real [[N-dimensional space]], typically [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]], of the corresponding abstract polytope.

The abstract definition allows some more general combinatorial structures than traditional definitions of a polytope, thus allowing many new objects that have no counterpart in traditional theory.

The term ''polytope'' is a generalisation of [[polygon]]s and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] into any number of dimensions.

== Introductory concepts ==

=== Traditional versus abstract polytopes ===
[[Image:Isomorphic Tetragons.svg|thumb|275px|Six geometric quadrilaterals.]]
In Euclidean geometry, the six [[quadrilateral]]s illustrated are all different. Yet they have a common structure in the alternating chain of four vertices and four sides which gives them their name. They are said to be [[isomorphic]] or “structure preserving”.

This common structure may be represented in an underlying abstract polytope, a purely algebraic partially-ordered set which captures the pattern of connections or ''incidences'' between the various structural elements. The measurable properties of traditional polytopes such as angles, edge-lengths, skewness, straightness and convexity have no meaning for an abstract polytope.

What is true for traditional polytopes (also called classical or geometric polytopes) may not be so for abstract ones, and vice versa. For example, a traditional polytope is regular if all its facets and vertex figures are regular, but this is not necessarily so for an abstract polytope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |McMullen |Schulte |2002 |loc=p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Realisations====
A traditional geometric polytope is said to be  a ''realisation'' of the associated abstract polytope. A realisation is a mapping or injection of the abstract object into a real space, typically [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]], to construct a traditional polytope as a real geometric figure.

The six quadrilaterals shown are all distinct realisations of the abstract quadrilateral, each with different geometric properties. Some of them do not conform to traditional definitions of a quadrilateral and are said to be ''unfaithful'' realisations. A conventional polytope is a faithful realisation.

===Faces, ranks and ordering===
In an abstract polytope, each structural element - vertex, edge, cell, etc. is associated with a corresponding member or element of the set. The term ''face'' often refers to any such element e.g. a vertex (0-face), edge (1-face) or a general ''k''-face, and not just a polygonal 2-face.

The faces are ''ranked'' according to their associated real dimension: vertices have rank = 0, edges rank = 1 and so on.

Incident faces of different rank, for example a vertex F of an edge G, are ordered by the relation  F &lt; G. F is said to be a ''subface'' of G, or G has subface F.

F, G are said to be ''incident'' if either F = G or F &lt; G or G &lt; F. This usage of "incidence" also occurs in [[Finite geometry]], although it differs from traditional geometry and some other areas of mathematics. For example in the square ''abcd'', edges ''ab'' and ''bc'' are not abstractly incident (although they are both incident with vertex ''b'').{{cn|date=December 2016|reason=equals sign undefined. F ranked equally to G is not sufficient condition for geometrical incidence, on the other hand F equating to G would mean they are the same face.}}

A polytope is then defined as a set of faces '''P''' with an order relation &lt;, and which satisfies certain additional axioms. Formally, '''P''' (with '''&lt;''') will be a (strict) [[partially ordered set]], or ''poset''.

===Least and greatest faces===
Just as the number zero is necessary in mathematics, so also set theory requires an [[empty set]] which, technically, every set contains. In an abstract polytope this is known as the ''least'' or ''null'' face and is a subface of all the others. Since the least face is one level below the vertices or 0-faces, its rank is −1 and may be denoted as ''F''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;. It is not usually realized.

There is also a single face of which all the others are subfaces. This is called the ''greatest'' face. In an ''n''-dimensional polytope, the greatest face has rank = ''n'' and may be denoted as ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is sometimes realized as the interior of the geometric figure.

These least and greatest faces are sometimes called ''improper'' faces, with all others being ''proper'' faces.

===A simple example===
The faces of the abstract quadrilateral or square are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable
|- 
!|Face type 
!Rank (''k'')
!Count
!''k''-faces
|-
|Least ||−1 ||1||''F''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
|Vertex ||0 ||4||'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''d'''
|-
|Edge ||1 ||4||W, X, Y, Z
|-
|Greatest ||2 ||1||G
|}

The relation &lt; comprises a set of pairs, which here include

: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;'''a''', ... , ''F''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;X, ... , ''F''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;G, ... , '''b'''&lt;Y, ... , '''c'''&lt;G, ... , Z&lt;G.

Order relations are [[Transitive relation|transitive]], i.e. F &lt; G and  G &lt; H implies that F &lt; H. Therefore, to specify the hierarchy of faces, it is not necessary to give every case of F&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;H, only the pairs where one is the [[Covering relation|successor]] of the other, i.e. where F&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;H and no G satisfies F&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;G&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;H.

The edges W, X, Y and Z are sometimes written as '''ab''', '''ad''', '''bc''', and '''cd''' respectively, but such notation is not always appropriate.

All four edges are structurally similar and the same is true of the vertices. The figure therefore has the symmetries of a square and is usually referred to as the square.

===The Hasse diagram===
[[Image:A Square and its Hasse Diagram.PNG|thumb|300px|The [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (left) and [[Hasse diagram]] of a quadrilateral, showing ranks (right)]]
Smaller posets, and polytopes in particular, are often best visualised in a [[Hasse diagram]], as shown. By convention, faces of equal rank are placed on the same vertical level. Each "line" between faces, say F, G, indicates an ordering relation &lt; such that F &lt; G where F is below G in the diagram.

The Hasse diagram defines the unique poset and therefore fully captures the structure of the polytope. Isomorphic polytopes give rise to isomorphic Hasse diagrams, and vice versa. The same is not generally true for the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] representation of polytopes.

=== Rank ===
The ''rank'' of a face F is defined as (''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2), where ''m'' is the maximum number of faces in any [[Total order#Chains|chain]] (F',&amp;nbsp;F",&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;F) satisfying F'&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;F"&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;F. F' is always the least face, F&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ''rank'' of an abstract polytope '''P''' is the maximum rank '''''n''''' of any face. It is always the rank of the greatest face F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

The rank of a face or polytope usually corresponds to the ''dimension'' of its counterpart in traditional theory.

For some ranks, their face-types are named in the following table.
{|class=wikitable style="text-align: center;"
|- 
!! width="80" | Rank !! width="50" |  -1 !! width="50" |0 !! width="50" |1 !! width="50" |2 !! width="50" |3 !! width="30" | ... !! width="50" |''n'' - 2  !! width="50" |''n'' - 1  ||width="50" |''n'' 
|-
! Face Type 
| Least ||Vertex ||Edge ||† ||Cell ||   ||Subfacet or ridge&lt;ref name=ARP23&gt;{{Harv |McMullen |Schulte |2002 |loc=p. 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ||Facet&lt;ref name=ARP23 /&gt; ||Greatest
|}

† Traditionally "face" has meant a rank 2 face or 2-face. In abstract theory the term "face" denotes a face of ''any'' rank.

===Flags===

A '''[[Flag (geometry)|flag]]''' is a maximal [[Total order#Chains|chain]] of faces, i.e. a (totally) ordered set Ψ of faces, each a subface of the next (if any), and such that Ψ is not a subset of any larger chain. Given any two distinct faces F, G in a flag, either F &lt; G or  F &gt; G.

For example, {'''ø''', '''a''', '''ab''', '''abc'''} is a flag in the triangle '''abc'''.

For a given polytope, all flags contain the same number of faces. Other posets do not, in general, satisfy this requirement.

===Sections===
[[Image:Triangular 3-Prism.PNG|thumb|540px|The graph (left) and Hasse Diagram of a triangular prism, showing a 1-section (&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;), and a 2-section (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;).]]

Any subset P' of a poset P is a poset (with the same relation &lt;, restricted to P').

In an abstract polytope, given any two faces ''F'', ''H'' of P with ''F'' ≤ ''H'', the set {''G'' | ''F'' ≤ ''G'' ≤ ''H''} is called a '''section''' of ''P'', and denoted ''H''/''F''. (In order theory, a section is called a [[Partially ordered set#Interval|closed interval]] of the poset and denoted [''F'', ''H''].

For example, in the prism  '''abcxyz''' (see diagram) the section '''xyz'''/'''ø''' (highlighted green) is the triangle

:{'''ø''', '''x''', '''y''', '''z''', '''xy''', '''xz''', '''yz''', '''xyz'''}.

A '''''k''-section''' is a section of rank ''k''.

A polytope that is the subset of another polytope is not necessarily a section. In the diagram, the square '''abcd''' is a ''subset'' of the tetrahedron '''abcd''', but is not a ''section'' of it.

P is thus a section of itself.

This concept of section ''does not'' have the same meaning as in traditional geometry.

====Vertex figures====
The '''[[vertex figure]]''' at a given vertex ''V'' is the (''n''&amp;minus;1)-section ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''V'', where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the greatest face.

For example, in the triangle '''abc''', the vertex figure at '''b''', '''abc'''/'''b''', is {'''b, ab, bc, abc'''}, which is a line segment.  The vertex figures of a cube are triangles.

====Connectedness====
A poset P is '''connected''' if P has rank ≤ 1, or, given any two proper faces F and G, there is a sequence of proper faces

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,H&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

such that F = H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, G = H&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and each H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i &lt; k, is incident with its successor.

The above condition ensures that a pair of disjoint triangles '''abc''' and '''xyz''' is ''not'' a (single) polytope.

A poset P is '''strongly connected''' if every section of P (including P itself) is connected.

With this additional requirement, two pyramids that share just a vertex are also excluded. However, two square pyramids, for example, ''can'', be "glued" at their square faces - giving an octahedron. The "common face" is ''not'' then a face of the octahedron.

==Formal definition==
An '''abstract polytope''' is a [[partially ordered set]], whose elements we call ''faces'', satisfying the 4 axioms:

# It has a [[Abstract polytope#Least and greatest faces|least face]] and a [[Abstract polytope#Least and greatest faces|greatest face]].
# All [[Abstract polytope#Flags|flags]] contain the same number of faces.
# It is [[Abstract polytope#Connectedness|strongly connected]].
# If the ranks of two faces ''a &gt; b'' differ by 2, then there are exactly 2 faces that lie strictly between ''a'' and ''b''.

An '''''n''-polytope''' is a polytope of rank ''n''.

===Notes===

In the case of the ''null polytope'', the least and greatest faces are the ''same single element''.

Axiom 2 is equivalent to saying that the poset is a [[graded poset]].

Given the other axioms, Axiom 3 is equivalent to ''strong flag-connectedness'', which informally means:

:For any section of the polytope (including the polytope itself), any flag can be changed into any other by changing just one face at a time.

Axiom 4 is known as the “diamond property”, since the Hasse Diagram of ''a'', ''b'', and the faces between it is diamond-shaped.

It can be shown from the axioms that every section is a polytope, and that Rank(''G''/''F'') = Rank(''G'') − Rank(''F'') − 1.

==The simplest polytopes==

===Rank &lt; 1===
There is just one poset for each rank −1 and 0. These are, respectively, the null face and the point. These are not always considered to be valid abstract polytopes.

===Rank 1: the line segment===
[[Image:An Edge (Line Segment) and its Hasse Diagram.PNG|thumb|240px|The graph (left) and Hasse Diagram of a line segment]]
There is only one polytope of rank 1, which is the line segment. It has a least face, just two 0-faces and a greatest face, for example {ø, '''a, b, ab'''}. It follows that the vertices '''a''' and '''b''' have rank 0, and that the greatest face '''ab''', and therefore the poset, both have rank 1.

===Rank 2: polygons===
For each ''p'', 3 ≤ ''p'' &lt; &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have the (abstract equivalent of) the traditional polygon with ''p'' vertices and ''p'' edges, or a ''p''-gon. For p = 3, 4, 5, ... we have the triangle, square, pentagon, ....

For ''p'' = 2, we have the [[digon]], and ''p'' = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; we get the [[apeirogon]].

====The digon====
[[Image:Digon and Hasse Diagram.PNG|thumb|220px|The graph (left) and Hasse Diagram of a digon]]
A [[digon]] is a polygon with just 2 edges. Unlike any other polygon, both edges have the same two vertices. For this reason, it is ''degenerate'' in the [[Euclidean plane]].

Faces are sometimes described using "vertex notation" - e.g. {'''ø''', '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''ab''', '''ac''', '''bc''', '''abc'''} for the triangle '''abc'''. This method has the advantage of ''implying'' the '''&lt;''' relation.

With the digon this vertex notation ''cannot be used''. It is necessary to give the faces individual symbols and specify the subface pairs F &lt; G.

Thus a digon is defined as a set {'''ø''', '''a''', '''b''', E', E", G} with the relation '''&lt;''' given by

:::{'''ø'''&lt;'''a''', '''ø'''&lt;'''b''', '''a'''&lt;E', '''a'''&lt;E",  '''b'''&lt;E', '''b'''&lt;E", E'&lt;G, E"&lt;G}

where E' and E" are the two edges, and G the greatest face.

This need to identify each element of the polytope with a unique symbol applies to many other abstract polytopes and is therefore common practice.

A polytope can only be fully described using vertex notation if ''every face is incident with a unique set of vertices''. A polytope having this property is said to be [[Atom (order theory)|atomistic]].

==Examples of higher rank==

The set of ''j''-faces (−1 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''n'') of a traditional ''n''-polytope form an abstract ''n''-polytope.

The concept of an abstract polytope is more general and also includes:
* [[Apeirotope]]s or infinite polytopes, which include [[tessellation]]s (tilings)
* Proper decompositions of unbounded manifolds such as the [[torus]] or [[real projective plane]].
* Many other objects, such as the [[11-cell]] and the [[57-cell]], that can not be faithfully realized in Euclidean spaces.

===Hosohedra and hosotopes===
[[File:Hexagonal Hosohedron.svg|thumb|A hexagonal [[hosohedron]], realized as a [[spherical polyhedron]].]]
The digon is generalized by the [[hosohedron]] and higher dimensional hosotopes, which can all be realized as [[spherical polyhedra]] – they tessellate the sphere.

===Projective polytopes===
[[Image:Hemicube.svg|thumb|220px|The [[Hemi-cube (geometry)|Hemicube]] may be derived from a cube by identifying opposite vertices, edges, and faces. It has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 3 faces.]]
Four examples of non-traditional abstract polyhedra are the [[Hemi-cube (geometry)|Hemicube]] (shown), [[Hemi-octahedron]], [[Hemi-dodecahedron]], and the [[Hemi-icosahedron]]. These are the projective counterparts of the [[Platonic solid]]s, and can be realized as (globally) [[projective polyhedra]] – they tessellate the [[real projective plane]].

The hemicube is another example of where vertex notation can not be used to define a polytope - all the 2-faces and the 3-face have the same vertex set.

==Duality==
Every geometric polytope has a ''[[Dual polyhedron#Dual polytopes and tessellations|dual]]'' twin. Abstractly, the dual is the same polytope but with the ranking reversed in order: the Hasse diagram differs only in its annotations. In an ''n''-polytope, 
each of the original ''k''-faces maps to an (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-face in the dual. Thus, for example, the ''n''-face maps to the (−1)-face. The dual of a dual is ([[isomorphic]] to) the original.

A polytope is self-dual if it is the same as, i.e. isomorphic to, its dual. Hence, the Hasse diagram of a self-dual polytope must be symmetrical about the horizontal axis half-way between the top and bottom. The square pyramid in the example above is self-dual.

The vertex figure at a vertex ''V'' is the dual of the facet to which ''V'' maps in the dual polytope.

==Abstract regular polytopes==
Formally, an abstract polytope is defined to be "regular" if its [[automorphism group]] [[group action|acts]] transitively on the set of its flags. In particular, any two ''k''-faces ''F'', ''G'' of an ''n''-polytope are "the same",  i.e. that there is an automorphism which maps ''F'' to ''G''. When an abstract polytope is regular, its automorphism group is isomorphic to a quotient of a [[Coxeter group]].

All polytopes of rank ≤ 2 are regular. The most famous regular polyhedra are the five Platonic solids. The hemicube (shown) is also regular.

Informally, for each rank ''k'', this means that there is no way to distinguish any ''k''-face from any other - the faces must be identical, and must have identical neighbors, and so forth. For example, a cube is regular because all the faces are squares, each square's vertices are attached to three squares, and each of these squares is attached to identical arrangements of other faces, edges and vertices, and so on.

This condition alone is sufficient to ensure that any regular abstract polytope has isomorphic regular (''n''&amp;minus;1)-faces and isomorphic regular vertex figures.

This is a weaker condition than regularity for traditional polytopes, in that it refers to the (combinatorial) automorphism group, not the (geometric) symmetry group. For example, any abstract polygon is regular, since angles, edge-lengths, edge curvature, skewness etc. don't exist for abstract polytopes.

There are several other weaker concepts, some not yet fully standardised, such as [[Semiregular polytope|semi-regular]], [[Quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]], [[Uniform polytope|uniform]], [[Chiral polytope|chiral]],  and [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] that apply to polytopes that have some, but not all of their faces equivalent in each rank.

===An irregular example===
[[Image:Amorphic Polyhedron.PNG|thumb|180px|An irregular polyhedron which has no automorphisms at all.]]
Given the amount of attention lavished on regular polytopes, one might almost think that all polytopes are regular. In reality, regular polytopes are just very special cases.

The simplest irregular polytope is the [[square pyramid]], though this still has many symmetries.

An example of a polyhedron with ''no'' nontrivial symmetries is shown - no pair of vertices, edges, or 2-faces are "the same", as defined above. This is possibly the simplest such polytope.

== Realisation ==
A ''realisation'' of an abstract polytope is a collection of points in space (corresponding to the vertices of the polytope), together with the face structure induced on it by the polytope. For example the set of points {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} is a realisation of the abstract square. It is not the only realisation, however - one could choose any set of four points in the target space.

If an abstract ''n''-polytope is realized in ''n''-dimensional space, such that the geometrical arrangement does not break any rules for traditional polytopes (such as curved faces, or ridges of zero size), then the realisation is said to be ''faithful''. In general, only a restricted set of abstract polytopes of rank ''n'' may be realized faithfully in any given ''n''-space. The characterisation of this effect is an outstanding problem.

For a regular abstract polytope, if the combinatorial automorphisms of the abstract polytope are realised by geometric symmetries then the geometric figure will be a regular polytope.

== The amalgamation problem and universal polytopes ==

An important question in the theory of abstract polytopes is the ''amalgamation problem''. This is a series of questions such as

: For given abstract polytopes ''K'' and ''L'', are there any polytopes ''P'' whose facets are ''K'' and whose vertex figures are ''L'' ?
: If so, are they all finite ?
: What finite ones are there ?

For example, if ''K'' is the square, and ''L'' is the triangle, the answers to these questions are

: Yes, there are polytopes ''P'' with square faces, joined three per vertex (that is, there are polytopes of type {4,3}).
: Yes, they are all finite, specifically,
: There is the [[cube]], with six square faces, twelve edges and eight vertices, and the [[hemi-cube (geometry)|hemi-cube]], with three faces, six edges and four vertices.

It is known that if the answer to the first question is 'Yes' for some regular ''K'' and ''L'', then there is a unique polytope whose facets are ''K'' and whose vertex figures are ''L'', called the '''universal''' polytope with these facets and vertex figures, which '''covers''' all other such polytopes. That is, suppose ''P'' is the universal polytope with facets ''K'' and vertex figures ''L''. Then any other polytope ''Q'' with these facets and vertex figures can be written ''Q''=''P''/''N'', where
* ''N'' is a subgroup of the automorphism group of ''P'', and
* ''P''/''N'' is the collection of [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of elements of ''P'' under the action of ''N'', with the partial order induced by that of ''P''.
''Q''=''P''/''N'' is called a '''quotient''' of ''P'', and we say ''P'' '''covers''' ''Q''.

Given this fact, the search for polytopes with particular facets and vertex figures usually goes as follows:
# Attempt to find the applicable universal polytope
# Attempt to classify its quotients.
These two problems are, in general, very difficult.

Returning to the example above, if ''K'' is the square, and ''L'' is the triangle, the universal polytope {''K'',''L''} is the cube (also written {4,3}). The hemicube is the quotient {4,3}/''N'', where ''N'' is a group of symmetries (automorphisms) of the cube with just two elements - the identity, and the symmetry that maps each corner (or edge or face) to its opposite.

If ''L'' is, instead, also a square, the universal polytope {''K'',''L''} (that is, {4,4}) is the tessellation of the Euclidean plane by squares. This tessellation has infinitely many quotients with square faces, four per vertex, some regular and some not. Except for the universal polytope itself, they all correspond to various ways to tessellate either a [[torus]] or an infinitely long [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] with squares.

===The 11-cell and the 57-cell===

The [[11-cell]], discovered independently by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[Branko Grünbaum]], is an abstract 4-polytope. Its facets are hemi-icosahedra. Since its facets are, topologically, projective planes instead of spheres, the 11-cell is not a tessellation of any manifold in the usual sense. Instead, the 11-cell is a ''locally'' projective polytope. The 11-cell is not only beautiful in the mathematical sense, it is also historically important as one of the first non-traditional abstract polytopes discovered. It is self-dual and universal: it is the ''only'' polytope with hemi-icosahedral facets and hemi-dodecahedral vertex figures.

The [[57-cell]] is also self-dual, with hemi-dodecahedral facets. It was discovered by H. S. M. Coxeter shortly after the discovery of the 11-cell. Like the 11-cell, it is also universal, being the only polytope with hemi-dodecahedral facets and hemi-icosahedral vertex figures. On the other hand, there are many other polytopes with hemi-dodecahedral facets and Schläfli type {5,3,5}. The universal polytope with hemi-dodecahedral facets and icosahedral (not hemi-icosahedral) vertex figures is finite, but very large, with 10006920 facets and half as many vertices.

=== Local topology ===

The amalgamation problem has, historically, been pursued according to ''local topology''. That is, rather than restricting ''K'' and ''L'' to be particular polytopes, they are allowed to be any polytope with a given [[topology]], that is, any polytope [[tessellation|tessellating]] a given [[manifold]]. If ''K'' and ''L'' are ''spherical'' (that is, tessellations of a topological [[sphere]]), then ''P'' is called ''locally spherical'' and corresponds itself to a tessellation of some manifold. For example, if ''K'' and ''L'' are both squares (and so are topologically the same as circles), ''P'' will be a tessellation of the plane, [[torus]] or [[Klein bottle]] by squares. A tessellation of an ''n''-dimensional manifold is actually a rank ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 polytope. This is in keeping with the common intuition that the [[Platonic solid]]s are three dimensional, even though they can be regarded as tessellations of the two-dimensional surface of a ball.

In general, an abstract polytope is called ''locally X'' if its facets and vertex figures are, topologically, either spheres or ''X'', but not both spheres. The [[11-cell]] and [[57-cell]] are examples of rank 4 (that is, four-dimensional) ''locally projective'' polytopes, since their facets and vertex figures are tessellations of [[real projective plane]]s. There is a weakness in this terminology however. It does not allow an easy way to describe a polytope whose facets are [[torus|tori]] and whose vertex figures are projective planes, for example. Worse still if different facets have different topologies, or no well-defined topology at all. However, much progress has been made on the complete classification of the locally toroidal regular polytopes (McMullen &amp; Schulte, 2002)

== Exchange maps ==

Let ''Ψ'' be a flag of an abstract ''n''-polytope, and let −1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. From the definition of an abstract polytope, it can be proven that there is a unique flag differing from ''Ψ'' by a rank ''i'' element, and the same otherwise. If we call this flag ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt;, then this defines a collection of maps on the polytopes flags, say ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These maps are called '''exchange maps''', since they swap pairs of flags : (''Ψφ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Ψ'' always. Some other properties of the exchange maps :
* ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the identity map
* The ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; generate a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. (The action of this group on the flags of the polytope is an example of what is called the '''flag action''' of the group on the polytope)
* If |''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''j''| &gt; 1, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
* If ''α'' is an automorphism of the polytope, then ''αφ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''α''
* If the polytope is regular, the group generated by the ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the automorphism group, otherwise, it is strictly larger.
The exchange maps and the flag action in particular can be used to prove that ''any'' abstract polytope is a quotient of some regular polytope.

==Incidence matrices==
A polytope can also be represented by tabulating its [[incidence matrix|incidences]]. 

The following incidence matrix is that of a triangle:
{|class=wikitable
|-
! 
!ø||a||b||c||ab||bc||ca|||abc
|-
!ø
|BGCOLOR="#ffe0e0"|1||1||1||1||1||1||1||1
|-
!a
|1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||1||0||1||1
|-
!b
|1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||1||1||0||1
|-
!c
|1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|1||0||1||1||1
|-
!ab
|1||1||1||0||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|1||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||1
|-
!bc
|1||0||1||1||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|1||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||1
|-
!ca
|1||1||0||1||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|0||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|1||1
|-
!abc
|1||1||1||1||1||1||1||BGCOLOR="#ffe0ff"|1
|}

The table shows a 1 wherever a face is a subface of another, ''or vice versa'' (so the table is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] about the diagonal)- so in fact, the table has ''redundant information''; it would suffice to show only a 1 when the row face ≤ the column face.

Since both the body and the empty set are incident with all other elements, the first row and column as well as the last row and column are trivial and can conveniently be omitted.

=== Square pyramid ===
[[File:Pyramid abstract polytope.svg|thumb|340px|A square pyramid and the associated abstract polytope.]]

Further information is gained by counting each occurrence. This numerative usage enables a [[symmetry]] grouping, as in the [[Abstract polytope#The Hasse diagram|Hasse Diagram]] of the [[square pyramid]]: If vertices B, C, D, and E are considered symmetrically equivalent within the abstract polytope, then edges f, g, h, and j will be grouped together, and also edges k, l, m, and n, And finally also the triangles '''P''', '''Q''', '''R''', and '''S'''. Thus the corresponding incidence matrix of this abstract polytope may be shown as:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! 
!&amp;nbsp; A &amp;nbsp;||B,C,D,E||f,g,h,j||k,l,m,n||''P'',''Q'',''R'',''S''||&amp;nbsp; ''T'' &amp;nbsp;
|-
!A
|BGCOLOR="#ffe0e0"|1||BGCOLOR="#ffe0e0"|*||4||0||4||0
|-
!B,C,D,E
|BGCOLOR="#ffe0e0"|*||BGCOLOR="#ffe0e0"|4||1||2||2||1
|-
!f,g,h,j
|1||1||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|4||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|*||2||0
|-
!k,l,m,n
|0||2||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|*||BGCOLOR="#e0ffe0"|4||1||1
|-
!''P'',''Q'',''R'',''S''
|1||2||2||1||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|4||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|*
|-
!''T''
|0||4||0||4||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|*||BGCOLOR="#e0e0ff"|1
|}

In this accumulated incidence matrix representation the diagonal entries represent the total counts of either element type.

Elements of different type of the same rank clearly are never incident so the value will always be 0, however to help distinguish such relationships, an asterisk (*) is used instead of 0.

The sub-diagonal entries of each row represent the incidence counts of the relevant sub-elements, while the super-diagonal entries represent the respective element counts of the vertex-, edge- or whatever -figure.

Already this simple [[square pyramid]] shows that the symmetry-accumulated incidence matrices are no longer symmetrical. But there is still a simple entity-relation (beside the generalised Euler formulae for the diagonal, respectively the sub-diagonal entities of each row, respectively the super-diagonal elements of each row - those at least whenever no holes or stars etc. are considered), as for any such incidence matrix &lt;math&gt;I=(I_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; holds:

&lt;math&gt;I_{ii} \cdot I_{ij} = I_{ji} \cdot I_{jj} \ \ (i&lt;j).&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==
In the 1960s [[Branko Grünbaum]] issued a call to the geometric community to consider generalizations of the concept of [[regular polytope]]s that he called ''polystromata''. He developed a theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects including the [[11-cell]].

The [[11-cell]] is a [[Dual polytope|self-dual]] [[4-polytope]] whose [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] are not [[Icosahedron|icosahedra]], but are "[[hemi-icosahedron|hemi-icosahedra]]" &amp;mdash; that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the ''same'' face (Grünbaum, 1977). A few years after Grünbaum's discovery of the [[11-cell]], [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] discovered a similar polytope, the [[57-cell]] (Coxeter 1982, 1984), and then independently rediscovered the 11-cell.

With the earlier work by [[Branko Grünbaum]], [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[Jacques Tits]] having laid the groundwork, the basic theory of the combinatorial structures now known as abstract polytopes was first described by [[Egon Schulte]] in his 1980 PhD dissertation. In it he defined "regular incidence complexes" and "regular incidence polytopes". Subsequently, he and [[Peter McMullen]] developed the basics of the theory in a series of research articles that were later collected into a book. Numerous other researchers have since made their own contributions, and the early pioneers (including Grünbaum) have also accepted Schulte's definition as the "correct" one.

Since then, research in the theory of abstract polytopes has focused mostly on ''regular'' polytopes, that is, those whose [[automorphism]] [[group (mathematics)|groups]] [[Group action|act]] [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]] on the set of flags of the polytope.

Prof '''Alexander Macfarlane''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] LLD (21 April 1851&amp;nbsp;– 28 August 1913) was a Scottish [[logic]]ian, [[physicist]], and mathematician.

==Life==

Macfarlane was born in [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], [[Scotland]] and studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  His [[doctoral thesis]] "The disruptive discharge of electricity"&lt;ref&gt;A Marfarlane (1878) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v19/n478/pdf/019184a0.pdf The disruptive discharge of electricity] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 19:184,5&lt;/ref&gt; reported on experimental results from the laboratory of [[Peter Guthrie Tait]].

In 1878 Macfarlane was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], [[Philip Kelland]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]], and [[John Hutton Balfour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life, Macfarlane played a prominent role in research and education. He taught at the universities of Edinburgh and [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], was physics professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] (1885&amp;nbsp;– 1894),&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00515/cah-00515.html Macfarlane papers at the University of Texas].&lt;/ref&gt; professor of Advanced Electricity, and later of [[mathematical physics]], at [[Lehigh University]]. In 1896 Macfarlane encouraged the association of [[quaternion]] students to promote the algebra.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1896) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1624707 Quaternions] [[Science (journal)|Science]] (2) 3:99–100, link from [[Jstor]] early content&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Secretary of the [[Quaternion Society]], and in 1909 its President. He edited the ''Bibliography of Quaternions'' that the Society published in 1904.

Macfarlane was also the author of a popular 1916 collection of mathematical biographies (''Ten British Mathematicians''), a similar work on physicists (''Lectures on Ten British Physicists of the Nineteenth Century'', 1919). Macfarlane was caught up in the revolution in [[geometry]] during his lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;''1830–1930: A Century of Geometry'', L Boi, D. Flament, JM Salanskis editors, Lecture Notes in Physics No. 402, Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-55408-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular through the influence of [[G. B. Halsted]] who was mathematics professor at the University of Texas. Macfarlane originated an ''Algebra of Physics'', which was his adaptation of quaternions to physical science. His first publication on ''Space Analysis'' preceded the presentation of [[Minkowski Space]] by seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1891) "Principles of the Algebra of Physics", ''Proceedings of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'' 40:65–117. It was 1908 when [[Hermann Minkowski]] proposed his spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macfarlane actively participated in several [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Congresses of Mathematicians]] including the primordial meeting in Chicago, 1893, and the Paris meeting of 1900 where he spoke on "Application of space analysis to curvilinear coordinates".

Macfarlane retired to [[Chatham, Ontario]], where he died in 1913.

==Space analysis==
Alexander Macfarlane stylized his work as "Space Analysis". In 1894 he published his five earlier papers and a book review of [[Alexander MacAulay]]'s ''Utility of Quaternions in Physics''. This collection is now available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1894) ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesalgeb01macfgoog Papers on Space Analysis]'', B. Westerman, New York, weblink from [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Page numbers are carried from previous publications, and the reader is presumed familiar with quaternions. The first paper is "Principles of the Algebra of Physics" where he first proposes the [[hyperbolic quaternion]] algebra, since "a student of physics finds a difficulty in principle of quaternions which makes the square of a vector negative." The second paper is "The Imaginary of the Algebra". Similar to [[Homersham Cox (mathematician)|Homersham Cox]] (1882/83),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cox, H.|year=1883|orig-year=1882|title=On the Application of Quaternions and Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre to different kinds of Uniform Space|journal=Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc.|volume=13|pages=69-143|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions13camb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cox, H.|year=1883|orig-year=1882|title=On the Application of Quaternions and Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre to different kinds of Uniform Space|journal=Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.|volume=4|pages=194-196|url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofcam4188083camb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macfarlane uses the [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] as the hyperbolic quaternion corresponding to the [[versor]] of Hamilton. The presentation is encumbered by the notation
:&lt;math&gt;h \alpha ^ A = \cosh A + \sinh A \ \alpha ^{\pi/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Later he conformed to the notation exp(A α) used by Euler and Sophus Lie. The expression &lt;math&gt;\alpha ^{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; is meant to emphasize that α is a ''right versor'', where π/2 is the measure of a [[right angle]] in [[radian]]s. The π/2 in the exponent is, in fact, superfluous.

Papers three and four are "Fundamental Theorems of Analysis Generalized for Space" and "On the definition of the Trigonometric Functions", which he had presented the previous year in Chicago at the ''Congress of Mathematicians'' held in connection with the [[World's Columbian Exhibition]]. He follows [[George Salmon]] in exhibiting the [[hyperbolic angle]], argument of [[hyperbolic function]]s. The fifth paper is "Elliptic and Hyperbolic Analysis" which considers the [[spherical law of cosines]] as the fundamental theorem of the [[sphere]], and proceeds to analogues for the ellipsoid of revolution, general [[ellipsoid]], and equilateral [[hyperboloid]]s of one and two sheets, where he provides the [[hyperbolic law of cosines]].

In 1900 Alexander published "Hyperbolic Quaternions"&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1900) "Hyperbolic Quaternions" ''Proceedings of the Royal Society at Edinburgh'', vol. 23, Nov. 1899 to July 1901 sessions, pp.&amp;nbsp;169&amp;ndash;180+figures plate.

(Note: P. 177 and figures plate incompletely scanned in free versions.)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Royal Society in Edinburgh, and included a sheet of nine figures, two of which display conjugate [[hyperbola]]s. Having been stung in the ''Great Vector Debate'' over the non-associativity of his Algebra of Physics, he restored associativity by reverting to [[biquaternion]]s, an algebra used by students of Hamilton since 1853.

Within a [[storage network]], encryption of data may occur at different hardware levels. '''Array controller based encryption''' describes the encryption of data occurring at the [[disk array controller]] before being sent to the disk drives.  This article will provide an overview of different implementation techniques to array controller based encryption. For cryptographic and encryption theory, see [[disk encryption theory]].

== Possible points of encryption in SAN ==
[[Image:Piont-of-encryption.gif|thumb|right|300px|Diagram showing the possible points of encryption within a storage network]]
The encryption of data can take place in many points in a storage network. The point of encryption may occur on the host computer, in the SAN infrastructure, the array controller or on each of the hard disks as shown on the diagram above. Each point of encryption has different merits and costs. Within the diagram, the key server components are also shown for each configuration of encryption. Designers of SANs and SAN components must take into consideration factors such as performance, deployment complexity, key server interoperability, strength of security, and cost when choosing where to implement encryption. But since the array controller is a natural central point of all data therefore encryption at this level is inherent and also reduces deployment complexity. 
 
{{clear}}

== Array controller-based encryption ==
With different configurations of a hardware or software array controller, there are different types of solutions for this type of encryption. Each of these solutions can be built into existing infrastructures by replacing or upgrading certain components.  Basic components include an encryption [[key server (cryptographic)|key server]], key management client, and commonly an encryption unit which are all implemented into a storage network.

=== Internal array controller encryption ===
[[Image:Iac.gif|thumb|right|150px|Encryption implementation in an internal array controller architecture]]
For an internal array controller configuration, the array controller is generally a PCI bus card situated inside the host computer. As shown in the diagram, the PCI array controller would contain an encryption unit where [[plaintext]] data is encrypted into [[ciphertext]]. This separate encryption unit is utilized to prevent and minimize performance reduction and maintain data throughput. Furthermore, the Key Management Client will generally be an additional service within the host computer applications where it will authenticate all keys retrieved from the Key Server. A major disadvantage to this type of implementation would be that encryption components are required to be integrated within each host computer and therefore is redundant on large networks with many host devices.

{{clear}}

=== External array controller encryption ===
In the case of an external array controller setup, the array controller would be an independent hardware module connected to the network. Within the hardware array controller would be an Encryption unit for data encryption as well as a Key Management Client for authentication. Generally, there are few hardware array controllers to many host devices and storage disks. Therefore, it reduces deployment complexity to implement into fewer hardware components. Moreover, the lifecycle of an array controller is generally much longer than host computers and storage disks, therefore the encryption implementation will not need to be reimplemented as often as if encryption was done at another point in the storage network.

==== Encryption at the front-end or back-end side array controller ====
In an external array controller, the encryption unit can either be placed either on the [[Disk array controller#Front-end and back-end side|front-end side]] or the [[Disk array controller#Front-end and back-end side|back-end side]] of the array controller. There are different advantages and disadvantages in placing the encryption unit either on the front-end side or the back-end side:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 
! Advantages
! Disadvantages
|-
| Front-end side
| All data is first encrypted before it moves along the array controller, therefore data is encrypted before sending it through the replication link and or stored in internal array controller cache. 
| Since data is encrypted before it moves along the array controller, data de-duplication and data compression cannot be done when sending data through replication link. Therefore, huge costs can be incurred when sending huge amounts of data through the replication link.
|-
| Back-end side
| Since all data is encrypted before leaving the array controller, data de-duplication and data compression can be done and therefore may save costs since only compressed and unique data is sent through the replication link. 
| Sensitive data may be compromised when sending through the replication link as well as cached data in the array controller compromised.
|}

The placement of the encryption unit may highly impact the secureness of your controller based encryption implementation. Therefore, this issue must be taken account for when designing your implementation to mitigate all security risks.

=== Software array controller encryption ===
[[Image:Sac.gif|thumb|right|150px|Encryption implementation in a software array controller architecture]]
For the software array controller encryption, a software array controller driver directs data into individual host bus adapters. In the adjacent diagram, there are multiple host bus adapters with hardware encryption units used for better performance requirements. In contrast, this type of encryption can be implemented with only 1 host bus adapter connected to a network of multiple hard drives and would still function. Performance will definitely be reduced since there will only be one encryption unit processing data. Key management will be done much like the internal array controller encryption mentioned before with the Key Management Client implemented as a service within the Host Computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8357">In [[metric geometry]], '''asymptotic dimension''' of a [[metric space]] is a large-scale analog of [[Lebesgue covering dimension]].  The notion of asymptotic dimension was introduced my [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]] in his 1993 monograph ''Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups''&lt;ref&gt;M. Gromov, ''Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups''. Geometric group theory, Vol. 2 (Sussex, 1991), 1–295, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., 182, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1993; {{ISBN|0-521-44680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of [[geometric group theory]], as a [[quasi-isometry]] invariant of finitely generated groups. As shown by [[Guoliang Yu]], finitely generated groups of finite homotopy type with finite asymptotic dimension satisfy the [[Novikov conjecture]].&lt;ref name=Yu/&gt;  Asymptotic dimension has important applications in [[geometric analysis]] and [[index theory]].

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] space and &lt;math&gt;n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; be an integer.  We say that &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)\le n &lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;R\ge 1&lt;/math&gt; there exists a uniformly bounded cover &lt;math&gt; \mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that every closed &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-ball in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; intersects at most &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; subsets from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;. Here 'uniformly bounded' means that &lt;math&gt;sup_{U\in \mathcal U} diam(U) &lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;.

We then define the ''asymptotic dimension'' &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)&lt;/math&gt; as the smallest integer &lt;math&gt;n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)\le n &lt;/math&gt;, if at least one such &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; exists, and define &lt;math&gt; asdim(X):=\infty&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

Also, one says that a family &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in I} &lt;/math&gt; of metric spaces satisfies &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)\le n&lt;/math&gt; ''uniformly''  if for every &lt;math&gt;R\ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; there exists a cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; by sets of diameter at most &lt;math&gt;D(R)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (independent of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;) such that every closed &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-ball in &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; intersects at most &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; subsets from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal U_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space of bounded diameter then &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;asdim(\mathbb R)=asdim(\mathbb Z)=1 &lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt; asdim(\mathbb R^n)=n&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt; asdim(\mathbb H^n)=n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

*If &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of a metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; asdim(Y)\le asdim(X) &lt;/math&gt;.
* For any metric spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; one has &lt;math&gt;asdim(X\times Y)\le asdim(X)+asdim(Y)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;A,B\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; asdim(A\cup B)\le \max\{asdim(A), asdim(B)\} &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;f:Y\to X&lt;/math&gt; is a coarse embedding (e.g. a quasi-isometric embedding), then &lt;math&gt; asdim(Y)\le asdim(X) &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are coarsely equivalent metric spaces (e.g. quasi-isometric metric spaces), then &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)= asdim(Y) &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real tree]] then &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)\le 1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;f : X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a Lipschitz map from a geodesic metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to a metric space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; . Suppose that for every &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; the set family &lt;math&gt;\{f^{-1}(B_r(y))\}_{y\in Y}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality &lt;math&gt; asdim  \le  n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly. Then &lt;math&gt;asdim(X)\le asdim(Y) +n.&lt;/math&gt; See&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Bell, A.N. Dranishnikov, ''A Hurewicz-type theorem for asymptotic dimension and applications to geometric group theory'', [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] '''358''' (2006), no. 11,  4749–4764.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space with &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits a coarse (uniform) embedding into a Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;John  Roe, ''Lectures on Coarse Geometry'', Univ. Lecture Ser., vol. 31, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8218-3332-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space of bounded geometry with &lt;math&gt; asdim(X)\le n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; admits a coarse embedding into a product of &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; locally finite simplicial trees.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Dranishnikov, ''On hypersphericity of manifolds with finite asymptotic dimension.''

==Asymptotic dimension in geometric group theory==

Asymptotic dimension achieved particular prominence in [[geometric group theory]] after a 1998 paper of  [[Guoliang Yu]]&lt;ref name=Yu&gt;G. Yu, ''The Novikov conjecture for groups with finite asymptotic dimension'', [[Annals of Mathematics]] ''147'' (1998), no. 2, 325-355.&lt;/ref&gt;
, which proved that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated group of finite homotopy type (that is with a classifying space of the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex) such that &lt;math&gt; asdim(G)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[Novikov conjecture]].  As was subsequently shown,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Dranishnikov,

The attack is named after the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] ceremony which is held at 13 years of age, because the vulnerability exploited is 13 years old&lt;ref name="darkreading" /&gt; and likely inspired by the naming of the unrelated [[birthday attack]].

The '''belt problem''' is a [[mathematics]] problem which requires finding the length of a crossed [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] that connects two circular [[pulley]]s with [[radius]] ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whose centers are separated by a distance ''P''. The solution of the belt problem requires [[trigonometry]] and the concepts of the [[bitangent|bitangent line]], the [[vertical angle]], and [[congruent angles]].

== Solution ==

Clearly [[triangle]]s ACO and ADO are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[right angled triangle]]s, as are [[triangle]]s BEO and BFO. In addition, [[triangle]]s ACO and BEO are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]]. Therefore [[angle]]s CAO, DAO, EBO and FBO are all equal. Denoting this [[angle]] by &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; (denominated in [[radian]]s), the length of the belt is

:&lt;math&gt;CO + DO + EO + FO + \text {arc} CD + \text {arc} EF \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=2r_1\tan(\varphi) + 2r_2\tan(\varphi) + (2\pi-2\varphi)r_1 + (2\pi-2\varphi)r_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=2(r_1+r_2)(\tan(\varphi) + \pi- \varphi) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This exploits the convenience of denominating angles in radians that the length of an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] = the [[radius]] × the measure of the [[angle]] facing the [[arc (geometry)|arc]].

To find &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; we see from the [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]] of [[triangle]]s ACO and BEO that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AO}{BO} = \frac{AC}{BE} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{P-x}{x} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{P}{x} = \frac{r_1+r_2}{r_2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {x} = \frac{P r_2}{r_1+r_2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \cos(\varphi) = \frac{r_2}{x} = \frac{r_2}{\left(\dfrac{P r_2}{r_1+r_2}\right)} = \frac{r_1+r_2}{P} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \varphi=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_1+r_2}{P}\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For fixed ''P'' the length of the belt depends only on the sum of the radius values ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and not on their individual values.

== Pulley problem ==

[[File:Pulley Problem.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pulley problem]]

There are other types of problems similar to the belt problem. The [[pulley]] problem, as shown, is similar to the belt problem; however, the [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] does not cross itself. In the pulley problem the length of the belt is

:&lt;math&gt;2 P \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)+r_1(2\pi-\theta)+r_2{\theta}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the radius of the larger pulley, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the radius of the smaller one, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta=2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_1-r_2}{P}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

The belt problem is used &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainmass.com/homework-help/math/trigonometry/77582 Trigonometry examples in real life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425071917/http://www.brainmass.com/homework-help/math/trigonometry/77582 |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the design of [[aeroplane]]s, [[bicycle gearing]], [[car]]s, and other items with [[pulley]]s or [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] that cross each other. The pulley problem is also used in the design of [[conveyor belt]]s found in [[airport]] [[luggage]] belts and [[automated]] [[factory]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beltbrake.com/tech.htm Trigonometry used in conveyor belts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222193004/http://www.beltbrake.com/tech.htm |date=February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''cellular algebra''' is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[associative algebra]] ''A'' with a distinguished '''cellular basis'''  which is particularly well-adapted to studying the [[representation theory]] of ''A''.

== History ==
The cellular algebras discussed in this article were introduced in a 1996 paper of Graham and Lehrer.&lt;ref name="grahamlehrer"&gt;{{citation|title= Cellular algebras|first1 = J.J|last1= Graham|first2= G.I.|last2 = Lehrer|journal= Inventiones Mathematicae|volume= 123|year=1996|pages=1–34|doi=10.1007/bf01232365|bibcode=1996InMat.123....1G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the terminology had previously been used by [[Boris Weisfeiler|Weisfeiler]] and Lehman in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, to describe what are also known as [[association scheme]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Weisfeiler| first1 = B. Yu.| authorlink1 = Boris Weisfeiler| last2 = A. A. | first2 = Lehman| year = 1968| title = Reduction of a graph to a canonical form and an algebra which appears in this process| journal = Scientific-Technological Investigations| volume = 9| series = 2| pages = 12&amp;ndash;16| language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Cameron|authorlink=Peter Cameron (mathematician)|title = Permutation Groups|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | series = London Mathematical Society Student Texts (45) | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-521-65378-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a fixed [[commutative ring]] with unit. In most applications this is a field, but this is not needed for the definitions. Let also &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra.

=== The concrete definition ===

A ''cell datum'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda,i,M,C)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of
* A  finite partially ordered set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* A &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-linear [[anti-automorphism]] &lt;math&gt;i:A\to A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i^2=id_A&lt;/math&gt;.
* For every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; a non-empty, finite set &lt;math&gt;M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of indices.
* An injective map
:&lt;math&gt;C: \dot{\bigcup}_{\lambda\in\Lambda} M(\lambda)\times M(\lambda) \to A&lt;/math&gt;
:The images under this map are notated with an upper index &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; and two lower indices &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{t}\in M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; so that the typical element of the image is written as &lt;math&gt;C_\mathfrak{st}^\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
and satisfying the following conditions:
# The image of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-basis of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;i(C_\mathfrak{st}^\lambda)=C_\mathfrak{ts}^\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for all elements of the basis.
# For every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{t}\in M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; the equation
::&lt;math&gt;aC_\mathfrak{st}^\lambda \equiv \sum_{\mathfrak{u}\in M(\lambda)} r_a(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s}) C_\mathfrak{ut}^\lambda \mod A(&lt;\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
::with coefficients &lt;math&gt;r_a(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})\in R&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{s}&lt;/math&gt; but not on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;A(&lt;\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-span of all basis elements with upper index strictly smaller than &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition was originally given by Graham and Lehrer who invented cellular algebras.&lt;ref name="grahamlehrer" /&gt;
=== The more abstract definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;i:A\to A&lt;/math&gt; be an anti automorphism of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebras with &lt;math&gt;i^2=id&lt;/math&gt; (just called "involution" from now on).

A ''cell ideal'' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is a two-sided ideal &lt;math&gt;J\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that the following conditions hold:
# &lt;math&gt;i(J)=J&lt;/math&gt;.
# There is a left ideal &lt;math&gt;\Delta\subseteq J&lt;/math&gt; that is free as a &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module and an isomorphism
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha: \Delta\otimes_R i(\Delta) \to J&lt;/math&gt;
::of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-bimodules such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are compatible in the sense that
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in\Delta: i(\alpha(x\otimes i(y))) = \alpha(y\otimes i(x))&lt;/math&gt;

A ''cell chain'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a [[direct sum|direct decomposition]]
:&lt;math&gt;A=\bigoplus_{k=1}^m U_k&lt;/math&gt;
into free &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-submodules such that
# &lt;math&gt;i(U_k)=U_k&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;J_k:=\bigoplus_{j=1}^k U_j&lt;/math&gt; is a two-sided ideal of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;J_k/J_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a cell ideal of &lt;math&gt;A/J_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; w.r.t. to the induced involution.

Now &lt;math&gt;(A,i)&lt;/math&gt; is called a cellular algebra if it has a cell chain. One can show that the two definitions are equivalent.&lt;ref name="ccxi"&gt;{{citation|title= On the structure of cellular algebras|first1= S.|last1= König|first2= C.C.|last2= Xi|journal= Algebras and modules II. CMS Conference Proceedings|year=1996|pages=365–386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every basis gives rise to cell chains (one for each [[topological ordering]] of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;) and choosing a basis of every left ideal &lt;math&gt;\Delta/J_{k-1}\subseteq J_k/J_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; one can construct a corresponding cell basis for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
=== Polynomial examples ===

&lt;math&gt;R[x]/(x^n)&lt;/math&gt; is cellular. A cell datum is given by &lt;math&gt;i=id&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda:=\lbrace 0,\ldots,n-1\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; with the reverse of the natural ordering.
* &lt;math&gt;M(\lambda):=\lbrace 1\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C_{11}^\lambda := x^\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

A cell-chain in the sense of the second, abstract definition is given by
: &lt;math&gt;0 \subseteq (x^{n-1}) \subseteq (x^{n-2}) \subseteq \ldots \subseteq (x^1) \subseteq (x^0)=R&lt;/math&gt;

=== Matrix examples ===

&lt;math&gt;R^{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt; is cellular. A cell datum is given by &lt;math&gt;i(A)=A^T&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda:=\lbrace 1 \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;M(1):=\lbrace 1,\dots,d\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
* For the basis one chooses &lt;math&gt;C_{st}^1 := E_{st}&lt;/math&gt; the standard matrix units, i.e. &lt;math&gt;C_{st}^1&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix with all entries equal to zero except the (''s'',''t'')-th entry which is equal to 1.

A cell-chain (and in fact the only cell chain) is given by
: &lt;math&gt; 0 \subseteq R^{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;

In some sense all cellular algebras "interpolate" between these two extremes by arranging matrix-algebra-like pieces according to the poset &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Further examples ===

Modulo minor technicalities all [[Iwahori–Hecke algebra]]s of finite type are cellular w.r.t. to the involution that maps the standard basis as &lt;math&gt;T_w\mapsto T_{w^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Hecke algebras of finite type are cellular|first1= Meinolf|last1= Geck|journal= Inventiones Mathematicae|volume= 169|year= 2007|pages=501–517|doi=10.1007/s00222-007-0053-2|arxiv= math/0611941|bibcode= 2007InMat.169..501G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes for example the integral group algebra of the [[symmetric group]]s as well as all other finite [[Weyl group]]s.

A basic Brauer tree algebra over a field is cellular if and only if the Brauer tree is a straight line (with arbitrary number of exceptional vertices).&lt;ref name="ccxi"/&gt;

Further examples include q-[[Schur algebra]]s, the [[Brauer algebra]], the [[Temperley–Lieb algebra]], the [[Birman–Wenzl algebra|Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra]], the blocks of the Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]].&lt;ref name="ccxi"/&gt;

== Representations ==
=== Cell modules and the invariant bilinear form ===

Assume &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is cellular and &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda,i,M,C)&lt;/math&gt; is a cell datum for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then one defines the ''cell module'' &lt;math&gt;W(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; as the free &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module with basis &lt;math&gt;\lbrace C_\mathfrak{s} | \mathfrak{s}\in M(\lambda)\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; and multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;aC_\mathfrak{s} := \sum_{\mathfrak{u}} r_a(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s}) C_\mathfrak{u}&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;r_a(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})&lt;/math&gt; are the same as above. Then &lt;math&gt;W(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; becomes an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-left module.

These modules generalize the [[Specht module]]s for the symmetric group and the Hecke-algebras of type A.

There is a canonical bilinear form &lt;math&gt;\phi_\lambda: W(\lambda)\times W(\lambda)\to R&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathfrak{st}^\lambda C_\mathfrak{uv}^\lambda \equiv \phi_\lambda(C_\mathfrak{t},C_\mathfrak{u}) C_\mathfrak{sv}^\lambda \mod A(&lt;\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
for all indices &lt;math&gt;s,t,u,v\in M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can check that &lt;math&gt;\phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_\lambda(x,y) = \phi_\lambda(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in W(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-invariant in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_\lambda(i(a)x,y)=\phi_\lambda(x,ay)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;x,y\in W(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Simple modules ===

Assume for the rest of this section that the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field. With the information contained in the invariant bilinear forms one can easily list all simple &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-modules:

Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_0:=\lbrace \lambda\in\Lambda | \phi_\lambda\neq 0\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;L(\lambda):=W(\lambda)/\operatorname{rad}(\phi_\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. Then all &lt;math&gt;L(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are [[Absolutely irreducible|absolute simple]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-modules and every simple &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module is one of these.

These theorems appear already in the original paper by Graham and Lehrer.&lt;ref name="grahamlehrer"/&gt;

== Properties of cellular algebras ==
=== Persistence properties ===

* Tensor products of finitely many cellular &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebras are cellular.
* A &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is cellular if and only if its [[opposite algebra]] &lt;math&gt;A^{op}&lt;/math&gt; is.
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is cellular with cell-datum &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda,i,M,C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi\subseteq\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal]] (a downward closed subset) of the poset &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A(\Phi):=\sum RC_\mathfrak{st}^\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (where the sum runs over &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s,t\in M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;) is an twosided, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-invariant ideal of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the quotient &lt;math&gt;A/A(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is cellular with cell datum &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda\setminus\Phi,i,M,C)&lt;/math&gt; (where i denotes the induces involution and M,C denote the restricted mappings).
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a cellular &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra and &lt;math&gt;R\to S&lt;/math&gt; is a unitary homomorphism of commutative rings, then the [[extension of scalars]] &lt;math&gt;S\otimes_R A&lt;/math&gt; is a cellular &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-algebra.
* Direct products of finitely many cellular &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebras are cellular.

If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integral domain]] then there is a converse to this last point:
* If &lt;math&gt;(A,i)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite dimensional &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra with an involution and &lt;math&gt;A=A_1\oplus A_2&lt;/math&gt; a decomposition in twosided, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-invariant ideals, then the following are equivalent:
# &lt;math&gt;(A,i)&lt;/math&gt; is cellular.
# &lt;math&gt;(A_1,i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A_2,i)&lt;/math&gt; are cellular.
* Since in particular all [[Block of a ring|blocks]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-invariant if &lt;math&gt;(A,i)&lt;/math&gt; is cellular, an immediate corollary is that a finite dimensional &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is cellular w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if and only if all blocks are &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-invariant and cellular w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Tits' deformation theorem]] for cellular algebras: Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a cellular &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. Also let &lt;math&gt;R\to k&lt;/math&gt; be a unitary homomorphism into a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K:=Quot(R)&lt;/math&gt; the [[quotient field]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following holds: If &lt;math&gt;kA&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, then &lt;math&gt;KA&lt;/math&gt; is also semisimple.

If one further assumes &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to be a [[local ring|local domain]], then additionally the following holds:

=== Other properties ===

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field (though a lot of this can be generalized to arbitrary rings, [[integral domain]]s, [[local ring]]s or at least [[discrete valuation ring]]s) and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is cellular w.r.t. to the involution &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following hold 
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is split, i.e. all simple modules are [[absolutely irreducible]].
* The following are equivalent:&lt;ref name="grahamlehrer" /&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]].
# &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is split semisimple.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall\lambda\in\Lambda: W(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is simple.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall\lambda\in\Lambda: \phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[nondegenerate]].
* The [[Cartan matrix]] &lt;math&gt;C_A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]].
* The following are equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Cellular algebras and quasi-hereditary algebras: A comparison|first1= S.|last1= König|first2= C.C.|last2= Xi|journal= [[Electronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume= 5|date= 1999-06-24|pages=71–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Quasi-hereditary algebra|quasi-hereditary]] (i.e. its module category is a [[highest-weight category]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6037">[[File:Conical coordinates.png|thumb|380px|right|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of the conical coordinates.  The constants {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} were chosen as 1 and 2, respectively.  The red sphere represents {{math|1=''r'' = 2}}, the blue elliptic cone aligned with the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis represents μ=cosh(1) and the yellow elliptic cone aligned with the (green) {{mvar|x}}-axis corresponds to {{math|1=''ν''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2/3}}.  The three surfaces intersect at the point {{math|'''P'''}} (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (1.26, -0.78, 1.34).  The elliptic cones intersect the sphere in taco-shaped curves.]]

'''Conical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] consisting of 
concentric spheres (described by their radius {{mvar|r}}) and by two families of perpendicular cones, aligned along the {{math|''z''}}- and {{math|''x''}}-axes, respectively.

==Basic definitions==

The conical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
x = \frac{r\mu\nu}{bc}
&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \frac{r}{b} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu^{2} - b^{2} \right) \left( \nu^{2} - b^{2} \right)}{\left( b^{2} - c^{2} \right)} }
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = \frac{r}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu^{2} - c^{2} \right) \left( \nu^{2} - c^{2} \right)}{\left( c^{2} - b^{2} \right)} }
&lt;/math&gt;

with the following limitations on the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu^{2} &lt; c^{2} &lt; \mu^{2} &lt; b^{2}. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Surfaces of constant {{mvar|r}} are spheres of that radius centered on the origin

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = r^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are mutually perpendicular cones

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\mu^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{\mu^{2} + b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{\mu^{2} - c^{2}} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\nu^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{\nu^{2} - b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{\nu^{2} + c^{2}} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this coordinate system, both [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]] are separable.

==Scale factors==

The scale factor for the radius {{mvar|r}} is one ({{math|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1}}), as in [[spherical coordinates]]. The scale factors for the two conical coordinates are 

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = r \sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2} - \nu^{2}}{\left( b^{2} - \mu^{2} \right) \left( \mu^{2} - c^{2} \right)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\nu} = r \sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2} - \nu^{2}}{\left( b^{2} - \nu^{2} \right) \left( c^{2} - \nu^{2} \right)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Light cone conical coordinates ==
[[File:LightConeConicCoords.pdf|thumb]]
An alternative set of (non-orthogonal) conical coordinates have been derived&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Drake|first = Samuel Picton|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Brian D. O.|last3 = Yu|first3 = Changbin|date = 2009-07-20|title = Causal association of electromagnetic signals using the Cayley–Menger determinant|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/95/3/10.1063/1.3180815|journal = Applied Physics Letters|volume = 95|issue = 3|pages = 034106|doi = 10.1063/1.3180815|issn = 0003-6951|arxiv = 0908.3143|bibcode = 2009ApPhL..95c4106D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\xi   &amp;=  r\cos(\phi\sin\theta)\\
\psi  &amp;=  r\sin(\phi\sin\theta) \\ 
\zeta &amp;=  \theta,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;   

where &lt;math&gt;\{r, \theta, \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[spherical polar coordinates]]. The corresponding inverse relations are

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r      &amp; =  \sqrt{\xi^2 + \psi^2}\\
\phi   &amp; =  \frac{1}{\sin\zeta}\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi}) \\
\theta &amp; =  \zeta.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal Euclidean distance between two points in these coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
ds^2  &amp; =  d\xi^2 + d\psi^2+(\xi^2 + \psi^2)(1+\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})^2\cot\zeta^2) d\zeta^2 \\
&amp;+ 2\psi\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})\cot\zeta d\xi d\zeta - 2\xi\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})\cot\zeta d\psi d\zeta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal coordinates on the surface of the cone given by &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the path between any two points is constrained to this surface, then the geodesic distance between any two points

&lt;math&gt;\{\xi_1,\psi_1,\zeta_1=\frac{\pi}{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_2,\psi_2,\zeta_2=\frac{\pi}{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; is 

&lt;math&gt;s^2_{12} = (\xi_1-\xi_2)^2+(\psi_1-\psi_2)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

'''David Herbert Fowler''' (28 April 1937 – 13 April 2004) was a historian of [[Greek mathematics]] who published work on pre-[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxian]] ratio theory (using the process he called [[anthyphairesis]]). He disputed the standard story of
Greek mathematical discovery, in which the discovery of the phenomenon of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurability]] came as a shock.

Fowler was also the translator of [[René Thom]]'s book ''Structural Stability and Morphogenesis'' from French (''Stabilité strukturelle et morphogénèse'') into English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2263">In [[mathematics]], the '''Denjoy–Young–Saks theorem''' gives some possibilities for  the [[Dini derivative]]s of a function that hold [[almost everywhere]].
{{harvs|txt|last=Denjoy|authorlink=A. Denjoy|year=1915}} proved the theorem for [[continuous function]]s, {{harvs|txt|last=Young|authorlink=Grace Young|year=1917}} extended it to [[measurable function]]s, and {{harvs|txt|last=Saks|authorlink=S. Saks|year=1924}} extended it to arbitrary functions.
{{harvtxt|Saks|1937|loc=Chapter IX, section 4}} and {{harvtxt|Bruckner|1978|loc=chapter IV, theorem 4.4}} give historical accounts of the theorem.

==Statement==

If ''f'' is a real valued function defined on an interval, then with the possible exception of a set of measure 0 on the interval, the Dini derivatives of ''f'' satisfy one of the following four conditions at each point:

*''f'' has a finite derivative
*''D''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' is finite, ''D''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ∞, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = –∞.
*''D''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' is finite, ''D''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ∞, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = –∞.
*''D''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ''D''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' = ∞, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = –∞.

The Routh array is a [[Routh-Hurwitz_stability_criterion#Higher-order_example|tabular method]] permitting one to establish the [[stable polynomial|stability]] of a system using only the coefficients of the characteristic [[polynomial]].  Central to the field of [[control theory|control systems design]], the [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]] and Routh array emerge by using the [[Euclidean algorithm]] and [[Sturm's theorem]] in evaluating [[cauchy index|Cauchy indices]]. 

== The Cauchy index ==


Given the system:


: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(x) &amp; {} = a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n &amp; {} \quad (1) \\
      &amp; {} = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n) &amp; {} \quad (2) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


Assuming no roots of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; lie on the imaginary axis, and letting


: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = The number of roots of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; with negative real parts, and
: &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = The number of roots of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; with positive real parts


then we have


: &lt;math&gt;N+P=n  \quad (3) &lt;/math&gt;


Expressing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in polar form, we have


: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \rho(x)e^{j\theta(x)}    \quad (4) &lt;/math&gt;


where


: &lt;math&gt;\rho(x) = \sqrt{\mathfrak{Re}^2[f(x)]+\mathfrak{Im}^2[f(x)]}   \quad (5) &lt;/math&gt;


and 


: &lt;math&gt;\theta(x) = \tan^{-1}\big(\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]\big)  \quad (6) &lt;/math&gt;


from (2) note that


: &lt;math&gt;\theta(x) = \theta_{r_1}(x)+\theta_{r_2}(x)+\cdots+\theta_{r_n}(x)  \quad (7)&lt;/math&gt;


where


: &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x) = \angle(x-r_i)  \quad (8)&lt;/math&gt;


Now if the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; has a positive real part, then (&lt;small&gt;using the notation y=(RE[y],IM[y])&lt;/small&gt;)


:  &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\theta_{r_i}(x)\big|_{x=j\infty} &amp; = \angle(x-r_i)\big|_{x=j\infty} \\
                                 &amp; = \angle(0-\mathfrak{Re}[r_i],\infty-\mathfrak{Im}[r_i]) \\
                                 &amp; = \angle(-\mathfrak{Re}[r_i],\infty) \\
                                 &amp; = \lim_{\phi \to -\infty}\tan^{-1}\phi=-\frac{\pi}{2}  \quad (9)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


and


: &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x)\big|_{x=-j\infty} = \angle(-\mathfrak{Re}[r_i],-\infty) = \lim_{\phi \to \infty}\tan^{-1}\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}  \quad (10)&lt;/math&gt;


Similarly, if the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; has a negative real part,


: &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x)\big|_{x=j\infty} = \angle(-\mathfrak{Re}[r_i],\infty) = \lim_{\phi \to \infty}\tan^{-1}\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}\,  \quad (11)&lt;/math&gt;


and


: &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x)\big|_{x=-j\infty} = \angle(-\mathfrak{Re}[r_i],-\infty) = \lim_{\phi \to -\infty}\tan^{-1}\phi=-\frac{\pi}{2}\,  \quad (12)&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x)\Big|_{x=-j\infty}^{x=j\infty} = -\pi&lt;/math&gt; when the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a positive real part, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{r_i}(x)\Big|_{x=-j\infty}^{x=j\infty} = \pi&lt;/math&gt; when the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a negative real part.  Alternatively,


: &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)\big|_{x=j\infty} = \angle(x-r_1)\big|_{x=j\infty}+\angle(x-r_2)\big|_{x=j\infty}+\cdots+\angle(x-r_n)\big|_{x=j\infty} = \frac{\pi}{2}N-\frac{\pi}{2}P  \quad (13)&lt;/math&gt;


and


: &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)\big|_{x=-j\infty} = \angle(x-r_1)\big|_{x=-j\infty}+\angle(x-r_2)\big|_{x=-j\infty}+\cdots+\angle(x-r_n)\big|_{x=-j\infty} = -\frac{\pi}{2}N+\frac{\pi}{2}P  \quad (14)&lt;/math&gt;


So, if we define


: &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{1}{\pi}\theta(x)\Big|_{-j\infty}^{j\infty}  \quad (15)&lt;/math&gt;


then we have the relationship


:&lt;math&gt;N - P = \Delta  \quad (16)&lt;/math&gt;


and combining (3) and (16) gives us


: &lt;math&gt;N = \frac{n+\Delta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{n-\Delta}{2}    \quad (17)&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, given an equation of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we need only evaluate this function &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; to determine &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of roots with negative real parts and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the number of roots with positive real parts.

|}


Equations (13) and (14) show that at &lt;math&gt;x=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta=\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.  Note now, in accordance with (6) and Figure 1, the graph of &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, that varying &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over an interval (a,b) where &lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\theta(x)|_{x=ja}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_b=\theta(x)|_{x=jb}&lt;/math&gt; are integer multiples of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, this variation causing the function &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt; to have increased by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, indicates that in the course of travelling from point a to point b, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; has "jumped" from &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; one more time than it has jumped from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, if we vary &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over an interval (a,b) this variation causing &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt; to have decreased by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, where again &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; at both &lt;math&gt;x = ja&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = jb&lt;/math&gt;, implies that &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta (x) = \mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; has jumped from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; one more time than it has jumped from &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; was varied over the said interval.


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)\Big|_{-j\infty}^{j\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; times the difference between the number of points at which &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; jumps from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and the number of points at which &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; jumps from &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ranges over the interval &lt;math&gt;(-j\infty,+j\infty\,)&lt;/math&gt; provided that at &lt;math&gt;x=\pm j\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan[\theta(x)]&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

In the case where the starting point is on an incongruity (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\pi/2 \pm i\pi&lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' = 0, 1, 2, ...) the ending point will be on an incongruity as well, by equation (16) (since &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an integer and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; will be an integer).  In this case, we can achieve this same index (difference in positive and negative jumps) by shifting the axes of the tangent function by &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, through adding &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, our index is now fully defined for any combination of coefficients in &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by evaluating &lt;math&gt;\tan[\theta]=\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;  over the interval (a,b) = &lt;math&gt;(+j\infty, -j\infty)&lt;/math&gt; when our starting (and thus ending) point is not an incongruity, and by evaluating


: &lt;math&gt;\tan[\theta'(x)]=\tan[\theta + \pi/2] = -\cot[\theta(x)] = -\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]/\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]  \quad (18)&lt;/math&gt;


over said interval when our starting point is at an incongruity.


This difference, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, of negative and positive jumping incongruities encountered while traversing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;-j\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+j\infty&lt;/math&gt; is called the Cauchy Index of the tangent of the phase angle, the phase angle being &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\theta'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, depending as &lt;math&gt;\theta_a&lt;/math&gt; is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; or not.

== The Routh criterion ==


To derive Routh's criterion, first we'll use a different notation to differentiate between the even and odd terms of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;:


: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0x^n + b_0x^{n-1} + a_1x^{n-2} + b_1x^{n-3} + \cdots  \quad (19)&lt;/math&gt;


Now we have: 


: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(j\omega) &amp; = a_0(j\omega)^n+b_0(j\omega)^{n-1}+a_1(j\omega)^{n-2}+b_1(j\omega)^{n-3}+\cdots &amp; {}  \quad (20)\\
            &amp; = a_0(j\omega)^n+a_1(j\omega)^{n-2}+a_2(j\omega)^{n-4}+\cdots &amp; {} \quad (21)\\
            &amp; + b_0(j\omega)^{n-1}+b_1(j\omega)^{n-3}+b_2(j\omega)^{n-5}+\cdots \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, 


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(j\omega) &amp; = (-1)^{n/2}\big[a_0\omega^n+a_1\omega^{n-2}+a_2\omega^{n-4}+\cdots \big] &amp; {}  \quad (22)\\
            &amp; + j(-1)^{(n/2)-1}\big[b_0\omega^{n-1}+b_1\omega^{n-3}+b_2\omega^{n-5}+\cdots \big] &amp; {} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


and if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd:


: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(j\omega) &amp; = j(-1)^{(n-1)/2}\big[a_0\omega^n+a_1\omega^{n-2}+a_2\omega^{n-4}+\cdots \big] &amp; {}  \quad (23)\\
            &amp; + (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\big[b_0\omega^{n-1}+b_1\omega^{n-3}+b_2\omega^{n-5}+\cdots \big] &amp; {}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


Now observe that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an odd integer, then by (3) &lt;math&gt;N+P&lt;/math&gt; is odd.  If &lt;math&gt;N+P&lt;/math&gt; is an odd integer, then &lt;math&gt;N-P&lt;/math&gt; is odd as well.  Similarly, this same argument shows that when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, &lt;math&gt;N-P&lt;/math&gt; will be even.  Equation (13) shows that if &lt;math&gt;N-P&lt;/math&gt; is even, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; even, and is thus the proper index to use when n is even, and similarly &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta') = \tan(\theta+\pi) = -\cot(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; odd, making it the proper index in this latter case.


Thus, from (6) and (22), for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; even:


: &lt;math&gt;\Delta = I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{-\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]}{\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]}= I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{b_0\omega^{n-1}-b_1\omega^{n-3}+\cdots}{a_0\omega^n-a_1\omega^{n-2}+\ldots}  \quad (24)&lt;/math&gt;


and from (18) and (23), for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; odd:


:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\mathfrak{Re}[f(x)]}{\mathfrak{Im}[f(x)]}= I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{b_0\omega^{n-1}-b_1\omega^{n-3}+\ldots}{a_0\omega^n-a_1\omega^{n-2}+\ldots}  \quad (25)&lt;/math&gt;


Lo and behold we are evaluating the same Cauchy index for both:


&lt;math&gt;\Delta = I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{b_0\omega^{n-1}-b_1\omega^{n-3}+\ldots}{a_0\omega^n-a_1\omega^{n-2}+\ldots}    \quad (26)&lt;/math&gt;

== Sturm's theorem ==


[[Sturm theorem|Sturm]] gives us a method for evaluating &lt;math&gt;\Delta = I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{f_2(x)}{f_1(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.  His theorem states as follows:


Given a sequence of polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots, f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; where:


1)   If &lt;math&gt;f_k(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f_{k-1}(x) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{k+1}(x) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{sign}[f_{k-1}(x)] = - \operatorname{sign}[f_{k+1}(x)]&lt;/math&gt;


2)   &lt;math&gt;f_m(x) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;


and we define &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; as the number of changes of sign in the sequence &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots, f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; for a fixed value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then:


: &lt;math&gt;\Delta = I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{f_2(x)}{f_1(x)}= V(-\infty) - V(+\infty)    \quad (27)&lt;/math&gt;


A sequence satisfying these requirements is obtained using the [[Euclid's algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]], which is as follows:


Starting with &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and denoting the remainder of &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)/f_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_3(x)&lt;/math&gt; and similarly denoting the remainder of &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)/f_3(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_4(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on, we obtain the relationships:


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;f_1(x)= q_1(x)f_2(x) - f_3(x)    \quad (28)\\
&amp;f_2(x)= q_2(x)f_3(x) - f_4(x) \\
&amp;     \ldots \\
&amp;f_{m-1}(x)= q_{m-1}(x)f_m(x) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


or in general 


: &lt;math&gt;f_{k-1}(x)= q_{k-1}(x)f_k(x) - f_{k+1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;


where the last non-zero remainder, &lt;math&gt;f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; will therefore be the highest common factor of &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots, f_{m-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be observed that the sequence so constructed will satisfy the conditions of Sturm's theorem, and thus an algorithm for determining the stated index has been developed.


It is in applying Sturm's theorem (28) to (26), through the use of the Euclidean algorithm above that the Routh matrix is formed.


We get


:&lt;math&gt;f_3(\omega) = \frac {a_0}{b_0}f_2(\omega) - f_1(\omega)   \quad (29) &lt;/math&gt;


and identifying the coefficients of this remainder by &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-c_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-c_3&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth, makes our formed remainder 


:&lt;math&gt;f_3(\omega) = c_0\omega^{n-2} - c_1\omega^{n-4} + c_2\omega^{n-6} - \cdots   \quad (30)&lt;/math&gt;


where


:&lt;math&gt;c_0 = a_1 - \frac{a_0}{b_0}b_1 = \frac{b_0a_1 - a_1b_0}{b_0}; c_1 = a_2 - \frac{a_0}{b_0}b_2 = \frac{b_0a_2 - a_0b_2}{b_0};\ldots   \quad (31)&lt;/math&gt;


Continuing with the Euclidean algorithm on these new coefficients gives us


:&lt;math&gt;f_4(\omega) = \frac {b_0}{c_0}f_3(\omega) - f_2(\omega)   \quad (32)&lt;/math&gt;


where we again denote the coefficients of the remainder &lt;math&gt;f_4(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-d_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-d_3&lt;/math&gt;,


making our formed remainder 


:&lt;math&gt;f_4(\omega) = d_0\omega^{n-3} - d_1\omega^{n-5} + d_2\omega^{n-7} - \cdots   \quad (33)&lt;/math&gt;


and giving us


:&lt;math&gt;d_0 = b_1 - \frac{b_0}{c_0}c_1 = \frac{c_0b_1 - b_1c_0}{c_0}; d_1 = b_2 - \frac{b_0}{c_0}c_2 = \frac{c_0b_2 - b_0c_2}{c_0};\ldots   \quad (34)&lt;/math&gt;


The rows of the Routh array are determined exactly by this algorithm when applied to the coefficients of (19).  An observation worthy of note is that in the regular case the polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_1(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; have as the highest common factor &lt;math&gt;f_{n+1}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and thus there will be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; polynomials in the chain &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots, f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt;.


Note now, that in determining the signs of the members of the sequence of polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots,f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; that at &lt;math&gt;\omega = \pm \infty&lt;/math&gt; the dominating power of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; will be the first term of each of these polynomials, and thus only these coefficients corresponding to the highest powers of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f_1(x),f_2(x), \dots&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which are &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_0&lt;/math&gt;, ... determine the signs of &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;f_m(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\omega = \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;.


So we get &lt;math&gt;V(+\infty)=V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; that is, &lt;math&gt;V(+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of changes of sign in the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0\infty^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0\infty^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0\infty^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_0&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;V(-\infty)=V(a_0, -b_0, c_0, -d_0, ...)&lt;/math&gt;; that is &lt;math&gt;V(-\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of changes of sign in the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0(-\infty)^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0(-\infty)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0(-\infty)^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-d_0&lt;/math&gt;, ... 


Since our chain &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_0&lt;/math&gt;, ... will have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; members it is clear that &lt;math&gt;V(+\infty) + V(-\infty) = n&lt;/math&gt; since within &lt;math&gt;V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; if going from &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt; a sign change has not occurred, within 
&lt;math&gt;V(a_0, -b_0, c_0, -d_0, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; going from &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-b_0&lt;/math&gt; one has, and likewise for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; transitions (there will be no terms equal to zero) giving us &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; total sign changes.


As &lt;math&gt;\Delta = V(-\infty) - V(+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n = V(+\infty) + V(-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and from (17) &lt;math&gt;P = (n - \Delta/2)&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;P = V(+\infty) = V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; and have derived Routh's theorem -


'''''The number of roots of a real polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; which lie in the right half plane &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Re}(r_i) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of changes of sign in the first column of the Routh scheme.'''''


And for the stable case where &lt;math&gt;P = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;V(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, \dots) = 0&lt;/math&gt; by  which we have Routh's famous criterion:


'''''In order for all the roots of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the elements in the first column of the Routh scheme be different from zero and of the same sign.'''''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Effect algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s of a kind introduced by D.&amp;nbsp;Foulis and M.&amp;nbsp;Bennett&lt;ref&gt;D. Foulis and M. Bennett. "Effect algebras and unsharp quantum logics", ''Found. Phys.'', 24(10):1331–1352, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a framework for unsharp measurements in [[quantum mechanics]].

An effect algebra consists of an underlying set ''A'' equipped with a partial binary operation ⊞, a unary operation (−)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;, and two special elements 0, 1 such that the following relationships hold:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Roumen, "Cohomology of effect algebras" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00567v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* The binary operation is commutative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' is defined, then so is ''b'' ⊞ ''a'', and they are equal.
* The binary operation is associative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' are defined, then so are ''b'' ⊞ ''c'' and ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c''), and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' = ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c'').
* The zero element behaves as expected: 0 ⊞ ''a'' is always defined and equals ''a''.
* The unary operation is an orthocomplementation: for each ''a'' ∈ ''A'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; is the unique element of ''A'' for which ''a'' ⊞ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
* A zero-one law holds: if ''a'' ⊞ 1 is defined, then ''a'' = 0.

Every effect algebra carries a natural [[partial order|order]]:  define ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an element ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ⊞ ''c''}} exists and is equal to&amp;nbsp;''b''. The defining axioms of effect algebras guarantee that&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;is a partial order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = 1602.00567| title = Cohomology of effect algebras | date = 2016-02-02 | last = Roumen | first = Frank | doi=10.4204/EPTCS.236.12 | volume=236 | journal=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science | pages=174–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second epoch (1920–1926)==

In the second epoch, Noether turned her attention to the theory of rings.  With her paper ''Moduln in nichtkommutativen Bereichen, insbesondere aus Differential- und Differenzenausdrücken'', [[Hermann Weyl]] states, "It is here for the first time that the Emmy Noether appears whom we all know, and who changed the face of algebra by her work."

| ''Mathematische Annalen'', '''83''', 24–66 || '''[[Ideal (ring theory)|Ideals]]'''.  Considered by many mathematicians to be Noether's most important paper.  In it, Noether shows the equivalence of the [[ascending chain condition]] with previous concepts such as Hilbert's theorem of a finite ideal basis.  She also shows that any ideal that satisfies this condition can be represented as an intersection of primary ideals, which are a generalization of the ''einartiges Ideal'' defined by [[Richard Dedekind]].  Noether also defines irreducible ideals and proves four uniqueness theorems by the exchange method, as in publication [[#noether_17|#17]].

==Third epoch (1927–1935)==

In the third epoch, Emmy Noether focused on non-commutative algebras, and unified much earlier work on the representation theory of groups.

In mathematics, the '''Garnir relations''' give a way of expressing a basis of the [[Specht module]]s ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of standard polytabloids.

==Specht modules in terms of polytabloids==
Given a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] λ of ''n'', one has the Specht module ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;. In characteristic 0, this is an irreducible representation of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. One can construct ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; explicitly in terms of polytabloids as follows:
* Start with the permutation representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acting on all [[Young tableau]]x of shape λ, where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acts by permuting the entries in each tableau. Note that we do not require the tableaux to be standard.
* Extend this to an action of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on all (row) [[Young tabloid]]s, which are orbits of Young tableaux under the action of the Young row subgroups (two Young tableaux of shape λ, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_r&lt;/math&gt;, are equivalent if they are in the same orbit of &lt;math&gt;S_{\lambda_1} \times \cdots \times S_{\lambda_r} \leqslant S_n&lt;/math&gt;, acting by permuting the entries in each row).
* Now consider [[polytabloid]]s, these are formal linear combinations of Young tabloids, with integer coefficients. Given any Young tableau ''T'', one defines the associated polytabloid by acting on ''T'' with the Young column subgroup &lt;math&gt;S_{\mu_1} \times \cdots \times S_{\mu_s}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_1 + \cdots + \mu_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conjugate partition]] to λ. One writes a polytabloid ''S'' = ''T'' σ corresponding to each element in this orbit, affected with the sign of the permutation σ taking ''T'' to ''S''. One then writes ''e''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; for the corresponding polytabloid:
:&lt;math&gt;e_T = \sum_{\sigma \in S_{\mu_1} \times \cdots \times S_{\mu_s}} \sgn(\sigma) T \sigma. &lt;/math&gt;
* The Specht module ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is then the subspace of the space of all polytabloids spanned by the polytabloids obtained from Young tableaux in the above fashion.

==Straightening polytabloids and the Garnir elements==
The above construction gives an explicit description of the Specht module ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the polytabloids associated to different Young tableaux are not necessarily linearly independent, indeed, the dimension of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is exactly the number of '''standard''' Young tableaux of shape λ. In fact, the polytabloids associated to standard Young tableaux span ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;; to express other polytabloids in terms of them, one uses a '''straightening algorithm'''.

Given a Young tableau ''S'', we construct the polytabloid ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; as above. Without loss of generality, all columns of ''S'' are increasing, otherwise we could instead start with the modified Young tableau with increasing columns, whose polytabloid will differ at most by a sign. ''S'' is then said to not have any ''column descents''. We want to express ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; as a linear combination of standard polytabloids, i.e. polytabloids associated to standard Young tableaux. To do this, we would like permutations π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that in all tableaux ''S''π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, a row descent has been eliminated, with &lt;math&gt; S(1 + \sum_i \pi_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This then expresses ''S'' in terms of polytabloids that are closer to being standard. The permutations that achieve this are the '''Garnir elements'''.

Suppose we want to eliminate a row descent in the Young tableau ''T''. We pick two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of the boxes of ''T'' as in the following diagram:

[[File:Row descent.svg]]

Then the Garnir element &lt;math&gt;g_{A,B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\sum_i \sgn(\pi_i) \pi_i&lt;/math&gt;, where the π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the permutations of the entries of the boxes of ''A'' and ''B'' that keep both subsets ''A'' and ''B'' without column descents.

==Example==
Consider the following Young tableau:

[[File:Row descent and Garnir element.svg]]

There is a row descent in the second row, so we choose the subsets ''A'' and ''B'' as indicated, which gives us the following:

[[File:Straightening of a polytabloid.svg]]

This gives us the Garnir element &lt;math&gt;g_{A,B} = 1 - (4 5) + (2 4 5) + (4 6 5) - (2 4 6 5) + (2 5) (4 6)&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to remove the row descent in the second row, but this has also introduced other descents in other places. But there is a way in which all tableaux obtained like this are closer to being standard, this is measured by a ''dominance order'' on polytabloids. Therefore, one can repeatedly apply this procedure to ''straighten'' a polytabloid, eventually writing it as a linear combination of standard polytabloids, showing that the Specht module is spanned by the standard polytabloids. As they are also linearly independent, they form a basis of this module.

== Other interpretations ==
There is a similar description for the irreducible representations of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. In that case, one can consider the [[Weyl module]]s associated to a partition &amp;lambda;, which can be described in terms of [[bideterminant]]s. One has a similar straightening algorithm, but this time in terms of semistandard Young tableaux.

'''Gongsun Long''' ({{zh|t=公孫龍|s=公孙龙|p=Gōngsūn Lóng|w=Kung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-sun&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Lung&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{circa|lk=no|325–250}} BC&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Yunzhi, "Gongsun Long". ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'' (Philosophy Edition), 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2004, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;) was a member of the [[School of Names]] (Logicians) of ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers, and advocated peaceful means of resolving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the [[Warring States period]]. However, little is known about the particulars of his life, and furthermore many of his writings have been lost.&lt;ref name="mcgreal"&gt;McGreal 1995, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; All of his essays — fourteen originally but only six extant — are included in the anthology '''''the Gongsun Longzi''''' ({{zh|t=公孫龍子|hp=Gōngsūn lóng zi|w=Kung-sun Lung-tzu|links=no}}).

In Book 17 of the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' anthology, Gongsun thus speaks of himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When young, I studied the way of the former kings. When I grew up, I understood the practice of kindness and duty. I united the same and different, separated hard from white, made so the not-so and admissible the inadmissible. I confounded the wits of the hundred schools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers. I took myself to have reached the ultimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is best known for a series of [[paradox]]es in the tradition of [[Hui Shi]], including "White horses are not horses," "When no thing is not the pointed-out, to point out is not to point out," and "There is no 1 in 2." These paradoxes seem to suggest a similarity to the discovery in Greek philosophy that pure logic may lead to apparently absurd conclusions.

==White Horse Dialogue==
{{main|When a White Horse is Not a Horse}}

In the ''White Horse Dialogue'' ({{zh|t=白馬論|hp=Báimǎ Lùn|links=no}}), one interlocutor (sometimes called the "sophist") defends the truth of the statement "White horses are not horses," while the other interlocutor (sometimes called the "objector") disputes the truth of this statement. This has been interpreted in a number of ways.

Possibly the simplest interpretation is to see it as based on a confusion of class and identity. The argument, by this interpretation, plays upon an ambiguity in Chinese that doesn't exist in English. The expression "X is not Y" (X非Y) can mean either
* "X is not a member (or subset) of set Y"
* "X is not identical to Y"

The sentence "White horses are not horses" would normally be taken to assert the obviously false claim that white horses are not part of the group of horses. However, the "sophist" in the dialogue defends the statement under the interpretation, "Not all horses are white horses". The latter statement is actually true, since — as the "sophist" explains — "horses" includes horses that are white, yellow, brown, etc., while "white horses" includes only white horses, and excludes the others.  A.C. Graham proposed this interpretation and illustrated it with an analogy.  The "Objector" assumes that "a white horse is not a horse" is parallel to "a sword is not a weapon," but the "Sophist" is treating the statement as parallel to "a sword is not a blade." &lt;ref name="Disputers"&gt;A.C. Graham, ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China'' (Chicago: Open Court, 2003) [1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89}} Other interpretations have been put forward by Fung Yu-lan and Chad Hansen among others.&lt;ref name="Disputers"/&gt;{{rp|82–83}}

This work has been viewed by some as a serious logical discourse, by others as a facetious work of [[sophistry]], and finally by some as a combination of the two.&lt;ref name="Humor"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Harbsmeier, Christoph| title=Humor in Ancient Chinese Philosophy| journal=[[Philosophy East and West]] | year=1989| volume=39| issue=3| pages=289–310 | doi=10.2307/1399450 | publisher=[[University of Hawaiʻi]] Press | jstor=1399450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered part of the [[New Weird America]] movement along with [[David Dondero]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], and [[CocoRosie]].  His latest full-length album, Hypnosis for Happiness, was released in July 2013 on the [[Friendly Police UK]] label. His previous full-length album, Brokedown Gospel, was released on the [[Asian Man Records]] label in July 2004.  He also releases music under the pseudonym [[Scout You Devil]] and as part of the songwriting duo [[Olney Clark]].

Alongside his music, Passmore is also a [[mathematician]] and [[theoretical computer scientist]], formerly a student at the University of Texas at Austin, the Mathematical Research Institute in the Netherlands, and the University of Edinburgh, where he earned his Ph.D.  He is a Life Member of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall, University of Cambridge]] and  is cofounder of the [[artificial intelligence]] company [[Aesthetic Integration]] which produces technology for the [[formal verification]] of [[algorithms]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10826">The '''growth function''', also called the '''shatter coefficient''' or the '''shattering number''', measures the richness of a [[set family]]. It is especially used in the context of [[statistical learning theory]], where it measures the complexity of a hypothesis class.
The term 'growth function' was coined by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in their 1968 paper, where they also proved many of its properties.&lt;ref name="vc"&gt;{{Cite Vapnik Chervonenkis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a basic concept in [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=book12&gt;{{Cite Mehryar Afshin Ameet 2012}}, especially Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=book14&gt;{{Cite Shai Shai 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Set-family definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a [[set family]] (a set of sets) and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; a set. Their ''intersection'' is defined as the following set-family:
:&lt;math mode=display&gt;
H\cap C := \{h\cap C\mid h\in H\}
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''intersection-size'' (also called the ''index'') of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;'' is &lt;math&gt;|H\cap C|&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, if a set &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; elements then the index is at most &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt;.

The growth function measures the size of &lt;math&gt;H\cap C&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;|C|&lt;/math&gt;. Formally:
:&lt;math mode=display&gt;
\operatorname{Growth}(H,m) := \max_{C: |C|=m} |H\cap C|
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hypothesis-class definition ===
Equivalently, let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a hypothesis-class (a set of binary functions) and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; a set with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; elements. The ''restriction'' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the set of binary functions on  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that can be derived from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|45}}
:&lt;math mode=display&gt;
H_{C} := \{(h(x_1),\ldots,h(x_m))\mid h\in H, x_i\in C\}
&lt;/math&gt;
The growth function measures the size of &lt;math&gt;H_C&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;|C|&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|49}}
:&lt;math mode=display&gt;
\operatorname{Growth}(H,m) := \max_{C: |C|=m} |H\cap C|
(H,m) := \max_{C: |C|=m} |H_C|
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
'''1.''' The domain is the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; contains all the [[half-line]]s (rays) from a given number to positive infinity, i.e., all sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x &gt; x_0 \mid x\in \mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x_0\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  
For any set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; real numbers, the intersection &lt;math&gt;H\cap C&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;m+1&lt;/math&gt; sets: the empty set, the set containing the largest element of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the set containing the two largest elements of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. Therefore: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)=m+1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Ex.1}} The same is true whether &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; contains open half-lines, closed half-lines, or both.

'''2.''' The domain is the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. 
The set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; contains all the open sets. 
For any set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; real numbers, the intersection &lt;math&gt;H\cap C&lt;/math&gt; contains all possible subsets of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. There are &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt; such subsets, so &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)=2^m&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Ex.2}}

'''3.''' The domain is the Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. 
The set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; contains all the [[half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s of the form: &lt;math&gt;x\cdot \phi \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed vector.
Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)=\operatorname{Comp}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;,
where Comp is the number of [[Space partitioning#Number of components|number of components in a partitioning of an n-dimensional space by m hyperplanes]].&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Ex.3}}

'''4.''' The domain is the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; contains all the real intervals, i.e., all sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x \in [x_0,x_1] | x\in \mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; real numbers, the intersection &lt;math&gt;H\cap C&lt;/math&gt; contains all runs of between 0 and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; consecutive elements of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. The number of such runs is &lt;math&gt;{m+1 \choose 2}+1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)={m+1 \choose 2}+1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Polynomial or exponential ==
The main property that makes the growth function interesting is that it can be either polynomial or exponential - nothing in-between. 

The following is a property of the intersection-size:&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Lem.1}}
* If, for some set &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and for some number &lt;math&gt;n\leq m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|H\cap C_m| \geq \operatorname{Comp}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; -
* then, there exists a subset &lt;math&gt;C_n\subseteq C_m&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|H\cap C_n| = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies the following property of the Growth function.&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Th.1}}
For every family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; there are two cases:
* The ''exponential case'': &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m) = 2^m&lt;/math&gt; identically.
* The ''polynomial case'': &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)&lt;/math&gt; is majorized by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Comp}(n,m) \leq m^n+1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest integer for which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,n) &lt; 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Other properties ==
=== Trivial upper bound ===
For any finite &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m) \leq |H|&lt;/math&gt;
since for every &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;H\cap C&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;|H|&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the growth function is mainly interesting when &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.

=== Exponential upper bound ===
For any nonempty &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m) \leq 2^m&lt;/math&gt;
I.e, the growth function has an exponential upper-bound.

We say that a set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; '''[[Shattered set|shatters]]''' a set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if their intersection contains all possible subsets of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;H\cap C = 2^C&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; shatters &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,C)=2^{m}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the upper bound.

=== Cartesian intersection ===
Define the Cartesian intersection of two set-families as:
::&lt;math&gt;H_1\bigotimes H_2 := \{h_1\cap h_2 \mid h_1\in H_1, h_2\in H_2\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|57}}
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H_1\bigotimes H_2, m) \leq \operatorname{Growth}(H_1, m)\cdot \operatorname{Growth}(H_2, m)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Union ===
For every two set-families:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|58}}
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H_1\cup H_2, m) \leq \operatorname{Growth}(H_1, m) + \operatorname{Growth}(H_2, m)&lt;/math&gt;

=== VC dimension ===
The '''[[VC dimension]]''' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is defined according to these two cases:
* In the ''polynomial case'', &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VCDim}(H) = n-1&lt;/math&gt; = the largest integer &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,d) = 2^d&lt;/math&gt;.
* In the ''exponential case''   &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VCDim}(H) = \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

So &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VCDim}(H)\geq d&lt;/math&gt; if-and-only-if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,d)=2^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The growth function can be regarded as a refinement of the concept of VC dimension. The VC dimension only tells us whether &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,d)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to or smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^d&lt;/math&gt;, while the growth function tells us exactly how &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)&lt;/math&gt; changes as a function of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

Another connection between the growth function and the VC dimension is given by the [[Sauer–Shelah lemma]]:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|49}}
:If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VCDim}(H)=d&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)\leq \sum_{i=0}^{d} {m\choose i}&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, 
:for all &lt;math&gt;m&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)\leq (em/d)^d = O(m^d)&lt;/math&gt;
:so when the VC dimension is finite, the growth function grows polynomially with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.
This upper bound is tight, i.e, for all &lt;math&gt;m&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; with VC dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|56}}
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)= \sum_{i=0}^{d} {m\choose i}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Entropy ===
While the growth-function is related to the ''maximum'' intersection-size,
the '''[[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]''' is related to the ''average'' intersection size:&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|272–273}}
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Entropy}(H, m) = E_{|C_m|=m}\big[\log_2(|H\cap C_m|)\big]&lt;/math&gt;
The intersection-size has the following property. For every set-family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;
|H\cap (C_1 \cup C_2)| 
\leq 
|H\cap C_1|\cdot |H \cap C_2|
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence:
::&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Entropy}(H, m_1+m_2)
\leq
\operatorname{Entropy}(H, m_1) + \operatorname{Entropy}(H, m_2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, the sequence &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Entropy}(H, m)/m&lt;/math&gt; converges to a constant &lt;math&gt;c\in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, the random-variable &lt;math&gt;\log_2{|H\cap C_m|/m}&lt;/math&gt; is concentrated near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications in probability theory ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a set on which a [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;\Pr&lt;/math&gt; is defined. 
Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (= a family of events).

Suppose we choose a set &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; elements of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;,
where each element is chosen at random according to the probability measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, independently of the others (i.e, with replacements). For each event &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;, we compare the following two quantities:
* Its relative frequency in &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt;, i.e, &lt;math&gt;|h\cap C_m|/m&lt;/math&gt;;
* Its probability &lt;math&gt;\Pr[h]&lt;/math&gt;.
We are interested in the difference, &lt;math&gt;D(h,C_m) := \big||h\cap C_m|/m - \Pr[h]\big|&lt;/math&gt;. This difference satisfies the following upper bound:
::&lt;math mode=display&gt;
\Pr\left[\forall h\in H: D(h,C_m) \leq 
\sqrt{8(\ln\operatorname{Growth}(H, 2m) + \ln(4/\delta)) \over m}
\right]
~~~~
&gt;
~~~~
1 - \delta
&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to:&lt;ref name=vc/&gt;{{rp|Th.2}}
::&lt;math mode=display&gt;
\Pr\big[\forall h\in H: D(h,C_m) \leq \varepsilon\big]
~~~~
&gt;
~~~~
1 - 4\cdot \operatorname{Growth}(H, 2m)\cdot \exp(-\varepsilon^2\cdot m/8)
&lt;/math&gt;
In words: the probability that for ''all'' events in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the relative-frequency is near the probability, is lower-bounded by an expression that depends on the growth-function of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

A corollary of this is that, iff the growth function is polynomial in &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (i.e, there exists some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Growth}(H,m)\leq m^n+1&lt;/math&gt;), then the above probability approaches 1 as &lt;math&gt;m\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. I.e, the family &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; enjoys [[uniform convergence in probability]].

'''The history of numerical weather prediction''' considers how current weather conditions as input into [[mathematical model]]s of the atmosphere and oceans to [[weather forecasting|predict the weather]] and future sea state (the process of [[numerical weather prediction]]) has changed over the years.  Though first attempted manually in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of the computer and [[computer simulation]] that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself.  [[ENIAC]] was used to create the first forecasts via computer in 1950, and over the years more powerful computers have been used to increase the size of initial datasets as well as include more complicated versions of the equations of motion.  The development of global forecasting models led to the first climate models.  The development of limited area (regional) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of [[tropical cyclone]] as well as [[air quality]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

Because the output of forecast models based on [[atmospheric dynamics]] requires corrections near ground level, [[model output statistics]] (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual ''forecast points'' (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to post-process the output of dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology.  This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases.  Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the [[forecast skill]] of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observations&amp;mdash;together with the [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the [[partial differential equation]]s used to calculate the forecast&amp;mdash;introduce errors which double every five days. The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the future than otherwise possible.

==Background==
Until the end of the 19th century, weather prediction was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 [[Cleveland Abbe]], founder of the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]], proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of [[thermodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamics]] that were studied in the previous century.&lt;ref name="Abbe MWR"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abbe|first=Cleveland|title=The Physical Basis of Long-Range Weather Forecasts|journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|date=December 1901|volume=29|issue=12|pages=551–61|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/029/mwr-029-12-0551c.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-23|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1901)29[551c:TPBOLW]2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1901MWRv...29..551A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a ''[[Diagnostic equation|diagnostic step]]'' is used to process data to generate [[initial condition]]s, which are then advanced in time by a ''[[Prognostic equation|prognostic step]]'' that solves the [[initial value problem]].&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Peter Lynch (meteorologist)|Lynch]]|first=Peter|title=The origins of computer weather prediction and climate modeling|journal=[[Journal of Computational Physics]]|date=2008-03-20|volume=227|issue=7|pages=3431–44|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2007.02.034|publisher=[[University of Miami]]|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/miskandarani/Courses/MPO662/Lynch,Peter/OriginsCompWF.JCP227.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-23|bibcode=2008JCoPh.227.3431L}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[density]], [[humidity]], and the three components of the [[flow velocity]] vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on [[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity]], [[conservation of momentum]], the [[first law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] [[laws of thermodynamics]], and the [[ideal gas law]] could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through [[numerical analysis|numerical methods]].&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Peter|title=The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85729-1|pages=1–27|chapter=Weather Prediction by Numerical Process}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics,&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt; these equations form the basis of the [[primitive equations]] used in present-day weather models.&lt;ref name="Primitive Eqs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Paul|title=Before 1955: Numerical Models and the Prehistory of AGCMs|url=http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/sloan/mainpage.html|work=Atmospheric General Circulation Modeling: A Participatory History|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic]] variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations,&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt; Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch1"/&gt; His forecast calculated that the change in [[atmospheric pressure|surface pressure]] would be {{convert|145|mbar|inHg|lk=on}}, an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt;

The first successful numerical prediction was performed using the [[ENIAC]] digital computer in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fjørtoft]], applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and computer programmer [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witman|first1=Sarah|title=Meet the Computer Scientist You Should Thank For Your Smartphone's Weather App|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/meet-computer-scientist-you-should-thank-your-phone-weather-app-180963716/|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=22 July 2017|language=en|date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Paul N.|title=A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262013925|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12080}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They used a simplified form of [[atmospheric dynamics]] based on solving the [[barotropic vorticity equation]] over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the [[geopotential height]] of the atmosphere's {{convert|500|mb|inHg}} pressure surface.&lt;ref name="Charney 1950"/&gt;  This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|page=208|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-38108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an "enormous scientific advance."&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt; The first calculations for a 24‑hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24&amp;nbsp;hours to produce,&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt; but Charney's group noted that most of that time was spent in "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.&lt;ref name="Charney 1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charney|first1=Jule|last2=Fjørtoft|first2=Ragnar|last3=von Neumann|first3=John|title=Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation|journal=Tellus|date=November 1950|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1950.tb00336.x|authorlink1=Jule Charney|authorlink2=Ragnar Fjørtoft|authorlink3=John von Neumann|bibcode=1950Tell....2..237C|pages=237–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
In September 1954, [[Carl-Gustav Rossby]] assembled an international group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) based on the barotropic equation.&lt;ref name="Harper BAMS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Kristine|author2=Uccellini, Louis W. |author3=Kalnay, Eugenia |author4=Carey, Kenneth |author5= Morone, Lauren |title=2007: 50th Anniversary of Operational Numerical Weather Prediction|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]]|date=May 2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=639–650|doi=10.1175/BAMS-88-5-639|bibcode=2007BAMS...88..639H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the [[U.S. Air Force]], [[U.S. Navy|Navy]], and [[U.S. Weather Bureau|Weather Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Institute of Physics|date=2008-03-25|url=http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ |title=Atmospheric General Circulation Modeling|accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325084036/http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer barotropic model, also developed by Charney.&lt;ref name="Shuman W&amp;F"/&gt;  It only modeled the atmosphere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Eug"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2001052687.pdf|pages=1–3, 18, 20|author=Kalnay, Eugenia|title=Atmospheric modeling, data assimilation and predictability|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|accessdate=2011-02-25|isbn=0-521-79179-0|author-link=Eugenia Kalnay}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates.&lt;ref name="Shuman W&amp;F"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Frederick G.|authorlink=Frederick Gale Shuman|title=History of Numerical Weather Prediction at the National Meteorological Center|journal=[[Weather and Forecasting]]|date=September 1989|volume=4|issue=3|pages=286–296|doi=10.1175/1520-0434(1989)004&lt;0286:HONWPA&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0434|bibcode=1989WtFor...4..286S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the [[thermal wind]] may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the [[Baroclinity|baroclinicity]] in the atmosphere can be simulated using the {{convert|500|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|1000|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[geopotential height]] surfaces and the average thermal wind between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gates|first1=W.

Later models used more complete equations for atmospheric dynamics and [[atmospheric thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. In 1959, Karl-Heinz Hinkelmann produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast, 37 years after Richardson's failed attempt. Hinkelmann did so by removing small oscillations from the numerical model during initialization. In 1966, [[West Germany]] and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977.&lt;ref name="Lynch JCP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leslie BOM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=L.M.|author2=Dietachmeyer, G.S.|title=Real-time limited area numerical weather prediction in Australia: a historical perspective|journal=Australian Meteorological Magazine|date=December 1992|volume=41|issue=SP|pages=61–77|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/1992/leslie2.pdf|accessdate=2011-01-03|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena. In the United States, [[solar radiation]] effects were added to the primitive equation model in 1967; moisture effects and [[heat of condensation|latent heat]] were added in 1968; and feedback effects from rain on [[convection]] were incorporated in 1971.  Three years later, the first global forecast model was introduced.&lt;ref name="Shuman W&amp;F"/&gt;  Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMXSpRwKNO8C&amp;pg=PA137|author=Stensrud, David J.|page=137|title=Parameterization schemes: keys to understanding numerical weather prediction models|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-86540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to involve [[sea surface temperature]] in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SV04AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38|pages=49–50|title=The Global Climate|author=Houghton, John Theodore|publisher=Cambridge University Press archive|year=1985|isbn=978-0-521-31256-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global forecast models==
[[File:Global Climate Model.png|thumb|280 px|right|Models use systems of [[differential equations]] based on the laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]], and use a coordinate system which divides the planet into a 3D grid.  [[Winds]], [[heat transfer]], [[radiation]], [[relative humidity]], and surface [[hydrology]] are calculated within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points.]]
A global forecast model is a weather forecasting model which initializes and forecasts the weather throughout the Earth's [[troposphere]].  It is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes.   Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the [[primitive equations]], used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations—along with the [[ideal gas law]]—are used to evolve the [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[potential temperature]] [[scalar field]]s and the [[flow velocity]] [[vector field]] of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other [[aerosol]]s are included in some primitive-equation high-resolution models as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equations used are [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods,&lt;ref name="finite"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SH8R_flZBGIC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165|title=Finite difference schemes and partial differential equations|author=Strikwerda, John C.|pages=165–170|year=2004|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-567-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of a few idealized cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions.  Different models use different solution methods: some global models and almost all regional models use [[finite difference method]]s for all three spatial dimensions, while other global models and a few regional models use [[spectral method]]s for the horizontal dimensions and  finite-difference methods in the vertical.&lt;ref name="finite"/&gt;

==Global climate models==
In 1956, [[Norman A. Phillips]] developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful [[climate model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Norman A.|title=The general circulation of the atmosphere: a numerical experiment|journal=Quarterly Journal of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]]|date=April 1956|volume=82|issue=352|pages=123–154|doi=10.1002/qj.49708235202|bibcode=1956QJRMS..82..123P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|page=210|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-38108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Phillips's work, several groups began working to create [[general circulation model]]s.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch10"/&gt; The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1980s, the United States' [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=William D. |title=Description of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0)|url=http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/description/description.pdf|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]|accessdate=2011-01-03|date=June 2004|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types, which led to more realistic forecasts.  For example, the Center for Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies (COLA) model showed a warm temperature bias of 2-4&amp;nbsp;°C (4-7&amp;nbsp;°F) and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect parameterization of crop and vegetation type across the central United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.geog.ucla.edu/~yxue/pdf/1996jgr.pdf |title=Impact of vegetation properties on U.

==Limited-area models==
The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire Earth, or ''regional'', covering only part of the Earth. Regional models (also known as ''limited-area'' models, or LAMs) allow for the use of finer (or smaller) grid spacing than global models.  The available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe.  This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model.  Regional models use a global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area.  Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RQ3dnjE8lgC&amp;pg=PA261|title=Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction|author=Warner, Thomas Tomkins |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-51389-0|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first operational regional model, the limited-area fine-mesh (LFM) model, was introduced in 1971.&lt;ref name="Shuman W&amp;F"/&gt;  Its development was halted, or frozen, in 1986.  The [[Nested Grid Model|NGM]] debuted in 1987 and was also used to create model output statistics for the United States.&lt;ref name="mdl"&gt;[http://www.weather.gov/mdl/synop/currngm.htm Explanation of Current NGM MOS]. National Weather Service Meteorological Development Lab (1999). Retrieved 2010-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its development was frozen in 1991.  The ETA model was implemented for the United States in 1993&lt;ref name="Eug"/&gt; and in turn was upgraded to the [[North American Mesoscale Model|NAM]] in 2006. The U.S. also offers the [[Rapid Refresh]] (which replaced the [[Rapid update cycle|RUC]] in 2012) for short-range and high-resolution applications; both the Rapid Refresh and NAM are built on the same framework, the [[Weather Research and Forecasting model|WRF]].

==Air quality models==
[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]
{{Main|Atmospheric dispersion modeling}}
The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C. H. and Pearson, J. L., "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Transactions of the Faraday Society, 32:1249, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation did not assume [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.  Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, O. G., "The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:257, 1947 and "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:426, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent [[Clean Air Act (United States)|environmental control regulations]], there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the '''Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes]]'''  The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of ''H'' which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus Δ''H'' (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

To determine Δ''H'', many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as "the Briggs equations." G. A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G. A., "A plume rise model compared with observations", Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, 15:433–438, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by Conservation of Clean Air and Water in Europe, he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas", Atmospheric Environment, 2:228–232, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade&lt;ref&gt;Slade, D. H. (editor), "Meteorology and atomic energy 1968", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models.  That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G. A., "Plume Rise", United States Army Environmental Command Critical Review Series, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as "the Briggs equations".  Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G. A., "Some recent analyses of plume rise observation", Proceedings of the Second International Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G. A., "Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings", Atmospheric Environment, 6:507–510, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urban Airshed Model, a regional forecast model for the effects of [[air pollution]] and [[acid rain]], was developed by a private company in the USA in 1970.  Development of this model was taken over by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and improved in the mid to late 1970s using results from a regional air pollution study.  While developed in [[California]], this model was later used in other areas of [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Air pollution modeling and its application VIII, Volume 8|author=Steyn, D.

==Ocean models==
The first [[wind wave model|ocean wave models]] were developed in the 1960s and 1970s.  These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions.  A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited the performance of the models.  After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions.  A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model [[swell (ocean)|swell]] nor depict [[wind wave|wind-driven waves]] (also known as wind waves) caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones.  This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh4410MzJ7cC&amp;pg=PA50|title=Dynamics and modelling of ocean waves|author=Komen, G. J., L. Cavaleri, M. Donelan|page=205|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57781-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u-CwzWN3Zg8C&amp;pg=PA320|page=320|title=Understanding the Oceans from Space: The Unique Applications of Satellite Oceanography |author=Robinson, Ian S.|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-3-540-24430-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this third generation of models, the spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography.  It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), [[wave shoaling]], [[refraction]], energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtOwfUG6cgC|title=Numerical modeling of water waves|author=Lin, Pengzhi|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41578-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean.  Along with dissipation of energy through [[Wind wave|whitecaps]] and [[resonance]] between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Leslie C.|title=Modification of the Physics and Numerics in a Third-Generation Ocean Wave Model|journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology]]|date=January 1996|volume=13|issue=3|pages=726|doi=10.1175/1520-0426(1996)013&lt;0726:MOTPAN&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode=1996JAtOT..13..726B|issn=1520-0426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model output statistics==
{{Main|Model output statistics}}
Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations.  These statistical models are collectively referred to as [[model output statistics]] (MOS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEMoIKX_0IC&amp;pg=PA188|page=189|title=When nature strikes: weather disasters and the law|author=Baum, Marsha L.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=978-0-275-22129-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were developed by the [[National Weather Service]] for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Model output statistics forecast guidance|author=Harry Hughes|publisher=United States Air Force Environmental Technical Applications Center|year=1976|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force]] developed its own set of MOS based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Air Weather Service Model Output Statistics Systems|author1=L. Best |author2=D. L. |author3=S. P. Pryor |year=1983|pages=1–90|publisher=Air Force Global Weather Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ensembles==
{{main|Ensemble forecasting}}
As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, it is impossible for long-range forecasts—those made more than two weeks in advance—to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of [[forecast skill|skill]], owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved.  Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=222–224|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-38108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere.  While a set of equations, known as the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equations]], exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers.&lt;ref name="HPCens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/ensembletraining|author=Manousos, Peter|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|date=2006-07-19|accessdate=2010-12-31|title=Ensemble Prediction Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about six days into the future.&lt;ref name="Klaus"&gt;Weickmann, Klaus, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith (2001-12-01).

Retrieved 2007-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Epstein (meteorologist)|Edward Epstein]] recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed a [[stochastic process|stochastic]] dynamic model that produced [[arithmetic mean|means]] and [[variance]]s for the state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=E.S.|title=Stochastic dynamic prediction|journal=Tellus|date=December 1969|volume=21|issue=6|pages=739–759|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1969.tb00483.x|bibcode=1969Tell...21..739E}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulations]] showed skill, in 1974 [[Cecil Leith]] revealed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble [[probability distribution]] was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leith|first=C.E.|title=Theoretical Skill of Monte Carlo Forecasts|journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|date=June 1974|volume=102|issue=6|pages=409–418|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1974)102&lt;0409:TSOMCF&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0493|bibcode=1974MWRv..102..409L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 1992 that [[Ensemble forecasting|ensemble forecasts]] began being prepared by the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]], the Canadian Meteorological Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/ens/NAEFS-pdf/ncep-pellerin.pdf|title=The Canadian ensemble prediction system (EPS)|author1=Houtekamer, Petere  |author2=Gérard Pellerin|publisher=[[Environmental Modeling Center]]|date=2004-11-12|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]].

This page gives some very general background to the mathematical idea of [[topos]]. This is an aspect of [[category theory]], and has a reputation for being abstruse. The level of abstraction involved cannot be reduced beyond a certain point; but on the other hand context can be given. This is partly in terms of historical development, but also to some extent an explanation of differing attitudes to category theory. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In the school of Grothendieck==
During the latter part of the 1950s, the foundations of [[algebraic geometry]] were being rewritten; and it is here that the origins of the '''topos''' concept are to be found. At that time the [[Weil conjectures]] were an outstanding motivation to research. As we now know, the route towards their proof, and other advances, lay in the construction of [[étale cohomology]].

With the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that algebraic geometry had been wrestling with two problems for a long time. The first was to do with its '''''points''''': back in the days of [[projective geometry]] it was clear that the absence of 'enough' points on an [[algebraic variety]] was a barrier to having a good geometric theory (in which it was somewhat like a [[Compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]). There was also the difficulty, that was clear as soon as [[topology]] took form in the first half of the twentieth century, that the topology of algebraic varieties had 'too few' open sets. 

The question of points was close to resolution by 1950; [[Alexander Grothendieck]] took a sweeping step (invoking the [[Yoneda lemma]]) that disposed of it &amp;mdash; naturally at a cost, that every variety or more general ''[[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]'' should become a [[functor]]. It wasn't possible to ''add'' open sets, though. The way forward was otherwise.

The topos definition first appeared somewhat obliquely, in or about 1960. General problems of so-called '[[descent (category theory)|descent]]' in algebraic geometry were considered, at the same period when the [[fundamental group]] was generalised to the algebraic geometry setting (as a [[pro-finite group]]). In the light of later work (c. 1970), 'descent' is part of the theory of [[comonad]]s; here we can see one way in which the Grothendieck school bifurcates in its approach from the 'pure' category theorists, a theme that is important for the understanding of how the topos concept was later treated.

There was perhaps a more direct route available: the [[abelian category]] concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on [[homological algebra]], to unify categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups, and of [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. An abelian category is supposed to be closed under certain category-theoretic operations &amp;mdash; by using this kind of definition one can focus entirely on [[structure (category theory)|structure]], saying nothing at all about the nature of the objects involved. This type of definition can be traced back, in one line, to the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] concept of the 1930s. It was a possible question to ask, around 1957, for a purely category-theoretic characterisation of categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of ''sets'', the case of sheaves of abelian groups having been subsumed by Grothendieck's work (the [[Tohoku paper|''Tohoku'' paper]]).

Such a definition of a topos was eventually given five years later, around 1962, by Grothendieck and [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]] (see Verdier's Bourbaki seminar ''Analysis Situs''). The characterisation was by means of categories 'with enough [[colimit]]s', and applied to what is now called a [[Grothendieck topos]]. The theory was rounded out by establishing that a Grothendieck topos was a category of sheaves, where now the word ''sheaf'' had acquired an extended meaning, since it involved a [[Grothendieck topology]].

The idea of a Grothendieck topology (also known as a ''site'') has been characterised by [[John Tate]] as a bold pun on the two senses of [[Riemann surface]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Technically speaking it enabled the construction of the sought-after étale cohomology (as well as other refined theories such as [[flat cohomology]] and [[crystalline cohomology]]). At this point &amp;mdash; about 1964 &amp;mdash; the developments powered by algebraic geometry had largely run their course. The 'open set' discussion had effectively been summed up in the conclusion that varieties had a rich enough ''site'' of open sets in [[Ramification (mathematics)|unramified]] covers of their (ordinary) [[Zariski topology|Zariski-open sets]].

==From pure category theory to categorical logic==
{{See|categorical logic}}

The current definition of [[topos]] goes back to [[William Lawvere]] and Myles Tierney. While the timing follows closely on from that described above, as a matter of history, the attitude is different, and the definition is more inclusive. That is, there are examples of '''toposes''' that are not '''Grothendieck topos'''. What is more, these may be of interest for a number of logical disciplines.

Lawvere and Tierney's definition picks out the central role in topos theory of the '''[[sub-object classifier]]'''. In the usual category of sets, this is the two-element set of Boolean [[truth-value]]s, '''true''' and '''false'''. It is almost tautologous to say that the subsets of a given set ''X'' are ''the same as'' (just as good as) the functions on ''X'' to any such given two-element set: fix the 'first' element and make a subset ''Y'' correspond to the function sending ''Y'' there and its complement in ''X'' to the other element.

Now sub-object classifiers can be found in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory. Still tautologously, though certainly more abstractly, for a [[topological space]] ''X'' there is a direct description of a sheaf on ''X'' that plays the role with respect to all sheaves of sets on ''X''. Its set of sections over an open set ''U'' of ''X'' is just the set of open subsets of ''U''. The [[sheaf (mathematics)|space associated with a sheaf]], for it, is more difficult to describe.

Lawvere and Tierney therefore formulated '''axioms for a topos''' that assumed a sub-object classifier, and some limit conditions (to make a [[cartesian-closed category]], at least). For a while this notion of topos was called 'elementary topos'.

Once the idea of a connection with logic was formulated, there were several developments 'testing' the new theory:

* models of set theory corresponding to proofs of the independence of the [[axiom of choice]] and [[continuum hypothesis]] by Cohen's method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]].
* recognition of the connection with [[Kripke semantics]], the [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[existential quantifier]] and [[intuitionistic type theory]].
* combining these, discussion of the [[intuitionistic theory of real numbers]], by sheaf models.

==Position of topos theory==
There was some irony that in the pushing through of [[David Hilbert]]'s long-range programme a natural home for [[intuitionistic logic]]'s central ideas was found: Hilbert had detested the school of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. Existence as 'local' existence in the sheaf-theoretic sense, now going by the name of [[Kripke–Joyal semantics]], is a good match. On the other hand Brouwer's long efforts on 'species', as he called the intuitionistic theory of reals, are presumably in some way subsumed and deprived of status beyond the historical. There is a theory of the real numbers in each topos, and so no one master intuitionist theory.

The later work on [[étale cohomology]] has tended to suggest that the full, general topos theory isn't required. On the other hand, other sites are used, and the Grothendieck topos has taken its place within homological algebra.

The Lawvere programme was to write higher-order logic in terms of category theory. That this can be done cleanly is shown by the book treatment by [[Joachim Lambek]] and [[P. J. Scott]]. What results is essentially an intuitionistic (i.e. [[constructive logic]]) theory, its content being clarified by the existence of a ''free topos''. That is a set theory, in a broad sense, but also something belonging to the realm of pure [[syntax]]. The structure on its sub-object classifier is that of a [[Heyting algebra]]. To get a more classical set theory one can look at toposes in which it is moreover a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], or specialising even further, at those with just two truth-values.  In that book, the talk is about [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]; but in fact this can be read as foundational [[computer science]] (which is not mentioned). If one wants to discuss set-theoretic operations, such as the formation of the image (range) of a function, a topos is guaranteed to be able to express this, entirely constructively.

It also produced a more accessible spin-off in [[pointless topology]], where the ''locale'' concept isolates some of more accessible insights found by treating ''topos'' as a significant development of ''topological space''. The slogan is 'points come later': this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone's ''Stone Spaces'', which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science 'a treatise on [[extensionality]]'. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient - it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped [[lambda calculus]] have been met in [[denotational semantics]]. Topos theory has long looked like a possible 'master theory' in this area.

==Summary==
The ''topos'' concept arose in algebraic geometry, as a consequence of combining the concept of ''sheaf'' and ''closure under categorical operations''. It plays a certain definite role in cohomology theories.

The subsequent developments associated with logic are more interdisciplinary. They include examples drawing on [[homotopy theory]] ([[classifying topos]]es). They involve links between category theory and mathematical logic, and also (as a high-level, organisational discussion) between category theory and theoretical computer science based on [[type theory]]. Granted the general view of [[Saunders Mac Lane]] about ''ubiquity'' of concepts, this gives them a definite status. A 'killer application' is [[étale cohomology]].

In mathematics, a '''Hodge–Tate module''' is an analogue of a [[Hodge structure]] over [[p-adic field]]s. {{harvs|txt|last=Serre|year=1967}} introduced and named Hodge–Tate structures using the results of {{harvs|txt|last=Tate|authorlink=John Tate|year=1967}} on [[p-divisible group]]s.

==Definition==

Suppose that ''G'' is the [[absolute Galois group]] of a ''p''-adic field ''K''. Then ''G'' has a canonical [[cyclotomic character]] χ given by its action on the ''p''th power [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. Let ''C'' be the completion of the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K''. Then a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over ''C'' with a semi-linear action of the [[Galois group]] ''G'' is said to be of '''Hodge–Tate type''' if it is generated by the eigenvectors of integral powers of χ.

'''Karl Mahlburg''' is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] whose research interests lie in the areas of [[modular form]]s, partitions, [[combinatorics]] and [[number theory]].

He submitted a paper to [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] (PNAS) entitled [[Partition Congruences and the Andrews-Garvan-Dyson Crank]] in 2005, and the paper won the PNAS first Paper of the Year prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=03282006 | title= PNAS Paper of the Year| accessdate=17 July 2006 | date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper extends a result first conjectured by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and later detailed by [[Freeman Dyson]], [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]], [[Frank Garvan]], and Mahlburg's advisor [[Ken Ono]] called the crank having to do with congruence patterns in [[Integer partition|partitions]].  Until recently such congruence patterns were only known to occur for 5, 7, and 11.  Mahlburg's result extends this to all [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7180 | title= Classic maths puzzle cracked at last | work=New Scientist | date=21 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahlburg was an undergraduate at [[Harvey Mudd College]], where he graduated with highest distinction in 2001 with a B.S. in Mathematics. In 2006, he graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a Ph.D. in Mathematics. He is currently on the mathematics faculty at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7848">'''Metadata modeling''' is a type of [[metamodeling]] used in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]] for the analysis and construction of models applicable to and useful for some predefined class of problems.

Meta-modeling is the analysis, construction and development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and theories applicable and useful for the modeling in a predefined class of problems. 

The meta-data side of the diagram consists of a concept diagram. This is basically an adjusted class diagram as described in Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson (1999). Important notions are concept, generalization, association, multiplicity and aggregation.

== Metadatamodeling Concepts==
[[File:Metadata modeling - STANDARD, OPEN and CLOSED CONCEPTS.gif|thumb|Fig.1 STANDARD, OPEN and CLOSED CONCEPTS]]
[[Image:Mm32.gif|thumb|Fig.2 Example of STANDARD, OPEN and CLOSED CONCEPTS]]
First of all, a concept is a simple version of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class. The class definition&lt;ref&gt; Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; is adopted to define a concept, namely: a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relations, and semantics.

The following concept types are specified:

* STANDARD CONCEPT: a concept that contains no further (sub) concepts. A standard concept is visualized with a rectangle.
* COMPLEX CONCEPT: a concept that consists of a collection of (sub) concepts. Complex concepts are divided into:
* OPEN CONCEPT: a complex concept whose (sub) concepts are expanded. An open concept is visualized with two white rectangles above each other. (Correction: An open concept is visualized with 2 white rectangles, 1 overlaid over the other, offset to the right, with 3 corners of the rectangle beneath visible. )
* CLOSED CONCEPT: a complex concept whose (sub) concepts are not expanded since it is not relevant in the specific context. A closed concept is visualized by a white rectangle above a black rectangle.

In Figure 1 the three concept types that are used in the modeling technique are illustrated. Concepts are always capitalized, not only in the diagram, but also when referring to them outside the diagram.

In Figure 2 all three concept types are exemplified. Part of the [[process-data diagram]] of the requirements workflow in the Unified Process is illustrated. The USE CASE MODEL is an open concept and consists of one or more ACTORS and one or more USE CASES. ACTOR is a standard concept, it contains no further sub-concepts. USE CASE, however, is a closed concept. A USE CASE consists of a description, a flow of events, conditions, special requirements, etc. Because in this case it is unnecessary to reveal that information, the USE CASE is illustrated with a closed concept.

=== Generalization ===
[[Image:Mm33r.gif|thumb|Fig.3 Generalization]]
[[Image:Mm34.gif|thumb|Fig. Example generalization]]
Generalization is a way to express a relationship between a general concept and a more specific concept. Also, if necessary, one can indicate whether the groups of concepts that are identified are overlapping or disjoint, complete or incomplete. Generalization is visualized by a solid arrow with an open arrowhead, pointing to the parent, as is illustrated in Figure 3.

In Figure 4 generalization is exemplified by showing the relationships between the different concepts described in the preceding paragraph. STANDARD CONCEPT and COMPLEX CONCEPT are both a specific kind of CONCEPT. Subsequently, a COMPLEX CONCEPT can be specified into an OPEN CONCEPT and a CLOSED CONCEPT.

=== Association ===
[[Image:Mm33.gif|thumb|Fig.5 Association]]
An association is a structural relationship that specifies how concepts are connected to another. It can connect two concepts (binary association) or more than two concepts (n-ary association). An association is represented with an undirected solid line. To give a meaning to the association, a name and name direction can be provided. The name is in the form of an active verb and the name direction is represented by a triangle that points in the direction one needs to read. Association with a name and name direction is illustrated in Figure 5.

In Figure 6 (removed) an example of association is illustrated. The example is a fragment of the process-data diagram of the requirements analysis in the Unified Process. Because both concepts are not expanded any further, although several sub concepts exist, the concepts are illustrated as closed concepts. The figure reads as “SURVEY DESCRIPTION describes USE CASE MODEL”.

=== Multiplicity ===
[[Image:Mm37.gif|thumb|Fig.7 Multiplicity]]
[[Image:Mm38.gif|thumb|Fig.8 Example multiplicity]]
Except name and name direction, an association can have more characteristics. With [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] one can state how many objects of a certain concept can be connected across an instance of an association. Multiplicity is visualized by using the following expressions: (1) for exactly one, (0..1) for one or zero, (0..*) for zero or more, (1..*) for one or more, or for example (5) for an exact number. In Figure 7 association with multiplicity is illustrated.

An example of multiplicity is represented in Figure 8. It is the same example as in Figure 6, only the multiplicity values are added. The figure reads as ‘exactly one SURVEY DESCRIPTION describes exactly one USE CASE MODEL’. This implies that a SURVEY DESCRIPTION cannot describe zero or more than one USE CASE MODEL and a USE CASE MODEL cannot be described by zero or more than one SURVEY DESCRIPTIONS.

=== Aggregation ===
[[Image:Mm39.gif|thumb|left|Fig.9 Aggregation]]
[[Image:Mm310.gif|thumb|Fig.10 Example aggregation]]
A special type of association is aggregation. Aggregation represents the relation between a concept (as a whole) containing other concepts (as parts). It can also be described as a ‘has-a’ relationship. In Figure 9 an aggregation relationship between OPEN CONCEPT and STANDARD CONCEPT is illustrated. An OPEN CONCEPT consists of one or more STANDARD CONCEPTS and a STANDARD CONCEPT is part of zero or more OPEN CONCEPT.

In Figure 10 aggregation is exemplified by a fragment of the requirements capture workflow in UML-Based Web Engineering. A USE CASE MODEL consists of one or more ACTORS and USE CASES.

=== Properties ===
[[Image:Mm311.gif|thumb|left|Fig.11 Aggregation]]
[[Image:Mm312.gif|thumb|Fig.12 Example aggregation]]
Sometimes the needs exist to assign properties to concepts. Properties are written in lower case, under the concept name, as is illustrated in Figure 11.

In Figure 12 an example of a concept with properties is visualized. The concept FEATURE has four properties, respectively: priority, type, risk and status.

In Table 1 a list presented Each CONCEPT requires a proper definition which is preferably copied from a standard glossary. All CONCEPT names in the text are with capital characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10187">[[image:Great Britain Box.svg|thumb|450px|Estimating the box-counting dimension of the coast of Great Britain]]
In [[fractal geometry]], the '''Minkowski–Bouligand dimension''', also known as '''Minkowski dimension''' or '''box-counting dimension''', is a way of determining the [[fractal dimension]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' in a [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, or more generally in a [[metric space]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d''). It is named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Hermann Minkowski]] and the [[France|French]] mathematician [[Georges Bouligand]].

To calculate this dimension for a fractal ''S'', imagine this fractal lying on an evenly spaced grid, and count how many boxes are required to [[cover (topology)|cover]] the set.  The box-counting dimension is calculated by seeing how this number changes as we make the grid finer by applying a [[box counting|box-counting]] algorithm.

Suppose that ''N''(''ε'') is the number of boxes of side length ε required to cover the set.  Then the box-counting dimension is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_{\rm box}(S) := \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac {\log N(\varepsilon)}{\log (1/\varepsilon)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Roughly speaking, this means the dimension is the exponent ''d'' such that ''N''(1/''n'') &amp;asymp; ''C n&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'', which is what one would expect in the trivial case where ''S'' is a smooth space (a manifold) of integer dimension d.

If the above [[limit of a function|limit]] does not exist, one may still take the [[limit superior and limit inferior]], which respectively define the '''upper box dimension''' and '''lower box dimension'''. The upper box dimension is sometimes called the '''entropy dimension''', '''Kolmogorov dimension''', '''Kolmogorov capacity''', '''limit capacity''' or '''upper Minkowski dimension''', while the lower box dimension is also called the '''lower Minkowski dimension'''.

The upper and lower box dimensions are strongly related to the more popular [[Hausdorff dimension]]. Only in very special applications is it important to distinguish between the three (see [[#Relations to the Hausdorff dimension|below]]). Yet another measure of fractal dimension is the [[correlation dimension]].

== Alternative definitions ==
[[image:Great Britain coverings.svg|thumb|350px|Examples of ball packing, ball covering, and box covering.]]
It is possible to define the box dimensions using balls, with either the [[covering number]] or the packing number. The covering number &lt;math&gt;N_{\rm covering}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''minimal'' number of [[open ball]]s of radius ε required to [[cover (topology)|cover]] the fractal, or in other words, such that their union contains the fractal. We can also
consider the intrinsic covering number &lt;math&gt;N'_{\rm covering}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined the same way but with the additional requirement that the centers of the open balls lie inside the set ''S''.  The packing number &lt;math&gt;N_{\rm packing}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''maximal'' number of [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] open balls of radius ε one can situate such that their centers would be inside the fractal. While ''N'', ''N''&lt;sub&gt;covering&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''N'''&lt;sub&gt;covering&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;packing&lt;/sub&gt; are not exactly identical, they are closely related, and give rise to identical definitions of the upper and lower box dimensions. This is easy to prove once the following inequalities are proven:

:&lt;math&gt; N_\text{packing}(\varepsilon) \leq N'_\text{covering}(\varepsilon) \leq N_\text{covering}(\varepsilon/2). \, &lt;/math&gt;

These, in turn, follow with a little effort from the [[triangle inequality]].

The advantage of using balls rather than squares is that this definition generalizes to any [[metric space]]. In other words, the box definition is [[Differential_geometry#Intrinsic_versus_extrinsic|extrinsic]] &amp;mdash; one assumes the fractal space ''S'' is contained in a [[Euclidean space]], and defines boxes according to the external geometry of the containing space. However, the dimension of ''S'' should be [[Differential_geometry#Intrinsic_versus_extrinsic|intrinsic]], independent of the environment into which ''S'' is placed, and the ball definition can be formulated intrinsically. One defines an internal ball as all points of ''S'' within a certain distance of a chosen center, and one counts such balls to get the dimension. (More precisely, the ''N''&lt;sub&gt;covering&lt;/sub&gt; definition is extrinsic, but the other two are intrinsic.)

The advantage of using boxes is that in many cases ''N''(''&amp;epsilon;'') may be easily calculated explicitly, and that for boxes the covering and packing numbers (defined in an equivalent way) are equal.

The [[logarithm]] of the packing and covering numbers are sometimes referred to as ''entropy numbers'', and are somewhat analogous to the concepts of [[entropy|thermodynamic entropy]] and [[entropy (information theory)|information-theoretic entropy]], in that they measure the amount of "disorder" in the metric space or fractal at scale ''&amp;epsilon;'', and also measure how many bits or digits one would need to specify a point of the space to accuracy ''&amp;epsilon;''.

Another equivalent (extrinsic) definition for the box-counting dimension, is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_\text{box}(S) = n - \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{\log \text{vol}(S_r)}{\log r},&lt;/math&gt;

where for each ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the set &lt;math&gt;S_r&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the ''r''-neighborhood of ''S'', i.e. the set of all points in &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; which are at distance less than ''r'' from ''S'' (or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;S_r&lt;/math&gt; is the union of all the open balls of radius ''r'' which are centered at a point in&amp;nbsp;''S'').

== Properties ==
Both box dimensions are finitely additive, i.e. if { ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, .... ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } is a finite collection of sets then

:&lt;math&gt;\dim (A_1 \cup \dotsb \cup A_n) = \max \{ \dim A_1 ,\dots, \dim A_n \}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

However, they are not [[countable set|countably]] additive, i.e. this equality does not hold for an ''infinite'' sequence of sets. For example, the box dimension of a single point is 0, but the box dimension of the collection of [[rational number]]s in the interval [0, 1] has dimension 1. The [[Hausdorff measure]] by comparison, is countably additive.

An interesting property of the upper box dimension not shared with either the lower box dimension or the Hausdorff dimension is the connection to set addition. If ''A'' and ''B'' are two sets in a Euclidean space then ''A'' + ''B'' is formed by taking all the pairs of points ''a,b'' where ''a'' is from ''A'' and ''b'' is from ''B'' and adding ''a+b''. One has

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_\text{upper box}(A+B)\leq \dim_\text{upper box}(A)+\dim_\text{upper box}(B).&lt;/math&gt;

== Relations to the Hausdorff dimension ==
The box-counting dimension is one of a number of definitions for dimension that can be applied to fractals.  For many well behaved fractals all these dimensions are equal; in particular, these dimensions coincide whenever the fractal satisfies the [[Hausdorff dimension#The open set condition|open set condition (OSC)]].&lt;ref name=Wagon214&gt;{{cite book | title=Mathematica® in Action: Problem Solving Through Visualization and Computation | first=Stan | last=Wagon | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2010 | isbn=0-387-75477-6 | page=214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], lower box dimension, and upper box dimension of the [[Cantor set]] are all equal to log(2)/log(3).  However, the definitions are not equivalent.

The box dimensions and the Hausdorff dimension are related by the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_{\operatorname{Haus}} \leq  \dim_{\operatorname{lower box}} \leq \dim_{\operatorname{upper box}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general both inequalities may be [[strict inequality|strict]]. The upper box dimension may be bigger than the lower box dimension if the fractal has different behaviour in different scales. For example, examine the set of numbers in the interval [0,1] satisfying the condition

:for any ''n'', all the digits between the 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-th digit and the (2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)th digit are zero

The digits in the "odd place-intervals", i.e. between digits 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are not restricted and may take any value. This fractal has upper box dimension 2/3 and lower box dimension 1/3, a fact which may be easily verified by calculating ''N''(''ε'') for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=10^{-2^n}&lt;/math&gt; and noting that their values behave differently for ''n'' even and odd.

More examples: The set of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, a countable set with &lt;math&gt;\dim_{\operatorname{Haus}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, has &lt;math&gt;\dim_{\operatorname{box}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; because its closure, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, has dimension 1. In fact, 

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\operatorname{box}}  \left\{0,1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots\right\} = \frac{1}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

These examples show that adding a countable set can change box-dimension, showing a kind of instability of this dimension.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">A '''mixed graph''' ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'', ''A'') is a mathematical object consisting of a set of vertices (or [[node (graph theory)|nodes]]) ''V'', a set of (undirected) [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] ''E'', and a set of directed edges (or arcs) ''A''.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung"&gt;{{harvtxt|Beck|Blado|Crawford|Jean-Louis|2013|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and Notation==
{{further|Graph (discrete mathematics)}}
[[File:Mixed Graph Example.jpg|thumbnail|Example of mixed graph]]
Consider adjacent vertices &lt;math&gt;u,v \in V&lt;/math&gt;. A '''directed edge''', called an '''arc''', is an edge with an orientation and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{uv}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the tail and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the head of the arc).&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ries|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, an '''undirected edge''', or '''edge''', is an edge with no orientation and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;[u,v]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ries" /&gt; 

{{further|Multiple edges}} {{further|Loop (graph theory)}}
For the purpose of our application example we will not be considering loops or multiple edges of mixed graphs. 

A cycle of a mixed graph, or '''mixed cycle''', is formed if the directed edges of the mixed graph form a cycle.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt; An orientation of a mixed graph is considered '''acyclic''' if cycles cannot be formed from the directed edges.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt; We call a mixed graph acyclic if all of its orientations are acyclic.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt;

==Coloring==
{{further|Graph coloring}}

[[File:ColoredMixed.png|thumbnail|Example of mixed graph]]

Mixed graph coloring can be thought of as a labeling or an assignment of {{mvar|k}} different colors  (where {{mvar|k}} is a positive integer) to the vertices of a mixed graph.&lt;ref name="HansenKuplinskydeWerra"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kuplinsky|de Werra|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different colors must be assigned to vertices that are connected by an edge. The colors may be represented by the numbers from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|k}}, and for a directed arc, the tail of the arc must be colored by a smaller number than the head of the arc.&lt;ref name="HansenKuplinskydeWerra" /&gt;

===Example===
For example, consider the figure to the right. Our available k-colors to color our mixed graph are &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge, they must receive different colors or labelings (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are labelled 1 and 2, respectively). We also have an arc from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Since orientation assigns an ordering, we must label the tail (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) with a smaller color (or integer from our set) than the head (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) of our arc.

===Strong and weak coloring===
A '''(strong) proper ''k''-coloring''' of a mixed graph is a function

&lt;math&gt;c : V \rightarrow [k] &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; [k] := {1,2, \dots , k} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c(u) \neq c(v)&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;uv \in E &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c(u) &lt; c(v) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{uv} \in A &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt; 

A weaker condition on our arcs can be applied and we can consider a '''weak proper ''k''-coloring''' of a mixed graph to be a function

&lt;math&gt;c : V \rightarrow [k] &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; [k] := {1,2, \dots , k} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c(u) \neq c(v)&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;uv \in E &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c(u) \leq c(v) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{uv} \in A &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt; 
Referring back to our example, this means that we can label both the head and tail of &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; with the positive integer 2.

===Existence===
A coloring may or may not exist for a mixed graph. In order for a mixed graph to have a k-coloring, the graph cannot contain any directed cycles.&lt;ref name="Ries" /&gt; If such a k-coloring exists, then we refer to the smallest k needed in order to properly color our graph as the '''chromatic number''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\chi(G)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ries" /&gt; We can count the number of proper k-colorings as a polynomial function of k. This is called the '''chromatic polynomial''' of our graph G (by analogy with the [[chromatic polynomial]] of undirected graphs) and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung" /&gt;

===Computing weak chromatic polynomials===
The [[Tutte polynomial#deletion–contraction|deletion–contraction method]] can be used to compute weak chromatic polynomials of mixed graphs. This method involves deleting (or removing) an edge or arc and contracting (or joining) the remaining vertices incident to that edge (or arc) to form one vertex.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_a"&gt;{{harvtxt|Beck|Blado|Crawford|Jean-Louis|2013|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deleting an edge, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, from a mixed graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E,A)&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the mixed graph &lt;math&gt;(V, E-e, A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_a" /&gt; We can denote this deletion of the edge, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;G-e&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, by deleting an arc, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, from a mixed graph, we obtain &lt;math&gt;(V, E, A-a)&lt;/math&gt; where we can denote the deletion of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;G-a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_a" /&gt; Also, we can denote the contraction of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;G/e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G/a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_a" /&gt; From Propositions given in,&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_a" /&gt; we obtain the following equations to compute the chromatic polynomial of a mixed graph:
# &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(k) = \chi_{G-e}(k) - \chi_{G/e}(k)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_b"&gt;{{harvtxt|Beck|Blado|Crawford|Jean-Louis|2013|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(k) = \chi_{G-a}(k) + \chi_{G/a}(k) - \chi_{G_a}(k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BeckBladoCrawfordJeanLouisYoung_b" /&gt;

==Applications==
===Scheduling problem===
{{main|Disjunctive graph}}
Mixed graphs may be used to model [[job shop scheduling]] problems in which a collection of tasks is to be performed, subject to certain timing constraints. In this sort of problem, undirected edges may be used to model a constraint that two tasks are incompatible (they cannot be performed simultaneously). Directed edges may be used to model precedence constraints, in which one task must be performed before another. A graph defined in this way from a scheduling problem is called a [[disjunctive graph]]. The mixed graph coloring problem can be used to find a schedule of minimum length for performing all the tasks.&lt;ref name="Ries" /&gt;

===Bayesian inference===
Mixed graphs are also used as [[graphical model]]s for [[Bayesian inference]]. In this context, an acyclic mixed graph (one with no cycles of directed edges) is also called a '''chain graph'''. The directed edges of these graphs are used to indicate a causal connection between two events, in which the outcome of the first event influences the probability of the second event. Undirected edges, instead, indicate a non-causal correlation between two events. A connected component of the undirected subgraph of a chain graph is called a chain. A chain graph may be transformed into an undirected graph by constructing its [[moral graph]], an undirected graph formed from the chain graph by adding undirected edges between pairs of vertices that have outgoing edges to the same chain, and then forgetting the orientations of the directed edges.{{sfnp|Cowell|Dawid|Lauritzen|Spiegelhalter|1999}}

'''Perlin noise''' is a type of [[gradient noise]] developed by [[Ken Perlin]] in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of [[computer-generated imagery|computer graphics]] at the time.&lt;ref name="ken_powerpoint"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/| title= Making Noise| first= Ken| last= Perlin | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232627/http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/| deadurl= yes | archive-date= March 3, 2016| website= noisemachine.com| publisher= Ken Perlin| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally described his findings in a [[SIGGRAPH]] paper in 1985 called ''An image Synthesizer''.&lt;ref name="Perlin:1985:IS:325165.325247"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perlin|first1=Ken|title=An Image Synthesizer|journal=SIGGRAPH Comput.

Perlin did not apply for any patents on the algorithm, but in 2001 he was granted a patent for the use of 3D+ implementations of [[simplex noise]] for [[texture synthesis]]. Simplex noise has the same purpose, but uses a simpler space-filling grid. Simplex noise alleviates some of the problems with Perlin's "classic noise", among them computational complexity and visually-significant directional artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6867776 |status=patent |title=Standard for perlin noise |pubdate= |gdate=2005-03-15 |fdate=2001-01-10 |pridate=2001-01-10 |inventor= Kenneth Perlin |invent1= |invent2= |assign1=Kenneth Perlin  |assign2=Wsou Investments LLC |class=G06T11/001  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Perlin.png|thumb|128px|Perlin noise rescaled and added into itself to create [[fractal noise]].]]
Perlin noise is a [[Procedural generation|procedural]] [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]] primitive, a type of [[gradient noise]] used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in [[computer graphics]]. The function has a [[pseudo-random]] appearance, yet all of its visual details are the same size. This property allows it to be readily controllable; multiple scaled copies of Perlin noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a great variety of [[procedural texture]]s. Synthetic textures using Perlin noise are often used in [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to make computer-generated visual elements – such as object surfaces, fire, smoke, or clouds – appear more natural, by imitating the controlled random appearance of textures in nature.

It is also frequently used to generate textures when memory is extremely limited, such as in [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]], and is increasingly finding use in [[graphics processing unit]]s for [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time graphics]] in [[computer game]]s.

==Development==
Perlin noise resulted from the work of [[Ken Perlin]], who developed it at [[Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.]] (MAGI) for [[Disney]]'s [[computer animated]] [[sci-fi]] motion picture ''[[Tron]]'' (1982). In 1997, he won an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for this contribution to CGI.&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, Phillip. ''Macromedia Flash 8 @work: Projects and Techniques to Get the Job Done.'' Sams Publishing. 2006. {{ISBN|9780672328282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm detail==
Perlin noise is most commonly implemented as a two-, three- or four-dimensional [[function (mathematics)|function]], but can be defined for any number of dimensions.  An implementation typically involves three steps: grid definition with random gradient vectors, computation of the [[dot product]] between the distance-gradient vectors and interpolation between these values.

===Grid definition===

Define an ''n''-dimensional grid where each point has a random ''n''-dimensional unit-length gradient vector, except in the one dimensional case where the gradients are random scalars between -1 and 1.

Assigning the random gradients in one and two dimensions is trivial using a [[random number generator]].  For higher dimensions a Monte Carlo approach can be used&lt;ref name="ken_powerpoint"/&gt; where random Cartesian coordinates are chosen in a unit cube, points falling outside the unit ball are discarded, and the remaining points are normalized to lie on the unit sphere. The process is continued until the required number of random gradients are obtained.

In order to negate the expensive process of computing new gradients for each grid node, some implementations use a [[Hash table|hash and lookup table]] for a finite number of precomputed gradient vectors.&lt;ref name="libnoise"&gt;[http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html libnoise]&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of a hash also permits the inclusion of a random seed where multiple instances of Perlin noise are required.

===Dot product===

Given an ''n''-dimensional argument for the noise function, the next step in the algorithm is to determine into which grid cell the given point falls.  For each corner node of that cell, the distance vector between the point and the node is determined.  The [[dot product]] between the gradient vector at the node and the distance vector is then computed.

For a point in a two-dimensional grid, this will require the computation of 4 distance vectors and dot products, while in three dimensions 8 distance vectors and 8 dot products are needed.  This leads to the &lt;math&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity scaling.

===Interpolation===

The final step is interpolation between the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; dot products computed at the nodes of the cell containing the argument point. This has the consequence that the noise function returns 0 when evaluated at the grid nodes themselves.

Interpolation is performed using a function that has zero first [[derivative]] (and possibly also second derivative) at the  &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; grid nodes. This has the effect that the [[gradient]] of the resulting noise function at each grid node coincides with the precomputed random gradient vector there. If &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, an example of a function that interpolates between value &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; at grid node 0 and value &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; at grid node 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \operatorname{smoothstep}(x)\cdot(a_1-a_0) \ \ \text{for }0\leq x\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[smoothstep]] function was used.

Noise functions for use in computer graphics typically produce values in the range [-1.0,1.0].  In order to produce Perlin noise in this range, the interpolated value may need to be scaled by some scaling factor.&lt;ref name="libnoise"/&gt;

==Implementation==

The following is a two-dimensional implementation of Classical Perlin Noise, written in C++.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
// Function to linearly interpolate between a0 and a1
// Weight w should be in the range [0.0, 1.0]
float lerp(float a0, float a1, float w) {
    return (1.0 - w)*a0 + w*a1;

    // as an alternative, this slightly faster equivalent formula can be used:
    // return a0 + w*(a1 - a0);
}

// Computes the dot product of the distance and gradient vectors.
float dotGridGradient(int ix, int iy, float x, float y) {

    // Precomputed (or otherwise) gradient vectors at each grid node
    extern float Gradient[IYMAX][IXMAX][2];

    // Compute the distance vector
    float dx = x - (float)ix;
    float dy = y - (float)iy;

    // Compute the dot-product
    return (dx*Gradient[iy][ix][0] + dy*Gradient[iy][ix][1]);
}

// Compute Perlin noise at coordinates x, y
float perlin(float x, float y) {

    // Determine grid cell coordinates
    int x0 = int(x);
    int x1 = x0 + 1;
    int y0 = int(y);
    int y1 = y0 + 1;

    // Determine interpolation weights
    // Could also use higher order polynomial/s-curve here
    float sx = x - (float)x0;
    float sy = y - (float)y0;

    // Interpolate between grid point gradients
    float n0, n1, ix0, ix1, value;
    n0 = dotGridGradient(x0, y0, x, y);
    n1 = dotGridGradient(x1, y0, x, y);
    ix0 = lerp(n0, n1, sx);
    n0 = dotGridGradient(x0, y1, x, y);
    n1 = dotGridGradient(x1, y1, x, y);
    ix1 = lerp(n0, n1, sx);
    value = lerp(ix0, ix1, sy);

    return value;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Complexity==
For each evaluation of the noise function, the dot product of the position and gradient vectors must be evaluated at each node of the containing grid cell. Perlin noise therefore scales with complexity &lt;math&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions.  Alternatives to Perlin noise producing similar results with improved complexity scaling include [[simplex noise]] and [[OpenSimplex noise]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18699">[[File:Parallel rays in Poincare model of hyperbolic geometry.svg|350px|right |thumb |Parallel rays in Poincare half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry]]

In [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the '''Poincaré half-plane model''' is the [[upper half-plane]], denoted below as '''H''' &lt;math&gt; \{ (x ,y) | y &gt; 0; x, y \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; , together with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], the [[Poincaré metric]], that makes it a [[mathematical model|model]] of two-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]].

Equivalently the Poincaré half-plane model is sometimes described as a [[complex plane]] where the [[imaginary part]] (the ''y'' coordinate mentioned above) is positive.

The Poincaré half-plane model is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], but it originated with [[Eugenio Beltrami]], who used it, along with the [[Klein model]] and the [[Poincaré disk model]] (due to [[Bernhard Riemann]]), to show that hyperbolic geometry was [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with [[Euclidean geometry]].

This model is [[conformal map projection|conformal]] which means that the angles measured at a point are the same in the model as they are in the actual hyperbolic plane.

The [[Cayley transform#Conformal map|Cayley transform]] provides an [[isometry]] between the half-plane model and the Poincaré disk model.

This model  can be generalized to model an &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] by replacing the real number ''x'' by a vector in an ''n'' dimensional Euclidean vector space.

==Metric==

The [[metric tensor|metric]] of the model on the half-plane, &lt;math&gt;\{ \langle x, y \rangle | y &gt; 0 \},&lt;/math&gt; is: 

:&lt;math&gt;(d s)^2 = \frac{(d x)^2 + (d y)^2}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' measures the length along a (possibly curved) line.
The ''straight lines'' in the hyperbolic plane ([[geodesics]] for this metric tensor, i.e., curves which minimize the distance) are represented in this model by circular arcs [[perpendicular]] to the ''x''-axis (half-circles whose origin is on the ''x''-axis) and straight vertical rays perpendicular to the ''x''-axis.

=== Distance calculation ===

In general, the ''distance'' between two points measured in this metric along such a geodesic is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle) 
&amp;= \operatorname{arcosh} \left( 1 + \frac{ {(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 - y_1)}^2 }{ 2 y_1 y_2 } \right)\\
&amp;= 2\operatorname{arsinh} \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{ {(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 - y_1)}^2} { y_1 y_2 }}\\
&amp;= 2\ln \frac{\sqrt{{(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 - y_1)}^2} + \sqrt{{(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 + y_1)}^2}} { 2 \sqrt{y_1 y_2}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''arcosh'' and ''arsinh'' are [[inverse hyperbolic function]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{arsinh} {x} &amp;=\ln \left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \right), \\
\operatorname{arcosh} {x} &amp;=\ln \left(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \right) &amp;&amp; x \ge 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Some special cases can be simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x, y_1 \rangle, \langle x, y_2 \rangle) =\left| \ln\frac{y_2}{y_1} \right| = | \ln(y_2) - \ln(y_1) | &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=mathematics stackexchange|title=Distance formula for points in the Poincare half plane model on a “vertical geodesic”|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1386297/88985|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} \left (\langle x_1, y \rangle, \langle x_2, y \rangle \right ) 
= \operatorname{arcosh} \left( 1 + \frac{ (x_2 - x_1)^2}{ 2 y^2} \right)
= 2 \operatorname{arsinh} \left( \frac{|x_2 -x_1|}{2 y}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} ( \langle x, r \rangle, \langle x \pm r\sin\phi, r\cos\phi \rangle )
= \operatorname{arsinh} \left( \tan \phi \right) 
= \operatorname{arcosh} \left( \frac{1}{\cos \phi } \right)
= \ln \left( \frac{1 + \sin \phi} {\cos \phi }\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Another way to calculate the distance between two points that are on a (Euclidean) half circle is:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(AB) = \left| \ln \left( \frac{|BA_{\infty}| |AB_{\infty}|}{ |AA_{\infty}| |BB_{\infty}|} \right) \right|.&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;A_{\infty}, B_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; are the points where the halfcircles meet the boundary line and &lt;math&gt;|PQ|&lt;/math&gt;is the euclidean length of the line segment connecting the points ''P'' and ''Q'' in the model.

==Special points and curves==

* '''[[Ideal point]]s''' (points at infinity) in the Poincaré half-plane model are of two kinds:
:* the points on the  ''x''-axis, and
:* one imaginary point at &lt;math&gt; y = \infty &lt;/math&gt; which is the [[ideal point]] to which all lines [[orthogonal]] to the ''x''-axis converge.

* '''Straight lines''', geodesics (the shortest path between the points contained within it) are modeled by either:
:* half-circles whose origin is on the x-axis
:* straight vertical rays orthogonal to the x-axis

* A '''circle''' (curves equidistant from a central point) with center &lt;math&gt;( x, y ) &lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r &lt;/math&gt; is modeled by:
:: a circle with center &lt;math&gt;( x, y \cosh (r) ) &lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;y \sinh (r) &lt;/math&gt;

* An '''[[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycle]]''' (a curve equidistant from a straight line, its axis) is modeled by either:
:* a circular arc which intersects the ''x''-axis at the same two [[ideal point]]s as the half-circle which models its axis but at an acute or obtuse [[angle]]
:* a straight line which intersects the ''x''-axis at the same point as the vertical line which models its axis , but at an acute or obtuse [[angle]].

* An '''[[horocycle]]''' (a curve whose normals all converge asymptotically in the same direction, its center) is modeled by either:
:* a circle tangent to the ''x''-axis (but excluding the [[ideal point]] of intersection, which is its center)
:* a line parallel to the ''x''-axis, in this case the center is the [[ideal point]] at &lt;math&gt; y = \infty &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Euclidean synopsis===

A Euclidean circle with center &lt;math&gt;(x_e, y_e) &lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r_e &lt;/math&gt; represents: 
* when the circle is completely inside the halfplane a hyperbolic circle with center 
::&lt;math&gt;\left ( x_e, \sqrt{y_e^2 - r_e^2 } \right ) &lt;/math&gt; 
:and radius 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{y_e + r_e} {y_e - r_e} \right).&lt;/math&gt; 
* when the circle is completely inside the halfplane and touches the boundary a horocycle centered around the ideal point &lt;math&gt;(x_e, 0 )&lt;/math&gt;

== Compass and straightedge constructions ==
{{see also|Compass and straightedge constructions}}
Here is how one can use [[compass and straightedge constructions]] in the model to achieve the effect of the basic constructions in the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bochaca|first1=Judit Abardia|title=Tools to work with the Half-Plane model|url=http://mat.uab.cat/~juditab/enllac3.htm|website=Tools to work with the Half-Plane mode|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, how to construct the half-circle in the Euclidean half-plane which models a line on the hyperbolic plane through two given points.

=== Creating the line through two existing points ===

Draw the line segment between the two points. Construct the perpendicular bisector of the line segment. Find its intersection with the ''x''-axis. Draw the circle around the intersection which passes through the given points. Erase the part which is on or below the ''x''-axis.

Or in the special case where the two given points lie on a vertical line, draw that vertical line through the two points and erase the part which is on or below the ''x''-axis.

=== Creating the circle through one point with center another point ===

*If the two points are not on a vertical line:

Draw the radial ''line'' (half-circle) between the two given points as in the previous case. Construct a tangent to that line at the non-central point. Drop a perpendicular from the given center point to the ''x''-axis. Find the intersection of these two lines to get the center of the model circle. Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

*If the two given points lie on a vertical line and the given center is above the other given point:

Draw a circle around the intersection of the vertical line and the ''x''-axis which passes through the given central point.
Draw a horizontal line through the non-central point.
Construct the tangent to the circle at its intersection with that horizontal line.

The midpoint between the intersection of the tangent with the vertical line and the given non-central point is the center of the model circle.
Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

*If the two given points lie on a vertical line and the given center is below the other given point:

Draw a circle around the intersection of the vertical line and the ''x''-axis which passes through the given central point.
Draw a line tangent to the circle which passes through the given non-central point.
Draw a horizontal line through that point of tangency and find its intersection with the vertical line.

The midpoint between that intersection and the given non-central point is the center of the model circle.
Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

=== Given a circle find its (hyperbolic) center ===

Drop a perpendicular ''p'' from the Euclidean center of the circle to the ''x''-axis.

Let point ''q'' be the intersection of this line and the ''x''- axis.

Draw a line tangent to the circle going through ''q''.

Draw the half circle ''h'' with center ''q'' going through the point where the tangent and the circle meet.

The (hyperbolic) center is the point where ''h'' and ''p'' intersect.&lt;ref&gt;Flavors of Geometry, MSRI Publications, Volume 31, 1997 , Hyperbolic Geometry, J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, R. Kenyon and W. R. Parry, page 87, Figure 19. Constructing the hyperbolic center of a circle&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other constructions ===

*Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing lines, if they intersect:
Find the intersection of the two given semicircles (or vertical lines).

*Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect):
Find the intersection of the given semicircle (or vertical line) with the given circle.

*Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect):
Find the intersection of the two given circles.

==Symmetry groups==
[[File:Poincare halfplane heptagonal hb.svg|300px|right|thumb|
Stellated regular [[Order-3 heptagonal tiling|heptagonal tiling]] of the model]]

The [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,'''C''') acts on the Riemann sphere by the [[Möbius transformation]]s. The subgroup that maps the upper half-plane, '''H''', onto itself is PSL(2,'''R'''), the transforms with real coefficients, and these act [[Transitive action|transitively]] and isometrically on the upper half-plane, making it a [[homogeneous space]].

There are four closely related [[Lie group]]s that act on the upper half-plane by fractional linear transformations and preserve the hyperbolic distance.

* The [[special linear group]] [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] which consists of the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals +1. Note that many texts (including Wikipedia) often say SL(2,'''R''') when they really mean PSL(2,'''R''').
* The group S*L(2,'''R''') consisting of the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals +1 or −1. Note that SL(2,'''R''') is a subgroup of this group.
* The [[projective special linear group]] [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]] = SL(2,'''R''')/{±''I''}, consisting of the matrices in SL(2,'''R''') modulo plus or minus the identity matrix.
*The group PS&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;L(2,'''R''') = S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;L(2,'''R''')/{±''I''}=PGL(2,'''R''') is again a projective group, and again, modulo plus or minus the identity matrix. PSL(2,'''R''') is contained as an index-two normal subgroup, the other coset being the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals −1, modulo plus or minus the identity.

The relationship of these groups to the Poincaré model is as follows:
* The group of all [[isometry|isometries]] of '''H''', sometimes denoted as Isom('''H'''), is isomorphic to PS&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;L(2,'''R''').   This includes both the orientation preserving and the orientation-reversing isometries. The orientation-reversing map (the mirror map) is &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow -\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The group of orientation-preserving isometries of '''H''', sometimes denoted as Isom&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;('''H'''), is isomorphic to PSL(2,'''R''').

Important subgroups of the isometry group are the [[Fuchsian group]]s.

One also frequently sees the [[modular group]] SL(2,'''Z'''). This group is important in two ways. First, it is a symmetry group of the square 2x2 [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of points. Thus, functions that are periodic on a square grid, such as [[modular form]]s and [[elliptic functions]], will thus inherit an SL(2,'''Z''') symmetry from the grid. Second, SL(2,'''Z''') is of course a subgroup of SL(2,'''R'''), and thus has a hyperbolic behavior embedded in it. In particular, SL(2,'''Z''') can be used to tessellate the hyperbolic plane into cells of equal (Poincaré) area.

==Isometric symmetry==
The [[group action]] of the [[projective special linear group]] &lt;math&gt;{\rm PSL}(2,\R)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\H&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\ c&amp;d\\ \end{pmatrix} \cdot z = \frac{az+b}{cz+d} = \frac{(ac|z|^2+bd+(ad+bc)\Re(z)) + i(ad-bc)\Im(z)}{|cz+d|^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the action is [[Transitive action|transitive]]: for any &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2\in\H&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;g\in {\rm PSL}(2,\R)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;gz_1=z_2&lt;/math&gt;. It is also faithful, in that if &lt;math&gt;gz=z&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\H,&lt;/math&gt; then ''g'' = ''e''.

The [[group action|stabilizer]] or ''isotropy subgroup'' of an element &lt;math&gt;z\in\H&lt;/math&gt; is the set of &lt;math&gt;g\in{\rm PSL}(2,\R)&lt;/math&gt; which leave ''z'' unchanged: ''gz'' = ''z''. The stabilizer of ''i'' is the [[special orthogonal group|rotation group]]

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm SO}(2) = \left.\left\{ \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta&amp;\sin\theta\\ -\sin\theta&amp;\cos\theta\\ \end{pmatrix}\right | \theta\in\R\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since any element &lt;math&gt;z\in\H&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to ''i'' by some element of &lt;math&gt;{\rm PSL}(2, \R)&lt;/math&gt;, this means that the isotropy subgroup of any ''z'' is [[isomorphic]] to SO(2). Thus, &lt;math&gt;\H={\rm PSL}(2,\R)/{\rm SO}(2)&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, the [[fiber bundle|bundle]] of unit-length tangent vectors on the upper half-plane, called the [[unit tangent bundle]], is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;{\rm PSL}(2, \R)&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper half-plane is tessellated into [[free regular set]]s by the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;{\rm SL}(2, \Z).&lt;/math&gt;

==Geodesics==
The geodesics for this metric tensor are circular arcs perpendicular to the real axis (half-circles whose origin is on the real axis) and straight vertical lines ending on the real axis.

The unit-speed geodesic going up vertically, through the point ''i'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(t) = \begin{pmatrix}e^{t/2}&amp;0\\ 0&amp;e^{-t/2}\\ \end{pmatrix}\cdot i = ie^t.&lt;/math&gt;

Because PSL(2,'''R''') acts transitively by isometries of the upper half-plane, this geodesic is mapped into the other geodesics through the action of PSL(2,'''R'''). Thus, the general unit-speed geodesic is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)=\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\ c&amp;d\\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}e^{t/2}&amp;0\\0&amp;e^{-t/2}\\ \end{pmatrix}\cdot i = \frac {aie^t +b} {cie^t +d}. &lt;/math&gt;

This provides the complete description of the [[geodesic flow]] on the unit-length tangent bundle (complex [[line bundle]]) on the upper half-plane.

== The model in three dimensions ==

The [[metric tensor|metric]] of the model on the half- space
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \langle x, y, z \rangle | z &gt; 0 \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

is given by
:&lt;math&gt;(d s)^2 = \frac{(d x)^2 + (d y)^2 + (d z)^2}{z^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' measures length along a possibly curved line.
The ''straight lines'' in the hyperbolic space ([[geodesics]] for this metric tensor, i.e. curves which minimize the distance) are represented in this model by circular arcs normal to the ''z = 0''-plane (half-circles whose origin is on the ''z = 0''-plane) and straight vertical rays normal to the ''z = 0''-plane.

The ''distance'' between two points measured in this metric along such a geodesic is:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1,z_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2,z_2\rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} \left( 1 + \frac{ {(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 - y_1)}^2 + {(z_2 - z_1)}^2 }{ 2 z_1 z_2 } \right)= 2 \operatorname{arsinh} \left(\frac{ \sqrt{{(x_2 - x_1)}^2 + {(y_2 - y_1)}^2 + {(z_2 - z_1)}^2} }{ 2 \sqrt{z_1 z_2} } \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

== The model in ''n'' dimensions ==
This model  can be generalized to model an &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] by replacing the real number ''x'' by a vector in an ''n'' dimensional Euclidean vector space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10379">[[File:Power point simple.svg|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1. Illustration of the power of point '''P''' in the circle centered on the point '''O'''. The distance ''s'' is shown in orange, the radius ''r'' is shown in blue, and the tangent line segment '''PT''' is shown in red.]]

In elementary plane [[geometry]], the '''power of a point''' is a [[real number]] ''h'' that reflects the relative distance of a given point from a given circle. Specifically, the power of a point '''P''' with respect to a [[circle]] ''O'' of radius ''r'' is defined by (Figure 1).

:&lt;math&gt;h = s^2 - r^2, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the distance between '''P'''  and the center '''O''' of the circle. By this definition, points inside the circle have negative power, points outside have positive power, and points on the circle have zero power. For external points, the power equals the square of the length of a tangent from the point to the circle. The power of a point is also known as the point's '''circle power''' or the '''power of a circle''' with respect to the point.

The power of point '''P''' ''(see in Figure 1)'' can be defined equivalently as the product of distances from the point '''P''' to the two intersection points of any ray emanating from '''P'''. For example, in Figure 1, a ray emanating from '''P''' intersects the circle in two points, '''M''' and '''N''', whereas a [[tangent lines to circles|tangent ray intersects the circle]] in one point '''T'''; the horizontal ray from '''P''' intersects the circle at '''A''' and '''B''', the endpoints of the diameter. Their respective products of distances are equal to each other and to the power of point '''P''' in that circle

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\overline{PT}}^2 =
\mathbf{\overline{PM}} \times \mathbf{\overline{PN}} =
\mathbf{\overline{PA}} \times \mathbf{\overline{PB}} =
(s - r) \times (s + r) =
s^2 - r^2 = h.  
&lt;/math&gt;

This equality is sometimes known as the ''"secant-tangent theorem"'', ''"intersecting chords theorem"'', or the ''"power-of-a-point theorem"''.

The power of a point is used in many geometrical definitions and proofs. For example, the [[radical axis]] of two given circles is the straight line consisting of points that have equal power to both circles. For each point on this line, there is a unique circle centered on that point that intersects both given circles orthogonally; equivalently, tangents of equal length can be drawn from that point to both given circles. Similarly, the [[power center (geometry)|radical center]] of three circles is the unique point with equal power to all three circles. There exists a unique circle, centered on the radical center, that intersects all three given circles orthogonally, equivalently, tangents drawn from the radical center to all three circles have equal length. The [[power diagram]] of a set of circles divides the plane into regions within which the circle minimizing the power is constant.

More generally, French mathematician  [[Edmond Laguerre]] defined the power of a point with respect to any algebraic curve in a similar way.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Orthogonal circle==
[[File:Orthogonal circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2: The dashed circle is centered on the point '''P''' and intersects the given circle (solid black) at right angles, i.e., orthogonally, at point '''T'''. The squared radius of the orthogonal circle equals the power of '''P''' with respect to the given circle.]]

For a point '''P''' outside the circle, the power ''h'' equals ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the square of the radius ''R'' of a new circle centered on '''P''' that intersects the given circle at right angles, i.e., orthogonally (Figure 2). If the two circles meet at right angles at a point '''T''', then radii drawn to '''T''' from '''P''' and from '''O''', the center of the given circle, likewise meet at right angles (blue line segments in Figure 2). Therefore, the radius line segment of each circle is tangent to the other circle. These line segments form a right triangle with the line segment connecting '''O''' and '''P'''. Therefore, by the [[Pythagorean theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt;
R^2 = s^2 - r^2 = h \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is again the distance from the point '''P''' to the center '''O''' of the given circle (solid black in Figure 2).

This construction of an orthogonal circle is useful in understanding the [[radical axis]] of two circles, and the [[power center (geometry)|radical center]] of three circles. The point '''T''' can be constructed—and, thereby, the radius ''R'' and the power ''h'' found geometrically—by finding the intersection of the given circle with a semicircle (red in Figure 2) centered on the midpoint of '''O''' and '''P''' and passing through both points. It can also be shown that the point '''Q''' is the [[Circle inversion|inverse]] of '''P''' with respect to the given circle.

==Theorems==
The ''power of a point theorem'', due to [[Jakob Steiner]], states that for any [[line (geometry)|line]] through ''A'' intersecting a circle ''c'' in points ''P'' and ''Q'', the power of the point with respect to the circle ''c'' is given up to a sign by the product

:&lt;math&gt;AP \cdot AQ \, &lt;/math&gt;

of the lengths of the segments from ''A'' to ''P'' and ''A'' to ''Q'', with a positive sign if ''A'' is outside the circle and a negative sign otherwise: if ''A'' is on the circle, the product is zero. In the limiting case, when the line is [[tangent]] to the circle, ''P'' = ''Q'', and the result is immediate from the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

In the other two cases, when ''A'' is inside the circle, or ''A'' is outside the circle, the power of a point theorem has two [[corollary|corollaries]].
* The [[intersecting chords theorem|''chord theorem'']], ''theorem of intersecting chords'', or ''chord-chord power theorem'' states that if ''A'' is a point inside a circle and ''PQ'' and ''RS'' are [[chord (geometry)|chords]] of the circle intersecting at ''A'', then
::&lt;math&gt; AP \cdot AQ = AR \cdot AS \, &lt;/math&gt;
:The common value of these products is the negative of the power of the point ''A'' with respect to the circle.
* The ''[[intersecting secants theorem]]'' (or ''secant-secant power theorem'') states that if ''PQ'' and ''RS'' are chords of a circle which intersect at a point ''A'' outside the circle, then
::&lt;math&gt;AP \cdot AQ = AR \cdot AS \, &lt;/math&gt;
:In this case the common value is the same as the power of ''A'' with respect to the circle.

* The ''[[tangent-secant theorem]]'' is a special case of the theorem of intersecting secants, where points ''Q'' and ''P'' coincide, i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;AP \cdot AQ = AR \cdot AS \, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;AP \cdot AP = AR \cdot AS \, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;AP^2 = AR \cdot AS \, &lt;/math&gt;
:This has utility in such applications as determining the distance to a point ''P'' on the [[horizon]], by selecting points ''R'' and ''S'' to form a diameter chord, so that ''RS'' is the diameter of the planet, ''AR'' is the height above the planet, and ''AP'' is the distance to the horizon.

==Darboux product==
The power of a point is a special case of the Darboux product between two circles, which is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\left| A_1A_2 \right|^2-r_1^2-r_2^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the centers of the two circles and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are their radii. The power of a point arises in the special case that one of the radii is zero.

If the two circles are orthogonal, the Darboux product vanishes.

If the two circles intersect, then their Darboux product is

:&lt;math&gt;2r_1 r_2 \cos\varphi \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;phi;'' is the angle of intersection.

==Laguerre's theorem==
Laguerre defined the power of a point ''P'' with respect to an algebraic curve of degree ''n'' to be the product of the distances from the point to the intersections of a circle through the point with the curve, divided by the ''n''th power of the diameter ''d''. Laguerre showed that this number is independent of the diameter.

In the case when the algebraic curve is a circle this is not quite the same as the power of a point with respect to a circle defined in the rest of this article, but differs from it by a factor of ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The '''principle of maximum entropy''' states that the [[probability distribution]] which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a [[proposition]] that expresses [[#Testable information|testable information]]).

Another way of stating this:  Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function. Consider the set of all trial probability distributions that would encode the prior data. According to this principle, the distribution with maximal [[information entropy]] is the best choice.

==History==
The principle was first expounded by [[E. T. Jaynes]] in two papers in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In particular, Jaynes offered a new and very general rationale why the Gibbsian method of statistical mechanics works. He argued that the [[entropy]] of statistical mechanics and the [[information entropy]] of [[information theory]] are basically the same thing. Consequently, [[statistical mechanics]] should be seen just as a particular application of a general tool of logical [[inference]] and information theory.

==Overview==
In most practical cases, the stated prior data or testable information is given by a set of [[conserved quantities]] (average values of some moment functions), associated with the [[probability distribution]] in question. This is the way the maximum entropy principle is most often used in [[statistical thermodynamics]]. Another possibility is to prescribe some [[symmetries]] of the probability distribution. The equivalence between [[conserved quantities]] and corresponding [[symmetry groups]] implies a similar equivalence for these two ways of specifying the testable information in the maximum entropy method.

The maximum entropy principle is also needed to guarantee the uniqueness and consistency of probability assignments obtained by different methods, [[statistical mechanics]] and [[logical inference]] in particular.

The maximum entropy principle makes explicit our freedom in using different forms of [[prior information|prior data]]. As a special case, a uniform [[prior probability]] density (Laplace's [[principle of indifference]], sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason), may be adopted. Thus, the maximum entropy principle is not merely an alternative way to view the usual methods of inference of classical statistics, but represents a significant conceptual generalization of those methods.

However these statements do not imply that thermodynamical systems need not be shown to be [[ergodic]] to justify treatment as a [[statistical ensemble]].

In ordinary language, the principle of maximum entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most ignorance beyond the stated prior data.

==Testable information==
The principle of maximum entropy is useful explicitly only when applied to ''testable information''. Testable information is a statement about a probability distribution whose truth or falsity is well-defined. For example, the statements

:the [[expected value|expectation]] of the variable ''x'' is 2.87
and
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.6

(where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are probabilities of events) are statements of testable information.

Given testable information, the maximum entropy procedure consists of seeking the [[probability distribution]] which maximizes [[information entropy]], subject to the constraints of the information. This constrained optimization problem is typically solved using the method of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

Entropy maximization with no testable information respects the universal "constraint" that the sum of the probabilities is one. Under this constraint, the maximum entropy discrete probability distribution is the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\frac{1}{n}\ {\rm for\ all}\ i\in\{\,1,\dots,n\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The principle of maximum entropy is commonly applied in two ways to inferential problems:

===Prior probabilities===
The principle of maximum entropy is often used to obtain [[prior probability|prior probability distributions]] for [[Bayesian inference]]. Jaynes was a strong advocate of this approach, claiming the maximum entropy distribution represented the least informative distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Posterior probabilities===
Maximum entropy is a sufficient updating rule for [[radical probabilism]]. [[Richard Jeffrey]]'s [[probability kinematics]] is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=[[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms, B]] | year=1987 | title=Updating, supposing and MAXENT | journal=Theory and Decision | volume=22 | pages=225–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximum entropy models===
Alternatively, the principle is often invoked for model specification: in this case the observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Such models are widely used in [[natural language processing]]. An example of such a model is [[logistic regression]], which corresponds to the maximum entropy classifier for independent observations.

===Probability density estimation ===
One of the main applications of the maximum entropy principle is in discrete and continuous density estimation.

Similar to [[support vector machine]] estimators, 
the maximum entropy principle may require the solution to a [[quadratic programming]] and thus provide 
a sparse mixture model as the optimal density estimator. One important advantage of the method is able to incorporate prior information in the density estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==General solution for the maximum entropy distribution with linear constraints==
{{main article|maximum entropy probability distribution}}

===Discrete case===
We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' taking values in {''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}. We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; that is, we require our probability distribution to satisfy the moment inequality/equality constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i)f_k(x_i) \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the probabilities must sum to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution with maximum information entropy subject to these equality constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(x_i) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m)} \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes called the [[Gibbs distribution]]. The normalization constant is determined by:

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m) = \sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and is conventionally called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]].  (The [[Pitman&amp;ndash;Koopman theorem]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a sampling distribution to admit [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistics]] of bounded dimension is that it have the general form of a maximum entropy distribution.)

The λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; parameters are Lagrange multipliers. In the case of equality constraints their values are determined from the solution of the nonlinear equations

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of inequality constraints, the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program with linear constraints.&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt; 
In both cases, there is no [[closed form solution]], and the computation of the Lagrange multipliers  usually requires  [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].

===Continuous case===
For [[continuous distribution]]s, the Shannon entropy cannot be used, as it is only defined for discrete probability spaces.  Instead [[E. T. Jaynes|Edwin Jaynes]] (1963, 1968, 2003) gave the following formula, which is closely related to the [[relative entropy]] (see also [[differential entropy]]).

:&lt;math&gt;H_c=-\int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''(''x''), which Jaynes called the "invariant measure", is proportional to the [[limiting density of discrete points]]. For now, we shall assume that ''m'' is known; we will discuss it further after the solution equations are given.

A closely related quantity, the relative entropy, is usually defined as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] of ''m'' from ''p'' (although it is sometimes, confusingly, defined as the negative of this).  The inference principle of minimizing this, due to Kullback, is known as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence#Principle of minimum discrimination information|Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information]].

We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' which takes values in some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the [[real numbers]] (all integrals below are over this interval). We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e. we require our probability density function to satisfy the inequality (or purely equality) moment constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)f_k(x)\,dx \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \dotsc,m.&lt;/math&gt;

And of course, the probability density must integrate to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)\,dx = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability density function with maximum ''H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' subject to these constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m)} m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] determined by

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m) = \int m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the discrete case, in the case where all moment constraints are equalities, the values of the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; parameters are determined by the system of nonlinear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case with  inequality moment  constraints the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program.&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

The invariant measure function ''m''(''x'') can be best understood by supposing that ''x'' is known to take values only in the [[bounded interval]] (''a'', ''b''), and that no other information is given. Then the maximum entropy probability density function is

:&lt;math&gt; p(x) = A \cdot m(x), \qquad a &lt; x &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a normalization constant. The invariant measure function is actually the prior density function encoding 'lack of relevant information'.  It cannot be determined by the principle of maximum entropy, and must be determined by some other logical method, such as the [[principle of transformation groups]] or [[Marginalization (probability)|marginalization theory]].

===Examples===
For several examples of maximum entropy distributions, see the article on [[maximum entropy probability distribution]]s.

==Justifications for the principle of maximum entropy==
Proponents of the principle of maximum entropy justify its use in assigning probabilities in several ways, including the following two arguments. These arguments take the use of [[Bayesian probability]] as given, and are thus subject to the same postulates.

===Information entropy as a measure of 'uninformativeness'===
Consider a '''discrete probability distribution''' among ''m'' mutually exclusive [[proposition]]s. The most informative distribution would occur when one of the propositions was known to be true. In that case, the information entropy would be equal to zero. The least informative distribution would occur when there is no reason to favor any one of the propositions over the others. In that case, the only reasonable probability distribution would be uniform, and then the information entropy would be equal to its maximum possible value, log&amp;nbsp;''m''. The information entropy can therefore be seen as a numerical measure which describes how uninformative a particular probability distribution is, ranging from zero (completely informative) to log&amp;nbsp;''m'' (completely uninformative).

By choosing to use the distribution with the maximum entropy allowed by our information, the argument goes, we are choosing the most uninformative distribution possible. To choose a distribution with lower entropy would be to assume information we do not possess. Thus the maximum entropy distribution is the only reasonable distribution.

===The Wallis derivation===
The following argument is the result of a suggestion made by [[Graham Wallis]] to E. T. Jaynes in 1962.&lt;ref name=Jaynes2003/&gt; It is essentially the same mathematical argument used for the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] in [[statistical mechanics]], although the conceptual emphasis is quite different. It has the advantage of being strictly combinatorial in nature, making no reference to information entropy as a measure of 'uncertainty', 'uninformativeness', or any other imprecisely defined concept. The information entropy function is not assumed ''a priori'', but rather is found in the course of the argument; and the argument leads naturally to the procedure of maximizing the information entropy, rather than treating it in some other way.

Suppose an individual wishes to make a probability assignment among ''m''  [[mutually exclusive]] propositions. She has some testable information, but is not sure how to go about including this information in her probability assessment. She therefore conceives of the following random experiment. She will distribute ''N'' quanta of probability (each worth 1/''N'') at random among the ''m'' possibilities. (One might imagine that she will throw ''N'' balls into ''m'' buckets while blindfolded. In order to be as fair as possible, each throw is to be independent of any other, and every bucket is to be the same size.) Once the experiment is done, she will check if the probability assignment thus obtained is consistent with her information. (For this step to be successful, the information must be a constraint given by an open set in the space of probability measures). If it is inconsistent, she will reject it and try again. If it is consistent, her assessment will be

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{n_i}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition, while ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of quanta that were assigned to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition (i.e. the number of balls that ended up in bucket ''i'').

Now, in order to reduce the 'graininess' of the probability assignment, it will be necessary to use quite a large number of quanta of probability. Rather than actually carry out, and possibly have to repeat, the rather long random experiment, the protagonist decides to simply calculate and use the most probable result. The probability of any particular result is the [[multinomial distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(\mathbf{p}) = W \cdot m^{-N}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!}&lt;/math&gt;

is sometimes known as the multiplicity of the outcome.

The most probable result is the one which maximizes the multiplicity ''W''. Rather than maximizing ''W'' directly, the protagonist could equivalently maximize any monotonic increasing function of ''W''. She decides to maximize

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac 1 N \log W 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{(Np_1)! \, (Np_2)! \, \dotsb \, (Np_m)!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( \log N! - \sum_{i=1}^m \log ((Np_i)!) \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, in order to simplify the expression, the protagonist takes the limit as &lt;math&gt;N\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. as the probability levels go from grainy  discrete values to smooth continuous values. Using [[Stirling's approximation]], she finds

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{N \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{N}\log W\right) 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( N\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m Np_i\log (Np_i) \right)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log (Np_i)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \log N \sum_{i=1}^m p_i - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \right)\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i \\[6pt]
&amp;= H(\mathbf{p}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains for the protagonist to do is to maximize entropy under the constraints of her testable information. She has found that the maximum entropy distribution is the most probable of all "fair" random distributions, in the limit as the probability levels go from discrete to continuous.

===Compatibility with Bayes' theorem===
Giffin and Caticha (2007) state that [[Bayes' theorem]] and the principle of maximum entropy are completely compatible and can be seen as special cases of the "method of maximum relative entropy". They state that this method reproduces every aspect of orthodox Bayesian inference methods. In addition this new method opens the door to tackling problems that could not be addressed by either the maximal entropy principle or orthodox Bayesian methods individually. Moreover, recent contributions (Lazar 2003, and Schennach 2005) show that frequentist relative-entropy-based inference approaches (such as [[empirical likelihood]] and [[exponentially tilted empirical likelihood]] – see e.g. Owen 2001 and Kitamura 2006) can be combined with prior information to perform Bayesian posterior analysis.

Jaynes stated Bayes' theorem was a way to calculate a probability, while maximum entropy was a way to assign a prior probability distribution.&lt;ref name=Jaynes1988/&gt;

It is however, possible in concept to solve for a posterior distribution directly from a stated prior distribution using the [[Cross entropy|principle of minimum cross entropy]] (or the Principle of Maximum Entropy being a special case of using a [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] as the given prior), independently of any Bayesian considerations by treating the problem formally as a constrained optimisation problem, the Entropy functional being the objective function.  For the case of given average values as testable information (averaged over the sought after probability distribution), the sought after distribution is formally the [[Gibbs measure|Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution]] the parameters of which must be solved for in order to achieve minimum cross entropy and satisfy the given testable information.

==Relevance to physics==

The principle of maximum entropy bears a relation to a key assumption of [[kinetic theory of gases]] known as [[molecular chaos]] or ''Stosszahlansatz''. This asserts that the distribution function characterizing particles entering a collision can be factorized. Though this statement can be understood as a strictly physical hypothesis, it can also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis regarding the most probable configuration of particles before colliding &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chliamovitch | first1 = G. | last2 = Malaspinas | first2 = O. | last3 = Chopard | first3 = B. | doi = 10.3390/e19080381 | title = Kinetic theory beyond the Stosszahlansatz | journal = Entropy | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | year = 2017| bibcode = 2017Entrp..19..381C | page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In mathematics, and especially [[topology]], a '''Pytkeev space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies qualities more subtle than a [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of a [[sequence]]. They are named after E. G. Pytkeev, who proved in 1983 that [[sequential space]]s have this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Definitions ==

Let ''X'' be a topological space. For a subset ''S'' of ''X'' let &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''S''&lt;/span&gt; denote the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Then a point ''x'' is called a ''Pytkeev point'' if for every set A with {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}}, there is a countable &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;-net of infinite subsets of ''A''.  A ''Pytkeev space'' is a space in which every point is a Pytkeev point.&lt;ref name="TAIA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malykhin|first=V. I.|last2=Tironi|first2=G|year=2000|title=Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn and Pytkeev spaces|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=104|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi=10.1016/s0166-8641(99)00027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Every [[sequential space]] is also a Pytkeev space. This is because, if {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}} then there exists a sequence {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} that converges to ''x''. So take the countable π-net of infinite subsets of ''A'' to be {{nowrap|1={''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} = {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, …}}}.&lt;ref name="TAIA"/&gt;
* If ''X'' is a Pytkeev space, then it is also a [[Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn space]].

Humans obtain most of their information through their eyes. Accordingly, the analysis of visual data is one of the most important functions of our brain and it has evolved high efficiency in processing visual data. Currently, visual information like images and videos constitutes the largest part of data traffic in the internet. Processing of this information requires ever larger computational power&lt;ref&gt; Gonzalez, R. C.;Woods,R. E., Digital Image Processing (Prentice Hall, London, UK, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;.

The researchers discuss a suitable method for encoding image data, and develop a new quantum algorithm that can detect boundaries among parts of an image with a single logical operation. This edge-detection operation is independent of the size of the image. Several other algorithms are also discussed. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that they work in practice. This is the first experiment to demonstrate practical quantum image processing. It contributes a substantial progress towards both theoretical and experimental quantum computing for image processing， it will stimulate future studies in the field of quantum information processing of visual data.

The '''rising moving average''' is a technical indicator used in [[stock market]] trading. Most commonly found visually, the pattern is spotted with a moving average overlay on a stock chart or price series. When the moving average has been rising consecutively for a number of days, this is used as a buy signal, to indicate a rising trend forming.

While the rising moving average indicator is commonly used by [[investor]]s without realising, there has been significant backtesting on historic stock data to calculate the performance of the rising moving average. Simulations have found that shorter rising averages, within the 3- to 10-day period, are more profitable overall than longer rising averages (e.g. 20 days). These have only been tested on US [[equity stock]]s however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockmarketfreedom.com/how-to-invest/Follow-the-Rising-Trend.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5216">In [[modal logic]], '''Sahlqvist formulas''' are a certain kind of modal formula with remarkable properties. The '''Sahlqvist correspondence theorem''' states that every [[Henrik Sahlqvist|Sahlqvist]] formula is [[Kripke semantics#Canonical models|canonical]], and corresponds to a [[first-order logic|first-order]] definable class of [[Kripke semantics|Kripke frames]]. 

Sahlqvist's definition characterizes a decidable set of modal formulas with first-order correspondents. Since it is undecidable, by Chagrova's theorem, whether an arbitrary modal formula has a first-order correspondent, there are formulas with first-order frame conditions that are not Sahlqvist [Chagrova 1991] (see the examples below). Hence Sahlqvist formulas define only a (decidable) subset of modal formulas with first-order correspondents.

== Definition ==
Sahlqvist formulas are built up from implications, where the consequent is ''positive'' and the antecedent is of a restricted form.
* A ''boxed atom'' is a propositional atom preceded by a number (possibly 0) of boxes, i.e. a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\Box\cdots\Box p&lt;/math&gt; (often abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;\Box^i p&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i &lt; \omega&lt;/math&gt;).
* A ''Sahlqvist antecedent'' is a formula constructed using ∧, ∨, and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; from boxed atoms, and negative formulas (including the constants ⊥, ⊤).
* A ''Sahlqvist implication'' is a formula ''A'' → ''B'', where ''A'' is a Sahlqvist antecedent, and ''B'' is a positive formula.
* A ''Sahlqvist formula'' is constructed from Sahlqvist implications using ∧ and &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; (unrestricted), and using ∨ on formulas with no common variables.

== Examples of Sahlqvist formulas ==
; &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \; Rxx&lt;/math&gt;, and it defines all '''[[Reflexive relation|reflexive frames]]'''
; &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [Rxy \rightarrow Ryx]&lt;/math&gt;, and it defines all '''[[Symmetric relation|symmetric frames]]'''
; &lt;math&gt;\Diamond \Diamond p \rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Box p \rightarrow \Box \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \forall z [(Rxy \land Ryz) \rightarrow Rxz]&lt;/math&gt;, and it defines all '''[[Transitive relation|transitive frames]]'''
; &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p \rightarrow \Diamond \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Box \Box p \rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [Rxy \rightarrow \exists z (Rxz \land Rzy)]&lt;/math&gt;, and it defines all '''[[Dense order|dense frames]]'''
; &lt;math&gt;\Box p \rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \; Rxy&lt;/math&gt;, and it defines all '''right-unbounded frames''' (also called serial)
; &lt;math&gt;\Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
: Its first-order corresponding formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall x_1 \forall z_0 [Rxx_1 \land Rxz_0 \rightarrow \exists z_1 (Rx_1z_1 \land Rz_0z_1)]&lt;/math&gt;, and it is the [[Church–Rosser theorem|Church-Rosser property]].

==Examples of non-Sahlqvist formulas==
; &lt;math&gt;\Box\Diamond p \rightarrow \Diamond \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
: This is the ''McKinsey formula''; it does not have a first-order frame condition.
;  &lt;math&gt;\Box(\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
: The ''Löb axiom'' is not Sahlqvist; again, it does not have a first-order frame condition.
; &lt;math&gt;(\Box\Diamond p \rightarrow \Diamond \Box p) \land (\Diamond\Diamond q \rightarrow \Diamond q)&lt;/math&gt;
: The conjunction of the McKinsey formula and the (4) axiom has a first-order frame condition (the conjunction of the transitivity property with the property &lt;math&gt; \forall x[\forall y(Rxy \rightarrow \exists z[Ryz]) \rightarrow \exists y(Rxy \wedge \forall z[Ryz \rightarrow z = y])] &lt;/math&gt;) but is not equivalent to any Sahlqvist formula.

== Kracht's theorem ==
When a Sahlqvist formula is used as an axiom in a normal modal logic, the logic is guaranteed to be complete with respect to the elementary class of frames the axiom defines. This result comes from the Sahlqvist completeness theorem [Modal Logic, Blackburn ''et al.'', Theorem 4.42]. But there is also a converse theorem, namely a theorem that states which first-order conditions are the correspondents of Sahlqvist formulas. Kracht's theorem states that ''any Sahlqvist formula locally corresponds to a Kracht formula; and conversely, every Kracht formula is a local first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist formula which can be effectively obtained from the Kracht formula'' [Modal Logic, Blackburn ''et al.'', Theorem 3.59].

==Details==
Stochastic quantization serves to quantize [[Euclidean field theory|Euclidean field theories]],&lt;ref name=damgaard&gt;{{cite journal|last=DAMGAARD|first=Poul|author2=Helmuth HUFFEL |title=STOCHASTIC QUANTIZATION|journal=Physics Reports|year=1987|volume=152|issue=5&amp;6|pages=227–398|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/helmuth.hueffel/PhysRep.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2013|bibcode = 1987PhR...152..227D |doi = 10.1016/0370-1573(87)90144-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for numerical applications, such as [[numerical simulation]]s of [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] with [[fermion]]s. This serves to address the problem of [[fermion doubling]] that usually occurs in these numerical calculations.

Stochastic quantization takes advantage of the fact that a Euclidean quantum field theory can be modeled as the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium limit]] of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical system]] coupled to a [[heat bath]]. In particular, in the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] representation of a Euclidean quantum field theory, the path integral measure is closely related to the [[Boltzmann distribution]] of a statistical mechanical system in equilibrium. In this relation, Euclidean [[Green's functions]] become [[correlation function]]s in the statistical mechanical system. A statistical mechanical system in equilibrium can be modeled, via the [[ergodic hypothesis]], as the [[stationary distribution]] of a [[stochastic process]]. Then the Euclidean path integral measure can also be thought of as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process; hence the name stochastic quantization.

In [[mathematics]], a '''symmetric polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]] {{math|''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in {{math|''n''}} variables, such that if any of the variables are interchanged, one obtains the same polynomial. Formally, {{math|''P''}} is a ''symmetric polynomial'' if for any [[permutation]] {{math|σ}} of the subscripts {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}} one has {{math|''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(1)&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(2)&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

Symmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A [[Elementary symmetric polynomial#The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials|theorem]] states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every ''symmetric'' [[polynomial expression]] in the roots of a [[monic polynomial]] can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.

Symmetric polynomials also form an interesting structure by themselves, independently of any relation to the roots of a polynomial. In this context other collections of specific symmetric polynomials, such as [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial|complete homogeneous]], [[power sum symmetric polynomial|power sum]], and [[Schur polynomial]]s play important roles alongside the elementary ones. The resulting structures, and in particular the [[ring of symmetric functions]], are of great importance in [[combinatorics]] and in [[representation theory]].

==Examples==
Symmetric polynomials in two variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;X_1^3+ X_2^3-7&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;4 X_1^2X_2^2 +X_1^3X_2 + X_1X_2^3 +(X_1+X_2)^4&lt;/math&gt;
and in three variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;X_1 X_2 X_3 - 2 X_1 X_2 - 2 X_1 X_3 - 2 X_2 X_3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
There are many ways to make specific symmetric polynomials in any number of variables, see the various types below. An example of a somewhat different flavor is
* &lt;math&gt;\prod_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq n}(X_i-X_j)^2&lt;/math&gt;
where first a polynomial is constructed that changes sign under every exchange of variables, and taking the square renders it completely symmetric (if the variables represent the roots of a monic polynomial, this polynomial gives its [[discriminant]]).

On the other hand, the polynomial in two variables
* &lt;math&gt;X_1 - X_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
is not symmetric, since if one exchanges &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; one gets a different polynomial, &lt;math&gt;X_2 - X_1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly in three variables
* &lt;math&gt;X_1^4X_2^2X_3 + X_1X_2^4X_3^2 + X_1^2X_2X_3^4&lt;/math&gt;
has only symmetry under cyclic permutations of the three variables, which is not sufficient to be a symmetric polynomial.  However, the following is symmetric:
* &lt;math&gt;X_1^4X_2^2X_3 + X_1X_2^4X_3^2 + X_1^2X_2X_3^4 +
        X_1^4X_2X_3^2 + X_1X_2^2X_3^4 + X_1^2X_2^4X_3&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Galois theory ===
{{Main|Galois theory}}
One context in which symmetric polynomial functions occur is in the study of [[Monic polynomial|monic]] [[univariate]] polynomials of degree ''n'' having ''n'' roots in a given [[field (mathematics)|field]]. These ''n'' roots determine the polynomial, and when they are considered as independent variables, the coefficients of the polynomial are symmetric polynomial functions of the roots. Moreover the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]] implies that a polynomial function ''f'' of the ''n'' roots can be expressed as (another) polynomial function of the coefficients of the polynomial determined by the roots [[if and only if]] ''f'' is given by a symmetric polynomial.

This yields the approach to solving polynomial equations by inverting this map, "breaking" the symmetry – given the coefficients of the polynomial (the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s in the roots), how can one recover the roots?
This leads to studying solutions of polynomials using the [[permutation group]] of the roots, originally in the form of [[Lagrange resolvents]], later developed in [[Galois theory]].

== Relation with the roots of a monic univariate polynomial ==
Consider a monic polynomial in ''t'' of degree ''n''

:&lt;math&gt;P=t^n+a_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\cdots+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0&lt;/math&gt;

with coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in some field&amp;nbsp;''k''. There exist ''n'' roots ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P'' in some possibly larger field (for instance if ''k'' is the field of [[real number]]s, the roots will exist in the field of [[complex number]]s); some of the roots might be equal, but the fact that one has ''all'' roots is expressed by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;P=t^n+a_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\cdots+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0=(t-x_1)(t-x_2)\cdots(t-x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

By comparison of the coefficients one finds that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_{n-1}&amp;=-x_1-x_2-\cdots-x_n\\
a_{n-2}&amp;=x_1x_2+x_1x_3+\cdots+x_2x_3+\cdots+x_{n-1}x_n = \textstyle\sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq n}x_ix_j\\
&amp; {}\  \, \vdots\\
a_1&amp;=(-1)^{n-1}(x_2x_3\cdots x_n+x_1x_3x_4\cdots x_n+\cdots+x_1x_2\cdots x_{n-2}x_n+x_1x_2\cdots x_{n-1})
      = \textstyle(-1)^{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\prod_{j\neq i}x_j\\
a_0&amp;=(-1)^nx_1x_2\cdots x_n.\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These are in fact just instances of [[Viète's formulas]]. They show that all coefficients of the polynomial are given in terms of the roots by a symmetric [[polynomial expression]]: although for a given polynomial ''P'' there may be qualitative differences between the roots (like lying in the base field&amp;nbsp;''k'' or not, being simple or multiple roots), none of this affects the way the roots occur in these expressions.

Now one may change the point of view, by taking the roots rather than the coefficients as basic parameters for describing ''P'', and considering them as indeterminates rather than as constants in an appropriate field; the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then become just the particular symmetric polynomials given by the above equations. Those polynomials, without the sign &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{n-i}&lt;/math&gt;, are known as the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. A basic fact, known as the '''[[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]]''' states that ''any'' symmetric polynomial in ''n'' variables can be given by a polynomial expression in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials. It follows that any symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the ''coefficients'' of the polynomial, and in particular that its value lies in the base field ''k'' that contains those coefficients. Thus, when working only with such symmetric polynomial expressions in the roots, it is unnecessary to know anything particular about those roots, or to compute in any larger field than ''k'' in which those roots may lie. In fact the values of the roots themselves become rather irrelevant, and the necessary relations between coefficients and symmetric polynomial expressions can be found by computations in terms of symmetric polynomials only. An example of such relations are [[Newton's identities]], which express the sum of any fixed power of the roots in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.

== Special kinds of symmetric polynomials ==

There are a few types of symmetric polynomials in the variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that are fundamental.

=== Elementary symmetric polynomials ===
{{Main|Elementary symmetric polynomial}}
For each nonnegative integer ''k'', the elementary symmetric polynomial ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of all distinct products of ''k'' distinct variables.  (Some authors denote it by σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; instead.) For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 there is only the empty product so ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', no products at all can be formed, so ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in these cases. The remaining ''n'' elementary symmetric polynomials are building blocks for all symmetric polynomials in these variables: as mentioned above, any symmetric polynomial in the variables considered can be obtained from these elementary symmetric polynomials using multiplications and additions only. In fact one has the following more detailed facts:
*any symmetric polynomial ''P'' in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a [[polynomial expression]] in the polynomials ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'';
*this expression is unique up to equivalence of polynomial expressions;
*if ''P'' has ''integral'' coefficients, then the polynomial expression also has integral coefficients.
For example, for ''n'' = 2, the relevant elementary symmetric polynomials are ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The first polynomial in the list of examples above can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;X_1^3+X_2^3-7=e_1(X_1,X_2)^3-3e_2(X_1,X_2)e_1(X_1,X_2)-7&lt;/math&gt;
(for a proof that this is always possible see the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]]).

=== Monomial symmetric polynomials === &lt;!--[[Monomial symmetric polynomial]] redirects here --&gt;
Powers and products of elementary symmetric polynomials work out to rather complicated expressions. If one seeks basic ''additive'' building blocks for symmetric polynomials, a more natural choice is to take those symmetric polynomials that contain only one type of monomial, with only those copies required to obtain symmetry. Any [[monomial]] in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;…''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where the exponents α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are natural numbers (possibly zero); writing α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) this can be abbreviated to ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;. The '''monomial symmetric polynomial''' ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as the sum of all monomials ''x''&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; where β ranges over all ''distinct'' permutations of (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). For instance one has
:&lt;math&gt;m_{(3,1,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3X_2X_3+X_1X_2^3X_3+X_1X_2X_3^3&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;m_{(3,2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3X_2^2X_3+X_1^3X_2X_3^2+X_1^2X_2^3X_3+X_1^2X_2X_3^3+X_1X_2^3X_3^2+X_1X_2^2X_3^3.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; when β is a permutation of α, so one usually considers only those ''m''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for which α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, in other words for which α is a [[partition (number theory)|partition of an integer]].
These monomial symmetric polynomials form a vector space basis: every symmetric polynomial ''P'' can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the monomial symmetric polynomials. To do this it suffices to separate the different types of monomial occurring in ''P''. In particular if ''P'' has integer coefficients, then so will the linear combination.

The elementary symmetric polynomials are particular cases of monomial symmetric polynomials: for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' one has
:&lt;math&gt;e_k(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=m_\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &amp;alpha; is the partition of ''k'' into ''k'' parts&amp;nbsp;1 (followed by ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'' zeros).

=== Power-sum symmetric polynomials ===
{{Main|Power sum symmetric polynomial}}
For each integer ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, the monomial symmetric polynomial ''m''&lt;sub&gt;(''k'',0,…,0)&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is of special interest. It is the power sum symmetric polynomial, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;p_k(X_1,\ldots,X_n) = X_1^k + X_2^k + \cdots + X_n^k .&lt;/math&gt; 
All symmetric polynomials can be obtained from the first ''n'' power sum symmetric polynomials by additions and multiplications, possibly involving rational coefficients.  More precisely,
:Any symmetric polynomial in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed as a polynomial expression with rational coefficients in the power sum symmetric polynomials ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), &amp;hellip;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
In particular, the remaining power sum polynomials ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' can be so expressed in the first ''n'' power sum polynomials; for example
:&lt;math&gt;p_3(X_1,X_2)=\textstyle\frac32p_2(X_1,X_2)p_1(X_1,X_2)-\frac12p_1(X_1,X_2)^3.&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the situation for the elementary and complete homogeneous polynomials, a symmetric polynomial in ''n'' variables with ''integral'' coefficients need not be a polynomial function with integral coefficients of the power sum symmetric polynomials.
For an example, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the symmetric polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2) = X_1^2 X_2 + X_1 X_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
has the expression
:&lt;math&gt; m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2)= \textstyle\frac12p_1(X_1,X_2)^3-\frac12p_2(X_1,X_2)p_1(X_1,X_2).&lt;/math&gt;
Using three variables one gets a different expression
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3) &amp;= X_1^2 X_2 + X_1 X_2^2 + X_1^2 X_3 + X_1 X_3^2 + X_2^2 X_3 + X_2 X_3^2\\
  &amp;= p_1(X_1,X_2,X_3)p_2(X_1,X_2,X_3)-p_3(X_1,X_2,X_3).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding expression was valid for two variables as well (it suffices to set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to zero), but since it involves ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, it could not be used to illustrate the statement for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. The example shows that whether or not the expression for a given monomial symmetric polynomial in terms of the first ''n'' power sum polynomials involves rational coefficients may depend on ''n''. But rational coefficients are ''always'' needed to express elementary symmetric polynomials (except the constant ones, and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which coincides with the first power sum) in terms of power sum polynomials. The [[Newton identities]] provide an explicit method to do this; it involves division by integers up to ''n'', which explains the rational coefficients. Because of these divisions, the mentioned statement fails in general when coefficients are taken in a field of finite [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]; however it is valid with coefficients in any ring containing the rational numbers.

=== Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ===
{{Main|Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial}}
For each nonnegative integer ''k'', the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of all distinct [[monomial]]s of degree ''k'' in the variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For instance
:&lt;math&gt;h_3(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3+X_1^2X_2+X_1^2X_3+X_1X_2^2+X_1X_2X_3+X_1X_3^2+X_2^3+X_2^2X_3+X_2X_3^2+X_3^3.&lt;/math&gt;
The polynomial ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is also the sum of all distinct monomial symmetric polynomials of degree ''k'' in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance for the given example
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 h_3(X_1,X_2,X_3)&amp;=m_{(3)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)+m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)+m_{(1,1,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)\\
 &amp;=(X_1^3+X_2^3+X_3^3)+(X_1^2X_2+X_1^2X_3+X_1X_2^2+X_1X_3^2+X_2^2X_3+X_2X_3^2)+(X_1X_2X_3).\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

All symmetric polynomials in these variables can be built up from complete homogeneous ones: any symmetric polynomial in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained from the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), …, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) via multiplications and additions. More precisely:
:Any symmetric polynomial ''P'' in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a polynomial expression in the polynomials ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''.
:If ''P'' has ''integral'' coefficients, then the polynomial expression also has ''integral'' coefficients.
For example, for ''n'' = 2, the relevant complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials are {{math|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The first polynomial in the list of examples above can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;X_1^3+ X_2^3-7=-2h_1(X_1,X_2)^3+3h_1(X_1,X_2)h_2(X_1,X_2)-7.&lt;/math&gt;
As in the case of power sums, the given statement applies in particular to the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials beyond ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), allowing them to be expressed in terms of the ones up to that point; again the resulting identities become invalid when the number of variables is increased.

An important aspect of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials is their relation to elementary symmetric polynomials, which can be expressed as the identities
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^ie_i(X_1,\ldots,X_n)h_{k-i}(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;, for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and any number of variables&amp;nbsp;''n''.
Since ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are both equal to&amp;nbsp;1, one can isolate either the first or the last term of these summations; the former gives a set of equations that allows one to recursively express the successive complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, and the latter gives a set of equations that allows doing the inverse. This implicitly shows that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'': one first expresses the symmetric polynomial in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, and then expresses those in terms of the mentioned complete homogeneous ones.

=== Schur polynomials ===
{{Main|Schur polynomial}}
Another class of symmetric polynomials is that of the Schur polynomials, which are of fundamental importance in the applications of symmetric polynomials to [[representation theory]]. They are however not as easy to describe as the other kinds of special symmetric polynomials; see the main article for details.

==Symmetric polynomials in algebra==
Symmetric polynomials are important to [[linear algebra]], [[representation theory]], and [[Galois theory]]. They are also important in [[combinatorics]], where they are mostly studied through the [[ring of symmetric functions]], which avoids having to carry around a fixed number of variables all the time.

==Alternating polynomials==
{{Main|Alternating polynomials}}

Analogous to symmetric polynomials are [[alternating polynomials]]: polynomials that, rather than being ''invariant'' under permutation of the entries, change according to the [[sign of a permutation|sign of the permutation]].

These are all products of the [[Vandermonde polynomial]] and a symmetric polynomial, and form a [[quadratic extension]] of the ring of symmetric polynomials: the Vandermonde polynomial is a square root of the discriminant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">In [[graph theory]], the '''Tutte matrix''' ''A'' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] used to determine the existence of a [[perfect matching]]: that is, a set of [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s which is incident with each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] exactly once.

If the set of vertices ''V'' has ''n'' elements then the Tutte matrix is an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix A with entries

: &lt;math&gt;A_{ij} = \begin{cases} x_{ij}\;\;\mbox{if}\;(i,j) \in E \mbox{ and } i&lt;j\\
-x_{ji}\;\;\mbox{if}\;(i,j) \in E \mbox{ and } i&gt;j\\
0\;\;\;\;\mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are indeterminates.  The [[determinant]] of this [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] matrix is then a polynomial (in the variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'',&amp;nbsp;''i&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;j'' ): this coincides with the square of the [[pfaffian]] of the matrix ''A'' and is non-zero (as a polynomial) if and only if a perfect matching exists.  (This polynomial is not the [[Tutte polynomial]] of ''G''.)

The Tutte matrix is named after [[W. T. Tutte]], and is a generalisation of the [[Edmonds matrix]] for a balanced [[bipartite graph]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3782">In algebra, the '''Vandermonde polynomial''' of an ordered set of ''n'' variables &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots, X_n&lt;/math&gt;, named after [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]], is the polynomial:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n = \prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n} (X_j-X_i).&lt;/math&gt;
(Some sources use the opposite order &lt;math&gt;(X_i-X_j)&lt;/math&gt;, which changes the sign &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; times: thus in some dimensions the two formulae agree in sign, while in others they have opposite signs.)

It is also called the '''Vandermonde determinant,''' as it is the [[determinant]] of the [[Vandermonde matrix]].

The value depends on the order of the terms: it is an [[alternating polynomial]], not a [[symmetric polynomial]].

== Alternating ==
The defining property of the Vandermonde polynomial is that it is ''alternating'' in the entries, meaning that permuting the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; by an [[odd permutation]] changes the sign, while permuting them by an [[even permutation]] does not change the value of the polynomial – in fact, it is the basic alternating polynomial, as will be made precise below.

It thus depends on the order, and is zero if two entries are equal – this also follows from the formula, but is also consequence of being alternating: if two variables are equal, then switching them both does not change the value and inverts the value, yielding &lt;math&gt;V_n = -V_n,&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;V_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the characteristic is not 2, otherwise being alternating is equivalent to being symmetric).

Conversely, the Vandermonde polynomial is a factor of every alternating polynomial: as shown above, an alternating polynomial vanishes if any two variables are equal, and thus must have &lt;math&gt;(X_i - X_j)&lt;/math&gt; as a factor for all &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Alternating polynomials ===
{{main|Alternating polynomial}}
Thus, the Vandermonde polynomial (together with the [[symmetric polynomial]]s) generates the [[alternating polynomial]]s.

== Discriminant ==
Its square is widely called the [[discriminant]], though some sources call the Vandermonde polynomial itself the discriminant.

The discriminant (the square of the Vandermonde polynomial: &lt;math&gt;\Delta=V_n^2&lt;/math&gt;) does not depend on the order of terms, as &lt;math&gt;(-1)^2=1&lt;/math&gt;, and is thus an invariant of the ''unordered'' set of points.

If one adjoins the Vandermonde polynomial to the ring of symmetric polynomials in ''n'' variables &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the [[quadratic extension]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n[V_n]/\langle V_n^2-\Delta\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is the ring of [[alternating polynomials]].

== Vandermonde polynomial of a polynomial ==
Given a polynomial, the Vandermonde polynomial of its roots is defined over the [[splitting field]]; for a non-monic polynomial, with leading coefficient ''a'', one may define the Vandermonde polynomial as
:&lt;math&gt;V_n = a^{n-1}\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n} (X_j-X_i),&lt;/math&gt;
(multiplying with a leading term) to accord with the discriminant.

==Generalizations==
Over arbitrary rings, one instead uses a different polynomial to generate the alternating polynomials – see (Romagny, 2005).

===Weyl character formula===
{{main|Weyl character formula}} (a vast generalization)

The Vandermonde polynomial can be considered a special case of the [[Weyl character formula]], specifically the [[Weyl denominator formula]] (the case of the [[trivial representation]]) of the [[special unitary group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Vector field reconstruction'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PRE/v51/i5/p4262_1 Global Vector Field Reconstruction from a Chaotic Experimental Signal in Copper Electrodissolution.] Letellier C, Le Sceller L , Maréchal E, Dutertre P, Maheu B, Gouesbet G, Fei Z, Hudson JL. Physical Review E, 1995 May;51(5):4262-4266&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of creating a [[vector field]] from experimental or computer generated data, usually with the goal of finding a [[differential equation]] [[Mathematical model|model]] of the system.

A [[differential equation]] [[Mathematical model|model]] is one that describes the value of [[dependent variables]] as they evolve in time or space by giving equations involving those variables and their [[derivative]]s with respect to some [[independent variables]], usually time and/or space. An [[ordinary differential equation]] is one in which the system's dependent variables are functions of only one independent variable. Many physical, chemical, biological and electrical systems are well described by ordinary differential equations. Frequently we assume a system is governed by differential equations, but we do not have exact knowledge of the influence of various factors on the state of the system. For instance, we may have an electrical circuit that in theory is described by a system of ordinary differential equations, but due to the tolerance of [[resistors]], variations of the supply [[voltage]] or interference from outside influences we do not know the exact [[parameters]] of the system. For some systems, especially those that support [[Chaos theory|chaos]], a small change in parameter values can cause a large change in the behavior of the system, so an accurate model is extremely important. Therefore, it may be necessary to construct more exact differential equations by building them up based on the actual system performance rather than a theoretical model. Ideally, one would measure all the dynamical variables involved over an extended period of time, using many different [[initial conditions]], then build or fine tune a differential equation model based on these measurements.

In some cases we may not even know enough about the processes involved in a system to even formulate a model. In other cases, we may have access to only one dynamical variable for our measurements, i.e., we have a scalar [[time series]]. If we only have a scalar time series, we need to use the method of time [[delay embedding]] or [[derivative coordinates]] to get a large enough set of dynamical variables to describe the system.

In a nutshell, once we have a set of measurements of the system state over some period of time, we find the derivatives of these measurements, which gives us a local vector field, then determine a global vector field consistent with this local field. This is usually done by a [[least squares]] fit to the derivative data.

==Formulation==

In the best possible case, one has data streams of  measurements of all the system variables, equally spaced in time, say

:s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t), s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ... , s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(t)

for

: ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,

beginning at several different initial conditions. Then the task of finding a vector field, and thus a differential equation model consists of fitting functions, for instance, a [[cubic spline]], to the data to obtain a set of continuous time functions

:x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t), x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ... , x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(t),

computing time derivatives dx&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/dt, dx&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/dt,...,dx&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/dt of the functions, then making a [[least squares]] fit using some sort of orthogonal basis functions ([[orthogonal polynomials]], [[radial basis functions]], etc.) to each component of the tangent vectors to find a global vector field. A differential equation then can be read off the global vector field.

There are various methods of creating the basis functions for the least squares fit.  The most common method is the [[Gram–Schmidt process]]. Which creates a set of orthogonal basis vectors, which can then easily be normalized.  This method begins by first selecting any standard basis β={v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}.  Next, set the first vector v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, we set u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-proj&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This process is repeated to for k vectors, with the final vector being u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;= v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;-∑&lt;sub&gt;(j=1)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(k-1)&lt;/sup&gt;proj&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. This then creates a set of orthogonal standard basis vectors.

The reason for using a standard orthogonal basis rather than a standard basis arises from the creation of the least squares fitting done next.  Creating a least-squares fit begins by assuming some function, in the case of the reconstruction an n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; degree polynomial, and fitting the curve to the data using constants.  The accuracy of the fit can be increased by increasing the degree of the polynomial being used to fit the data.  If a set of non-orthogonal standard basis functions was used, it becomes necessary to recalculate the constant coefficients of the function describing the fit.  However, by using the orthogonal set of basis functions, it is not necessary to recalculate the constant coefficients.

==Applications==

Vector field reconstruction has several applications, and many different approaches.  Some mathematicians have not only used radial basis functions and polynomials to reconstruct a vector field, but they have used [[Lyapunov exponent]]s and [[singular value decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Global vector-field reconstruction of nonlinear dynamical system from a time series with SVD method and validation with Lyapunov exponent. Wei-Dong L, Ren F K, Meunier-Guttin-Cluzel S., Gouesbet G. Chin. Phys. Soc, 2003 December; Vol 12 No 12:1366-1373&lt;/ref&gt;  Gouesbet and Letellier used a multivariate polynomial approximation and least squares to reconstruct their vector field. This method was applied to the [[Rössler system]], and the [[Lorenz system]], as well as [[thermal lens oscillations]].

The Rossler system, Lorenz system and Thermal lens oscillation follows the differential equations in standard system as

:X'=Y, Y'=Z and Z'=F(X,Y,Z)

where F(X,Y,Z) is known as the standard function.&lt;ref&gt;Global vector field reconstruction by using a multivariate polynomial ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; approximation on nets. Gouesbet G. and Letellier C. Physical Review E, 1994 June; Vol 49, No 6: 4955-4972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation issues==

In some situation the model is not very efficient and difficulties can arise if the model has a large number of coefficients and demonstrates a divergent solution.  For example, nonautonomous differential equations give the previously described results.&lt;ref&gt;Constructing nonautonomous differential equations from experimental time series. Bezruchko B.P and Smirnov D.A. Physical Review E, 2000; Vol 63, 016207:1-7&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the modification of the standard approach in application gives a better way of further development of global vector reconstruction.

Usually the system being modeled in this way is a [[chaotic dynamical system]], because chaotic systems explore a large part of the [[phase space]] and the estimate of the global dynamics based on the local dynamics will be better than with a system exploring only a small part of the space.

Frequently, one has only a single scalar time series measurement from a system known to have more than one [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. The time series may not even be from a system variable, but may be instead of a function of all the variables, such as temperature in a stirred tank reactor using several chemical species. In this case, one must use the technique of [[delay coordinate embedding]],&lt;ref&gt;Embedology, Tim Sauer, James A. Yorke, and Martin Casdagli, Santa Fe Institute working paper&lt;/ref&gt; where a state vector consisting of the data at time t and several delayed versions of the data is constructed.

A comprehensive review of the topic is available from &lt;ref&gt;G. Gouesbet, S. Meunier-Guttin-Cluzel and O. Ménard, editors. Chaos and its reconstruction. Novascience Publishers, New-York (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VisSim''' is a visual [[block diagram]] program for simulation of [[dynamical system]]s and [[model based design]] of [[embedded systems]], with its own [[vsual programming language|visual language]]. It is developed by Visual Solutions of [[Westford, Massachusetts]]. Visual Solutions, has been acquired by [[Altair Engineering|Altair]] in August 2015 and its products have been rebranded as solidThinking Embed as a part of [[solidThinking]]'s Model Based Development Suite. With solidThinking Embed, you can develop virtual prototypes of dynamic systems. Models are built by sliding blocks into the work area and wiring them together with the mouse. Embed automatically converts the control diagrams into C-code ready to be downloaded to the target hardware.

VisSim or now solidThinking Embed uses a graphical data flow paradigm to implement dynamic systems based on differential equations. Version 8 adds interactive [[UML state machine|UML]] [[Object Management Group|OMG]] 2 compliant [[State diagram|state chart graphs]] that are placed in VisSim diagrams. This allows the modeling of state based systems such as startup sequencing of process plants or serial protocol decoding.

==Applications==
VisSim/solidThinking Embed is used in [[control system]] design and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and design.&lt;ref name=References&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=VisSim+Visual+Solutions Books on wide variety of technical subjects referencing VisSim] on the [[Google Books Library Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes blocks for arithmetic, Boolean, and [[transcendental function]]s, as well as [[digital filter]]s, [[transfer function]]s, [[numerical integration]] and interactive plotting.&lt;ref name=userguide&gt;''Visual simulation with student VisSim'', by Karen Darnell, 1996, PWS Pub. Co., Boston, {{ISBN|0-534-95485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly modeled systems are aeronautical, biological/medical, digital power, electric motor, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, process, thermal/HVAC and econometric.&lt;ref name=References /&gt;

===Distributing VisSim models===
[[File:VisSim screenshot.PNG|left|thumb|VisSim viewer screenshot with sample model.]]
A read-only version of the software, [http://www.vissim.com/downloads/demos.html VisSim Viewer], is available free of charge and provides a way for people not licensed to use VisSim to run VisSim models.&lt;ref name=Viewer&gt;[http://vissim.com/products/vissim_viewer.html Viewer page] on company website&lt;/ref&gt; This program is intended to allow models to be more widely shared while preserving the model in its published form.&lt;ref name=Viewer /&gt; The viewer will execute any VisSim model, and only allows changes to block and simulation parameters to illustrate different design scenarios. Sliders and buttons may be activated if included in the model.

==Code generation==
The "VisSim/C-Code" add-on generates [[ANSI C]] code for the model, and generates target specific code for on-chip devices like PWM, ADC, encoder, GPIO, I2C etc. This is useful for development of [[embedded systems]]. After the behavior of the controller has been simulated, C-code can be generated, compiled and run on the target. For debugging, VisSim supports an interactive JTAG linkage, called "Hotlink", that allows interactive gain change and plotting of on-target variables. The VisSim generated code has been called efficient and readable, making it well suited for development of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademik.unsri.ac.id/download/journal/files/waset/v47-35.pdf Graphical Environment for Modeling Control Systems in Full Scope Training Simulators]&lt;/ref&gt; VisSim's author served on the X3J11 ANSI C committee and wrote several C compilers, in addition to co-authoring a book on C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Peter+A.+Darnell&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;lr= Books on C by Peter A. Darnell and Philip E. Margolis]&lt;/ref&gt; This deep understanding of ANSI C, and the nature of the resulting [[machine code]] when compiled, is the key to the code generator's efficiency. VisSim can target small [[16-bit]] [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] systems like the [[Texas Instruments]] [[MSP430]], using only 740 bytes flash and 64 bytes of RAM for a small closed-loop [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) actuated system, as well as allowing very high control sample rates over 500&amp;nbsp;kHz on larger [[32-bit]] [[floating point processor]]s like the [[Texas Instruments]] 150&amp;nbsp;MHz F28335.

==Use of model-based development==
{{Main article|Model based design}}
The technique of simulating system performance off-line, and then generating code from the simulation is known as "model-based development". Model-based development for [[embedded system]]s is becoming widely adopted for production systems because it shortens development cycles for hardware development in the same way that [[Model-driven architecture]] shortens production cycles for software development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LGzS1uiUa7AC Principles of model-driven architecture], Stephen J. Mellor, Addison-Wesley, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model building]] is a visual way of describing a situation. In an engineering context, instead of writing and solving a [[system of equations]], model building involves using visual "blocks" to solve the problem. The advantage of using models is that in some cases problems which appear difficult if expressed mathematically may be easier to understand when represented pictorially.

VisSim uses a hierarchical composition to create nested block diagrams. A typical model would consist of "virtual plants" composed of various VisSim "layers", combined if necessary with custom blocks written in C or FORTRAN. A virtual controller can be added and tuned to give desired overall system response. [[Graphical control element (software)|Graphical control element]] such as sliders and buttons allow control of [[what-if analysis]] for operator training or controller tuning.

Although VisSim was originally designed for use by [[control engineer]]s, it can be used for any type of mathematical model.

'''Félix Édouard Justin Émile Borel''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁɛl|lang}}; 7 January 1871 – 3 February 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{DSB |first=Kenneth | last=May | title=Borel, Émile | volume=2 | pages=302–305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[mathematician]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-lille1.fr/asa_2/mathematiques/mathematiques-2.htm Émile Borel's biography] - [[Université Lille Nord de France]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[politician]]. As a mathematician, he was known for his founding work in the areas of [[measure theory]] and [[probability]].

==Biography==
Borel was born in [[Saint-Affrique]], [[Aveyron]], the son of a [[Protestant]] pastor.&lt;ref name="McElroy 2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=McElroy, Tucker |title=A to Z of Mathematicians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiZIWtX9AJUC&amp;pg=PA46 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0921-3 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]] and [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] before applying to both the [[École normale supérieure]] and the [[École Polytechnique]]. Although he qualified for both, he chose to attend the former institution in 1889. That year he won the [[concours général]], an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the [[agrégation]], a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agrégé. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled ''Sur quelques points de la théorie des fonctions'' ("On some points in the theory of functions"). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the [[University of Lille]], during which time he published 22 research papers. He returned to the École normale in 1897, and was appointed to the chair of theory of function, which he held until 1941.&lt;ref name="Chang 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chang, Sooyoung |title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=2011 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4282-29-1 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Borel married 17-year-old Marguerite, the daughter of colleague [[Paul Émile Appel]]; she later wrote more than 30 novels under the pseudonym [[Camille Marbo]]. Émile Borel died in Paris on 3 February 1956.&lt;ref name="Chang 2011"/&gt;

==Work==
Along with [[René-Louis Baire]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]], Émile Borel was among the pioneers of [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] and its application to [[probability theory]]. The concept of a [[Borel set]] is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing [[thought experiment]] that entered popular culture under the name [[infinite monkey theorem]] or the like.  He also published a series of papers (1921–27) that first defined [[game theory|games of strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74060/Emile-Borel "Émile Borel," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[special relativity]] with expository work. For instance, his book ''Introduction Geometrique à quelques Théories Physiques''&lt;ref&gt;Émile Borel (1914) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04710001 Introduction Geometrique à quelques Théories Physiques], Gauthier-Villars, link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs&lt;/ref&gt; described [[hyperbolic rotation]]s as transformations that leave a hyperbola [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]] just as a circle around a rotational center is stable.

In 1928 he co-founded [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris.

==Political career==
In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, he was active in politics. In 1922, he founded [[Paris Institute of Statistics]], the oldest French school for statistics. From 1924 to 1936, he was a member of the [[French National Assembly]]. In 1925, he was [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of Marine]] in the cabinet of fellow mathematician [[Paul Painlevé]]. During the [[Second World War]], he was a member of the [[French Resistance]].

==Honors==

Besides the ''Centre Émile Borel'' at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris
and a [[Borel (crater)|crater on the Moon]], the following mathematical notions are named after him:
