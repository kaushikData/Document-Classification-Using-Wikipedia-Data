The '''Água Preta virus''' is probably a [[herpesvirus|herpes-like virus]] as determined by thin-section electron microscopy. It was isolated from a species of [[bat]], [[Carolloa subrufa]], in the [[Utinga Forest]] near [[Belem]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahy|first=Brian W J|title=A dictionary of virology|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, Calif.

'''''Aquifex pyrophilus''''' is a rod-shaped [[bacterium]] with a length of 2 to 6 [[micrometre|micrometers]] and a diameter of around half a micrometer. It is one of a handful of species in the [[Aquificae]] phylum, an unusual group of [[thermophilia|thermophilic]] bacteria that are thought to be some of the oldest species in the [[bacteria]] [[domain (biology)|domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beblo|first1=Kristina|last2=Douki|first2=Thierry|last3=Schmalz|first3=Gottfried|last4=Rachel|first4=Reinhard|last5=Wirth|first5=Reinhard|last6=Huber|first6=Harald|last7=Reitz|first7=Günther|last8=Rettberg|first8=Petra|title=Survival of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms after exposure to UV-C, ionizing radiation and desiccation|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=2011|volume=193|issue=11|pages=797–809|doi=10.1007/s00203-011-0718-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.kenyon.edu:80/Microbial_Biorealm/bacteria/aquifex/aquifex.htm |title=Aquifex |publisher=Kenyon College |accessdate=2 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312181937/http://biology.kenyon.edu/Microbial_Biorealm/bacteria/aquifex/aquifex.htm |archivedate=12 March 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deckert"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6674/pdf/392353a0.pdf |author1=Gerard Deckert |author2=Patrick V.

''Aquifex pyrophilus'' grows best in water between 85 and 95&amp;nbsp;°C, and can be found near underwater [[volcano]]es or [[hot spring]]s. It typically uses [[oxygen]] in its [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], producing water as a byproduct, thus leading to the name "Aquifex," meaning "water-maker." However ''A. pyrophilus'' can even grow [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]]ally by reducing [[nitrogen]] instead of oxygen. Members of the species tend to form large cell conglomerations, comprising up to 100 individual cells. It was discovered just north of [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Prokaryotes: An Evolving Electronic Resource for the Microbiological Community |year=2004 |publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genome]] of ''[[Aquifex aeolicus]]'', a member of the same genus, has been successfully mapped. Comparison of this genome to other organisms showed that around 16% of its genes originated from the [[Archaea]] domain. It is assumed that ''A. pyrophilus'' also has this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bacdive.dsmz.de/index.php?search=508&amp;submit=Search |title=Type strain of ''Aquifex pyrophilus'' |publisher=Bac''Dive'' -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203013253/http://bacdive.dsmz.de/index.php?search=508&amp;submit=Search |archivedate=3 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''baiji''' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:白鱀豚|白鱀豚]]|p={{Audio|zh-bai2ji4tun2.ogg|báijìtún}}}}, ''Lipotes vexillifer'', ''Lipotes'' meaning "left behind", ''vexillifer'' "flag bearer") is a functionally extinct species of [[River dolphin|freshwater dolphin]] formerly found only in the [[Yangtze River]] in [[China]]. Nicknamed "Goddess of the Yangtze" ({{zh|s=长江女神|t=長江女神|p=Cháng Jiāng nǚshén}}) in China, the dolphin is also called '''Chinese river dolphin''', '''Yangtze River dolphin''', '''whitefin dolphin''' and '''Yangtze dolphin'''. It was regarded as the goddess of protection by local fishermen and boatmen in China (Zhou, 1991).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |author=NOAA Fisheries |title=Chinese River Dolphin / Baiji ''(Lipotes vexillifer) '' :: NOAA Fisheries |website=www.fisheries.noaa.gov |url=http://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/dolphins/chinese-river-dolphin.html |accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with the [[Chinese white dolphin]] or the [[finless porpoise]].

The baiji population declined drastically in decades as China industrialized and made heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation, and [[hydroelectricity]]. It has been credibly claimed, after surveys in the Yangtze River during the 1980s, that baiji could be the first dolphin species in history that humans have driven to extinction. A Conservation Action Plan for Cetaceans of the Yangtze River was approved by the Chinese Government in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2006 |title=Conservation of the Baiji: No Simple Solution |journal=Conservation Biology |publisher=Society for Conservation Biology |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00471.x |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=623–625|last1=Wang |first1=Ding |last2=Zhang |first2=Xianfeng |last3=Wang |first3=Kexiong |last4=Wei |first4=Zhuo |last5=Wursig |first5=Bernd |last6=Braulik |first6=Gillian T. |last7=Ellis |first7=Susie }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to conserve the species, but a [[Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition 2006|late 2006 expedition]] failed to find any baiji in the river.

It also signified the disappearance of an entire mammal family of river dolphins (Lipotidae).&lt;ref name="iucn ssc"/&gt;  The baiji's extinction would be the first recorded extinction of a well-studied [[cetacea]]n species (it is unclear if some previously extinct varieties were species or subspecies) to be directly attributable to human influence.

Swiss economist and CEO of the baiji.org Foundation, August Pfluger, funded an expedition in which an international team, taken in part from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Fisheries Research Agency in Japan, searched for six weeks for signs of the dolphin. The search took place almost a decade after the last exploration in 1997, which turned up only 13 of the cetaceans.&lt;ref name=DeMoss2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeMoss |first=Jennifer |year=2007 |title=''Species at Risk'' Baiji ''(Lipotes vexillifer)'' |journal=Endangered Species Update |publisher=University of Michigan |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=24–25 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/janmar2007/species%20at%20risk%20baji.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known living baiji was Qiqi (淇淇), who died in 2002. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] is calling for the preservation of any possible baiji habitat, in case the species is located and can be revived.&lt;ref name=DeMoss2007/&gt;

Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th Ed. The Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yangtze River Dolphin is pale blue to gray on the dorsal (back) side, and white on the ventral (belly) side. It has a long and slightly-upturned beak with 31–36 conical teeth on either jaw. Its [[dorsal fin]] is low and triangular in shape and resembles a light-colored flag when the dolphin swims just below the surface of the murky [[Yangtze River]], hence the name "white-flag" dolphin. It has smaller eyes compared to oceanic dolphins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When escaping from danger, the baiji can reach {{convert|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but usually stays within {{convert|30|to|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Because of its poor vision, the baiji relies primarily on [[Animal echolocation|sonar]] for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams |first=Douglas |year=1990 |title=Last Chance To See |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=0517582155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sonar system also plays an important role in socializing, predator avoidance, group coordination, and expressing emotions. Sound emission is focused and highly directed by the shape of the skull and melon. Peak frequencies of echolocation clicks are between 70&amp;nbsp;kHz and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wei |first1=Chong |last2=Zhang |first2=Yu |last3=Au |first3=Whitlow W.

==Distribution==
Historically the baiji occurred along {{convert|1,700|km|mi}} of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze from [[Yichang]] in the west to the mouth of the river, near to [[Shanghai]], as well as in Poyang and Dongting lakes, and the smaller Qiantang river to the south. This had been reduced by several hundred kilometres both upstream and downstream, and was limited to the main channel of the Yangtze, principally the middle reaches between the two large tributary lakes, [[Dongting Lake|Dongting]] and [[Lake Poyang|Poyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Reeves |editor1-first=R.

==Evolutionary history==
{{technical|section|date=June 2018}}
Fossil records suggest that the [[dolphin]] first appeared 25 million years ago and migrated from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the Yangtze River 20 million years ago.&lt;ref name=ChinaDialogue&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/673-Farewell-to-the-baiji |title=Farewell to the baiji|publisher=China Dialogue|date=January 10, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2007|author=Yongchen Wang|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011410/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/673-Farewell-to-the-baiji| archivedate= September 28, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of four species of dolphins known to have made [[fresh water]] their exclusive habitat. The [[river dolphin|other five species]], including the [[boto]] and the [[La Plata dolphin]], have survived in the [[Río de la Plata]] and [[Amazon river|Amazon]] rivers in South America and the [[Ganges]] and [[Indus]] rivers on the Indian subcontinent.

It is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary ''[[Erya]]'' circa 3rd century BC.

It is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, ''Platanista'' and ''Lipotes'' + (''Inia'' + ''Pontoporia''), having no sister relationship with each other, and the ''Platanista'' lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the ''Platanista'' is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The ''Lipotes'' has a sister relationship with ''Inia + pontoporia'', and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based
on short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = K. | last3 = Gaung | first3 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = Molecular phylogenetics of 'river dolphins' and the baiji mitochondrial genome | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 743–750 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.06.009| pmid = 16046150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a highlevel of overall genetic structure. The males having a higher genetic differentiation than the females suggested a significant female –biased dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Yang|first1 = G.|last2 = Liu|first2 = S.|last3 = Ren|first3 = W.|last4 = Zhou|first4 = K.|last5 = Wei |first5 = F.|year = 2003|title = Mitochondrial control region variability of baiji and the Yangtze finless porpoises, two sympatric small cetaceans in the Yangtze river|journal = Acta Therologica|volume = 48|issue = 4|pages = 469–483|doi=10.1007/bf03192493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aquatic adaptations of the baiji and other cetaceans have happened slowly and can be linked to positively selected genes (PSGs) and/or other functional changes. Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into PSGs in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including [[microcephaly]]. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much if the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Baiji genomes reveal low genetic variability and new insights into secondary aquatic adaptations|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131029/ncomms3708/full/ncomms3708.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2013-10-29|pmc = 3826649|pmid = 24169659|volume = 4|pages = 2708|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3708|first = Xuming|last = Zhou|first2 = Fengming|last2 = Sun|first3 = Shixia|last3 = Xu|first4 = Guangyi|last4 = Fan|first5 = Kangli|last5 = Zhu|first6 = Xin|last6 = Liu|first7 = Yuan|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chengcheng|last8 = Shi|first9 = Yunxia|last9 = Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.&lt;ref name="Zhou"/&gt;

== Folklore ==
Per Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze. He was evil, and a greedy man out for his own self-interest. One day, he took the girl on a boat, intending to sell her on the market. Out on the river, though, he became infatuated with her beauty and tried to take advantage of her. But she freed herself by plunging into the river whereupon a big storm came and sank the boat. After the storm had thus settled, people saw a beautiful dolphin swimming – the incarnation of the girl – which became known as the ‘Goddess of the Yangtze.’ The baiji, in the region of Yangtze, is regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marderspacher | first1 = F | year = 2007 | title = Bye Baiji? | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.08.055 | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = R783–R784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.china.org.cn/english/environment/36657.htm|title=Rescue Plan Prepared for Yangtze River Dolphins|work=[[China Daily]]|date=July 11, 2002|accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. Now the most endangered cetacean in the world, according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', the baiji was last sighted in August 2004, though there was a possible sighting in 2007.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; It is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. government under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. It is now thought to be extinct.

===Causes of decline===
{{see also|Yangtze River#Degradation of the river|Water pollution in China}}
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) has noted the following as threats to the species: a period of hunting by humans during the [[Great Leap Forward]], entanglement in [[fishing net|fishing gear]], the illegal practice of [[Electrofishing|electric fishing]], [[ship strike|collisions with boats and ships]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]], and [[water pollution|pollution]]. Further studies have noted that a lack of information on the baiji's historical distribution or ecology, the environmental impact of the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] on the living space of the baiji, and the failure to act for the protection of the baiji are also threats to the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walters |first=Mark Jerome |date=November 1993 |title=Who speak for the baiji? |journal=Animals |publisher=EBSCO |volume=126 |issue=6 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Leap Forward]], when traditional veneration of the baiji was denounced, it was hunted for its flesh and skin, and quickly became scarce.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=B. D. |last2=Zhou |first2=K. |last3=Wang |first3=D. |last4=Reeves |first4=R. R. |last5=Barlow |first5=J. |last6=Taylor |first6=B.

As China developed economically, pressure on the river dolphin grew significantly. [[Industrial waste|Industrial]] and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5122074.stm|title = Last Chance for China's Dolphin|date=June 27, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706045903/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5122074.stm|archivedate= July 6, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of anthropogenic led causes (e.g. boat collisions, dam construction) which also threaten freshwater cetaceans in other river systems, have been implicated in the decline of the baiji population. However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets ([[gill nets]] and [[fyke]] nets) and [[electrofishing]]; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was
the victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Turvey, S.T. |author2=Rovbert, P.L. |author3=Taylor, B.L. |author4=Barlow, J. |author5=Akamatsu, T. |author6=Barrett, L.A. |author7=Zhao, X. |author8=Reeves, R.

Its extinction merely reflects the latest stage in the progressive ecological deterioration of the Yangtze region. In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to [[bycatch|entanglement]] in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered "the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival."&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt; Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.

There are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by parasitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in [[epizootic]]s, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had [[Helminthiasis|helminth]] infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = S | last2 = Ju | first2 = J | last3 = Zhou | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = L | last5 = Zhou | first5 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Considerable MHC Diversity Suggests That the Functional Extinction of Baiji Is Not Related to Population Genetic Collapse | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = e30423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030423 | pmid=22272349 | pmc=3260281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji. A model provided by Yangtze fishing communities show that the baiji population was not connected by geographical range or fragmentation of location, as the baiji make long-term and periodic movements throughout several years. The movements of the baiji left the species unaffected by dwindling geographical range.&lt;ref name="geographical range"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=Samuel T. |last2=Barrett |first2=Leigh A. |last3=Hart |first3=Tom |last4=Collen |first4=Ben |author5=Hao Yujiang |author6=Zhang Lei |author7=Zhang Xinqiao |author8=Wang Xianyan |author9=Huang Yadong |author10=Zhou Kaiya |author11=Wang Ding |date=October 22, 2010 |title=Spatial and temporal extinction dynamics in a freshwater cetacean |publisher=Royal Society |jstor=20780101 |volume=277 |pages=3139–3147 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.0584 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|pmc=2982057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation efforts===
During the 1970s, China recognized the precarious state of the river dolphin. The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.

In 1978, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (淡水海豚研究中心) as a branch of the [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of [[Wuhan]] (武汉白鱀豚保护基金), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 [[Renminbi|CNY]] (about 100,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]) and used the funds for [[in vitro]] cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.
[[Image:Baiji conservation efforts map.png|thumb|right|350px|Conservation efforts of the baiji along the Yangtze River]]
Since 1992, five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves ([[Shishou|Shishou City]] and Xin-Luo) and two provincial ([[Tongling]] and [[Zhenjiang]]). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been
established along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and
illegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction
of these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken
in the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As
humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided 
, the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a
habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conversationalists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and
Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment 
for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the [[finless porpoise]], to breed. Through careful management,
both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduced successfully enough to
provide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = K. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | last4 = Pfluger | first4 = A. | last5 = Barrett | first5 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Range-wide Yangtze freshwater dolphin expedition: The last chance to see Baiji''?'' | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Pollution Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 418–424 | doi=10.1065/espr2006.10.350| pmid = 17120833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth protected area is an isolated [[oxbow lake]] located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve|Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve]]. Combined, these five reserves cover just over {{convert|350|km|mi}}, about 1/3 of the baijis range, leaving two-thirds of the species' habitat unprotected.&lt;ref name="workshop" /&gt;

As well as these five protected areas there are also five "Protection Stations" in Jianli, Chenglingji, Hukou, Wuhu and Zhengjiang. These stations consist of two observers and a motorized fishing boat with the aim of conducting daily patrols, making observations and investigating reports of illegal fishing.&lt;ref name=workshop/&gt;

In 2001, the Chinese government approved a Conservation Action Plan for Cetaceans of the Yangtze River. This plan re-emphasised the three measures identified at the 1986 workshop and was adopted as the national policy for the conservation of the Baiji. Despite all of these workshops and conventions little money was available in China to aid the conservation efforts. It has been estimated that US$1 million was needed to begin the project and maintain it for a further 3 years.&lt;ref name=ZSL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |title=Conservation of the Yangtze River Dolphin: Emergency Implementation Meeting |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=December 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619235441/http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to save the mammals proved to be too little and too late. August Pfluger, chief executive of the Baiji.org Foundation, said, "The strategy of the Chinese government was a good one, but we didn't have time to put it into action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK307754.htm|title=  INTERVIEW-Chinese river dolphin almost certainly extinct|agency=[[Reuters AlertNet]]|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=December 30, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070102091941/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK307754.htm| archivedate= January 2, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the conservation attempts have been criticized, as even with the international attention about the need for conservation for the baiji, the Chinese government did not "[make] any serious investment" to protect the baiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reeves|first=Randall R.|last2=Gales|first2=Nicholas J.|date=2006|title=Realities of Baiji Conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=626–628|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00472.x|pmid=16909545}}&lt;!--|access-date=October 29, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====In situ conservation====
Most scientists agreed that the best course of action was an [[Ex-situ conservation|ex-situ]] effort working in parallel with an [[In-situ conservation|in situ]] effort. The deterioration of the Yangtze River had to be reversed to preserve the habitat. The ex-situ projects aimed to raise a large enough population over time so that some, if not all, of the dolphins could be returned to the Yangtze, so the habitat within the river had to be maintained anyway.

====Ex-situ conservation====
The Shishou Tian-e-Zhou is a {{convert|21|km|mi|adj=on}} long, {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} wide [[oxbow lake]] located near Shishou City in Hubei Province. Shishou has been described as being "like a miniature Yangtze … possessing all of the requirements for a semi-natural reserve". From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze [[finless porpoise]]. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the ‘island’ within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.&lt;ref name=workshop/&gt;

The success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |title=Responsible Ecotourism at Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve |publisher=baiji.org |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617043837/http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve. The necessary infrastructure does not currently exist to realize these opportunities.

====Captive specimens====
A baiji conservation [[dolphinarium]] was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large ({{convert|25|m}} arc [kidney shaped] x {{convert|7|m}} wide x {{convert|3.5|m}} deep, {{convert|10|m}} diameter, {{convert|2|m}} deep and {{convert|12|m}} diameter, {{convert|3.5|m}} deep) and so are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.

[[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carwardine | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = The baiji: So long and thanks for all the fish | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 195 | issue = | pages = 50–53 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)62350-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology [[dolphinarium]] from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in [[Dongting Lake]], he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve]] (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only [[finless porpoise]]s since 1990, was flooded.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Two expedition boats cruise along the Yangtze ..jpg|right|thumb|200px|Two research vessels cruising the Yangtze in search of the baiji.]] --&gt;
The [[Xinhua News Agency]] announced on December 4, 2006 that no Chinese river dolphins were detected in a six-week survey of the Yangtze River conducted by 30 researchers. The failure of the [[Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition 2006|Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition]] ({{zh|s=长江淡水豚类考察|t=長江淡水豚類考察|p=Chāng Jiāng dànshuǐ túnlèi kǎochá}}) raised suspicions of the first unequivocal extinction of a [[cetacea]]n species due to human action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/176223.html|title=Rare Yangtze dolphin may be extinct|accessdate=December 5, 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107232529/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/176223.html| archivedate=January 7, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (some extinct baleen whale populations might not have been distinct species). Poor water and weather conditions may have prevented sightings,&lt;ref name=baiji/&gt; but expedition leaders declared it "[[functionally extinct]]" on December 13, 2006, as fewer are likely to be alive than are needed to propagate the species.&lt;ref name=baiji/&gt; However, footage believed to be a baiji from August 2007 was released to the public.&lt;ref name=brink/&gt;

The [[Japanese sea lion]] and [[Caribbean monk seal]] disappeared in the 1950s, the last aquatic mammals to become extinct. Several land-based mammal [[species]] and [[subspecies]] have disappeared since then. If the baiji is now extinct, the [[vaquita]] has become the most endangered marine mammal species.

Some scientists retain hope for the species:
{{pull quote|1=The fact that the expedition didn't see any baiji dolphins during this expedition does not necessarily mean that the species is extinct or even 'effectively extinct', because it covered a considerable distance in a relatively short period of time... However, we are extremely concerned. The Yangtze is highly degraded, and we spotted dramatically fewer finless porpoises than we have in the past.|author=Wang Limin, director of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], Wuhan office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=77691 |title=Chinese River Dolphin (Baiji) Feared Extinct, Hope Remains for Finless Porpoise |publisher=[[World Wildlife Federation|WWF]] |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=December 15, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A report of the expedition was published online in the journal ''[[Biology Letters]]'' on August 7, 2007, in which the authors conclude "We are forced to conclude that the baiji is now likely to be extinct, probably due to unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/5/537.short|title=First human-caused extinction of a cetacean species?|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|date=August 7, 2007|last=Turvey|first=Samuel T.|author2=Pitman, Robert L. |author3=Taylor, Barbara L. |author4=Barlow, Jay |author5=Akamatsu, Tomonari |author6=Barrett, Leigh A. |author7=Zhao, Xuijiang |author8=Reeves, Randall R. |author9=Stewert, Brent S. |author10=Wang, Kexiong |author11=Wei, Zhuo |author12=Zhang, Xianfeng |author13=Pusser, L.T. |author14=Richlen, Michael |author15=Brandon, John R. |author16=Wang, Ding |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Royal Society Publishing|accessdate=August 8, 2007|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0292|volume=3|pages=537–40|pmid=17686754|issue=5|pmc=2391192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Witness to Extinction: How We Failed To Save The Yangtze River Dolphin", an account of the 2006 baiji survey by Samuel Turvey, the lead author of the ''Biology Letters'' paper, was published by Oxford University Press in autumn 2008. This book investigated the baiji's probable extinction within the wider-scale context of how and why international efforts to conserve the species had failed, and whether conservation recovery programmes for other threatened species were likely to face similar potentially disastrous administrative hurdles.

Some reports suggest that information about the baiji and its demise is being suppressed in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.null-hypothesis.co.uk/science/straight-talking/science-mutters/sad_baiji_yangtse_river_dolphin|title=R.I.P. Yangtse River Dolphin – Null Hypothesis|work=null-hypothesis.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports cite government media English language reports in [[China Central Television]] and [[Xinhua News Agency]] as evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/21/content_5632307.htm|title=Endemic dolphin "extinction" mirrors Yangtze health decline|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]|date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Zeng Yujiang reportedly videotaped a large white animal swimming in the Yangtze in [[Anhui]] Province.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/29/content_6627940.htm "Extinct" white-flag dolphin spotted in Yangtze River]. news.xinhuanet.com. August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Kexiong of the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has tentatively confirmed that the animal on the video is a baiji.

On October 3, 2011 the sighting of almost 20 porpoises was reported in Chinese media. The sighting was done from a bridge in Nanjing city. It should be noted however, that the sighting has not been confirmed by independent media sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/society/2/detail_2011_10/03/9629926_0.shtml|title=南京市民发现近20头江豚现身长江大桥下|date=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2007, Chinese state media announced that under a development plan an additional 4,000,000 people will be relocated from their homes near the dam by the year 2020 due to ecological concerns, while a forum of officials and experts warned of a possible “environmental catastrophe” if preventive measures are not taken.&lt;ref name=BBC_101307&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7042660.stm|title=Millions forced out by China dam|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=October 13, 2007|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Xinhua_101107&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-10/11/content_6864252.htm|title=Millions more face relocation from Three Gorges Reservoir Area|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=October 11, 2007|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Xinhua_092607&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-09/26/content_6796234.htm|title=China warns of environmental "catastrophe" from Three Gorges Dam|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the quality of water in the Yangtze is falling rapidly, due to the dam's preventing dispersal of pollutants; algae blooms have risen progressively since the dam’s construction; and soil erosion has increased, causing riverbank collapses and landslides.&lt;ref name="Time_101307"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1671000,00.html|title=China's Three Gorges Dam Under Fire|date=October 12, 2007|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Lin|last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report detailing this was officially released in September 2007.&lt;ref name=MWC_News_101307&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwcnews.net/content/view/17341&amp;Itemid=1 |title=MWC News – A Site Without Borders – – China dam to displace millions more |publisher=Mwcnews.net |accessdate=November 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023044423/http://mwcnews.net/content/view/17341%26Itemid%3D1 |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior Chinese government officials and scholars said the dam could cause a “huge disaster&amp;nbsp;... if steps are not taken promptly.”&lt;ref name="Time_101307" /&gt; The same scholars and officials previously had defended the Three Gorges Dam project.&lt;ref name=TheAge_101307&gt;Toy, Mary-Anne [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/three-gorges-dam-could-be-huge-disaster/2007/09/26/1190486394786.html "Three Gorges Dam 'could be huge disaster'"], theage.com.au.

== History ==
[[File:Bangladesh National Museum southern side (01).jpg|thumb|left|Southern side]]

Bangladesh National Museum was originally established on 20 March 1913, albeit under another name (the Dhaka Museum), and formally inaugurated on 7 August 1913 by [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael]], the governor of Bengal. In July 1915 it was handed over to the Naib-Nazim of Dhaka.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/eventful-innings|title=Eventful Innings|date=2013-08-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bangladesh National Museum was formed through the incorporation of Dhaka museum and it was made the national museum of Bangladesh on 17 November 1983. It is located at Shahbag, Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bangladeshmuseum.gov.bd/site/|title=Welcome to Bangladesh National Museum|website=bangladeshmuseum.gov.bd|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:National Museum1.JPG|thumb|Bangladesh National Museum designed by [[Syed Mainul Hossain]]]]

== Ground floor ==
The ground floor consists of some old guns at the entrance and the hall where the people book their tickets or assemble to hear the history of the museum. The hall leads to a grand staircase. Beside the hall, there is a smaller room which also acts like the hall (it is also used by the guides to tell the visitors about the history) and a simple staircase.

== 1st floor ==
The 1st floor is divided into 22 rooms.

=== 1st room ===
The first room displays a large map showing the map of [[Bangladesh]] and its 64 districts.

=== 2nd room ===
The 2nd room consists of an under going work of a large statue of a [[royal Bengal tiger]].

=== 3rd-10th room ===
These rooms consist of natural beauties found in Bangladesh. In one of the room there is showcase of a tongue of a whale.

=== 10th-22nd room ===
The other rooms contain some historic relics of Bengal up to 1900. There is a room which shows the different boats used by the rural people.

== 2nd floor ==

[[File:Bubbles Within Bubbles (Unannotated).jpg|thumb|250px|Astrophysicist [[Eric Chaisson]] argues in ''Cosmic Evolution'' that optimal energy flows are the key to understanding the origin and evolution of complexity, whether in stars and galaxies (photo courtesy STScI/NASA) or in carbon-based structures such as life-forms and the human brain.]]
'''''Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature''''' (2001) is a book by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Eric Chaisson]].&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt; It examines cosmic evolution which includes the history of natural evolution from the [[Big Bang]] to the present from the perspective of the emerging multi-scientific discipline of [[Big History]].&lt;ref name=twsEllis/&gt; It offers an explanation of why simple structures billions of years ago gave way to more complex structures, such as stars, planets, life, and human beings in complex civilizations.&lt;ref name=twsEllis&gt; Book Review by George Ellis, Nature 412, 587-588 (9 August 2001), doi:10.1038/35088114, Review title: An energetic view of nature, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6847/ An energetic view of nature], Retrieved Sept. 1, 2014, "...stepping back to confront the broader scheme of things..."&lt;/ref&gt; It is written for a general audience interested in science.

==Overview==
Chaisson argues that cosmic history can be examined from the perspective of energy flows.&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsKauffman/&gt; He analyzes the flows of energy through various objects, and argues that these flows are relevant to understanding the relative complexity of these objects.&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt; He suggests that a key measure for scientific analysis should be energy per second per gram, termed "[[energy rate density]]," and that analysis using this yardstick can be used to explain not only human evolution but cosmic evolution.&lt;ref name=twsKauffman/&gt; He sees energy as "work per unit time" which he equates with [[Power (physics)|power]], and shows how energy rate density in some structures has increased over time.&lt;ref name=twsKauffman&gt; Stewart Kauffman, June 30, 2010, NPR, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/06/30/128212122/why-is-the-universe-complex-broken-symmetries-information-energy-work Why Is The Universe Complex? Broken Symmetries, Information, Energy, Work], Retrieved Sept. 1, 2014, "...Eric Chaisson’s Cosmic Evolution is a wonderful discussion ... well supported ... energy density per gram universe per second has increased over the course of cosmic, biological and cultural evolution...&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Chaisson's view, the [[human brain]] uses a much greater amount of energy, relative to its size, than a [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name=twsBraude&gt; Hillel Braude, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 45, Number 2, Spring 2002, pp. 307-309, 10.1353/pbm.2002.0021, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pbm/summary/v045/45.2braude.html Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature (review)], Retrieved Sept. 1, 2014, review of The Rise of Complexity in Nature. By Eric J. Chaisson. Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. Pp. xii + 274...."Cosmic Evolution draws from a rich scientific palette to paint a colorful explanatory model of the ascending complexity in nature ... analysis of energy flows therefore provides the opportunity to map the evolution in complexity of the cosmos...."&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that energy lets us make "order out of disorder"; for example, an air conditioner, which draws current from an electric outlet, can turn a less-complex zone of lukewarm air into two more-complex zones of hot air and cold air, and in so doing, it reverses the disorder in a room.&lt;ref name=twsSeife&gt; Charles Seife (book reviewer), Spring 2001, Wilson Quarterly, [http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/book-reviews/cosmic-evolution-rise-complexity-in-nature COSMIC EVOLUTION: The Rise of Complexity in Nature], Retrieved Sept. 1, 2014, By Eric Chaisson. Harvard Univ. Press. 274 pp. , "...Harvard University astrophysicist Chaisson ... Energy lets us make order out of disorder. ... defines life ... ''open, coherent, space-time structure maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a flow of energy through it''....problem with such a broad definition of life is that it becomes meaningless...&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, organisms do much the same thing with energy but in a more complex way, by taking in food instead of electrons, to keep themselves from disintegrating and becoming less complex; he analyzes energy flows in not just organisms and society, but in inanimate structures such as stars, galaxies, planets.&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt; 

Chaisson notes that increases in [[complexity]] are consistent with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]; according to one reviewer, the second law might suggest that complexity should decrease with the universe "slouching toward disorder."&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsMcShea&gt; Daniel W. McShea (book reviewer), November-December 2001, Volume 89, Number 6, Page: 1, American Scientist, [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/measuring-complexity Measuring Complexity], Retrieved Sept. 1, 2014, "...a complex structure such as a galaxy, a star or an organism is an open system, able to generate and sustain complexity by exporting enough disorder to its surrounding environment to more than make up for its internal gains..."; ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time'' Lineweaver et al. (eds.) Cambridge Univ. Press, 2013 (review), ''Science'', vol. 342, pg 1319, 2013, "Only two other trends on the scale of life’s history have been documented quantitatively—those in body size and in hierarchy or nestedness (prokaryotic cell, multicellular individual, colony). Energy rate density is a fine candidate for a third."&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chaisson argues that complexity can increase because complex structures such as a star can "generate and sustain complexity by exporting enough disorder to its surrounding environment to more than make up for its internal gains."&lt;ref name=twsMcShea/&gt; From this perspective, Chaisson offers a definition of life as an "open, coherent, space-time structure maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a flow of energy through it."&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt; 

Reactions to Chaisson's book are generally positive, although different reviewers took issue with some of his points and writing style. Biologist Daniel W. McShea originally noted that Chaisson is "prone to using inflated language," but a decade later in another review of his work notes that "Chaisson offers data showing a trend in what he calls [[energy rate density]] ... over the history of life (and even over the much longer history of the universe), that's really saying something."&lt;ref name=twsMcShea/&gt; Critic Stewart Kauffman found the book to be a "wonderful discussion."&lt;ref name=twsKauffman/&gt; Critic Hillel Braude wrote "Cosmic Evolution draws from a rich scientific palette to paint a colorful explanatory model of the ascending complexity in nature."&lt;ref name=twsBraude/&gt; Critic Charles Seife wrote highly about Chaisson's book although he criticized Chaisson's definition of life as being "such a broad definition" that it becomes meaningless, while acknowledging that Chaisson's analysis "gives the theory some numerical muscle."&lt;ref name=twsSeife/&gt;  Many more excerpts from reviews of this book are collected here &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of units==

Chaisson chose to use the obsolete [[cgs]] (centimetre, gram, second) system of measurement, rather than [[SI]] units as is standard current practice, for his calculations and numerical estimates - thus quoting energy in ergs (one ten millionth of a [[Joule]]), also using [[calories]], and sometimes kilocalories as alternative measures of energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">'''David 'Dan' Stannard'''  (born 1937 Peshawar, Pakistan of British parents) was a [[Zimbabwe]] policeman who became a Branch Director of the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]], under [[Ken Flower]], thus serving under both the [[Ian Smith]] and [[Robert Mugabe]] administrations. He subsequently became manager of Zimbabwe's cricket team in addition to overseeing security for the [[Zimbabwe Cricket Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Grundy, [http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/The-secret-Zimbabwe-policemans-cricket.2398697.jp The secret Zimbabwe policeman's cricket ball], [[The Scotsman]], 2 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/cricket/765342.stm Pommie pounds Yorkshire], [[BBC]] News, 27 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Stannard, joined the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) in March 1957, becoming  a career policeman, and a detective in the  Criminal Investigation Department (CID), serving with distinction. During his tenure in the CID, he served in several specialist sections, including the Fraud Squad and later headed the section dealing with serious crimes of violence.  Early in his career, he was responsible for investigating the Crocodile Gang (a member of which was eventually to become his political master) for  murders and other serious crimes while stationed in the Manicaland Province.  At one time he investigated elements of Rhodesia's most prestigious military unit – the [[Selous Scouts]] – concerning allegations of poaching and ivory trafficking.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kevin Thomas| authorlink = | title = Shadows in an African Twilight: Game Ranger – Soldier – Hunter|edition= 2008|pages= 1–705 | publisher = uThekwane Press| isbn= 978-0-620-39727-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Stannard was seconded to the [[Rhodesia]]n [[Special Branch]] (SB) as Acting Provincial Special Branch Officer, Salisbury and Mashonaland, shortly before Zimbabwean independence.

At the time of Independence in 1980, Stannard was appointed the official Liaison Officer to work with both ZANU and ZAPU guerrillas who were then based at the Audio Visual Centre at the University. After independence he was transferred to Special Branch Headquarters, where he became Deputy Director (Internal) (DDIN) of Branch I, under Mike Reeves.

He later served as the Director Internal (DIN) of CIO, effectively the head of the Rhodesian Special Branch and oversaw internal intelligence-gathering for the CIO. At the time Zimbabwe was celebrating its new found independence,  Stannard foiled an assassination attempt on Zimbabwean presidential elect [[Robert Mugabe]] by a [[South Africa]]n [[fifth column]] in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonyturton.com/admin/my_documents/my_files/774_History_1975_-_1986_Website_Ready.pdf South African Diary: Contested Identity, My Family – Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt; an event for which he was awarded the [[Gold Cross of Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galago.co.za/CAT1_019_b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senior adviser to the post-independence regime, Stannard and many former Rhodesian agents were retained to train their successors.  [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], the first minister of security, transferred all SB members into the CIO to obviate intelligence getting into the possession of Joshua Nkomo, who was then Minister of Home Affairs. The modus operandi of Rhodesia's campaign to infiltrate political parties, silence public demonstrations, and destabilise action groups during the colonial period were thus passed on to a new generation of partisan intelligence operatives.&lt;ref name="Tyrant"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61925969.html Mugabe's Enforcer Revealed: Zimbabwe's Cricket Chief Was Leader of Tyrant's Secret Police]&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the CIO in 1992, Stannard became manager of the [[Zimbabwe cricket team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/the-secret-zimbabwe-policeman-s-cricket-ball-1-1383506 The secret Zimbabwe policeman's cricket ball]&lt;/ref&gt; As many white cricketers, loyally representing their nation, had family affected by the government's chaotic [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land redistribution]] efforts, he found himself  involved with their pleas and then lobbying for land redesignation to avoid the Mugabe purge, but not always with success.&lt;ref name="Tyrant"/&gt;

Stannard's brother Richard, a former British military policeman, was a public relations officer for the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] during the long-running [[Rhodesian Bush War|bush war]]. Richard later joined the Zimbabwe Intelligence Corps to serve alongside Danny. Their nephew, also Richard Stannard, was a much-decorated veteran of the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]] and [[South African Special Forces Brigade|South African Special Forces]] who later became embroiled with an attempted coup d'etat in the [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=137566 &amp;#91;alpha&amp;#93; INSIGHT – ZIMBABWE – thoughts on CIO determining Mugabe succession – ZA086]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhori virus''' (DHOV) is a species of the genus ''[[Thogotovirus]]'' and a member of the family ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]''.

The '''enthalpy of atomization''' (also atomisation in British spelling) is the [[enthalpy]] change that accompanies the total separation of all atoms in a chemical substance (either a [[chemical element]] or a [[chemical compound]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/g/Enthalpy-Of-Atomization-Definition.htm|title=Enthalpy of Atomization Definition|last=Helmenstine|first=Anne Marie|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often represented by the symbol '''Δ&lt;sub&gt;at&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;at&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'''. All bonds in the compound are broken in atomization and none are formed, so enthalpies of atomization are always positive. The associated [[standard enthalpy]] is known as the '''Standard enthalpy of atomization''', Δ&lt;sub&gt;at&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/([[Joule|kJ]]&amp;thinsp;[[mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), at 298.15&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (or 25 degrees Celsius) and 101.3&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].

==Definition==
Enthalpy of atomization is the amount of enthalpy change when a compound's bonds are broken and the component atoms are reduced to individual atoms.

Enthalpy of atomization is denoted by the symbol ΔHa. The enthalpy change of atomization of gaseous [[water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] is, for example, the sum of the HO–H and H–O [[bond-dissociation energy|bond dissociation enthalpies]].

The enthalpy of atomization of an elemental solid is exactly the same as the [[enthalpy of sublimation]] for any elemental solid that becomes a [[monatomic]] gas upon [[evaporation]].

When a diatomic element is converted to gaseous atoms, only half a mole of molecules will be needed, as the standard enthalpy change is based purely on the production of one mole of gaseous atoms. When the atoms in the molecule are different isotopes of the same element the calculation becomes non-trivial.

Standard enthalpy of atomization is the enthalpy change when 1&amp;nbsp;mol of a substance is dissociated completely into atoms under standard conditions (298.15K, 1 bar).

'''Force-field analysis''' is a development in social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (''forces'') that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by [[Kurt Lewin]], is a significant contribution to the fields of [[social science]], [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication]], [[organizational development]], [[process management]], and [[change management]].

==History==
Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the "field" to be a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychological environment existing in an individual's (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a [[topological]] constellation of constructs. The "field" is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual's "field" (Lewin used the term "life space") describes that person's motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 

Lewin believed that changes of an individual's "life space" depend upon that individual's internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the "life space". Although Lewin did not use the word "experiential" (see [[experiential learning]]), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the "life space" with "external stimuli" (at what he calls the "boundary zone") were important for development (or regression). For Lewin, development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their "life space" has a "boundary zone" experience with external stimuli. Note, it is not merely the experience that causes change in the "life space", but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.

Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of [[group conflict]], [[learning]], [[adolescence]], [[hatred]], [[morale]], German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena, and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field, and hence to determine the causes of human and group behavior.

The '''Francis P. Garvan–John M. Olin Medal''' is an annual award that recognizes distinguished scientific accomplishment, leadership and service to [[chemistry]] by [[:Category:Women chemists|women chemists]]. The Award is offered by the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS), and consists of a cash prize (US$5,000) and a medal.  The medal was designed by [[Margaret Christian Grigor]].

==Background==
Any individual may nominate a single eligible chemist in one year. Nominees must be a female citizen of the United States.

The award was established by [[Francis Patrick Garvan|Francis Garvan]] and Mabel Brady Garvan in 1936 in honor of their daughter. It was initially an essay contest, that ran for seven years, as a memorial to their daughter (the American Chemical Society's Prize Essay Contest). It was solely funded by the Francis P. Garvan Medal Endowment from its establishment in 1936 until 1979. W.&amp;nbsp;R. Grace &amp; Co. assumed co-sponsorship of the award from 1979 to 1983. In 1984, Olin Corporation assumed co-sponsorship. Mabel Brady Garvan remained involved with the Award through 1967.

The Garvan–Olin Award is the ACS' third-oldest award, and the first [[List of prizes, medals, and awards for women in science|award]] established to honor women chemists.

In 1861, Bacon founded a series of businesses. He became bankrupt in 1867, after failing to keep on top of managing these businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dg-maps.com/gw-bacon.html|title=G.W. BACON|website=The Antique Map Shop Ltd|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Bacon started his business, G.W. Bacon &amp; Co., on 127 [[Strand, London|Strand]], London. He based his [[atlases]] on the plates used by [[Edward Weller (cartographer)|Edward Weller]] for his ''Weekly Dispatch Atlas''. In 1893, he bought the map business of [[James Wyld]].

== History ==
The first inroads into the understanding of GAs were developments from the [[plant pathology]] field, with studies on the ''[[bakanae]]'', or "foolish seedling" disease in [[rice]]. Foolish seedling disease causes a strong elongation of rice stems and leaves and eventually causes them to topple over.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B B Stowe|last2=Yamaki|first2=and T.|date=1957|title=The History and Physiological Action of the Gibberellins|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=181–216|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.08.060157.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Japan]]ese scientist Eiichi Kurosawa identified that foolish seedling disease was caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Gibberella fujikuroi]].''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Later work at the University of Tokyo (notable from Yabuta, Sumiki and Hayashi) showed that a substance produced by this fungus triggered the symptoms of foolish seedling disease and they named this substance "gibberellin".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The increased communication between Japan and the west following [[World War II]] enhanced the interest in gibberellin in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Workers at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in the UK and the Department of Agriculture in the US both independently isolated [[gibberellic acid]] &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (with the Americans originally referring to the chemical as "gibberellin-X", before adopting the British name and the chemical is known as gibberellin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in Japan&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;).

Knowledge of gibberellins spread around the world as the potential for its use on various commercially important plants became more obvious. For example, research that started at the [[University of California, Davis]] in the mid-1960s led to its commercial use on [[Sultana (grape)|Thompson seedless table grapes]] throughout California by 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cetulare.ucdavis.edu/pubgrape/tb1400.pdf Gibberellin and Flame Seedless Grapes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206231438/http://cetulare.ucdavis.edu/pubgrape/tb1400.pdf|date=2006-12-06}} from a [[University of California, Davis]] website&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2017|reason=research starting in the *mid*-60s led to use *by* 1962? causality??}} A known gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor is [[paclobutrazol]] (PBZ), which in turn inhibits growth and induces early fruitset as well as seedset.

A chronic food shortage was feared during the rapid climb in world population in the 1960s. This was averted with the development of a high-yielding variety of rice. This variety of semi-dwarf rice is called [[IR8]], and it has a short height because of a mutation in the sd1 gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sasaki A, Ashikari M, Ueguchi-Tanaka M, Itoh H, Nishimura A, Swapan D, Ishiyama K, Saito T, Kobayashi M, Khush GS, Kitano H, Matsuoka M|date=April 2002|title=Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice|journal=Nature|volume=416|issue=6882|pages=701–2|bibcode=2002Natur.416..701S|doi=10.1038/416701a|pmid=11961544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sd1 encodes GA20ox, so a mutant sd1 is expected to exhibit a short height that is consistent with GA deficiency.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
All known gibberellins are [[Diterpene#Diterpenoids|diterpenoid]] acids that are synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in [[plastid]]s and then modified in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[cytosol]] until they reach their biologically-active form.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell N, Reec JB | author-link1 = Neil Campbell (scientist) | title = Biology | edition = 6th | location = San Francisco | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All gibberellins are derived via the ''ent''-gibberellane skeleton, but are synthesised via ent-kaurene. The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery. [[Gibberellic acid]], which was the first gibberellin to be structurally characterized, is GA3.

As of 2003, there were 126 GAs identified from plants, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gibberellins are tetracyclic diterpene acids. There are two classes based on the presence of either 19 or 20 carbons. The 19-carbon gibberellins, such as gibberellic acid, have lost carbon 20 and, in place, possess a five-member lactone bridge that links carbons 4 and 10. The 19-carbon forms are, in general, the biologically active forms of gibberellins. Hydroxylation also has a great effect on the biological activity of the gibberellin. In general, the most biologically active compounds are dihydroxylated gibberellins, which possess hydroxyl groups on both carbon 3 and carbon 13. Gibberellic acid is a dihydroxylated gibberellin.&lt;ref name="accessscience.com"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1036/1097-8542.289000 | title=Gibberellins | journal=AccessScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioactive GAs===
The bioactive GAs are GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA7.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamaguchi S | title = Gibberellin metabolism and its regulation | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 59 | pages = 225–51 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18173378 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three common structural traits between these GAs: 1) a hydroxyl group on C-3β, 2) a carboxyl group on C-6, and 3) a lactone between C-4 and C-10.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; The 3β-hydroxyl group can be exchanged for other functional groups at C-2 and/or C-3 positions.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; GA5 and GA6 are examples of bioactive GAs that do not have a hydroxyl group on C-3β.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; The presence of GA1 in various plant species suggests that it is a common bioactive GA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacMillan J | title = Occurrence of Gibberellins in Vascular Plants, Fungi, and Bacteria | journal = Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 387–442 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11986764 | doi = 10.1007/s003440010038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently in the early stages of germination, the stored energy reserves of [[starch]] nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to [[glucose]] in the [[endosperm]] begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Peter J. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant growth | url = | journal = AccessScience | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1036/1097-8542.523000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch [[hydrolysis]] through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-[[amylase]] in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that gibberellins (denoted by GA) produced in the [[scutellum (botany)|scutellum]] diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch, which is abundant in many seeds, into glucose that can be used in cellular respiration to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase.&lt;ref name="accessscience.com" /&gt;

Gibberellins are produced in greater mass when the plant is exposed to cold temperatures. They stimulate cell elongation, breaking and budding, seedless fruits, and seed germination. They do the last by breaking the seed’s dormancy and acting as a chemical messenger. Its hormone binds to a receptor, and [[calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activates the protein [[calmodulin]], and the complex binds to DNA, producing an enzyme to stimulate growth in the embryo.

==Metabolism==
===Biosynthesis===
GAs are usually synthesized from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants.&lt;ref name="Hedden2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hedden P, Thomas SG | title = Gibberellin biosynthesis and its regulation | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 444 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–25 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22533671 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20120245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP).&lt;ref name="Hedden2012" /&gt; In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes are used to yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs).&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: 
- 1) GGDP is converted to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase 
- 2) etn-CDP is converted to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase 
- 3) ent-kaurene is converted to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) 
- 4) ent-kaurenol is converted to ent-kaurenal by KO 
- 5) ent-kaurenal is converted to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO 
- 6) ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) 
- 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is converted to GA12-aldehyde by KAO
- 8) GA12-aldehyde is converted to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt;

One or two genes encode the enzymes responsible for the first steps of GA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and rice.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; The null alleles of the genes encoding CPS, KS, and KO result in GA-deficient Arabidopsis dwarves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koornneef M, van der Veen JH | title = Induction and analysis of gibberellin sensitive mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) heynh | journal = TAG.

The auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) regulates concentration of GA1 in elongating internodes in peas.&lt;ref name="Ross2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross JJ, O'Neill DP, Smith JJ, Kerckhoffs LH, Elliott RC | title = Evidence that auxin promotes gibberellin A1 biosynthesis in pea | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 547–52 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10758505 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00702.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of IAA by removal of the apical bud, the auxin source, reduces the concentration of GA1, and reintroduction of IAA reverses these effects to increase the concentration of GA1.&lt;ref name="Ross2000" /&gt; This phenomenon has also been observed in tobacco plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolbang CM, Ross JJ | title = Auxin promotes gibberellin biosynthesis in decapitated tobacco plants | journal = Planta | volume = 214 | issue = 1 | pages = 153–7 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11762165 | doi = 10.1007/s004250100663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxin increases GA 3-oxidation and decreases GA 2-oxidation in barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolbang CM, Chandler PM, Smith JJ, Ross JJ | title = Auxin from the developing inflorescence is required for the biosynthesis of active gibberellins in barley stems | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 769–76 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14730077 | pmc = 344552 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.030460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxin also regulates GA biosynthesis during fruit development in peas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ngo P, Ozga JA, Reinecke DM | title = Specificity of auxin regulation of gibberellin 20-oxidase gene expression in pea pericarp | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 439–48 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12090620 | doi = 10.1023/A:1015522404586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries in different plant species suggest the auxin regulation of GA metabolism may be a universal mechanism.

Ethylene decreases the concentration of bioactive GAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Achard P, Baghour M, Chapple A, Hedden P, Van Der Straeten D, Genschik P, Moritz T, Harberd NP | title = The plant stress hormone ethylene controls floral transition via DELLA-dependent regulation of floral meristem-identity genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 15 | pages = 6484–9 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17389366 | pmc = 1851083 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0610717104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.6484A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation by environmental factors===
Recent evidence suggests fluctuations in GA concentration influence light-regulated seed germination, photomorphogenesis during de-etiolation, and photoperiod regulation of stem elongation and flowering.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi2008" /&gt; Microarray analysis showed about one fourth cold-responsive genes are related to GA-regulated genes, which suggests GA influences response to cold temperatures.&lt;ref name="Yamauchi2004" /&gt; Plants reduce growth rate when exposed to stress. A relationship between GA levels and amount of stress experienced has been suggested in barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vettakkorumakankav NN, Falk D, Saxena P, Fletcher RA |title=A Crucial Role for Gibberellins in Stress Protection of Plants|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|year=1999|volume=40|pages=542–548|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029575|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in seed development===
Bioactive GAs and abcisic acid levels have an inverse relationship and regulate seed development and germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Batge SL, Ross JJ, Reid JB |title=Abscisic acid levels in seeds of the gibberellin-deficient mutant lh-2 of pea (Pisum sativum)|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|year=1999|volume=195|pages=485–490|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105313.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White CN, Proebsting WM, Hedden P, Rivin CJ | title = Gibberellins and seed development in maize.

==Signalling mechanism==

=== Receptor ===
In the early 1990's, there were several lines of evidence that suggested the existence of a GA receptor in [[oat]] seeds that was located at the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]]. However despite intensive research, to date, no membrane-bound GA receptor has been isolated. This, along with the discovery of a soluble receptor, GA INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) has led many to doubt that a membrane-bound receptor exists.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hedden P, Sponsel V | title = A Century of Gibberellin Research | journal = Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 740–60 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26523085 | pmc = 4622167 | doi = 10.1007/s00344-015-9546-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:GA signal cascade.png|thumb|280x280px|'''GA-GID1-DELLA signal pathway:''' In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins bind to and inhibit transcription factors (TFs) and prefoldins (PFDs).

The movement of this lid results in the exposure of a surface which enables the binding of GID1 to DELLA proteins.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===DELLA proteins: Repression of a repressor===
DELLA proteins, such as SLR1 in rice or [[GAI (Arabidopsis thaliana gene)|GAI]] and RGA in Arabidopsis are repressors of plant development. DELLAs inhibit seed germination, seed growth, flowering and GA reverses these effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Achard P, Genschik P | title = Releasing the brakes of plant growth: how GAs shutdown DELLA proteins | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 1085–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19043067 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/ern301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DELLA proteins are characterized by the presence of a DELLA motif ([[Aspartic acid|aspartate]]-[[Glutamic acid|glutamate]]-[[leucine]]-leucine-[[alanine]] or D-E-L-L-A in the single letter [[amino acid code]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When GA binds to the GID1 receptor, it enhances the interaction between GID1 and DELLA proteins, forming a GA-GID1-DELLA complex. When in the GA-GID1-DELLA complex, it is thought that DELLA proteins undergo changes in structure that enable their binding to [[F-box protein]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (SLY1 in arabidopsis or GID2 in rice).&lt;ref name="Lechner 2006 631–638"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lechner E, Achard P, Vansiri A, Potuschak T, Genschik P | title = F-box proteins everywhere | journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 631–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17005440 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbi.2006.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davière JM, Achard P | title = Gibberellin signaling in plants | journal = Development | volume = 140 | issue = 6 | pages = 1147–51 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23444347 | doi = 10.1242/dev.087650 | url = http://dev.biologists.org/content/140/6/1147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinnis KM, Thomas SG, Soule JD, Strader LC, Zale JM, Sun TP, Steber CM | title = The Arabidopsis SLEEPY1 gene encodes a putative F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 1120–30 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12724538 | pmc = 153720 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.010827 }}&lt;/ref&gt; F-box proteins [[Catalysis|catalyse]] the addition of [[ubiquitin]] to their targets.&lt;ref name="Lechner 2006 631–638" /&gt; The addition of ubiquitin to DELLA proteins promotes their degradation via the [[Proteasome|26S-proteosome]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The degradation of DELLA proteins releases cells from their repressive effects.

=== Targets of DELLA proteins ===

==== Transcription factors ====
The first targets of DELLA proteins identified were PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). PIFs are [[transcription factor]]s that negatively regulate light signalling and are strong promoters of elongation growth. In the presence of GA, DELLAs are degraded and this then allows PIFs to promote elongation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zheng Y, Gao Z, Zhu Z | title = DELLA-PIF Modules: Old Dogs Learn New Tricks | language = English | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 813–815 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27569991 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2016.08.006 | url = https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(16)30116-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found that DELLAs repress a large number of other transcription factors, among which are positive regulators of [[auxin]], [[Brassinosteroid|brassinosteriod]] and [[ethylene]] signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh E, Zhu JY, Bai MY, Arenhart RA, Sun Y, Wang ZY | title = Cell elongation is regulated through a central circuit of interacting transcription factors in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl | journal = eLife | volume = 3 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24867218 | pmc = 4075450 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.03031 | url = https://elifesciences.org/articles/03031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marín-de la Rosa N, Sotillo B, Miskolczi P, Gibbs DJ, Vicente J, Carbonero P, Oñate-Sánchez L, Holdsworth MJ, Bhalerao R, Alabadí D, Blázquez MA | title = Large-scale identification of gibberellin-related transcription factors defines group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS as functional DELLA partners | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 166 | issue = 2 | pages = 1022–32 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25118255 | pmc = 4213073 | doi = 10.1104/pp.114.244723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DELLAs can repress transcription factors either by stopping their binding to DNA or by promoting their degradation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Prefoldins and microtubule assembly ====
In addition to repressing transcription factors, DELLAs also bind to prefoldins (PFDs). PFDs are molecular [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], meaning they assist in the folding of other proteins. PFDs function in the [[cytosol]] but when DELLAs bind to PFDs, it restricts them to the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. An important function of PFDs is to assist in the folding of [[Tubulin|β-tubulin]]. As such, in the absence of GA (when there is a high level of DELLA proteins), PDF function is reduced and there is a lower cellular pool of β-tubulin. When GA is present the DELLAs are degraded, PDFs can move to the cytosol and assist in the folding of β-tubulin. β-tubulin is a vital component of the [[cytoskeleton]] (in the form of [[microtubule]]s). As such, GA allows for re-organisation of the cytoskeleton, and the elongation of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Locascio A, Blázquez MA, Alabadí D | title = Dynamic regulation of cortical microtubule organization through prefoldin-DELLA interaction | language = English | journal = Current Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 804–9 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23583555 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.053 | url = https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)00355-2?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982213003552?showall=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microtubules are also required for the trafficking of [[Membrane vesicle trafficking|membrane vesicles]]. Membrane vesicle trafficking is needed for the correct positioning of several [[Transport protein|hormone transporters]]. One of the most well characterized hormone transporters are [[PIN proteins]], which are responsible for the movement of the hormone auxin between cells. In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins reduce the levels of microtubules and thereby inhibit membrane vesicle trafficking. This reduces the level of PIN proteins at the [[cell membrane]], and the level of auxin in the cell. GA reverses this process and allows for PIN protein trafficking to the cell membrane to enhance the level of auxin in the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salanenka Y, Verstraeten I, Löfke C, Tabata K, Naramoto S, Glanc M, Friml J | title = Gibberellin DELLA signaling targets the retromer complex to redirect protein trafficking to the plasma membrane | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 14 | pages = 3716–3721 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29463731 | pmc = 5889667 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1721760115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonzalo Tancredi''' (born 8 March 1963) is an [[Uruguayan]] [[astronomer]] and full professor in the Department of Astronomy at the [[University of the Republic]] in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fisica.edu.uy/~gonzalo/ |title=Gonzalo Tancredi—Departamento de Astronomia |work=Instituto de Fisica, Facultad de Ciencias (Universidad de la República) |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an active member of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and investigator at [[Los Molinos Observatory]].&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt;

His [[list of possible dwarf planets]], along with that of [[Michael E. Brown]], is commonly considered, along with the five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU – [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]], [[Haumea]], [[Makemake]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] – to be the [[dwarf planet]]s of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="dwarf-planets" /&gt; The Themistian asteroid [[5088 Tancredi]] has been named after him.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

==Definition of planet==
In 2006, Tancredi was one of a number of dissenters at the [[IAU]]'s [[2006 definition of planet|meeting to establish the first definition of "planet]].[[2006 definition of planet|"]] As an alternative to the IAU's draft proposal, which had included [[Pluto]], its moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] among the planets, Tancredi with his Uruguayan colleague [[Julio Ángel Fernández]] proposed a definition where they reserved the term "[[planet]]" only for those objects in the [[Solar System]] which had [[Cleared the neighbourhood|cleared their neighbourhoods]] of [[planetesimal]]s, describing those objects which had not cleared their orbits yet retained a spherical shape as "planetoids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Robert Roy| last= Britt| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060818_planet_newprop.html| title=Pluto May Get Demoted After All| publisher=[[Space.com]]| date=2006-08-18| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAU's final definition incorporated much of Fernández and Tancredi's proposal, though the objects were christened "[[dwarf planet]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iau.org/Resolutions_5-6.398.0.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Resolutions 5 and 6|date=24 August 2006|publisher=IAU}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the namesake of the [[Hosoya index]] used in [[computational chemistry]].&lt;ref name=croat&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/19756 "Haruo Hosoya"], by [[Ante Graovac]], ''Croatica Chemica Acta'' 80 (2) XXI–XXII (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Haruo Hosoya was born in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Japan]] to a family of an office worker. During 1955-1959 he studied at the [[University of Tokyo]]. In 1964 he wrote his [[Ph.D.]] thesis, "Study on the Structure of Reactive Intermediates and Reaction Mechanism". After postdoc work abroad ([[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], with prof. [[John R. Platt|John Platt]]), in 1969 he became [[associate professor]] at the Ochanomizu University, where he worked for 33 years until his retirement in 2002. After retirement he keeps working in computational chemistry.&lt;ref name=croat/&gt;

In 1971, Hosoya defined [[topological index]] (a [[graph invariant]]) as the total number of [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] of a graph plus 1.&lt;ref&gt;Hosoya H., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 44, 1971, 2332&lt;/ref&gt; The Hosoya index is often used in [[Mathematical chemistry|computer (mathematical)]] chemistry investigations for organic compounds.

In 2002-2003 the  ''[[Internet Electronic Journal of Molecular Design]]'' dedicated a series of issues to commemorate the 65th birthday of professor Hosoya.&lt;ref&gt;Special issues dedicated to Professor Haruo Hosoya on the occasion of the 65th birthday, Internet Electronic Journal of Molecular Design, [http://www.biochempress.com/cv01_i09.html 2002, vol 1 no. 9] &amp;mdash; [http://www.biochempress.com/cv02_i06.html 2003, Volume 2, Number 6]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosoya's article  "The Topological Index Z Before and After 1971" describes the history of the notion and the associated inside stories and details other Hosoya's achievements.&lt;ref name=before&gt;Hosoya H., ''[http://www.biochempress.com/av01_0428.html The Topological Index Z Before and After 1971]'', ''Internet Electronic Journal of Molecular Design'', 2002, 1, 428–442&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosoya also introduced the triangle of numbers known as [[Hosoya's triangle]] (originally "Fibonacci triangle", but that name can be ambiguous).&lt;ref&gt;Haruo Hosoya, "Fibonacci Triangle", ''[[The Fibonacci Quarterly]]'', vol. 14, no. 2 (1976), pp. 173–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IUCN protected area categories''', or '''IUCN protected area management categories''', are categories used to classify [[protected area]]s in a system developed by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).&lt;ref&gt;

The enlisting of such areas is part of a strategy being used toward the conservation of the world's natural environment and biodiversity. The [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has developed the protected area management categories system to define, record, and classify the wide variety of specific aims and concerns when categorising protected areas and their objectives.

This categorisation method is recognised on a global scale by national governments and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_capacity2/gpap_pub/gpap_catpub/?13959/Guidelines-for-applying-protected-area-management-categories IUCN Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, Published 2 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==

=== Category Ia – Strict Nature Reserve ===
A [[strict nature reserve]] (IUCN Category Ia) is an area which is protected from all but light human use in order to preserve the geological and geomorphical features of the region and its biodiversity. These areas are often home to dense native ecosystems that are restricted from all human disturbance outside of scientific study, environmental monitoring and education. Because these areas are so strictly protected, they provide ideal pristine environments by which external human influence can be measured.

In some cases strict nature reserves are of spiritual significance for surrounding communities, and the areas are also protected for this reason. The people engaged in the practice of their faith within the region have the right to continue to do so, providing it aligns with the area's conservation and management objectives.

Human impacts on strict nature reserves are increasingly difficult to guard against as climate and air pollution and newly emerging diseases threaten to penetrate the boundaries of protected areas. If perpetual intervention is required to maintain these strict guidelines, the area will often fall into category IV or V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_cat1a/ Category Ia Strict Nature Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Category Ib – Wilderness Area ===
[[File:Serengeti.JPG|thumb|right|The Serengeti National Park, Tanzania is a designated Wilderness Area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Serengeti_National_Park/ Data for Serengeti National Park (Category Ib) on Protected Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A [[wilderness area]] (IUCN Category Ib) is similar to a strict nature reserve, but generally larger and protected in a slightly less stringent manner.

These areas are a protected domain in which [[biodiversity]] and ecosystem processes (including evolution) are allowed to flourish or experience restoration if previously disturbed by human activity. These are areas which may buffer against the effects of climate change and protect threatened species and ecological communities.

Human visitation is limited to a minimum, often allowing only those who are willing to travel of their own devices (by foot, by ski, or by boat), but this offers a unique opportunity to experience wilderness that has not been interfered with. Wilderness areas can be classified as such only if they are devoid of modern infrastructure, though they allow human activity to the level of sustaining indigenous groups and their cultural and spiritual values within their wilderness-based lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hggiiucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_category1b/ Category Ib Wilderness Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Category II – National Park ===
A [[national park]] (IUCN Category II) is similar to a wilderness area in its size and its main objective of protecting functioning ecosystems. However, national parks tend to be more lenient with human visitation and its supporting infrastructure. National parks are managed in a way that may contribute to local economies through promoting educational and recreational tourism on a scale that will not reduce the effectiveness of conservation efforts.

The surrounding areas of a national park may be for consumptive or non-consumptive use but should nevertheless act as a barrier for the defence of the protected area's native species and communities to enable them to sustain themselves in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_pacategory2/ Category II National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407225919/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_pacategory2/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Category III – Natural Monument or Feature ===
A [[natural monument]] or [[natural feature|feature]] (IUCN Category III) is a comparatively smaller area that is specifically allocated to protect a [[natural monument]] and its surrounding [[habitat]]s. These monuments can be natural in the wholest sense or include elements that have been influenced or introduced by humans. The latter should hold biodiversity associations or could otherwise be classified as a historical or spiritual site, though this distinction can be quite difficult to ascertain.

To be categorised as a natural monument or feature by IUCN's guidelines, the protected area could include natural geological or geomorphological features, culturally-influenced natural features, natural cultural sites, or cultural sites with associated ecology. The classification then falls into two subcategories: those in which the biodiversity is uniquely related to the conditions of the natural feature and those in which the current levels of biodiversity are dependent on the presence of the sacred sites that have created an essentially modified ecosystem.

Natural monuments or features often play a smaller but key ecological role in the operations of broader conservation objectives. They have a high cultural or spiritual value that can be utilised to gain support of conservation challenges by allowing higher visitation or recreational rights, therefore offering an incentive for the preservation of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_category3/ Category III Natural Monument or Feature]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Category IV – Habitat/Species Management Area ===

[[File:Galapagos iguana1.jpg|thumb|right|The Galápagos, Ecuador, is managed under category IV to preserve the islands' native flora and fauna&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Galapagos_Islands_World_Heritage_Site/ Data for The Galápagos Islands (Category IV) on Protected Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A [[habitat management area|habitat]] or [[species management area]] (IUCN Category IV) is similar to a natural monument or feature, but focuses on more specific areas of conservation (though size is not necessarily a distinguishing feature), like an identifiable species or habitat that requires continuous protection rather than that of a natural feature. These protected areas will be sufficiently controlled to ensure the maintenance, conservation, and restoration of particular species and habitats—possibly through traditional means—and public education of such areas is widely encouraged as part of the management objectives.

Habitat or species management areas may exist as a fraction of a wider ecosystem or protected area and may require varying levels of active protection. Management measures may include (but are not limited to) the prevention of poaching, creation of artificial habitats, halting natural succession, and supplementary feeding practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-areas-categories/category-iv-habitatspecies-management-area Category IV Habitat/Species Management Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Category V – Protected Landscape/Seascape ===
A [[protected landscape]] or [[protected seascape]] (IUCN Category V) covers an entire body of land or ocean with an explicit natural conservation plan, but usually also accommodates a range of for-profit activities.

The main objective is to safeguard regions that have built up a distinct and valuable ecological, biological, cultural, or scenic character. In contrast with previous categories, Category V permits surrounding communities to interact more with the area, contributing to the area's sustainable management and engaging with its natural and cultural heritage.

[[Landscape]]s and [[seascape]]s that fall into this category should represent an integral balance between people and nature and can sustain activities such as traditional agricultural and forestry systems on conditions that ensure the continued protection or [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] of the area.

Category V is one of the more flexible classifications of protected areas. As a result, protected landscapes and seascapes may be able to accommodate contemporary developments, such as [[ecotourism]], at the same time as maintaining the historical management practices that may procure the sustainability of [[agrobiodiversity]] and aquatic biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_category5/ Category V Protected Landscape/Seascape]&lt;/ref&gt;:

===Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources===
[[File:Landsat gbreef.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park/ Data for The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Category VI) on Protected Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though human involvement is a large factor in the management of these [[protected area]]s, developments are not intended to allow for widescale industrial production. The IUCN recommends that a proportion of the land mass remains in its natural condition—a decision to be made on a national level, usually with specificity to each protected area. Governance has to be developed to adapt the diverse—and possibly growing—range of interests that arise from the production of sustainable natural resources.

Category VI may be particularly suitable to vast areas that already have a low level of human occupation or in which local communities and their traditional practices have had little permanent impact on the environmental health of the region. This differs from category V in that it is not the result of long-term human interaction that has had a transformative effect on surrounding ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_category6/ Category VI Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isbanir Fossa''' is a north-south trending [[Escarpment|scarp]] on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Isbanir Fossa was first seen in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images, though a small section was see at much higher resolution by ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]''.  It is centred at 12.6° North [[Latitude]], 354.0° West [[Longitude]] and is approximately 132 kilometres long.  Based on [[photoclinometry|photoclinometric]] analysis of ''Voyager 2'' images (using topographic shading in an image to determine slope), like the one at right, Isbanir Fossa was determined to be a 300-metre tall, west-dipping scarp (Kargel and Pozio 1996).  Two sets of troughs can be seen running perpendicular to Isbanir Fossa, like [[Daryabar Fossa]].  These troughs appear to be right-laterally offset 15–20&amp;nbsp;km east and west of Isbanir Fossa, suggesting that the scarp may be a [[Geologic fault#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip fault]] or even a [[transform fault]] with troughs like Daryabar Fossa representing [[Seafloor spreading|spreading centres]] (Rothery 1999).

[[Isbanir]] Fossa is named after the home of Fakir Taj from ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.

'''Joe Henry Engle''' (born August 26, 1932) ([[Major general (United States)|Maj Gen]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]], Ret.), is an American [[Aviator|pilot]] who served in the [[United States Air Force]], [[test pilot]] for the [[North American X-15]] program, [[aeronautical engineer]], and a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].  As of 2018, he is the last living pilot of the X-15 program.

Engle test-flew the joint NASA-Air Force [[X-15]] rocket airplane. During the course of testing, Engle earned his [[astronaut wings#United States Air Force|USAF Astronaut Wings]], a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (U.S.)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and other awards. Engle was selected by NASA in 1966 for the [[Apollo program]], and was originally scheduled to land on the Moon as [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] Pilot on [[Apollo 17]], but was bumped when later flights were cancelled, so that geologist-astronaut [[Harrison H. Schmitt]] could fly.

He subsequently became one of the first astronauts in the [[Space Shuttle program]], having flight tested the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']] in 1977. He was Commander of the second orbital test flight of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 1981.

==Biography==

===Personal life and education===
Engle was born on August 26, 1932, in [[Chapman, Kansas|Chapman]], [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name="nasajsc" /&gt; He attended primary and secondary schools in Chapman, Kansas, and he graduated from [[Chapman High School (Chapman, Kansas)|Dickinson County High School]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="salina"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/1121622/|title=Dickinson County's historical high school|newspaper=The Salina Journal|date=September 10, 1989|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|page=33|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] from the [[University of Kansas]] in 1955, where he was a member of the [[Theta Tau]] Professional Engineering Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetatau.org/Websites/thetatauhq/images/Alumni_Hall_Of_Fame_Laureates.pdf|title=Alumni Hall of Fame Laureates|publisher=Theta Tau|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Engle was active as a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and earned the rank of [[First Class Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|First Class]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx Joe H. Engle at scouting.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000000/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Mary Catherine Lawrence of [[Mission Hills, Kansas]] and has two grown children and one stepchild. He is currently married to Jeanie Carter Engle of [[Houston, Texas]]. Engle's recreational interests include [[Aviation|flying]] (including [[World War II]] fighter aircraft), [[big game hunting]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/us/engle-from-childhood-he-planned-to-be-a-pilot.html|title=ENGLE: FROM CHILDHOOD HE PLANNED TO BE A PILOT||publisher=New York Times|access-date=December 1, 2017|date=November 13, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]] and became a Fellow in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setp.org/setp-personnel/fellow-classes.html|title=Fellow Classes|publisher=The Society of Experimental Test Pilots|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight experience===
[[File:Joe Engle X-15 pilot.jpg|thumb|left|Engle with the X-15A-2 aircraft in 1965]]
Engle received his commission in the U.S. Air Force through the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] at the [[University of Kansas]]. While in school he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity [[Theta Tau]], and decided to become a [[test pilot]]. While working at [[Cessna Aircraft]] during the summer, he learned how to fly from a fellow [[draftsman]].{{r|engleoh}}

Engle entered flying school in 1957, and received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|pilot wings]] in 1958. He flew the [[F-100 Super Sabre]] with the [[474th Tactical Fighter Squadron|474th Fighter Day Squadron]] and the [[309th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] at [[George Air Force Base]], [[California]]. [[Chuck Yeager]] recommended Engle for [[USAF Test Pilot School]], from which he graduated in 1961, and he was later assigned to the second class of the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Aerospace Research Pilot School]], despite his reluctance to leave "stick and rudder" flying for a [[space capsule]].{{r|engleoh}}

After serving as a test pilot in the Fighter Test Group at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, Engle was a test pilot in the [[North American X-15|X-15 research program]] at Edwards from June 1963 until his assignment to the Manned Spacecraft Center (now the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]]). Engle had applied with fellow ARPS student [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] to the [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|third NASA astronaut group]], but the Air Force withdrew Engle's NASA application and instead chose him to replace [[Robert M. White]] in the X-15 program, which pleased Engle.&lt;ref name="engleoh"/&gt;

Engle's parents witnessed his flight of 29 June 1965, which exceeded an altitude of 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) and qualified him for astronaut wings; he again exceeded 50 miles twice&lt;ref name="engleoh"&gt;"[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/EngleJH/englejh.pdf Joe H. Engle]", NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, 22 April to 24 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; during his career of 16 flights. On his final X-15 mission, free flight 153 (1-61-101), which took place on 14th October 1965, he became the first of only two pilots to accomplish a sub-orbital space flight in an X-15 without the benefit of the assistance provided by the MH-96 adaptive flight control system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mach25media.com/Resources/X15FlightLog.pdf|title=The X-15 Rocket Plane, Flight Log, Page 44|publisher=Michelle Evans|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite what he later called "the best flying job in the world", Engle decided to apply again to NASA as he expected to be rotated to another Air Force assignment within a year and hoped to go to the Moon.&lt;ref name="engleoh"/&gt;

Engle has flown over 185 different types of aircraft (25 different fighters) during his career: logging more than 15,400 hours flight time; 9,000 in [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name="nasajsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/engle-jh.html|website=NASA JSC|access-date=December 5, 2016|title=Astronaut Bio: Joe Henry Engle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASA career===
[[File:Sts-2 crew.jpg|thumb|left|Engle, commander of the STS-2 mission, with Truly, pilot]]
Engle was one of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5|19 astronauts selected by NASA]] in April 1966.  He served on the support crew for [[Apollo 10]]. Following this assignment, he was backup [[Lunar Module]] Pilot for the [[Apollo 14]] mission and was due to land on the [[Moon]] as Lunar Module Pilot for [[Apollo 17]], but was replaced by [[geologist]] [[Harrison Schmitt]] after [[canceled Apollo missions|Apollo 18]] was cancelled with pressure from the scientific community to have a scientist explore the Moon, and not just test pilots who had been given geology training. In response to getting bumped from the mission, he said "When you think about it, the lunar missions were geology-oriented."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

According to Engle, [[Deke Slayton]] asked him whether he would prefer to fly on [[Skylab]], [[Apollo-Soyuz]], or the Space Shuttle; Engle responded that he would prefer the Shuttle as it was an airplane.{{r|engleoh}}

[[File:STS-51-I crew.jpg|thumb|right|The crew of the STS-51-I mission.  Engle is at the lower left]]
Engle was Commander of one of the two crews that flew the [[Approach and Landing Tests|Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Flights]] from June through October 1977. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']] was carried to 25,000 feet on top of the [[Boeing 747]] carrier aircraft, and then released for its two-minute glide flight to landing. In this series of flight tests, Engle evaluated the Orbiter handling qualities and landing characteristics, and obtained the stability and control, and performance data in the subsonic flight envelope for the space shuttle. He was the backup Commander for [[STS-1]], the first orbital test flight of [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']]. Together with pilot [[Richard Truly]] he flew as Commander on the second flight of the Space Shuttle, [[STS-2]]. He was also mission commander on [[STS-51-I]] and logged over 225 hours in space.{{r|engleoh}}

Engle is the only human being to have flown two different types of winged vehicles in space, the [[X-15]] and the Space Shuttle. In Engle's June 2004 oral history interview the interviewer (Rebecca Wright) states that he is the only astronaut to have manually flown the Shuttle through reentry and landing, {{r|engleoh}} but this is an oversimplification. Periods of hand flying flight test manoeuvres were interspersed with periods of computer control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon 1972-2013|author=Dennis R. Jenkins|publisher=Speciality Press|isbn=9781580072496|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight at NASA Headquarters from March 1982 to December 1982.&lt;ref name="nasajsc" /&gt; He retained his astronaut flight status and returned to the Johnson Space Center in January 1983.&lt;ref name="nasajsc" /&gt; He also participated in the [[STS-51-L|''Challenger'' disaster]] investigation in 1986, and did other consulting work on the Shuttle well into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/engle-joe/|title=Engle, Joe Henry|publisher=The National Aviation Hall of Fame|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-NASA career===
Joe Engle retired from NASA on November 28, 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Recer|first=Paul|title=Senior NASA astronaut Joe H. Engle retires|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Senior-NASA-Astronaut-Joe-H-Engle-Retires/id-7927dc4b8e1c02a508c4df973b1e2c23|publisher=AP|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=2 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the USAF on November 30, 1986. On December 1, he was subsequently promoted to the rank of Major General. In 1986 he was appointed to the [[Kansas Air National Guard]] and 1992, he was inducted into the [[Aerospace Walk of Honor]]. On July 21, 2001, Engle was enshrined at Dayton, Ohio, in the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] class of 2001, along with USAF [[flying ace|ace]] [[Robin Olds]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] ace [[Marion Carl]], and [[Albert Ueltschi]]. In November, 2001, he was inducted into the [[U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="ushalloffame" /&gt;

The '''weather extremes in Pakistan''' include high and low temperatures, heaviest rainfall and flooding. The highest temperature ever recorded in [[Pakistan]] is 53.5&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;which was recorded in [[Moenjo Daro]], [[Sindh]] on 26 May 2010. It was not only the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan but also the hottest reliably measured temperature ever recorded on the continent of [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Wunderground.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1559&amp;tstamp= |title=Wunder Blog : Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pakmet.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912164706/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html |archivedate=12 September 2010 |title=Record breaking heat in Pakistan : Highest maximum temperature was recorded 53.5°C in  MohenjuDaro and 53 in Sibbi.

== Temperature ==
The standard measuring conditions for temperature are 1.2 meters above the ground out of direct sunlight (hence the term, x degrees "in the shade").

== High temperature ==
Heat waves mostly occur during summer months but in Pakistan heat waves occur at any time period between April and September and bring high temperatures but most powerful heat waves occur in May and June. Some areas of southern Pakistan usually experience above {{convert|50|C}} temperature and play havoc in these areas. The most deadly heat wave in the history of Pakistan is the record-breaking heat wave of summer 2010 which occurred in the last ten days of May.

Some areas of northern and western Pakistan usually experience below 0&amp;nbsp;°C temperature and play havoc in these areas. The most deadly cold wave in the recent history of Pakistan is the record-breaking cold wave of winter 2013.

== Precipitation ==
The standard way of measuring Rainfall or Snowfall is the standard Rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by 25&amp;nbsp;mm (0.98&amp;nbsp;in) of Rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm (0.0098&amp;nbsp;in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm (0.0098&amp;nbsp;in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining Rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty.

=== Rainfall ===
Pakistan receives Rainfall from both [[Monsoon]] and [[Western Disturbance]]. Monsoon occurs from July to September and brings heavy Downpour across the country except western Balochistan. Western Disturbances occur from October to May and bring Rainfall across the country with some heavy Downpour in northern Pakistan. But in June Western Disturbances occasionally hit the northern parts of the country. Pre-Monsoon also occurs in this month occasionally but not always.

== Record-breaking torrential rainfall of August and September 2011 in Sindh ==
[[File:Supercell-best.JPG|thumb|Heavy Rainy Clouds over Larkana during the wet spell of September 2011]]
In the month of July Pakistan received below normal monsoon rains; however, in August and September the country received above normal monsoon rains. A strong weather pattern entered the areas of Sindh from the [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]] in August and gained strength with the passage of time and caused heavy Downpour. The first Monsoon spell hit the southern parts of Sindh on 10 August. It produced record breaking widespread torrential Rainfall and resulted in floods in district Badin. The second spell hit the areas on 30 August and lasted until 2 September. In the month of September four more consecutive spells of monsoon rainfall devastated the southern parts of the province. The first spell of September hit the already inundated parts of the province on 2 September. Thereafter, the second spell hit on 5 September, the third on 9 September, and the fourth on 12 September 2011. The four spells of Monsoon produced even more devastating torrential Rains in the already affected areas of [[Sindh]].

Pakistan has seen many floods, the worst and most destructive is the recent [[2010 Pakistan floods]], which swept away the 20% of Pakistan's land, the flood is the result of unprecedented monsoon rains which lasted from 28 July to 31 July 2010. [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|North eastern Punjab]] were badly affected during the monsoon rains when dams, rivers and lakes overflowed. By mid-August, according to the governmental Federal Flood Commission (FFC), the floods had caused the deaths of at least 1,540 people, while 2,088 people had received injuries, 557,226 houses had been destroyed, and over 6 million people had been displaced.&lt;ref name=ahmadani&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/19-Aug-2010/Heavily-funded-FFC-fails-to-deliver/ |author=Ahmadani A |title=Heavily Funded FFC Fails to Deliver |publisher=TheNation |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ATYnKydX?url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/19-Aug-2010/Heavily-funded-FFC-fails-to-deliver/ |archive-date=2012-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, the data had been updated to reveal 1,781 deaths, 2,966 people with injuries, and more than 1.89 million homes destroyed.&lt;ref name=src&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/LSGZ-89GD7W?OpenDocument |author=[[Singapore Red Cross]] |title=Pakistan Floods:The Deluge of Disaster – Facts &amp; Figures as of 15 September 2010| date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood affected more than 20 million people exceeding the combined total of individuals affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref name="South Asia"&gt;{{Cite news|last=South Asia|first=BBC News|title=Floods affect 20&amp;nbsp;m people&amp;nbsp;– Pakistan PM Gilani|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10973725|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gulfnews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/pakistan/floods-in-pakistan-worse-than-tsunami-haiti-1.666221?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Floods in Pakistan worse than tsunami, Haiti |publisher=gulfnews |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood is considered as worst in Pakistan's history affecting people of all four provinces and [[Gilgit Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] region of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/03-pakistan-flood-crisis-bigger-than-tsunami-haiti-un-ss-05 |publisher=Dawn.com |title=Dawn.com : 2010 Pakistan Floods |date= |accessdate=6 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903181450/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/03-pakistan-flood-crisis-bigger-than-tsunami-haiti-un-ss-05 |archivedate=3 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lord Morton's mare.jpg|thumb|The mare with the subsequent foal]]
'''Lord Morton’s mare''' was an equid hybrid and once an often-noticed example in the history of [[evolutionary theory]].

In 1820 [[George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton]], F.R.S., reported to the President of the [[Royal Society]] that, being desirous of domesticating the [[quagga]] (a now extinct subspecies of the [[plains zebra]]), he had bred an Arabian chestnut mare with a quagga [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]] and that, subsequently, the same [[Mare (horse)|mare]] was bred with a black stallion and Lord Morton found that the [[offspring]] had strange stripes in the legs like the quagga. The Royal Society published Lord Morton's letter in its ''Philosophical Transactions'', 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Communication of a singular Fact in Natural History |first=George |last=Douglas |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1821 |pages=20–22 |volume=111 |jstor=107600 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1821.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue "Particulars of a Fact, nearly similar to that related by Lord Morton, communicated to the President, in a letter from Daniel Giles, Esq." reported that in a litter of a black and white sow, by a "boar of the wild breed, the chestnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed" in some of the piglets, even to the two subsequent litters of that sow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=Daniel |title=Particulars of a Fact, nearly similar to that related by Lord Morton, communicated to the President, in a letter from Daniel Giles, Esquire|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=1821|pages=23–24|volume=111|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/111/23.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1098/rstl.1821.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These circumstantial reports seemed to confirm the ancient idea of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]] in heritability: [[Charles Darwin]] cited the example in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868). The concept of telegony, that the seed of a male could continue to affect the offspring of a female, whether animal or human, had been inherited from [[Aristotle]] and remained a legitimate theory until experiments in the 1890s confirmed [[Mendelian inheritance]]. Biologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare using dominant and recessive [[allele]]s{{how|date=July 2018}}.

'''Maria Pronchishcheva''' (''Мария Прончищева'', also known as '''Tatiana Pronchishcheva''', 1710 - 23 September 1736) was a [[Russia]]n explorer.

In 1735 with her husband, [[Vasili Pronchishchev]], went down the Lena River (from [[Yakutsk]]) on Vasili's [[sloop]] ''Yakutsk'', doubled its delta, and stopped for wintering at the mouth of the [[Olenek River]]. Many members of the crew fell ill and died, mainly owing to [[scurvy]]. Despite the difficulties, in 1736, they reached the eastern shore of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] and went north along its coastline. Finally Pronchishcheva and her husband succumbed to scurvy and died on the way back.

Maria is considered the first female polar explorer. [[Maria Pronchishcheva Bay]] in the [[Laptev Sea]] is named after her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">[[File:Plankton_collage.jpg|right|thumb|An assemblage of [[planktonic]] organisms]]

'''Meroplankton''' is a wide variety of [[planktonic]] organisms, which spend a portion of their lives in the benthic region of the ocean. These organisms do not remain as [[plankton]] permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms. After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the [[nekton]] or adopt a [[benthos|benthic]] (often [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]]) lifestyle on the [[seafloor]]. Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as [[sea urchins]], [[starfish]], and [[crustaceans]]. Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement. Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses. Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species. Many of the common, well-known animals found on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become. The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults. Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year. However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate.

==Spatial distribution==
Meroplankton species composition depends on spatial distribution and reproductive habits of adults in a given area. Biotic and abiotic factors such as tidal and lunar cycles and availability of food determine adult spawning schedules, in turn,  determining subsequent meroplankton populations. Behavioural factors, such as predator avoidance are also important. Freshwater inputs play a key role in meroplankton species composition in estuarine environments. Effects of tides contribute greatly to meroplankton species distribution. One study conducted in a Patagonian [[Fjord]] found that species composition of the meroplankton community depended on the seasonally varying input levels from the [[Baker River (Chile)|Baker river]] as well as vertical and horizontal stratification of the water column.&lt;ref name="Castrob"&gt;7. Castrob L., R., Meerhoffa E., Tapiab F. J. 2014. Spatial structure of the meroplankton community along a Patagonian Fjord – The Role of Changing Freshwater Inputs. Vo. 129A, pp.125-135&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as wind driven upwelling and downwelling also affect meroplankton species distribution. Most species are swept in the direction of the flow of water, either off shore during an [[upwelling]] or near shore during a [[downwelling]]. Some species, such as [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] larvae, have the ability to maintain their nearshore position during these events.&lt;ref name="Brubaker"&gt;10. Brubaker J., Largier J., Shanks A.L., 2003. Observations on the Distribution of Meroplankton During an Upwelling Event. Journal of Plankton Research. Vo. 25, No 6, pp: 645-667&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Icefishuk.jpg|right|thumb|212x212px|Icefish larva]][[File:Haeckel_Amphoridea-10.jpg|thumb|189x189px|An early state of a [[Sea Urchin]] larva|left]]

==Dispersal==
Survival rate of Meroplankton is critical to successful development of adult organisms. Low survival rates of meroplankton will result in reduction in adult population numbers. One factor which often determines meroplankton survival is larval dispersal. Most species within the meroplankton community rely on ocean currents for dispersal. Currents play a key role in delivering larval organisms to specific settlement locations, where they are able to transition and mature into adult forms. Organisms which do not make it to the right settlement site are unlikely to complete their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;5. Brink L., Brubaker J., Hooff R., Largier J., Shanks A.L, 2002. Observations on the distribution of meroplankton during a downwelling event and associated intrusion of the Chesapeake Bay estuarine plume. Journal of Plankton Research. Vo. 24, No. 4, pp. 391-416&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in recent years have also discovered that many of these tiny animals in the plankton (in particular larval fish and crustaceans) quickly become very good swimmers capable of incredible feats of speed and endurance.   [[File:FMIB_46393_First_Larval_Stage_of_the_Common_Lobster.jpeg|thumb|185x185px|First Larval Stage of the [[Common Lobster]]]]

==Food availability==
A major factor affecting meroplankton survival is food availability. While living in the plankton, meroplankton either feed on other members of the plankton, or they live off the [[Egg yolk|yolk]] they have retained from the egg they hatched from. Many members of the meroplankton community rely on the surrounding planktonic community for nutrition. In order to ensure that larvae have sufficient amounts of nutrition, many species coordinate larval release with times of algal blooms.  This synchronicity between release of larvae and algal blooms often leads to Meroplankton making up the largest percentage of the planktonic community during such reproductive periods.&lt;ref name="Attrill"&gt;3. Attrill M.J., Conway D.V.P., Eloire D., Highfeild J.M., Lindeque P.K., SomerfeildP.J., 2010. Seasonal dynamics of meroplankton assemblages at station L4. Journal of Plankton Research. Vol. 00, No. 0, pp.1-11&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that certain species are able to commence spawning as they come into contact with [[phytoplankton]] cells. These species store embryos in the mantle cavity until they detect algal blooms. This adaptation allows for better larval survival.&lt;ref name="Arntz"&gt;2. Arntz W.E., Schnack-Schiel S., Thatje S., 2003. Developmental trade-offs in Subantarctic meroplankton communities and the enigma of low decapod diversity in high southern latitudes. Marine Ecology Progress Series. Vo. 260, pp. 195-207&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Phytoplankton_-_the_foundation_of_the_oceanic_food_chain.jpg|thumb|185x185px|A [[phytoplankton]] cell|left]]

==Diversity and abundance==
Meroplankton diversity and abundance are affected by many factors. Seasonal and spatial variations are among some of the main causes of such variability. A study which was conducted in Dunkellin Estuary, determined that spawning times of many species are timed to maximize food availability at a particular time of year, while minimizing presence of other species which exploit the same food source &lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;8. Byrne, P., 1995. Seasonal Composition of Meroplankton in the Dunkellin Estuary, Galway Bay. Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vo. 95B, No. 1, pp. 35–48&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity and abundance are depth dependent qualities. Generally, shallow coastal waters contain far greater numbers of meroplankton than deep, open ocean waters. Most abundant regions occur at depths between 0 and 200 meters of the water column, where light penetration is highest. Availability of sunlight allows for proliferation of [[phytoplankton]], which serves as one of the major food sources for meroplankton. Deep oceanic waters show significantly lower abundance than shelf regions, due to poor light penetration.&lt;ref name="Gallego"&gt;9. Gallego R., Lavery S.,  Sewell M.A.,  2014. Meroplankton Community of the Oceanic Ross Sea During Late Summer. Antarctic Science Antarctic Science, Vo. 26, No. 4, pp. 345–360&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of pollution ==
Water and benthos pollution from industrial sources has been demonstrated to have varying  effects on biological diversity and survival potential of meroplankton. One study conducted in the [[Vostok Bay]] region in [[Russia]], demonstrated that even in the presence of industrial pollutants, most species of meroplankton were able to proliferate almost unaffected. The authors of this study attribute these findings to the fact that meroplankton are transported by ocean currents generally from cleaner open waters inshore. Furthermore, the same study also concluded that even in heavily polluted areas, meroplankton populations were able to reestablish if pollution was brought under control and sufficient time was allowed to pass. However, the rate of recolonization was demonstrated to be notably slow, on average talking about 10 years before the abundance and diversity of meroplankton returned to its original levels. This is in part due to the slow nature of detoxification of benthic [[sediment]]s, which retain much of the heavy metal [[pollution]] &lt;ref name="Kulikova"&gt;6. Kulikova V. A., Omelyanenko V. A., Tarasov V. G. 2004. Effect of Pollution on the Meroplankton of Gaidamak Bight (Vostok Bay, Sea of Japan), Russian Journal of Ecology, Vo. 35, No. 2, pp. 91-97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meroplankton and climate change ==
A study conducted in the  [[North Sea]] between 1958-2005, collected samples of meroplankton using a CPR survey. These samples consisted of larval [[echinoderms]], [[decapods]], [[bivalves]], cirripedes, and ectoprocts. Meroplankton abundance as well as PCI levels (amount of chlorophyll in each sample in relation to sea surface temperature) were examined. Researchers concluded that echinoderm larvae increased in abundance throughout the study, with the largest increase occurring in the Northern and Central regions. [[Decapoda|Decapod]] larvae were found to increase in abundance as well, and were found to appear earlier in the year. Bivalve larvae showed an overall decline in abundance. It was also concluded that PCI levels increased throughout the study, particularly during the summer months. It was determined that climate, particularly sea surface temperature, drives meroplankton abundance. Warmer sea surface temperature shortens developmental time of the larvae, increasing their survival rate.&lt;ref name="Beaugrand"&gt;4. Beaugrand G., Kirby R. R., Lindley J. A., 2008. Climate-induced effects on the meroplankton and the benthic-pelagic ecology of the North Sea. American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, pp. 1805–1815&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon rocks on Earth come from three sources: those collected by the [[United States]] [[Apollo program]] manned lunar landings from 1969 to 1972; samples returned by three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme]] unmanned probes in the 1970s; and rocks that were ejected naturally from the lunar surface.

The Soviet Union attempted, but failed to make manned lunar landings in the 1970s, due to failure to develop their [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]], but they succeeded in landing three robotic [[Luna programme|Luna spacecraft]] with the capability to collect and return small samples to Earth. A combined total of less than one kilogram of material was returned.

In 1993, three small fragments from [[Luna 16]], weighing 200&amp;nbsp;mg, were sold for [[United States dollar|US$]] 442,500.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Dating==

Rocks from the Moon have been measured by [[radiometric dating]] techniques. They range in age from about 3.16 billion years old for the [[basalt]]ic samples derived from the [[lunar maria]], up to about 4.44 billion years old for rocks derived from the highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=James Papike |author2=Grahm Ryder |author3=Charles Shearer  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Lunar Samples | journal = Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 5.1–5.234 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the age-dating technique of "crater counting," the youngest basaltic eruptions are believed to have occurred about 1.2 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = H.

Moon rocks fall into two main categories: those found in the lunar highlands (terrae), and those in the [[lunar mare|maria]]. The terrae consist dominantly of [[mafic]] [[plutonic]] rocks. Regolith [[breccia]]s with similar [[protolith]]s are also common. Mare basalts come in three distinct series in direct relation to their titanium content: ''[[high-Ti basalt]]s, low-Ti basalts'', and ''Very Low-Ti (VLT) basalts''.

Almost all lunar rocks are depleted in [[volatiles]] and are completely lacking in [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] common in Earth rocks. In some regards, lunar rocks are closely related to Earth's rocks in their isotopic composition of the element [[oxygen]]. The Apollo moon rocks were collected using a variety of tools, including [[hammers]], [[Rake (tool)|rakes]], [[scoop (tool)|scoops]], [[tongs]], and [[Core sample|core tubes]]. Most were photographed prior to collection to record the condition in which they were found. They were placed inside sample bags and then a ''Special Environmental Sample Container'' for return to the Earth to protect them from contamination. In contrast to the Earth, large portions of the lunar crust appear to be composed of rocks with high concentrations of the mineral [[anorthite]]. The mare basalts have relatively high [[iron]] values. Furthermore, some of the mare basalts have very high levels of [[titanium]] (in the form of [[ilmenite]]).&lt;ref name="NYT-20151228"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhanoo |first=Sindya N. |title=New Type of Rock Is Discovered on Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/science/new-type-of-rock-is-discovered-on-moon.html |date=28 December 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary igneous rocks in the lunar highlands compose three distinct groups: the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite.

Lunar breccias, formed largely by the immense basin-forming impacts, are dominantly composed of highland [[Lithology|lithologies]] because most mare basalts post-date basin formation (and largely fill these impact basins).

*The ''ferroan anorthosite suite'' consists almost exclusively of the rock ''[[anorthosite]]'' (&gt;90% calcic plagioclase) with less common ''anorthositic [[gabbro]]'' (70-80% calcic plagioclase, with minor pyroxene). The ferroan anorthosite suite is the most common group in the highlands, and is inferred to represent plagioclase flotation cumulates of the lunar magma ocean, with interstitial mafic phases formed from trapped interstitial melt or rafted upwards with the more abundant plagioclase framework. The plagioclase is extremely calcic by terrestrial standards, with molar anorthite contents of 94-96% (An94-96). This reflects the extreme depletion of the bulk moon in alkalis (Na, K) as well as water and other volatile elements. In contrast, the mafic minerals in this suite have low Mg/Fe ratios that are inconsistent with calcic plagioclase compositions. Ferroan anorthosites have been dated using the internal isochron method at "circa" 4.4 Ga.
*The ''magnesian suite'' (or "''mg suite''") consists of ''[[dunite]]s'' (&gt;90% olivine), ''[[troctolite]]s'' (olivine-plagioclase), and ''[[gabbro]]s'' (plagioclase-pyroxene) with relatively high Mg/Fe ratios in the mafic minerals and a range of plagioclase compositions that are still generally calcic (An86-93). These rocks represent later intrusions into the highlands crust (ferroan anorthosite) at round 4.3-4.1 Ga. An interesting aspect of this suite is that analysis of the trace element content of plagioclase and pyroxene require equilibrium with a [[KREEP]]-rich magma, despite the refractory major element contents.
*The ''alkali suite'' is so-called because of its high alkali content—for moon rocks. The alkali suite consists of ''alkali [[anorthosite]]s'' with relatively sodic plagioclase (An70-85), ''[[norite]]s'' (plagioclase-orthopyroxene), and ''[[gabbronorite]]s'' (plagioclase-clinopyroxene-orthopyroxene) with similar plagioclase compositions and mafic minerals more iron-rich than the magnesian suite. The trace element contents of these minerals also indicates a KREEP-rich parent magma. The alkali suite spans an age range similar to the magnesian suite.
*''Lunar granites'' are relatively rare rocks that include [[diorite]]s, monzodiorites, and [[granophyre]]s. They consist of quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase or alkali feldspar, rare mafics (pyroxene), and rare zircon. The alkali feldspar may have unusual compositions unlike any terrestrial feldspar, and they are often Ba-rich. These rocks apparently form by the extreme fractional crystallization of magnesian suite or alkali suite magmas, although liquid immiscibility may also play a role. U-Pb date of [[zircon]]s from these rocks and from lunar soils have ages of 4.1-4.4 Ga, more or less the same as the magnesian suite and alkali suite rocks. In the 1960s, NASA researcher John A. O'Keefe and others linked lunar granites with tektites found on Earth although many researchers refuted these claims. According to one study, a portion of lunar sample 12013 has a chemistry that closely resembles javanite tektites found on Earth.
*''Lunar breccias'' range from glassy vitrophyre melt rocks, to glass-rich breccia, to regolith breccias. The vitrophyres are dominantly glassy rocks that represent impact melt sheets that fill large impact structures. They contain few clasts of the target lithology, which is largely melted by the impact. Glassy breccias form from impact melt that exit the crater and entrain large volumes of crushed (but not melted) ejecta. It may contain abundant clasts that reflect the range of lithologies in the target region, sitting in a matrix of mineral fragments plus glass that welds it all together. Some of the clasts in these breccias are pieces of older breccias, documenting a repeated history of impact brecciation, cooling, and impact. Regolith breccias resemble the glassy breccias but have little or no glass (melt) to weld them together. As noted above, the basin-forming impacts responsible for these breccias pre-date almost all mare basalt volcanism, so clasts of mare basalt are very rare. When found, these clasts represent the earliest phase of mare basalt volcanism preserved.

''Mare basalts'' are named as such because they frequently constitute large portions of the [[lunar maria]]. These are containing typically 18-21 wt% of Fe0, and 1-13% of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They are similar to terrestrial basalts, but have many important differences; for example, mare basalts show a large negative [[europium anomaly]]. The type location is [[Mare Crisium]] sampled by [[Luna 24]]. 
*''[[KREEP]] Basalts'' (and borderline ''VHK (Very High K) basalt''s) have extraordinary potassium content. These are containing 13-16wt% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 9-15wt% FeO, and are enriched in magnesium and incompatible elements (potassium, phosphorus and rare earth elements) 100-150 times compared to ordinary chondrite meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wieczorek |first1=Mark |last2=Jolliff |first2=Bradley |last3=Khan |first3=Amir |last4=et al. |title=The Constitution and Structure of the Lunar Interior |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=2006 |pages=221–364|bibcode=2006RvMG...60..221W |doi=10.2138/rmg.2006.60.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are commonly encountered around the [[Oceanus Procellarum]], and are identified in remote sensing by their high (about 10 ppm) thorium contents. Most of incompatible elements in [[KREEP]] basalts are incorporated in the grains of the phosphate minerals [[apatite]] and [[merrillite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lucey |first1=Paul |last2=Korotev |first2=Randy |last3=Taylor |first3=Larry |last4=et al. |title=understanding the lunar surface and Space-Moon Interactions |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=2006 |pages=100|bibcode=2006RvMG...60...83L |doi=10.2138/rmg.2006.60.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. For safe keeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at [[White Sands Test Facility]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools.

Moon rocks collected during the course of lunar exploration are currently considered priceless. In 2002, a safe was stolen from the Lunar Sample Building that contained minute samples of lunar and [[Mars meteorite|Martian material]]. The samples were recovered, and NASA estimated their value during the ensuing court case at about $1 million for 10 oz. (285 g) of material.

Naturally transported Moon rocks in the form of lunar meteorites are sold and traded among private collectors.

Apollo 17 astronauts [[Eugene Cernan]] and [[Harrison Schmitt]] picked up a rock "composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon". This rock was later labeled sample 70017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Astromaterials Research  |author2=Exploration Science |lastauthoramp=yes |title=70017 Ilmenite Basalt|url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/70017.pdf|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Nixon ordered that fragments of that rock should be distributed in 1973 to all 50 US states and 135 foreign heads of state. The fragments were presented encased in an acrylic sphere, mounted on a wood plaque which included the recipients' flag which had also flown aboard Apollo 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where are the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks?|url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html|publisher=Collect Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the presentation Moon rocks are now unaccounted for, [[Stolen and missing moon rocks|having been stolen or lost]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Discoveries==
Three minerals were discovered from the Moon. These include [[armalcolite]], [[tranquillityite]], and [[pyroxferroite]]. Armalcolite was named for the three [[astronaut]]s on the [[Apollo 11]] mission: [[Neil Armstrong|'''Arm'''strong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|'''Al'''drin]] and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|'''Col'''lins]].

==Stolen and missing Moon rocks==
{{Main|Stolen and missing moon rocks}} 
Because of their rarity on Earth, and the difficulty of obtaining more, Moon rocks have been frequent targets of [[theft]] and [[vandalism]], and many have gone missing or were stolen.

The '''''Nicolaus-Copernicus-Gesamtausgabe''''' (''Nicolaus Copernicus Complete Edition'') is a comprehensive, commented collection of works by, about, and related to [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. The ''Gesamtausgabe'' includes Copernicus's surviving manuscripts and notes, his published writings, other authors' commentary about Copernicus and his works, a bibliography, and a biography.
 
Compilation of the series began in 1973 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Copernicus's birth. The first volume is the [[astronomer]]'s landmark work, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres''), which expounded [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernicus's heliocentric theory]] of the universe. The set is published by [[Akademie Verlag]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

The '''Nobel Prize''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|b|ɛ|l}}, {{IPA-sv|nʊˈbɛlː}}; [[Swedish language|Swedish]] definite form, singular: ''Nobelpriset''; {{lang-no|Nobelprisen}}) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances.

The [[Will and testament|will]] of the [[Swedes|Swedish]] scientist [[Alfred Nobel]] established the five Nobel prizes in 1895. The prizes in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]], [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] were first awarded in 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/|title=Nobel Prizes and Laureates|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Which country has the best brains? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11500373 |accessdate=6 December 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Sweden's central bank, [[Sveriges Riksbank]], established the ''[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]'', which, although not being a Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nomination and Selection of Laureates in Economic Sciences |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/economic-sciences/ |website=Nobel Prize |accessdate=25 June 2018 |quote=The Prize in Economic Sciences is not a Nobel Prize.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become informally known as the "Nobel Prize in Economics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/business/nobel-economics-richard-thaler.html|title=Nobel in Economics Is Awarded to Richard Thaler|last=Appelbaum|first=Binyamin|date=9 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=29 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nobel-prize-in-economics-awarded-to-richard-h-thaler-1507543046|title=Nobel Prize in Economics Awarded to American Richard Thaler|last=Leubsdorf|first=Ben|date=10 October 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=29 March 2018|last2=Gauthier-Villars|first2=David|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in the fields of chemistry, literature, peace activism, physics, and physiology or medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey/awards.html|title=Top Award, ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017 {{!}} Shanghai Ranking - 2017|website=www.shanghairanking.com|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalev8"&gt;[[Nobel Prize#Shalev69|Shalev]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awards the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the Nobel Prize in Physics, and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel; the [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the [[Swedish Academy]] grants the Nobel Prize in Literature; and the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]].

Between 1901 and 2018, the Nobel Prizes (and the Prizes in Economic Sciences, from 1969 on) were awarded 590 times to 935 people and organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 27 organizations and 908 individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/ "All Nobel Prizes"]. ''www.nobelprize.org''. Retrieved 10 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The prize ceremonies take place annually in [[Stockholm]], Sweden (with the exception of the Peace Prize ceremony, which is held in [[Oslo]], Norway). Each recipient (known as a "[[laureate]]") receives a gold medal, a [[diploma]], and a sum of money that has been decided by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. ({{As of|2017}}, each prize is worth 9,000,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]], or about {{USD|1,110,000}}, €944,000, £836,000 or ₹73,800,000.&lt;ref name="PrizeAmountRaised"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize amount is raised by SEK 1 million |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/press/#/publication/59c911c82a43dd000437b4b7/552bd85dccc8e20c00e7f979 |publisher=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold, and later in 18 carat [[Electrum|green gold]] plated with a 24 carat gold coating.

==History==
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photo of a bearded man in his fifties sitting in a chair. | Alfred Nobel had the unpleasant surprise of reading his own obituary, which was titled ''The merchant of death is dead'', in a French newspaper.]]
[[Alfred Nobel]] ({{Audio|Sv-Alfred Nobel.ogg|listen}}) was born on 21 October 1833 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, into a family of engineers.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz5"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the [[Bofors]] iron and steel mill, which he made into a major [[Weapon|armaments]] [[manufacturing|manufacturer]]. Nobel also invented [[ballistite]]. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder [[cordite]]. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355&amp;nbsp;inventions, of which [[dynamite]] is the most famous.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz11"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled ''The merchant of death is dead'', in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig]] who had died, the [[obituary]] was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |first= Frederic |last= Golden |title= The Worst And The Brightest |date= 16 October 2000 |publisher= Time Warner |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998209,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo, Italy]], from a [[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]]. He was 63 years old.&lt;ref name="Sohlman13"&gt;[[#Sohlman69|Sohlman]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.&lt;ref name="Sohlman7"&gt;[[#Sohlman69|Sohlman]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= von Euler|first= U. S.|title= The Nobel Foundation and its Role for Modern Day Science|url= http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=xu7j67w616m06488&amp;size=largest|format= PDF|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|work= Die Naturwissenschaften|date= 6 June 1981|accessdate= 21 January 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714080803/http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=xu7j67w616m06488&amp;size=largest|archivedate= 14 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To widespread astonishment, Nobel's [[Will and testament|last will]] specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[physiology]] or [[medicine]], [[literature]], and [[peace]].&lt;ref name="thelocal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html|title=Full text of Alfred Nobel's Will|author=|date=|work=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31&amp;nbsp;million SEK (c. US$186 million, €150 million in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name="Abrams7"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NobelFoundationPrizeAmount&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize Amounts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the [[Storting]] in Norway.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz13-25"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 13–25&lt;/ref&gt; The executors of Nobel's will, [[Ragnar Sohlman]] and Rudolf Lilljequist, formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organised the award of prizes.&lt;ref name="Abrams7-8"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel's instructions named a [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] to award the Peace Prize, the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organizations were designated.&lt;!--wouldn't a better word be "designated"? they already existed, did they not?--&gt; These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.&lt;ref name="Crawford1"&gt;[[#Crawford69|Crawford]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created [[statute]]s were promulgated by [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]].&lt;ref name="thelocal1"/&gt; In 1905, the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union between Sweden and Norway]] was dissolved.

===Nobel Foundation===
==== Formation of Foundation ==== 
{{Main article|Nobel Foundation}}
[[File:Alfred Nobels will-November 25th, 1895.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A paper with stylish handwriting on it with the title "Testament"|Alfred Nobel's [[Will and testament|will]] stated that 94% of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prizes.]]

According to his will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896, a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity. The Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobel's personal fortune. According to the official sources, Alfred Nobel bequeathed from the shares 94% of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/1314/1322&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nobel Foundation]] was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz14"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Nobel's [[Will and testament|will]], the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. [[Robert Nobel|Robert]] and [[Ludvig Nobel]] were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, who accessed the Nobel family archives, it was this "decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from [[Baku]] that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/42_folder/42_articles/42_readersforum.html|title=Nobel Prize Funded from Baku|publisher=''[[Azerbaijan International]]''|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz15"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman16"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an [[investment company]], in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).&lt;ref name="Levinovitz17-18"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, the Foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish ''kronor'' (c. US$560 million).&lt;ref name="Levinovitz15-17"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the statutes, the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]] is appointed by the Swedish [[Privy Council of Sweden|King in Council]], with the other four members appointed by the [[trustee]]s of the prize-awarding institutions. An [[Executive director|Executive Director]] is chosen from among the [[board of directors|board members]], a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and [[audit]]ors.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz15-17"/&gt;

==== Foundation capital and cost ====
The capital of the Nobel Foundation today is invested 50&amp;nbsp;% in shares, 20&amp;nbsp;% bonds and 30&amp;nbsp;% other investments (e.g. hedge funds or real estate). The distribution can vary by 10 percent.&lt;ref name="dn20121202"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Rabatter räddar Nobelfesten|periodical=Dn.se|publisher=|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/rabatter-raddar-nobelfesten|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-02-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|date=2012-12-02|month=|day=|language=sv|pages=|quote=|last1=Sjöholm/Tt|first1=Gustav}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2008, 64&amp;nbsp;% of the funds were invested mainly in American and European stocks, 20&amp;nbsp;% in bonds, plus 12% in real estate and [[hedge funds]].&lt;ref name="handelsblatt2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel-Stiftung: Noble Sorgen|periodical=Handelsblatt.com|publisher=|url=http://www.handelsblatt.com/journal/nachrichten/noble-sorgen;2106721;0|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-02-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the total annual cost was approximately 120 million krona, with 50 million krona as the prize money. Further costs to pay institutions and persons engaged in giving the prizes were 27,4 million krona. The events during the Nobel week in Stockholm and Oslo cost 20,2 million krona. The administration, Nobel symposium, and similar items had costs of 22.4 million krona. The cost of the Economic Sciences prize of 16.5 Million krona is paid by the [[Sveriges Riksbank]].&lt;ref name="dn20121202" /&gt;

===First prizes===
[[File:Röntgen, Wilhelm Conrad (1845-1923).jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A black and white photo of a bearded man in his fifties sitting in a chair. |[[Wilhelm Röntgen]] received the first Physics Prize for his discovery of X-rays.]]
Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the [[Nobel Committee]]s began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently, they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.

The Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery of [[X-ray]]s and [[Philipp Lenard]]'s work on [[cathode ray]]s. The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize.&lt;ref name="Feldman134"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leroy117-118"&gt;[[#Leroy|Leroy]], pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus, with the Chemistry Prize, the Academy "was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize".&lt;ref name="Levinovitz77"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Jacobus van 't Hoff]].&lt;ref name="Crawford118"&gt;[[#Crawford69|Crawford]], p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in [[chemical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Levinovitz81"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman205"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish Academy chose the poet [[Sully Prudhomme]] for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected [[Leo Tolstoy]] to be awarded.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz144"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Some, including [[Burton Feldman]], have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred [[Victorian literature]] and thus selected a Victorian poet.&lt;ref name="Feldman69"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist [[Emil von Behring]]. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an [[antitoxin]] to treat [[diphtheria]], which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.&lt;ref name="Feldman242-244"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 242–244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leroy233"&gt;[[#Leroy|Leroy]], p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] went to the Swiss [[Henry Dunant|Jean Henri Dunant]] for his role in founding the International [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross Movement]] and initiating the Geneva Convention, and jointly given to French pacifist [[Frédéric Passy]], founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization.

===Second World War===
In 1938 and 1939, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] forbade three laureates from Germany ([[Richard Kuhn]], [[Adolf Butenandt|Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt]], and [[Gerhard Domagk]]) from accepting their prizes.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz23"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm85"&gt;[[#Wilhelm69|Wilhelm]], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939, the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940 to 1942, due to the [[German occupation of Norway|occupation of Norway by Germany]]. In the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/ |title=All Nobel Laureates |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in [[Oslo]] was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden.&lt;ref name="Abrams23"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz23"/&gt;

===Prize in Economic Sciences===
{{Main article|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences}}
[[File:Worldmapnobellaureatesbycountry2.PNG|thumb|Map of Nobel laureates by country]]

In 1968, [[Sveriges Riksbank]] (Sweden's central bank) celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Nobel. The following year, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were [[Jan Tinbergen]] and [[Ragnar Frisch]] "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes".&lt;ref name="Feldman343"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinovitz207"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz20"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award process==
The award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes; the main difference is in who can make nominations for each of them.&lt;ref name="Feldman16-17"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominations===
Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.&lt;ref name="Feldman16-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinovitz26"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.&lt;ref name="Abrams15"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.&lt;ref name="Feldman315"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/nomination_facts.html |title=Nomination Facts |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=3 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109142845/http://nobelprize.org/nomination/nomination_facts.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.&lt;ref name="Feldman52"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz25-28"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt; A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.&lt;ref name="Abrams8"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous nominations===
Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to [[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]], and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, [[William Vickrey]], who in 1996 died after the prize (in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics]]) was announced but before it could be presented.&lt;ref name="Abrams9"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, [[Ralph M. Steinman]], had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref name="cbc1003"/&gt; The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize "was made in good faith", it would remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Steinman Remains Nobel Laureate|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/press_releases_archive/2011/steinman.html|accessdate=8 October 2012|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition time lag===
Nobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made "during the preceding year". Early on, the awards usually recognised recent discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/articles/espmark/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |date=3 December 1999|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of those early discoveries were later discredited. For example, [[Johannes Fibiger]] was awarded the 1926 Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz125"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid repeating this embarrassment, the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Abrams25"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="embo"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve034|last=Breithaupt|pmc=1083830|first=Holger|pmid=11258715 |title=The Nobel Prizes in the new century: An interview with Ralf Pettersson, Director of the Stockholm Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, the Karolinska Institute, and former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology/Medicine |year=2001 |volume=2|issue=2|journal=EMBO Reports|pages=83–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scienceline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceline.org/2009/10/06/blog-liu-nobel_physics-200/ |title=Nobel Prize in Physics Honors "Masters of Light" |work=Scienceline |date=7 October 2009|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralf Pettersson, former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine, "the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident."&lt;ref name=embo/&gt;

[[File:Nobelinstituttet 20080913-01.jpg|thumb|alt=A room with pictures on the walls. In the middle of the room there is a wooden table with chairs around it.|The committee room of the Norwegian Nobel Committee]]
The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Laureates in Literature |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]] was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2008/index.html |title=Peace 2008 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Bryant |title=Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari Wins Nobel Peace Prize |date=10 October 2008 |work=[[Voice of America]] |publisher=International Broadcasting Bureau |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa8.cfm |accessdate=27 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117162443/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa8.cfm |archivedate=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Kofi Annan]] was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Abrams330"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], and [[Shimon Peres]] received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref name="Abrams27"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Awards for physics, chemistry, and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted.  Sometimes,  this takes decades – for example, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution.&lt;ref name=currentscience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vishveshwara|first=S.|title=Leaves from an unwritten diary: S.

Except for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.icm.ac.uk/technology/2009-nobel-prize-award-ceremony-live-online/4893/ |title=2009 Nobel Prize award ceremony live online &amp;#124; IT &amp;#124; ICM Commercial &amp; Business News |publisher=[[Institute of Commercial Management]] |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209005839/http://news.icm.ac.uk/technology/2009-nobel-prize-award-ceremony-live-online/4893/ |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/23784/20091210/ |title=Pomp aplenty as winners gather for Nobel gala |work=[[The Local]] |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215055502/http://www.thelocal.se/23784/20091210/ |archivedate=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]], with the Nobel banquet following immediately at [[Stockholm City Hall]]. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] (1905–1946), at the [[auditorium]] of the [[University of Oslo]] (1947–1989), and at [[Oslo City Hall]] (1990–present).&lt;ref name="Levinovitz21-23"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]]. In Oslo, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]].&lt;ref name="thelocal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweden2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Froman |first=Ingmarie |url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Research/Reading/The-Nobel-Week--a-celebration-of-science/ |title=The Nobel Week — a celebration of science |publisher=[[Swedish Institute]] |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014205607/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Research/Reading/The-Nobel-Week--a-celebration-of-science/ |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners.

===Nobel Banquet===
{{main article|Nobel Banquet}}
[[File:Nobel-banquet-table.jpg|thumb|alt=A set table with a white table cloth. There are many plates and glasses plus a menu visible on the table.|Table at the 2005 Nobel Banquet in Stockholm]]
After the award ceremony in Sweden, a banquet is held in the [[Blue Hall]] at the [[Stockholm City Hall]], which is attended by the [[Swedish Royal Family]] and around 1,300 guests.

The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] banquet is held in Norway at the [[Grand Hotel (Oslo)|Oslo Grand Hotel]] after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the President of the [[Storting]], the Swedish prime minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.

===Nobel lecture===
According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par9|title=The Nobel Foundation - Statutes|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]],"Nobel Rhetoric, Or Petrarch's Pendulum", in the journal Rhetoric and Philosophy 42(4), 373–400, 2009 {{ISSN|0031-8213}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office.&lt;ref name="Abrams18-19"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/08/jmg-clezio-nobel-lecture |title=Le Clézio uses Nobel lecture to attack information poverty|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Company |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=20 January 2010|first=Richard|last=Lea |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==

===Medals===
It was announced on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by [[Myntverket]] (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Medalj – ett traditionellt hantverk|publisher= [[Myntverket]]|url= http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&amp;page=3 |language= Swedish|accessdate=15 December 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102934/http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang%3Dsv%26page%3D3 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate= 18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]]. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.&lt;ref name="Feldman2"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.&lt;ref name=Paulingmedal&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/pictures/nobel-chemistry-medal.html "Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 [[carat (purity)|carat]] gold. Since then, they have been struck in 18 carat [[coloured gold#Green gold|green gold]] plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold, but averages about {{convert|175|g|lb}} for each medal. The diameter is {{convert|66|mm|in}} and the thickness varies between {{convert|5.2|mm|in}} and {{convert|2.4|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/medals/ |title=The Nobel Prize Medals and the Medal for the Prize in Economics |accessdate=2 April 2010 |last=Lemmel |first=Birgitta |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display, Nobel medals are subject to medal theft.&lt;ref name="UniversityofCalifornia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/8975 |title=University of California – UC Newsroom – Nobel Prize medal stolen from Lawrence Hall of Science is found, student arrested |publisher=[[University of California]] |accessdate=21 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111230223/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/8975 |archivedate=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/26/world/world-briefing-asia-india-poet-s-nobel-medal-stolen.html?fta=y |title=Poet's Nobel Medal Stolen |work=The New York Times|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.|accessdate=21 January 2010|first=Hari|last=Kumar|date=26 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1646982020070616 |title=Police hand back Tutu's stolen Nobel medal|work=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=21 January 2010 |date=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the medals of German scientists [[Max von Laue]] and [[James Franck]] were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark, Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself) [[George de Hevesy]] dissolved them in [[aqua regia]] (nitro-hydrochloric acid), to prevent confiscation by [[Nazi Germany]] and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.&lt;ref name="Feldman397"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomas===
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden, or in the case of the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.&lt;ref name="Feldman2"/&gt; The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.&lt;ref name="Abrams18"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize Diplomas |accessdate=12 March 2010 |last=Lemmel |first=Birgitta |year=2009 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Award money===
The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.&lt;ref name=Feldman2/&gt; The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880,000 SEK per prize (c. 2.6 million SEK altogether, US$350,000 today). In 2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million).&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Amounts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/prize_amounts_14.pdf|title=Prize Amount and Market Value |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|year=2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2009/10/11/foreman.how.nobel.awarded.cnn?iref=videosearch |title=Video – Breaking News Videos from CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, it was lowered to 8 million SEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee lowers Nobel Prize by 2 million kronor |url=http://www.thelocal.se/41378/20120611/ |publisher=The Local |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615172218/http://www.thelocal.se/41378/20120611 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients.

===Controversial recipients===
[[File:Henry A. Kissinger, U.S. Secretary of State, 1973-1977.jpg|thumb|upright|When it was announced that [[Henry Kissinger]] was to be awarded the Peace Prize, two of the Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigned in protest.]]
Among other criticisms, the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda, and of omitting more deserving candidates. They have also been accused of [[Eurocentrism]], especially for the Literature Prize.&lt;ref name="Abramsxiv"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman65"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarasota Herald-Tribune - 20 Sep 1981"&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Tuohy|title=Literature Award Hardest for Nobel Prize Panel|date=20 September 1981|publisher=Sarasota Herald Tribune|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19810920&amp;id=FZ0cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DGgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6245,2424225|page=58|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Peace Prize

Among the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Lê Đức Thọ]]. This led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members.&lt;ref name="topten"&gt;{{cite news|last=de Sousa |first=Ana Naomi |title=Top ten Nobel Prize rows|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6868007.ece|accessdate=25 May 2010|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|work=The Times|date=9 October 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger and Thọ were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between [[North Vietnam]] and the United States in January 1973. However, when the award was announced, both sides were still engaging in hostilities.&lt;ref name="Abrams219"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics sympathetic to the North announced that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite, responsible for widening the war. Those hostile to the North and what they considered its deceptive practices during negotiations were deprived of a chance to criticise Lê Đức Thọ, as he declined the award. &lt;ref name="Feldman315"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams315"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yasser Arafat]], [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine.&lt;ref name="Feldman315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinovitz183"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the award was announced, one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned.&lt;ref name="Feldman15-16"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.&lt;ref name="Abrams302-306"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 302–306&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to [[Barack Obama]] [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize|in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Steven|last1=Erlanger |first2=Sheryl Gay|last2=Stolberg |title=Surprise Nobel for Obama Stirs Praise and Doubts |date=9 October 2009|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/10nobel.html?_r=1|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as [[President of the United States]], but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months.&lt;ref name="philp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6868833.ece|title=How the Nobel Peace Prize winner is decided|last=Philp|first=Catherine|date=10 October 2009|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|location=London|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5981JK20091009?sp=true|title=Obama is surprise winner of Nobel Peace Prize |accessdate=9 October 2009 |date=9 October 2009 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; or worthy of the company it would place him in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Winning-the-Nobel-Peace-Prize/ |title=Remarks by the President on winning the Nobel Peace Prize |accessdate=1 April 2010 |date=9 October 2009 |publisher=[[The White House]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20091014210725/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Winning-the-Nobel-Peace-Prize/ |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Al Gore]], also prompted accusations of a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Naughton|first= Philippe|title= President Obama humbled: I do not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize|date= 9 October 2009|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|work= The Times|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6868457.ece|accessdate=8 June 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Literature Prize

The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to [[Elfriede Jelinek]] drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, [[Knut Ahnlund]]. Ahnlund resigned, alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused "irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art". He alleged that Jelinek's works were "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9665122/ |title=Who deserves Nobel prize?

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/08/AR2009100800965.html |title=Author's Nobel Stirs Shock-and-'Bah' |accessdate=1 April 2010 |last=Jordan |first=Mary |date=9 October 2009 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/08/nobel-prize-winner-herta_n_313577.html |title=NOBEL PRIZE WINNER: Herta Muller |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Science prizes

In 1949, the neurologist [[António Egas Moniz]] received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the [[Lobotomy|prefrontal leucotomy]]. The previous year, [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Dr. Walter Freeman]] had developed a [[Lobotomy#Transorbital lobotomy|version of the procedure]] which was faster and easier to carry out. Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure, Freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern [[medical ethics]]. Endorsed by such influential publications as ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', leucotomy or "lobotomy" became so popular that about 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz's receipt of the Prize.&lt;ref name="Feldman286-289"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 286–289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/13/neuroscience.medicalscience |title=He was bad, so they put an ice pick in his brain... |work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=31 March 2010|date=12 January 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overlooked achievements===
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Norwegian Nobel Committee declined to award a prize in 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate."]]

The Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937–39, 1947, and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz181-186"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 181–186&lt;/ref&gt; Later, members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006, said, "The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110915025114/http://www.icrs.ugm.ac.id/wednesday-forum-schedule/111-relevance-of-gandhian-philosophy-in-the-21st-century Relevance of Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st century]. icrs.ugm.ac.id&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate" that year.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html |title=Mahatma Gandhi, the Missing Laureate |accessdate=17 October 2007 |last=Tønnesson |first=Øyvind |date=1 December 1999|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams147-148"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1989/presentation-speech.html |title= The Nobel Prize in Peace 1989 – Presentation Speech |accessdate=12 June 2010 |last= Aarvik |first= Egil |publisher= [[The Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out. ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' lists [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], [[Sari Nusseibeh]], and [[Corazon Aquino]] as people who "never won the prize, but should have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Kenner |title=Nobel Peace Prize Also-Rans |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |work=Foreign Policy |pages=1–7 |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125073527/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |archivedate=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept.  He consulted staff and later replied that he would.  At the same time, Chairman [[Gunnar Jahn]] of the Nobel Peace prize committee, lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to [[UNICEF]].  The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War.  The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/peace/lundestad-review/ |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1901–2000 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"U Thant in New York: A Portrait of the Third Secretary-General of the United Nations", Rames Nassif, C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd (31 December 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|upright|left|James Joyce, one of the controversial omissions of the Literature Prize]]
The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions. [[Adam Kirsch]] has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons. The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism.&lt;ref name="KirschNoClue"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch |first=Adam |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2201447/ |title=The Nobel Committee has no clue about American literature. – By Adam Kirsch – Slate Magazine |journal=Slate |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/akademien-valjer-helst-en-europe-1.789000 |title=Akademien väljer helst en europé |accessdate=2 April 2010 |last=Fristorp |first=Mimmi |date=8 October 2008 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218021516/http://www.dn.se/dnbok/akademien-valjer-helst-en-europe-1.789000 |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by [[Peter Englund]], the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8742797 |title=Judge: Nobel literature prizes 'too Eurocentric' |work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=6 October 2009|accessdate=3 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency towards European authors still leaves some European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize,  including Europe's [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[James Joyce]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Karel Čapek]], the [[New World]]'s [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[John Updike]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Mark Twain]], and Africa's [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref name="Feldman56-57"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates can receive multiple nominations the same year. [[Gaston Ramon]] received a total of 155&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Database: Gaston Ramon|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7545|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominations in physiology or medicine from 1930 to 1953, the last year with public nomination data for that award {{as of|2016|lc=on}}. He died in 1963 without being awarded. [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux]] received 115&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Database: Emile P Roux|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7930|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominations in physiology or medicine, and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] received 84&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Database: Arnold Sommerfeld|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=8661|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physics.

The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.&lt;ref name="Levinovitz61"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators, one or more will miss out. For example, in 2002, the prize was awarded to [[Koichi Tanaka]] and [[John Fenn (chemist)|John Fenn]] for the development of [[mass spectrometry]] in [[protein|protein chemistry]], an award that did not recognise the achievements of [[Franz Hillenkamp]] and [[Michael Karas]] of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="Spinney"&gt;{{cite web|author=Spinney, Laura|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/20931|title=News Analysis: Nobel Prize Controversy|work=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|year=2002|accessdate=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Nicholas|last= Dawidoff|title= The Civil Heretic|date= 25 April 2009|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all/|work= The New York Times|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of [[C. R. Hagen|Carl Hagen]], [[Gerald Guralnik]], and [[Tom Kibble]] published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began, but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to [[Peter Higgs]] and [[François Englert]], who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles.  Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction, or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Goodman | first = James | title = UR prof disappointed in Nobel Prize decision | publisher = democratandchronicle.com | url =  http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2013/10/08/ur-prof-disappointed-in-nobel-prize-decision/2941821/ | accessdate = 8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. The Economics Prize was not awarded to [[Fischer Black]], who died in 1995, when his co-author [[Myron Scholes]] received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with [[Robert C. Merton]], another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.

Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]], who co-discovered nuclear fission along with [[Otto Hahn]], may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Crawford | first1 = Elisabeth, | last2 = Lewin Sime | first2 = Ruth, | last3  = Walker | first3 = Mark, | display-authors = 1 | title = A Nobel Tale of Postwar Injustice | journal = Physics Today | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 26–32 | year = 1997 | doi=10.1063/1.881933| bibcode = 1997PhT....50i..26C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later, when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 [[Enrico Fermi Award]].

===Emphasis on discoveries over inventions===
Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded "to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604155708/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel]. nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given "to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics". Nobel did not emphasise discoveries, but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg, in papers published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''Technoetic Arts'', have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/448644c|pmid=17687300|title=Physics Nobels should favour inventions|year=2007|last1=Bartneck|first1=Christoph|last2=Rauterberg|first2=Matthias|journal=Nature|volume=448|issue=7154|page=644|bibcode = 2007Natur.448..644B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1386/tear.6.1.73_1|title=The asymmetry between discoveries and inventions in the Nobel Prize in Physics|year=2008|last1=Bartneck|first1=Christoph|last2=Rauterberg|first2=Matthias|journal=Technoetic Arts: A Journal of Speculative Research|volume=6|page=73|url=http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2008/nobel/bartneckTechnoeticArts2008.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.145.8130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender disparity ===
In terms of the most prestigious awards in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women. Out of 210 laureates in Physics, 181 in Chemistry and 216 in Medicine between 1901 and 2018, there were only three female laureates in physics, five in chemistry and 12 in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org. 2014.

==Specially distinguished laureates==

===Multiple laureates===
[[File:Marie Curie 1903.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white portrait of a woman in profile. |[[Marie Curie]], one of four people who have received the Nobel Prize twice (Physics and Chemistry)]]

Four people have received two Nobel Prizes. [[Marie Curie]] received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]] and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure [[radium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5715220/Marie-Curie-voted-greatest-female-scientist.html |title=Marie Curie voted greatest female scientist |work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; making her the only person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. [[Linus Pauling]] was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the [[chemical bond]] and its application to the [[Chemical structure|structure]] of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. [[John Bardeen]] received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the [[transistor]] and in 1972 for the theory of [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref name="Feldman180"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Sanger]] received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the [[insulin]] molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.&lt;ref name="Shalev78"&gt;[[#Shalev69|Shalev]], p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman222"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Two organizations have received the Peace Prize multiple times. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary.&lt;ref name="Abrams84"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams149"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams199-200"&gt;[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has been awarded the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.&lt;ref name="Feldman313"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family laureates===
The [[Curie Family|Curie family]] has received the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. [[Marie Curie]] received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, [[Pierre Curie]], shared the 1903 Physics prize with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/curie_marie.shtml|title= Marie Curie (1867–1934)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, [[Irène Joliot-Curie]], received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]]. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, [[Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr.|Henry Labouisse]], was the director of [[UNICEF]] when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on that organisation's behalf.&lt;ref name="Feldman405"&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no family matches the Curie family's record, there have been several with two laureates. The husband-and-wife team of [[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine&lt;ref name="GrinsteinBiermann1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grinstein|first1=Louise S.|last2=Biermann|first2=Carol A.|last3=Rose|first3=Rose K.|title=Women in the Biological Sciences: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPGJZ7e06PQC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=25 December 2012|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29180-7|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the husband-and-wife team of [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] in 2014 (along with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. J. Thomson]] was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that [[electron]]s are particles. His son, [[George Paget Thomson]], received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they [[Wave–particle duality|also have the properties of waves]].&lt;ref name="Gribbin91"&gt;[[#Gribbin69|Gribbin]], p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Henry Bragg]] and his son, [[William Lawrence Bragg]], shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectrometer]].&lt;ref name="Hargittai2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hargittai|first=István|title=The Road to Stockholm:Nobel Prizes, Science, and Scientists: Nobel Prizes, Science, and Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9rF6MTXtXYC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=28 August 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860785-4|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niels Bohr]] was awarded the Physics prize in 1922, as was his son, [[Aage Bohr]], in 1975.&lt;ref name=Feldman405/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6829396.ece|title= Professor Aage Bohr: Nobel prize-winning physicist|work= [[The Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|date= 11 September 2009|accessdate=24 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manne Siegbahn]], who received the Physics Prize in 1924, was the father of [[Kai Siegbahn]], who received the Physics Prize in 1981.&lt;ref name=Feldman405/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Maugh|first= Thomas H., II|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-siegbahn8aug08,1,6152607.story|title= Kai Siegbahn, 89; Nobel-winning physicist invented electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= 8 August 2007|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]], who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of [[Ulf von Euler]], who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970.&lt;ref name=Feldman405/&gt; [[C.

==Cultural impact==
Being a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that is recognisable worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films like ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]'' and ''[[Nobel Son]]'' about fictional Nobel laureates as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as ''[[Nobel Chor]]'', a film based on the [[Rabindranath Tagore#Theft of Nobel Prize|unsolved theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize]].&lt;ref name="nobel film screen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/stockholmvisitorsboard/pressreleases/the-nobel-prize-on-the-film-screen-937364 |title=The Nobel Prize: On the film screen |author=Stockholm Business Region |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |work=Mynewsdesk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102825/http://www.mynewsdesk.com/stockholmvisitorsboard/pressreleases/the-nobel-prize-on-the-film-screen-937364 |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodesco|first=Alberto|date=2018|title=Nobel laureates in fiction: From La fin du monde to The Big Bang Theory|journal=Public Understanding of Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=458–470|doi=10.1177/0963662518766476|pmid=29720058|issn=0963-6625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refusals and constraints==
[[File:Richard Kuhn ETH-Bib Dia 248-065.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white portrait of a man in a suit and tie. Half of his face is in a shadow.|[[Richard Kuhn]], who was forced to decline his Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]
Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize.  In 1964, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] was awarded the Literature Prize but refused, stating, "A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honourable form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Holt|first= Jim|url= http://www.slate.com/id/2088648/|title= Exit, Pursued by a Lobster|work= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date= 22 September 2003|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lê Đức Thọ]], chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the [[Paris Peace Accords]], declined, stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|last= English|first=Jason|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/10/06/mf.nobel.odd.facts/index.html|title= Odd facts about Nobel Prize winners|work= [[CNN]]|date= 6 October 2009|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler hindered [[Richard Kuhn]], [[Adolf Butenandt]], and [[Gerhard Domagk]] from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958, [[Boris Pasternak]] declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying "this refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it back until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf.&lt;ref name="timesonline-292690"&gt;{{cite news|last= Franchetti|first= Mark|title= How the CIA won Zhivago a Nobel|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1292690.ece|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|date= 14 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|last= Finn|first= Peter|title= The Plot Thickens|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012601758.html|publisher=Katharine Weymouth|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date= 27 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in [[Myanmar|Burma]]; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aung San Suu Kyi – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/kyi.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Xiaobo]] was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners, and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime.

==Legacy==
The memorial symbol "Planet of Alfred Nobel" was opened in Dnipropetrovsk University of Economics and Law in 2008. On the globe, there are 802 Nobel laureates' reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panoramio.com/photo/27994903?comment_page=1 Monument of the Planet of Alfred Nobel].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7657">In [[sociology of science]], '''obliteration by incorporation''' ('''OBI''') occurs when at some stage in the [[history of science|development of a science]], certain ideas become so universally accepted and commonly used that their contributors are no longer [[citations|cited]]. Eventually, its source and creator are forgotten ("obliterated") as the concept enters common [[knowledge]] (is "incorporated"). Obliteration occurs when "the sources of an idea, finding or concept, become obliterated by incorporation in canonical knowledge, so that only a few are still aware of their parentage".&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Merton, quoted by Sztompka, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The concept was introduced by [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1949, although some incorrectly attribute it to [[Eugene Garfield]], whose work contributed to the popularization of Merton's theory. Merton introduced the concept of "obliteration by incorporation" in his landmark work, ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' in 1949 (although the revised edition of 1968 is usually cited (pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28, 35–37 in the enlarged edition)). Merton also introduced the less known counterpart to this concept, [[adumbrationism]], meaning the attribution of insights, ideas or analogies absent from original works.&lt;ref name="Sztompka, 1991"&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka]], ''Society in Action: The Theory of Social Becoming'', University of Chicago Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-226-78815-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226788156&amp;id=sdSw3FgVOS4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=%22Obliteration+by+incorporation%22&amp;sig=Xm5iltugsvIVoTpeWuvH83_dLdQ Google Print, p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of "obliteration by incorporation", both the original idea and the literal formulations of it are forgotten due to prolonged and widespread use, and enter into everyday [[language]] (or at least the everyday language of a given [[academic discipline]]), no longer being attributed to their creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sztompka | first = Piotr | author-link = Piotr Sztompka | contribution = Robert K.

Thus they become similar to [[common knowledge]]. Merton notes that this process is much more common in highly codified fields of [[natural science]]s than in [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;David J. Hess, ''Science Studies: An Advanced Introduction'', NYU Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8147-3564-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0814735649&amp;id=QAwDUOdHE1kC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=%22Obliteration+by+incorporation%22&amp;sig=SlAMF9Q71SBk_V6YFcpz4qeCPnE Google Print, p.77]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also lead to ignoring or hiding the early sources of recent ideas under the claims of novelty and originality.&lt;ref name="Sztompka, 1991"/&gt; [[Allan Chapman (historian)|Allan Chapman]] notes that 'obliteration by incorporation' often affects famous individuals, to whom attribution becomes considered as obvious and unnecessary, thus leading to their exclusion from citations, even if they and their ideas have been mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name=cwf&gt;Ellen G. Cohn, Richard A. Wright, David P. Farrington, ''Evaluating Criminology and Criminal Justice'', Greenwood Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-313-30153-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0313301530&amp;id=nAfDzHJ75-gC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;q=obliteration&amp;vq=obliteration&amp;dq=%22Obliteration+by+incorporation%22&amp;sig=qZjiSvBqcotaL6dQju3kGtkuLuk, Google Print, p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Ferber]] and Eugene Garfield concur with Chapman, noting that obliteration often occurs when the citation count and reputation of an affected scientist have already reached levels much higher than average.&lt;ref name=cwf/&gt;

The '''obliteration phenomenon''' is a concept in [[library and information science]], referring to the tendency for truly ground-breaking research papers to fail to be cited after the ideas they put forward are fully accepted into the orthodox world view. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s paper on the [[theory of relativity]] is rarely cited in modern research papers on [[physical cosmology]], despite its direct relevance.

The concept builds on the idea of an optimum nutritional environment in the body and suggests that diseases reflect deficiencies in this environment.

The approach is sometimes referred to as [[megavitamin therapy]]&lt;ref name="isbn1-59120-226-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7207301"/&gt; because its practice evolved out of, and in some cases still uses, doses of [[vitamin]]s and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] many times higher than the recommended [[Dietary Reference Intake|dietary intake]].

==History and development==
In the early 20th century, some doctors hypothesised that vitamins could cure disease, and supplements were prescribed in megadoses by the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Menolascino"/&gt; Their effects on health were disappointing, though, and in the 1950s and 1960s, nutrition was de-emphasised in standard medical curricula.&lt;ref name="Menolascino"/&gt; Riordon's organization cite figures from this period as founders of their movement,&lt;ref name="OMHistory"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.orthomolecular.org/history/index.shtml |title=History of orthomolecular medicine |publisher=riordonclinic.org |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the word "orthomolecular" was coined by Linus Pauling only in 1967.

Amongst the individuals described posthumously as orthomolecularists are [[Max Gerson]], who developed a diet that he claimed could treat diseases, which the American Medical Association's 1949 Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry found ineffective;&lt;ref name='AMA_Council'&gt;

In 1948, William McCormick theorized that [[vitamin C]] deficiency played an important role in many diseases and began to use large doses in patients.&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;

In the 1950s, some individuals believed that vitamin deficiencies caused mental illness.&lt;ref name="Menolascino"/&gt; Psychiatrists [[Humphry Osmond]] and [[Abram Hoffer]] gave people having acute [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] episodes high doses of [[niacin]],&lt;ref&gt;

While niacin has no known efficacy in psychiatric disease, the use of niacin in combination with [[statins]] and other medical therapies has become one of several medical treatments for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;

In the late 1960s, [[Linus Pauling]] introduced the expression "orthomolecular"&lt;ref name=pauling1968&gt;

According to Abram Hoffer, orthomolecular medicine does not purport to treat all diseases, nor is it "a replacement for standard treatment.

==Orthomolecular psychiatry==
{{Main|Orthomolecular psychiatry}}
Hoffer believed that particular nutrients could cure [[mental illness]]. In the 1950s, he attempted to treat schizophrenia with niacin, although proponents of orthomolecular psychiatry say that the ideas behind their approach predate Hoffer.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Abram Hoffer, "primitive" peoples do not consume processed foods and do not have "degenerative" diseases.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=Weston Price |year=2008 |title=[Nutrition and Physical Degeneration] |publisher=Price Pottenger Nutrition |edition=8th |isbn=0-916764-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, typical "Western" diets are said to be insufficient for long-term health, necessitating the use of megadose supplements of [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral]]s, [[protein]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[omega-3 fatty acid|ω-3 fatty acids]], [[omega-6 fatty acid|ω-6 fatty acids]], [[medium-chain triglycerides]], [[dietary fiber]], short and long chain [[fatty acids]], [[lipotropic|lipotropes]], systemic and [[digestive enzyme]]s, other digestive factors, and prohormones to ward off hypothetical [[metabolism]] anomalies at an early stage, before they cause disease.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;

A survey released in May, 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] focused on who used [[alternative medicine]], what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults age 18 years and over during 2003. The survey reported uses in the previous twelve months that include orthomolecular related uses: Nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products 18.9%, Diet-based therapies 3.5%, Megavitamin therapy 2.8%.&lt;ref name=NCCAMsurvey&gt;

Another recent CAM survey reported that 12% of liver disease patients used the antioxidant [[silymarin]], more than 6% used vitamins, and that "in all, 74% of patients reported using CAM in addition to the medications prescribed by their physician, but 26% did not inform their physician of their CAM use."&lt;ref&gt;

==Medical and scientific reception==

===Methodology===
Orthomolecular therapies have been criticized as lacking a sufficient evidence base for clinical use: their scientific foundations are too weak, the studies that have been performed are too few and too open to interpretation, and reported positive findings in observational studies are contradicted by the results of more rigorous clinical trials.&lt;ref name="cassileth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Proponents of orthomolecular medicine strongly dispute this statement by citing studies demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments involving vitamins, though this ignores the belief that a normal diet will provide adequate nutrients to avoid deficiencies, and that orthomolecular treatments are not actually related to [[Avitaminosis|vitamin deficiency]].&lt;ref name=Singh2008/&gt; The lack of scientifically rigorous testing of orthomolecular medicine has led to its practices being classed with other forms of alternative medicine and regarded as unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;

Some supplements have exhibited benefits for specific conditions, while a few have been confirmed to be harmful; the consumption of nutritious foods is the best recognized method to obtain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients crucial for good health.&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt; [[Barrie Cassileth]], an adviser on alternative medicine to the [[National Institutes of Health]], stated that "scientific research has found no benefit from orthomolecular therapy for any disease,"&lt;ref name="cassileth"/&gt; and medical textbooks also report that there is "no evidence that megavitamin or orthomolecular therapy is effective in treating any disease."&lt;ref&gt;

A 1973 task force of the American Psychiatric Association unanimously concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This review and critique has carefully examined the literature produced by megavitamin proponents and by those who have attempted to replicate their basic and clinical work. It concludes in this regard that the credibility of the megavitamin proponents is low. Their credibility is further diminished by a consistent refusal over the past decade to perform controlled experiments and to report their new results in a scientifically acceptable fashion. Under these circumstances this Task Force considers the massive publicity which they promulgate via radio, the lay press and popular books, using catch phrases which are really misnomers like "megavitamin therapy" and "orthomolecular treatment," to be deplorable.&lt;ref&gt;

====Safety====
In the United States, pharmaceuticals must be proven safe and effective to the satisfaction of the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] before they can be marketed, whereas [[dietary supplement]]s must be proven ''unsafe'' before regulatory action can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;

The US regulations also have provisions to recognize a general level of safety for established nutrients that can forgo new drug safety tests. Proponents of orthomolecular medicine argue that supplements are less likely to cause dangerous side-effects or harm, since they are normally present in the body.&lt;ref name="orthomed"/&gt; Some vitamins are toxic in high doses&lt;ref name=NutCom1990 /&gt; and nearly all (with the possible exception of Vitamin C&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Padayatty | first1 = S.

===Alleged institutional bias===
Advocates of orthomolecular medicine, including Pauling, Hoffer and [[Ewan Cameron (physician)|Ewan Cameron]] have claimed that their findings are actively suppressed by the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Hoffer wrote "There is no conspiracy led and directed by a single person or by a single organization. There is no Mafia in psychiatry. However, there is a conspiracy led and directed by a large number of professionals and their associations who have a common aim to protect their hard-earned orthodoxy, no matter what the cost to their opponent colleagues or to their patients.".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Hoffer A |year=1987 |url=http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1987/pdf/1987-v02n03-p158.pdf |format=PDF |title=Is there a conspiracy? |journal=J Orthomol Med |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=158 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The ''[[Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine]]'', founded in 1967 as the ''Journal of Schizophrenia'', is a major publication of orthomolecular medicine. As [[Abram Hoffer]] wrote:
:We had to create our own journals because it was impossible to obtain entry into the official journals of [[psychiatry]] and medicine. Before 1967 I had not found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and by then I had about 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.&lt;ref name="hoffer"&gt;

'''[[Computer programming]]''' &amp;ndash; process that leads from an original formulation of a [[computing]] problem to [[executable]] computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating [[algorithms]], verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Shaun Bebbington| year=2014| url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-coding| title=What is coding| accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Shaun Bebbington| year=2014| url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-programming| title=What is programming| accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of algorithms in a target [[programming language]]. [[Source code]] is written in one or more [[programming language]]s. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem.

In nuclear reactor engineering, a per cent mille is equal to one-thousandth of a percent of the [[Nuclear reactor physics#criticality|reactivity]], denoted by Greek lowercase letter [[rho]]. Reactivity is a dimensionless unit representing a departure from [[Criticality (status)|criticality]], calculated by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2012_2013/Reactivity_Measurements_(Vid_Merljak).pdf|title=Reactivity measurements|last=Merljak|first=Vid|publisher=University of Ljublj|access-date=September 17, 2017}}ana&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=(k_{eff}-1)/k_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; 
where k&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[effective multiplication factor]] for the reaction. Therefore, one pcm is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/nuclear-fission-chain-reaction/reactivity/|title=Reactivity|website=nuclear-power.net|access-date=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1pcm = \rho * 10^5&lt;/math&gt; 
This unit is commonly used in the operation of [[light-water reactor]] sites because reactivity values tend to be small, so measuring in pcm allows reactivity to be expressed using whole numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/nuclear-fission-chain-reaction/reactivity/percent-mille-pcm-unit-of-reactivity/|title=percent mille – pcm – unit of reactivity|website=nuclear-power.net|access-date=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[multivariate statistics]], if &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector space|vector]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[random variable]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[symmetric matrix]], then the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] quantity &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is known as a '''quadratic form''' in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Expectation==
It can be shown that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Bates|title=Quadratic Forms of Random Variables|url=http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~st849-1/lectures/Ch02.pdf|work=STAT 849 lectures|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left[\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon\right]=\operatorname{tr}\left[\Lambda \Sigma\right] + \mu^T\Lambda\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are the [[expected value]] and [[covariance matrix|variance-covariance matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, and tr denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of a matrix. This result only depends on the existence of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;; in particular, [[multivariate normal distribution|normality]] of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' required.

A book treatment of the topic of quadratic forms in random variables is that of Mathai and Provost.&lt;ref name="Mathai"&gt;{{cite book | title=Quadratic Forms in Random Variables | publisher=CRC Press |author1=Mathai, A. M. |author2=Provost, Serge B.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1992 | page=424 | isbn=978-0824786915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proof ===
Since the quadratic form is a scalar quantity, &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon = \operatorname{tr}(\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, by the cyclic property of the [[Trace (linear algebra)#Properties|trace]] operator,

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[\operatorname{tr}(\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon)] = \operatorname{E}[\operatorname{tr}(\Lambda\varepsilon\varepsilon^T)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the trace operator is a linear combination of the components of the matrix, it therefore follows from the linearity of the expectation operator that

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[\operatorname{tr}(\Lambda\varepsilon\varepsilon^T)] = \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda \operatorname{E}(\varepsilon\varepsilon^T)). &lt;/math&gt;

A standard property of variances then tells us that this is

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda (\Sigma + \mu \mu^T)). &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the cyclic property of the trace operator again, we get

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda\Sigma) + \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda \mu \mu^T) = \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda\Sigma) + \operatorname{tr}(\mu^T\Lambda\mu) = \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda\Sigma) + \mu^T\Lambda\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

==Variance==
In general, the variance of a quadratic form depends greatly on the distribution of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. However, if &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; ''does'' follow a multivariate normal distribution, the variance of the quadratic form becomes particularly tractable. Assume for the moment that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix. Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var} \left[\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon\right] = 2\operatorname{tr}\left[\Lambda \Sigma\Lambda \Sigma\right] + 4\mu^T\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda\mu&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Linear models in statistics |last=Rencher |first=Alvin C. |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |last2=Schaalje |first2=G. Bruce. |isbn=9780471754985 |edition=2nd |location=Hoboken, N.J. |oclc=212120778}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In fact, this can be generalized to find the [[covariance]] between two quadratic forms on the same &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (once again, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; must both be symmetric):

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}\left[\varepsilon^T\Lambda_1\varepsilon,\varepsilon^T\Lambda_2\varepsilon\right]=2\operatorname{tr}\left[\Lambda _1\Sigma\Lambda_2 \Sigma\right] + 4\mu^T\Lambda_1\Sigma\Lambda_2\mu&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Computing the variance in the non-symmetric case===
Some texts incorrectly{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} state that the above variance or covariance results hold without requiring &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; to be symmetric. The case for general &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be derived by noting that

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^T\Lambda^T\varepsilon=\varepsilon^T\Lambda\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^T\tilde{\Lambda}\varepsilon=\varepsilon^T\left(\Lambda+\Lambda^T\right)\varepsilon/2&lt;/math&gt;

'''is''' a quadratic form in the symmetric matrix &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Lambda}=\left(\Lambda+\Lambda^T\right)/2&lt;/math&gt;, so the mean and variance expressions are the same, provided &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; therein.

==Examples of quadratic forms==
In the setting where one has a set of observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and an [[operator matrix]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then the  [[residual sum of squares]] can be written as a quadratic form in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{RSS}=y^T(I-H)^T (I-H)y.&lt;/math&gt;

For procedures where the matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and [[idempotent matrix|idempotent]], and the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are [[multivariate normal distribution|Gaussian]] with covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textrm{RSS}/\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; has a [[chi-squared distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;k=\operatorname{tr}\left[(I-H)^T(I-H)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\mu^T(I-H)^T(I-H)\mu/2&lt;/math&gt;

may be found by matching the first two [[central moment]]s of a [[noncentral chi-squared distribution|noncentral chi-squared]] random variable to the expressions given in the first two sections. If &lt;math&gt;Hy&lt;/math&gt; estimates &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; with no [[bias of an estimator|bias]], then the noncentrality &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt;\textrm{RSS}/\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; follows a central chi-squared distribution.

[[Image:How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think'']]

'''''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think''''' is a [[festschrift]] of 25 essays written in recognition of the life and work of [[Richard Dawkins]]. It was published in 2006, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the publication of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. A wide range of topics is covered from many fields including [[evolutionary biology]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Space is also given to writers who are not in full agreement with Dawkins. The book is edited by two of Dawkins' former PhD students, [[Alan Grafen]] and [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]]. ({{ISBN|9780199291168}})

==Reception==
The reviews of the book have been mixed, but the controversial title phrase, "How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think" has been explained by considering Dawkins to have worked as an influential educator and concise author, of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', who promoted the key ideas of others about [[evolutionary biology]], also including some controversial ideas which are not as widely accepted.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite newspaper

&lt;/ref&gt;
As the author of a popular science book, Dawkins had popularized ideas by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]] about group selection, [[William D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]] on the theory of kin selection in evolution, biologist/[[geneticist]] [[John Maynard Smith]] on evolutionarily stable strategies, and [[Robert L. Trivers|Robert Trivers]] about [[reciprocal altruism]] and competition between siblings versus parent and child.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''Slab pull''' is that part of the motion of a [[tectonic plate]] that is caused by its [[subduction]]. Plate motion is partly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] at [[oceanic trench]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad CP, Lithgow-Bertelloni C (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://powerpoints.geology-guy.com/pipkin/pipkin_chapter3.pdf |title=Plate tectonics, based on 'Geology and the Environment', 5 ed; 'Earth', 9 ed |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711084813/http://powerpoints.geology-guy.com/pipkin/pipkin_chapter3.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This force and [[slab suction force|slab suction]] account for almost all of the force driving [[plate tectonics]]. The [[ridge push force|ridge push]] at rifts contributes only 5 to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad CP, Lithgow-Bertelloni C (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson et al. (1983) in Lallemandet al. (2005) defines the [[Slab (geology)|slab]] pull force as:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{sp} = K \times \Delta\rho \times L \times \sqrt{A}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
: ''K'' is {{math|4.2&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}} (gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) according to McNutt (1984);
: ''Δρ'' = 80&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the mean density difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere;
: ''L'' is the slab length calculated only for the part above 670&amp;nbsp;km (the upper/lower mantle boundary);
: ''A'' is the slab age in [[Annum|Ma]] at the trench.

The slab pull force manifests itself between two extreme forms:
* The aseismic [[Back-arc basin|back-arc]] [[Extension (geology)|extension]] as in the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc]].
* And as the [[Aleutian Arc|Aleutian]] and [[List of earthquakes in Chile|Chile]] tectonics with strong earthquakes and back-arc [[Thrust fault|thrusting]].
Between these two examples there is the evolution of the [[Farallon plate]]: from the huge slab width with the [[Nevada orogeny|Nevada]], the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]; the [[Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up]] and later left as [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and  [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]] plates, the [[Basin and Range Province]] under extension, with [[slab detachment|slab break off]], smaller slab width, more edges and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] return flow.

Some early models of [[plate tectonics]] envisioned the plates riding on top of convection cells like [[conveyor belt]]s. However, most scientists working today believe that the [[asthenosphere]] does not directly cause motion by the [[friction]] of such basal forces. The [[North American Plate]] is nowhere being [[Subduction|subducted]], yet it is in motion. Likewise the [[African Plate|African]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[Antarctic Plate]]s. The subducting slabs around the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] cool down the Earth and its [[Core-mantle boundary]], around the African Plate the upwelling mantle plumes from the Core-mantle boundary produce [[Rifting (geology)|rifting]]. The overall driving force for plate motion and its energy source remain subjects of ongoing research.

In [[physics]], the [[topological]] structure of  '''spinfoam''' or  '''spin foam''' consists of two-dimensional faces representing a configuration required by [[functional integration]] to obtain a [[Feynman's path integral]] description of [[quantum gravity]]. Also, see [[loop quantum gravity]].

==Spin foam in loop quantum gravity==
{{main|Loop quantum gravity}}

[[Second quantization|Covariant formulation]] of loop quantum gravity provides the best formulation of the dynamics of the theory of [[quantum gravity]] – a [[quantum field theory]] where the invariance under [[General covariance|diffeomorphisms]] of [[general relativity]] applies. The resulting path integral represents a sum over all the possible configurations of spin foam.{{how|date=May 2016}}

===Spin network===
{{Main|Spin network}}
A spin network is a one-dimensional [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], together with labels on its vertices and edges which encode aspects of a spatial geometry. 

A spin network is defined as a diagram like the [[Feynman diagram]] which makes a basis of [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]]s between the elements of a [[differentiable manifold]] for the [[Hilbert space]]s defined over them, and for computations of amplitudes between two different [[hypersurface]]s of the [[manifold]]. Any evolution of the spin network provides a spin foam over a manifold of one dimension higher than the dimensions of the corresponding spin network.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} A spin foam is analogous to [[quantum history]].{{why|date=May 2016}}

===Spacetime===

Spin networks provide a language to describe the [[quantum geometry]] of space. Spin foam does the same job for spacetime.

Spacetime can be defined as a superposition of spin foams, which is a generalized Feynman diagram where instead of a graph, a higher-dimensional complex is used. In [[topology]] this sort of space is called a 2-[[cell complex|complex]]. A spin foam is a particular type of [[2-complex]], with labels for [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], edges and [[Face (geometry)|faces]]. The boundary of a spin foam is a spin network, just as in the theory of manifolds, where the boundary of an n-manifold is an (n-1)-manifold.

In Loop Quantum Gravity, the present Spin Foam Theory has been inspired by the work of [[G. Ponzano|Ponzano]]–[[Tullio Regge|Regge]] model. The concept of a spin foam, although not called that at the time, was introduced in the paper "A Step Toward Pregeometry I: Ponzano–Regge Spin Networks and the Origin of Spacetime Structure in Four Dimensions" by Norman J. LaFave. In this paper, the concept of creating sandwiches of 4-geometry (and local time scale) from spin networks is described, along with the connection of these spin 4-geometry sandwiches to form paths of spin networks connecting given spin network boundaries (spin foams). Quantization of the structure leads to a generalized Feynman path integral over connected paths of spin networks between spin network boundaries. This paper goes beyond much of the later work by showing how 4-geometry is already present in the seemingly three dimensional spin networks, how local time scales occur, and how the field equations and conservation laws are generated by simple consistency requirements. The idea was reintroduced in a 1997 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=gr-qc/9612035|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.56.3490|title="Sum over surfaces" form of loop quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=56|issue=6|pages=3490|year=1997|last1=Reisenberger|first1=Michael P.|last2=Rovelli|first2=Carlo|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..56.3490R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed into the [[Barrett–Crane model]]. The formulation that is used nowadays is commonly called EPRL after the names of the authors of a series of seminal papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0711.0146|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2008.02.018|title=LQG vertex with finite Immirzi parameter|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=799|pages=136|year=2008|last1=Engle|first1=Jonathan|last2=Livine|first2=Etera|last3=Pereira|first3=Roberto|last4=Rovelli|first4=Carlo|bibcode = 2008NuPhB.799..136E }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the theory has also seen fundamental contributions from the work of many others, such as [[Laurent Freidel]] (FK model) and [[Lewandowski|Jerzy Lewandowski]] (KKL model).

==Definition==
The summary partition function for a '''spin foam model''' is 

&lt;math&gt; Z:=\sum_{\Gamma}w(\Gamma)\left[ \sum_{j_f,i_e}\prod_f A_f(j_f) \prod_e A_e(j_f,i_e)\prod_v A_v(j_f,i_e) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

with:

* a set of 2-complexes &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; each consisting out of faces &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, edges &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and vertices &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Associated to each 2-complex &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a weight &lt;math&gt;w(\Gamma)&lt;/math&gt;
* a set of irreducible representations &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; which label the faces and intertwiners &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; which label the edges.
* a vertex amplitude &lt;math&gt;A_v(j_f,i_e)&lt;/math&gt; and an edge amplitude &lt;math&gt;A_e(j_f,i_e)&lt;/math&gt;
* a face amplitude &lt;math&gt;A_f(j_f)&lt;/math&gt;, for which we almost always have &lt;math&gt;A_f(j_f)=\dim(j_f)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Cellarius ptolemaic system c2.jpg|thumb|The obsolete [[geocentric model]] places [[Earth]] at the centre of the [[Universe]].]]

A [[scientific theory]] is superseded or becomes obsolete when a [[scientific consensus]] once widely accepted it, but current science considers it an inadequate, incomplete, or simply false description of [[reality]]. Such labels do not cover [[protoscience|protoscientific]] or [[fringe science]] theories that have never had [[consensus|broad support]] in the [[scientific community]]. Also, superseded or obsolete theories exclude theories that were never widely accepted. Some theories that were only supported under specific political authorities, such as [[Lysenkoism]], may also be described as obsolete or superseded.

All of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] is so satisfactory for most purposes that it is more widely used except at velocities that are a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]], and simpler Newtonian but not [[relativistic mechanics]] is usually taught in schools. Another case is the belief that the earth is approximately flat. For centuries, people have known that a [[flat Earth]] model produces errors in long-distance calculations, but considering local-scale areas as flat for the purposes of [[Cartography|mapping]] and [[surveying]] does not introduce significant errors.

In some cases, a theory or idea is found baseless and is simply discarded. For example, the [[phlogiston theory]] was entirely replaced by the quite different concept of energy and related laws. In other cases an existing theory is replaced by a new theory that retains significant elements of the earlier theory; in these cases, the older theory is often still useful for many purposes, and may be more easily understood than the complete theory and lead to simpler calculations. An example of this is the use of [[Newtonian physics]], which differs from the currently accepted [[relativistic physics]] by a factor that is negligibly small at velocities much lower than that of light.

==Superseded theories==
Scientific theories are [[Testability|testable]] and make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, Karl]] (1963), ''Conjectures and Refutations'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, UK. Reprinted in [[Theodore Schick]] (ed., 2000), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Science'', Mayfield Publishing Company, Mountain View, Calif.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is a mark of good science if a discipline has a growing list of superseded theories, and conversely, a lack of superseded theories can indicate problems in following the use of the [[scientific method]].

===Biology===
* [[Spontaneous generation]] – a principle regarding the spontaneous generation of complex life from inanimate matter, which held that this process was a commonplace and everyday occurrence, as distinguished from univocal generation, or reproduction from parent(s). Falsified by an [[Spontaneous generation#Pasteur and Tyndall|experiment by Louis Pasteur]]: where apparently spontaneous generation of microorganisms occurred, it did not happen on repeating the process without access to unfiltered air; on then opening the apparatus to the atmosphere, bacterial growth started.
* [[Transmutation of species]], [[Lamarckism]], [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] – first theories of evolution. Not supported by experiment, and rendered obsolete by [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[Mendelian genetics]], though some elements of Lamarckian evolution are coming back in the area of [[epigenetics]].
* [[Mendelian genetics]], [[classical genetics]], [[Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory]] – first genetic theories. Not invalidated as such, but subsumed into [[molecular genetics]].
* [[Maternal impression]] – the theory that the mother's thoughts created [[birth defects]]. No experimental support (a notion rather than a theory), and rendered obsolete by [[genetics|genetic theory]] (see also [[fetal origins of adult disease]], [[genomic imprinting]])
* [[Preformationism]] – the theory that all organisms have existed since the beginning of life, and that [[gamete]]s contain a miniature but complete preformed individual, in the case of humans, a [[homunculus]]. No support when [[microscopy]] became available. Rendered obsolete by  [[Cell biology|cytology]], discovery of [[DNA]], and [[atomic theory]].
* [[Recapitulation theory]] – the theory that "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny". See [[Baer's laws of embryology]].
* [[Telegony (pregnancy)|Telegony]] – the theory that an offspring can inherit characteristics from a previous mate of its mother's as well as its actual parents, often associated with [[racism]].
* [[Vitalism]] – the theory that living things are alive because of some "vital force" independent of matter, as opposed to because of some appropriate assembly of matter. It was gradually discredited by the rise of [[organic chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]], fields that failed to discover any "vital force". [[Friedrich Wöhler]]'s synthesis of urea from [[ammonium cyanate]] was only one step in a long road, not a great refutation.
* [[Out of Asia theory]] of human origin – The majority view is of a [[recent African origin of modern humans]], although a [[multiregional origin of modern humans]] hypothesis has much support (which incorporates past evidence of Asian origins)
* [[Azoic hypothesis]] – that [[marine life]] cannot exist below 300 fathoms. Disproven in 1850 with the discovery of ''[[Conocrinus lofotensis]]''.
* [[Germ line theory]], explained [[immunoglobulin diversity]] by proposing that each [[antibody]] was encoded in a separate germline gene.&lt;ref name="ncbi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=germline theory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10759/def-item/A2844/|work=Glossary|publisher=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefers|first=Mark|title=germ-line theory|url=http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-G/germ-line_theory.html|work=Glossary|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
* [[Caloric theory]] – the theory that a self-repelling fluid called "caloric" was the substance of heat. Rendered obsolete by the [[mechanical theory of heat]].
* [[Classical element]]s – All matter was once thought composed of various combinations of classical elements (most famously air, earth, fire, and water). [[Antoine Lavoisier]] finally refuted this in his 1789 publication, ''Elements of Chemistry'', which contained the first modern list of chemical elements.
* [[Phlogiston theory]] – The theory that combustible goods contain a substance called "phlogiston" that entered air during combustion. Replaced by [[Antoine Laurent Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]'s work on oxidation
* Point 2 of [[John Dalton#Atomic theory|Dalton's Atomic Theory]] was rendered obsolete by discovery of [[isotope]]s, and point 3 by discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s and [[nuclear reaction]]s.
* Vitalism – See section on biology.

===Physics===
* [[Emission theory (vision)|Emission theory of vision]] – the belief that vision is caused by rays emanating from the eyes was superseded by the [[Visual perception|intro-mission]] approach and more complex theories of [[Two-streams hypothesis|vision]]
* [[Aristotelian physics]] – superseded by [[Newtonian physics]]
* [[Ptolemy]]'s law of [[refraction]], replaced by [[Snell's law]]
* [[Luminiferous aether]] – failed to be detected by the sufficiently sensitive [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], made obsolete by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s work.
* [[Caloric theory]] – [[Lavoisier]]'s successor to phlogiston, discredited by [[Benjamin Thompson|Rumford]]'s and [[James Joule|Joule]]'s work
* [[Contact tension]] – a theory on the source of electricity
* [[Vis viva]] – [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s elementary and limited early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy
* "Purely [[Static electricity|electrostatic]]" theories of the [[Potential difference|generation of voltage differences]].
* [[Emitter theory]] – another now-obsolete theory of light propagation
* [[Balance of nature]] – superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]]
* Progression of [[atomic theory]]
**[[Democritus]], the originator of atomic theory, held that everything is composed of atoms that are indestructible. His claim that atoms are indestructible is not the reason it is superseded—as it was later scientists who identified the concept of atoms with particles, which later science showed are destructible. Democritus' theory is superseded because of his position that several kinds of atoms explain pure materials like water or iron, and characteristics that science now identifies with molecules rather than with indestructible primary particles. Democritus also held that between atoms, an empty space of a different nature than atoms allowed atoms to move. This view on space and matter persisted until Einstein described spacetime as being relative and connected to matter.
**[[John Dalton]]'s model of the atom, which held that atoms are indivisible and indestructible (superseded by nuclear physics) and that all atoms of a given element are identical in mass (superseded by discovery of atomic isotopes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/composition/dalton.html |title=Dalton's Atomic Theory |last1=De Leon |first1=Professor N. |date= |website=Chemistry 101 Class Notes |publisher=Indiana University Northwest |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Plum pudding model]] of the atom—assuming the protons and electrons were mixed together in a single mass
**[[Rutherford model]] of the atom with an impenetrable nucleus orbited by electrons
**[[Bohr model]] with quantized orbits
**[[Electron cloud]] model following the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in 1925 and the eventual [[atomic orbital]] models derived from the quantum mechanical solution to the hydrogen atom
* All of [[classical physics]], including [[Newtonian physics]], superseded by [[relativistic physics]] and [[quantum physics]]. However, classical physics is a limiting case of the latter two theories, and it is often a very good approximation.

===Astronomy and cosmology===
* [[Ptolemaic system]] – replaced by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' heliocentric model.
* [[Geocentric universe]] – made obsolete by Copernicus
* [[Heliocentric universe]] – made obsolete by discovery of the structure of the [[Milky Way]]. Heliocentrism only applies to the Solar System, and only approximately, since the Sun's center is not at the Solar System's [[center of mass]].
* [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] – made obsolete by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]]
* [[Newtonian gravity]] – superseded by [[general relativity]], to which it is an excellent approximation unless typical speeds approach that of light in a vacuum (c). The anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]] was the first observational evidence that Newtonian gravity was not totally accurate.
* [[Luminiferous aether]] theory
* [[Steady state theory]], a model developed by [[Hermann Bondi]], [[Thomas Gold]], and [[Fred Hoyle]] whereby the [[metric expansion of space|expanding universe]] was in a [[steady state]], and had no beginning. It was a competitor of the [[Big Bang]] model until evidence supporting the Big Bang and falsifying the steady state was found. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2017}}
* Many planets and other objects were once thought to exist but are now known not to – see [[List of hypothetical Solar System objects]]

===Geography and climate===
* [[Flat Earth]] theory. On length scales much smaller than the radius of the Earth, a flat [[map projection]] gives a quite accurate and practically useful approximation to true distances and sizes, but departures from flatness become increasingly significant over larger distances.
* [[Terra Australis]]
* [[Hollow Earth]] theory
* The [[Open Polar Sea]], an ice-free sea once supposed to surround the [[North Pole]]
* [[Rain follows the plow]] – the theory that human settlement increases rainfall in arid regions (only true to the extent that crop fields evapotranspirate more than barren wilderness)
* [[Island of California]] – the theory that [[California]] was not part of mainland North America but rather a large island
* [[Inland sea (geology)|Inland sea of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Cathcart |title=The Water Dreamers: How Water and Silence Shaped Australia |year=2009 |location=Melbourne |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921520648 |at=chapter 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An inland sea, the [[Eromanga Basin|Eromanga Sea]], did exist there in the [[Mesozoic]], but not during any period of human history&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental determinism]]

:*Climatic determinism
:*Topographic determinis
*[[Drainage divide|Drainage divides]] are always made up by hills and mountains.

===Geology===
* [[Abiogenic petroleum origin]]
* [[Catastrophism]] was largely replaced by [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] and [[neocatastrophism]]
* [[Flood geology]] replaced by modern [[geology]] and [[stratigraphy]]
* [[Neptunism]] replaced by [[plutonism]] and [[volcanism]]
* [[Granitization]] a discredited alternative to a magmatic origin of granites
* [[Monoglaciation]]
* Oscillation theory of land-level rise and subsidence during [[deglaciation]]
* The following were superseded by [[plate tectonics]]:
** [[Elevation crater|Elevation crater theory]]
** [[Expanding Earth theory]] (superseded by [[Plate tectonics#Subduction discovered|subduction]])
** [[Contracting Earth]]
** [[Geosyncline|Geosyncline theory]]
** [[Erich Haarmann|Haarman's Oscillation theory]]
** Various [[lost continent|lost landmasses]] including [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]

===Psychology===
* Pure behaviorist explanations for [[language acquisition]] in infancy, falsified by the study of cognitive adaptations for language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crain, Stephen and Diane C. Lillo-Martin|year=1999|title=An Introduction to Linguistic Theory and Language Acquisition|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Psychomotor patterning]], a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] approach to the treatment of [[intellectual disabilities]], [[brain injury]], [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], and other [[cognition|cognitive]] [[disease]]s.&lt;ref name=Novella&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srmhp.org/archives/patterning.html|title=Psychomotor Patterning|accessdate=October 16, 2014|author=Steven Novella, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
* Theory of the [[Humorism|four bodily humours]] (see also [[Four temperaments]])
**[[Heroic medicine]] – a therapeutic method derived from the belief in bodily humour imbalances as the cause of ailments.
*[[Miasma theory of disease]] – the theory that diseases are caused by "bad air". No experimental support, and rendered obsolete by the [[germ theory of disease]].
*[[Phrenology]] – a theory of highly localised brain function popular in 19th century medicine.
* [[Eclectic medicine]] – Transformed into [[alternative medicine]], and is no longer considered a scientific theory
* [[Physiognomy]], related to [[phrenology]], held that inner character was strongly correlated with physical appearance
* [[Tooth worm]], an erroneous theory of the cause of [[dental caries]], [[periodontitis]], and [[toothache]]s

==Obsolete branches of enquiry==
* [[Alchemy]], which led to the development of [[chemistry]]
* [[Astrology]], which led to the development of [[astronomy]]
* [[Phrenology]], a [[pseudoscience]]
* [[Numerology]], a [[pseudoscience]]

==Theories now considered incomplete==
Here are theories that are no longer considered the most complete representation of [[reality]], but remain useful in particular domains or under certain conditions. For some theories a more complete model is known, but in practical use the coarser approximation provides good results with much less calculation.

* [[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] disintegrate at [[High energy physics|high energy]].
* [[Newtonian mechanics]] was extended by the [[theory of relativity]] and by [[quantum mechanics]].

'''Total balance''' refers to whole-system scientific methods for adding up the whole effect of things, starting from the concepts of [[life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) and using [[scientific method]]s to mix physical measures with economic measures and the whole system learning curves of their environmental connections.  A balance of future compensations assuming a goal of sustainability is the objective.   It is aimed at providing people a true measure of the meaning of their choices.   The start is using the energy value of money as a measure of the whole economic system, and its widely distributed average effects.

The untraceable portion of whole system impacts may be shown to be many times the scale of the traceable portion when considered that way.  It's useful because so much  of the impacts distributed in complex systems are unaccountable.  The major unaccountable part of economic impacts, for example, is the free use of the money given others for their goods and services.  There are no data for what they do with it, making it a perfect hiding place for many times the impacts you readily see.

For whole energy impact of a choice the simple first step is to add up the accountable [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] used, like electric bills and LCA accounts, and then add the country's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] for the cost. The global average spent per BTU works out to roughly 6000 BTU per dollar in 2008 based on [[United States Department of Energy]] trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html  |title=World Energy Use and Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 1980-2001: I.

The effect is to add the impacts of the technology and the impacts of the commerce.

In [[control system]] theory, and various branches of engineering, a '''transfer function matrix''', or just '''transfer matrix''' is a generalisation of the [[transfer function]]s of [[single-input single-output system|single-input single-output]] (SISO) systems to [[MIMO|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO) systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, p. 1038&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] relates the outputs of the system to its inputs.  It is a particularly useful construction for [[linear time-invariant]] (LTI) systems because it can be expressed in terms of the [[s-plane]].

In some systems, especially ones consisting entirely of [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] components, it can be ambiguous which variables are inputs and which are outputs.  In electrical engineering, a common scheme is to gather all the voltage variables on one side and all the current variables on the other regardless of which are inputs or outputs.  This results in all the elements of the transfer matrix being in units of [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  The concept of impedance (and hence impedance matrices) has been borrowed into other energy domains by analogy, especially mechanics and acoustics.

Many control systems span several different energy domains.  This requires transfer matrices with elements in mixed units.  This is needed both to describe [[transducer]]s that make connections between domains and to describe the system as a whole.  If the matrix is to properly model energy flows in the system, compatible variables must be chosen to allow this.

== General ==
{{see also|Rosenbrock system matrix}}

A MIMO system with {{mvar|m}} outputs and {{mvar|n}} inputs is represented by a {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix.  Each entry in the matrix is in the form of a transfer function relating an output to an input.  For example, for a three-input, two-output system, one might write,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
g_{11} &amp; g_{12} &amp; g_{13} \\
g_{21} &amp; g_{22} &amp; g_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the inputs, the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the outputs, and the {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the transfer functions.  This may be written more succinctly in matrix operator notation as,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Y = \mathbf G \mathbf U &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''Y'''}} is a [[column vector]] of the outputs, {{math|'''G'''}} is a matrix of the transfer functions, and {{math|'''U'''}} is a column vector of the inputs.

In many cases, the system under consideration is a [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant]] (LTI) system.  In such cases, it is convenient to express the transfer matrix in terms of the [[Laplace transform]] (in the case of [[continuous time]] variables) or the [[z-transform]] (in the case of [[discrete time]] variables) of the variables.  This may be indicated by writing, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Y (s) = \mathbf G (s) \mathbf U (s) &lt;/math&gt;

which indicates that the variables and matrix are in terms of {{mvar|s}}, the [[complex frequency]] variable of the [[s-plane]] arising from Laplace transforms, rather than time.  The examples in this article are all assumed to be in this form, although that is not explicitly indicated for brevity.  For discrete time systems {{mvar|s}} is replaced by {{mvar|z}} from the z-transform, but this makes no difference to subsequent analysis.  The matrix is particular useful when it is a '''proper rational matrix''', that is, all its elements are [[proper rational function]]s.  In this case the [[state-space representation]] can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levine, p. 481|Chen, pp. 1037–1038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In systems engineering, the overall system transfer matrix {{math|'''G''' (''s'')}} is decomposed into two parts: {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}} representing the system being controlled, and {{math|'''C'''(''s'')}} representing the control system.  {{math|'''C''' (''s'')}} takes as its inputs the inputs of {{math|'''G''' (''s'')}} and the outputs of {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}}.  The outputs of {{math|'''C''' (''s'')}} form the inputs for {{math|'''H''' (''s'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrical systems ==
In electrical systems it is often the case that the distinction between input and output variables is ambiguous.  They can be either, depending on circumstance and point of view.  In such cases the concept of [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] (a place where energy is transferred from one system to another) can be more useful than input and output.  It is customary to define two variables for each port ({{mvar|p}}): the [[voltage]] across it ({{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and the [[electric current|current]] entering it ({{mvar|I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}).  For instance, the transfer matrix of a [[two-port network]] can be defined as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|z&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called the [[impedance parameters]], or ''z''-parameters.  They are so called because they are in units of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] and relate port currents to a port voltage.  The z-parameters are not the only way that transfer matrices are defined for two-port networks.  There are six basic matrices that relate voltages and currents each with advantages for particular system network topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Chen, pp. 54–55|Iyer, p. 240|Bakshi &amp; Bakshi, p. 420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only two of these can be extended beyond two ports to an arbitrary number of ports.  These two are the ''z''-parameters and their inverse, the [[admittance parameters]] or ''y''-parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Choma, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:Resistive divider2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Voltage divider circuit]]
To understand the relationship between port voltages and currents and inputs and outputs, consider the simple voltage divider circuit.  If we only wish to consider the output voltage ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) resulting from applying the input voltage ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) then the transfer function can be expressed as,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\dfrac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be considered the trivial case of a 1×1 transfer matrix.  The expression correctly predicts the output voltage if there is no current leaving port 2, but is increasingly inaccurate as the load increases.  If, however, we attempt to use the circuit in reverse, driving it with a voltage at port 2 and calculate the resulting voltage at port 1 the expression gives completely the wrong result even with no load on port 1.  It predicts a greater voltage at port 1 than was applied at port 2, an impossibility with a purely resistive circuit like this one.  To correctly predict the behaviour of the circuit, the currents entering or leaving the ports must also be taken into account, which is what the transfer matrix does.&lt;ref&gt;Yang &amp; Lee, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;  The impedance matrix for the voltage divider circuit is,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
R_1 + R_2 &amp; R_2 \\
R_2 &amp; R_2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which fully describes its behaviour under all input and output conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bessai, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[microwave]] frequencies, none of the transfer matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice.  Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy.  For [[waveguide]] implementations, circuit voltage and current are entirely meaningless.  Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead.  These are the [[power (physics)|powers]] transmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in the [[transmission line]] technology used in [[distributed-element circuit]]s in the microwave band.  The most well known and widely used of these sorts of parameters is the [[scattering parameters]], or s-parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nguyen, p. 271|Bessai, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical and other systems==
[[File:VIEW TO SOUTHWEST. DETAIL, GEAR TRAIN SYSTEM, CONTROL CABIN INTERIOR. - Gianella Bridge, Spanning Sacramento River at State Highway 32, Hamilton City, Glenn County, CA HAER CAL,11-HAMCI.V,1-22.tif|thumb|A gear train in the control cabin of the former [[Gianella Bridge]] which operated this [[swing bridge]].  Gear trains are two-ports.]]
The concept of [[mechanical impedance|impedance]] can be extended into the mechanical, and other domains through a [[mechanical-electrical analogy]], hence the impedance parameters, and other forms of 2-port network parameters, can be extended to the mechanical domain also.  To do this an [[effort variable]] and a [[flow variable (control systems)|flow variable]] are made analogues of voltage and current respectively.  For mechanical systems under [[translation (physics)|translation]] these variables are [[force]] and [[velocity]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressing the behaviour of a mechanical component as a two-port or multi-port with a transfer matrix is a useful thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour is dependent on the loads at the inputs and outputs.  For instance, a [[gear train]] is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function.  However, the gearbox output [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] can be driven round to turn the input shaft requiring a MIMO analysis.  In this example the effort and flow variables are [[torque]] {{mvar|T}} and [[angular velocity]] {{mvar|ω}} respectively.  The transfer matrix in terms of z-parameters will look like,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, the z-parameters are not necessarily the most convenient for characterising gear trains.  A gear train is the analogue of an electrical [[transformer]] and the [[h-parameters]] (''hybrid'' parameters) better describe transformers because they directly include the turns ratios (the analogue of gear ratios).&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;  The gearbox transfer matrix in h-parameter format is,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{11} &amp; h_{12} \\
h_{21} &amp; h_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:where
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the velocity ratio of the gear train with no load on the output,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the reverse direction torque ratio of the gear train with input shaft clamped, equal to the forward velocity ratio for an ideal gearbox,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the input rotational mechanical impedance with no load on the output shaft, zero for an ideal gearbox, and,
:{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the output rotational mechanical [[admittance]] with the input shaft clamped.

For an ideal gear train with no losses (friction, distortion etc), this simplifies to,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 &amp; N \\
N &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 \\ T_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} is the gear ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20|Koenig &amp; Blackwell, p. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transducers and actuators ==
[[File:Filterbaustein MF200 1 800 293.jpg|thumb|A mechanical filter opened to show the mechanical-electrical transducers at either end]]
In a system that consists of multiple energy domains, transfer matrices are required that can handle components with ports in different domains.  In [[robotics]] and [[mechatronics]], [[actuator]]s are required.  These usually consist of a [[transducer]] converting, for instance, signals from the control system in the electrical domain into motion in the mechanical domain.  The control system also requires [[sensor]]s that detect the motion and convert it back into the electrical domain through another transducer so that the motion can be properly controlled through a feedback loop. Other sensors in the system may be transducers converting yet other energy domains into electrical signals, such as optical, audio, thermal, fluid flow and chemical.  Another application is the field of [[mechanical filter]]s which require transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains in both directions.

A simple example is an electromagnetic [[electromechanical]] actuator driven by an electronic controller.  This requires a transducer with an input port in the electrical domain and an output port in the mechanical domain.  This might be represented simplistically by a SISO transfer function, but for similar reasons to those already stated, a more accurate representation is achieved with a two-input, two-output MIMO transfer matrix.  In the z-parameters, this takes the form,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} V \\ F \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\
z_{21} &amp; z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I \\ v \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F}} is the force applied to the actuator and {{mvar|v}} is the resulting velocity of the actuator.  The impedance parameters here are a mixture of units; {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an electrical impedance, {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a mechanical impedance and the other two are [[transimpedance]]s in a hybrid mix of units.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acoustic systems ==
[[Acoustics|Acoustic systems]] are a subset of [[fluid dynamics]], and in both fields the primary input and output variables are [[pressure]], {{mvar|P}}, and [[volumetric flow rate]], {{mvar|Q}}, except in the case of sound travelling through solid components.  In the latter case, the primary variables of mechanics, force and velocity, are more appropriate.  An example of a two-port acoustic component is a [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] such as a [[muffler]] on an [[exhaust system]].  A transfer matrix representation of it may look like,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} P_2 \\ Q_2 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
T_{11} &amp; T_{12} \\
T_{21} &amp; T_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P_1 \\ Q_1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the transmission parameters, also known as [[ABCD-parameters]].  The component can be just as easily described by the z-parameters, but transmission parameters have a mathematical advantage when dealing with a system of two-ports that are connected in a cascade of the output of one into the input port of another.  In such cases the overall transmission parameters are found simply by the matrix multiplication of the transmission parameter matrices of the constituent components.&lt;ref&gt;Munjal, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatible variables ==
[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|A pneumatic rack and pinion actuator controlling a valve in a water pipe.  The actuator is a two-port device that converts from the pneumatic domain to the mechanical domain.  Together with the valve itself it comprises a three-port system; the pneumatic control port and the fluid flow input and output water pipe ports of the valve.]]  
When working with mixed variables from different energy domains consideration needs to be given on which variables to consider analogous.  The choice depends on what the analysis is intended to achieve.  If it is desired to correctly model energy flows throughout the entire system then a pair of variables whose product is power (power conjugate variables) in one energy domain must map to power conjugate variables in other domains.  Power conjugate variables are not unique so care needs to be taken to use the same mapping of variables throughout the system.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

A common mapping (used in some of the examples in this article) maps the effort variables (ones that initiate an action) from each domain together and maps the flow variables (ones that are a property of an action) from each domain together.  Each pair of effort and flow variables is power conjugate.  This system is known as the [[impedance analogy]] because a ratio of the effort to the flow variable in each domain is analogous to electrical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other power conjugate systems on the same variables that are in use.  The [[mobility analogy]] maps mechanical force to electric current instead of voltage.  This analogy is widely used by mechanical filter designers and frequently in audio electronics also.  The mapping has the advantage of preserving network topologies across domains but does not maintain the mapping of impedances.  The Trent analogy classes the power conjugate variables as either ''across'' variables, or ''through'' variables depending on whether they act across an element of a system or through it.  This largely ends up the same as the mobility analogy except in the case of the fluid flow domain (including the acoustics domain).  Here pressure is made analogous to voltage (as in the impedance analogy) instead of current (as in the mobility analogy).  However, force in the mechanical domain ''is'' analogous to current because force acts ''through'' an object.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some commonly used analogies that do not use power conjugate pairs.  For sensors, correctly modelling energy flows may not be so important.  Sensors often extract only tiny amounts of energy into the system.  Choosing variables that are convenient to measure, particularly ones that the sensor is sensing, may be more useful.  For instance, in the [[thermal resistance]] analogy, thernal resistance is considered analogous to electrical resistance, resulting in temperature difference and thermal power mapping to voltage and current respectively.  The power conjugate of temperature difference is not thermal power, but rather [[entropy]] flow rate, something that cannot be directly measured.  Another analogy of the same sort occurs in the magnetic domain.  This maps [[magnetic reluctance]] to electrical resistance, resulting in [[magnetic flux]] mapping to current instead of magnetic flux rate of change as required for compatible variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The matrix representation of [[linear algebra]]ic equations has been known for some time.  [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of such equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).  Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of transfer matrices to represent a MIMO control system was by Boksenbom and Hood in 1950, but only for the particular case of the gas turbine engines they were studying for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kavanagh, p. 350|Bokenham &amp; Hood, p. 581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cruickshank provided a firmer basis in 1955 but without complete generality.  Kavanagh in 1956 gave the first completely general treatment, establishing the matrix relationship between system and control and providing criteria for realisability of a control system that could deliver a prescribed behaviour of the system under control.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite''' ('''TESS''') is a [[space telescope]] for [[NASA]]'s [[Explorers program]], designed to search for [[exoplanet]]s using the [[transit method]] in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' mission.&lt;ref name="tess-nasa-faq"/&gt; It was launched on April 18, 2018 atop a [[Falcon 9]] rocket.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sfn-schedule"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/ |title=Launch Schedule |work=Spaceflight Now |date=February 27, 2018 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|bbc-amos}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-planet-hunter-on-its-way-to-orbit |title=NASA Planet Hunter on Its Way to Orbit |date=April 19, 2018 |website=NASA |access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its 2-year primary mission, it is expected to find more than 20,000 exoplanets,{{r|astrobio.net}} compared to about 3,800 exoplanets known when it launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=J. |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] image from TESS was taken on August 7, 2018, and released publicly on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180917a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180917b" /&gt;

The primary mission objective for TESS is to survey the brightest stars near the Earth for transiting exoplanets over a two-year period. The TESS satellite uses an array of wide-field cameras to perform a survey of 85% of the sky. With TESS, it is possible to study the mass, size, density and orbit of a large cohort of small planets, including a sample of [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]] of their host stars. TESS will provide prime targets for further characterization by the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future.  While previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets, TESS will find a large number of small planets around the nearest stars in the sky. TESS records the nearest and brightest [[main sequence star]]s hosting transiting exoplanets, which are the most favorable targets for detailed investigations.&lt;ref name="NASA-2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NASA_2015_Budget_Estimates.pdf |format=PDF |title=NASA FY 2015 President's Budget Request Summary |publisher=NASA |date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS uses a novel highly-elliptical orbit around the Earth with an apogee approximately at the distance of the Moon and a perigee of 108,000&amp;nbsp;km. TESS orbits Earth twice during the time the Moon orbits once, a 2:1 resonance with the Moon.&lt;ref name="McGiffin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGiffin |first1=Daniel A. |last2=Mathews |first2=Michael |last3=Cooley |first3=Steven |title=HIGH EARTH ORBIT DESIGN FOR LUNAR-ASSISTED MEDIUM CLASS EXPLORER MISSIONS |date=June 1, 2001 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |location=Greenbelt, MD |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20010084964 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbit is expected to remain stable for a minimum of 10 years.

The genesis of TESS was as early as 2006, when a design was developed from private funding by individuals, Google, and [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]].&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission_history.html |title=Mission History |work=Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, MIT proposed that TESS become a full NASA mission and submitted it for the [[Small Explorer program]] at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]],&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; but it was not selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2009/06/no_smexlove_for_tess.html |title=No SMEX-love for TESS |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first=Eric |last=Hand |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was resubmitted in 2010 as an [[Explorers program]] mission, and was approved in 2013 as a Medium Explorer mission.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/midex.html |title=Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX) Missions in Development |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS passed its [[critical design review]] (CDR) in 2015, allowing production of the satellite to begin.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; While Kepler had cost US$640 million at launch, TESS cost only US$200 million (plus US$87 million for launch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet TESS, NASA's Next Planet Finder |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/telescopes/a9565/all-about-tess-nasas-next-planet-finder-16097391/ |accessdate=May 4, 2018 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Stuart |title=Spacewatch: Tess embarks on planet-hunting mission for Nasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/19/tess-nasa-planet-exoplanet-hunt-satellite |accessdate=May 4, 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=April 19, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission overview ==
TESS is designed to carry out the first spaceborne [[astronomical survey|all-sky]] [[transiting exoplanet]] survey.&lt;ref name="selection" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricker2014"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Discovering New Earths and Super-Earths in the Solar Neighborhood |conference=SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation. June 22–27, 2014. Montréal, Quebec, Canada. |first=George R. |last=Ricker |date=June 26, 2014 |doi=10.1117/2.3201407.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equipped with four wide-angle telescopes and associated [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) detectors. Science data will be transmitted to Earth every two weeks. Full-frame images with an effective exposure time of two hours will be transmitted as well, enabling scientists to search for unexpected, transient phenomena, such as the optical counterparts to [[gamma-ray burst]]s. TESS will also utilize a Guest Investigator program, allowing scientists from other organizations to use TESS for their own research. This will allow an additional 20,000 celestial bodies to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess |title=About TESS |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orbital dynamics ===
In order to obtain unobstructed imagery of both the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern]] and [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern hemispheres]] of the sky, TESS will utilize a 2:1 [[Moon|lunar]] [[Orbital resonance|resonant orbit]] called P/2, an orbit that has never been used before (although [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX]] uses a similar P/3 orbit). The highly elliptical orbit has a {{cvt|232000|mi|km|order=flip}} [[apogee]], timed to be positioned approximately 90° away from the position of the Moon to minimize its [[Perturbation (astronomy)|destabilizing effect]].  This orbit should remain stable for decades and will keep TESS's cameras in a stable temperature range. The orbit is entirely outside the [[Van Allen belts]] to avoid radiation damage to TESS, and most of the orbit is spent far outside the belts. Every 13.7 days at its [[perigee]] of {{cvt|67000|mi|km|order=flip}}, TESS will [[downlink]] the data it has collected during the orbit to Earth over a period of approximately 3 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/new-explorer-mission-chooses-the-just-right-orbit/ |title=New Explorer Mission Chooses the 'Just-Right' Orbit |publisher=NASA |first=Lori |last=Keesey |date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science objectives ===

[[File:TESS science sector suddivision.jpg|thumb|400px|The 26 observation sectors of the sky planned for TESS]]
TESS's two-year all-sky survey will focus on nearby [[G-type main-sequence star|G]]-, [[K-type main-sequence star|K]]-, and [[Red dwarf|M]]-[[spectral type|type]] [[star]]s with [[apparent magnitude]]s brighter than magnitude 12.&lt;ref name="seager-2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seagerexoplanets.mit.edu/exoplanet.htm |title=Exoplanet Space Missions |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |first=Sara |last=Seager |date=2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 500,000 stars will be studied, including the 1,000 closest [[red dwarf]]s across the whole sky,&lt;ref name="tess-nasa-faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skytel20130530"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/exoplanets-after-kepler-whats-next/ |title=Exoplanets After Kepler: What’s next? |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |first=Mark |last=Zastrow |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area 400 times larger than that covered by the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' mission.&lt;ref name="tess-nasa-faq"/&gt; TESS is expected to discover more than 20,000 transiting exoplanets, including 500 to 1000 [[terrestrial planet|Earth-sized]] planets and [[super-Earth]]s.&lt;ref name="astrobio.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/the-astrobiology-magazine-guide-to-tess/ |title=The Astrobiology Magazine Guide to TESS |first=Keith |last=Cooper |date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those discoveries, an estimated 20 could be super-Earths located in the [[habitable zone]] around a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2015/sept/14-super-earths |title=Super-Earths Might Be Our Best Bet For Finding Alien Life |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Adam |last=Hadhazy |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most exoplanets are expected to be between 30 and 300 light-years away.

The survey is broken up into 26 observation sectors, each sector being {{nowrap|24° × 96°}}, with an overlap of sectors at the ecliptic poles to allow additional sensitivity toward smaller and longer-period exoplanets in that region of the celestial sphere. The spacecraft will spend two 13.7-day orbits observing each sector, mapping the southern hemisphere of sky in its first year of operation and the northern hemisphere in its second year.&lt;ref name='Home TESS'/&gt; The cameras actually take images every 2 seconds, but all the raw images would represent much more data volume than can be stored or downlinked. To deal with this, cutouts around 15,000 selected stars (per orbit) will be [[Lucy–Hook coaddition method|coadded]] over a 2-minute period and saved on board for downlink, while full-frame images will also be coadded over a 30-minute period and saved for downlink. The actual data downlinks will occur every 13.7 days near perigee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/docs/TESS_observatory_guide_v1.1.pdf |title=TESS Observatory Guide |website=Tess Science Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that during the 2 years, TESS will continuously survey 85% of the sky for 27 days, with certain parts being surveyed across multiple runs.  The survey methodology was designed such that the area that will be surveyed, essentially continuously, over an entire year (351 observation days) and makes up about 5% of the entire sky,&lt;!-- at its pole of its Southern hemisphere (together with its Northern counterpart surveyed in the second year ), --&gt; will encompass the regions of sky (near the ecliptic poles) which will be observable at any time of year with the [[James Webb Space Telescope|JWST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPL9cFg8e38&amp;t=42m18s |title=Latest Exoplanet Results from NASA's Kepler/K2 Mission |first=Ian |last=Crossfield |series=SETI Talks 2017 |minutes=42.3 |date=March 27, 2017 |publisher=SETI Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asteroseismology ===
The TESS team also plans to use a 30-minute observation cadence for full-frame images, which has been noted for imposing a hard [[Nyquist limit]] that can be problematic for [[asteroseismology]] of stars.&lt;ref name="Murphy2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The potential for super-Nyquist asteroseismology with ''TESS'' |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first=Simon J. |last=Murphy |volume=453 |issue=3 |pages=2569–2575 |date=November 2015 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1842 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.453.2569M |arxiv=1508.02717 |url=http://simonmurphy.info/images/tess_sampling.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asteroseismology is the science that studies the internal structure of stars by the interpretation of their frequency spectra. Different oscillation modes penetrate to different depths inside the star. The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] and [[PLATO (spacecraft)|''PLATO'']] observatories are also intended for asteroseismology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findaphd.com/search/projectdetails.aspx?PJID=63199 |title=Asteroseismic data analysis with Kepler, K2, TESS and PLATO |work=FindaPhD.com |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcon 9 launch sequence included a 149-second burn by the first stage, followed by a 6-minute second stage burn. Meanwhile, the B1045 first-stage Block 4 booster performed controlled-reentry maneuvers and successfully landed on the [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship|autonomous drone ship]] [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship#Of Course I Still Love You|''Of Course I Still Love You'']]. After coasting for 35 minutes, the second stage performed a final 54-second burn that placed the TESS spacecraft into a [[Supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous]] [[transfer orbit]] of 200 by 270,000&amp;nbsp;km at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.&lt;ref name=flight-profile&gt;{{cite web |title=Launch Profile - Falcon 9 - TESS |url=http://spaceflight101.com/tess/flight-profile/ |website=spaceflight101.com |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burns&gt;{{cite web |title=TESS Orbit Design |url=http://spaceflight101.com/tess/tess-orbit-design/ |website=spaceflight101.com |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage released the payload, after which the stage itself was placed in a heliocentric orbit.

== Spacecraft ==
[[File:TESS with techs high res.jpg|thumb|TESS spacecraft before launch]]
In 2013, [[Orbital Sciences Corporation|Orbital Sciences]] received a four-year, {{USD|75 million}} contract to build TESS for NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/35024orbital-gets-75m-to-build-tess-exoplanet-telescope/ |title=Orbital Gets $75M To Build TESS Exoplanet Telescope |work=[[SpaceNews]] |first=Dan |last=Leone |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS uses an Orbital Sciences [[LEOStar]]-2 [[satellite bus]], capable of three-axis stabilization using four [[hydrazine]] thrusters plus four [[reaction wheel]]s providing better than three [[arc-second]] fine spacecraft pointing control. Power is provided by two single-axis [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] generating 400 watts. A [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] dish antenna provides a 100 Mbit/s science downlink.&lt;ref name="tess-nasa-faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tess-orbital-faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orbital.com/SatelliteSpaceSystems/Publications/TESS_factsheet.pdf |title=TESS: Discovering Exoplanets Orbiting Nearby Stars |publisher=Orbital Sciences |date=2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |id=FS011_13_2998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational orbit ===

Once injected into the initial orbit by the Falcon 9 [[second stage]], the spacecraft performed four additional independent [[Rocket engine#Ignition|burns]] that placed it into a lunar flyby orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |number=990743720566894594 |title=Mission Update: Team decided that the second apogee maneuver (Apogee 2 maneuver (A2M)), was not necessary... |user=NASA_TESS |date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, the spacecraft underwent a [[gravity assist]] by the Moon at {{convert|8253.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |number=997485558283882501 |title=Mission Update: #TESS successfully completed a lunar flyby... |user=NASA_TESS |date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed the final period adjustment burn on May 30.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/NASA_TESS/status/1002603655722397696&lt;/ref&gt; It achieved an orbital period of 13.65 days in the desired 2:1 resonance with the Moon, at 90 degrees phase offset to the Moon at [[apogee]], which is expected to be a stable orbit for at least 20 years, thus requiring very little fuel to maintain.&lt;ref name=bbc-amos&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43790557 |title=Planet-hunter launches from Florida |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |journal=BBC News |date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire maneuvering phase was expected to take a total of two months, and bring the craft in an eccentric orbit ({{R+|17–75|link=y}}) at a 37° inclination.  The total [[delta-v]] budget for orbit maneuvers was {{convert|215|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}, which is 80% of the mission’s total available reserves.  If TESS receives an on-target or slightly above nominal orbit insertion by the Falcon 9, a theoretical mission duration in excess of 15 years would be possible from a consumables standpoint.&lt;ref name=burns/&gt;

=== Project timeline ===
Around 60 days after launch, TESS was expected to begin its primary science mission. The [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] image was made on August 7, 2018, and released publicly on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180920"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=NASA’s TESS Starts Collecting Planets - The satellite, launched in April, has already identified at least 73 stars that may harbor exoplanets, most of them new to astronomers. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/science/nasa-tess-planets.html |date=September 20, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180917a"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kazmierczak |first1=Jeanette |last2=Garner |first2=Rob |title=NASA’s TESS Shares First Science Image in Hunt to Find New Worlds |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-s-tess-shares-first-science-image-in-hunt-to-find-new-worlds |date=September 17, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180917b"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wiessinger |first1=Scott |last2=Lepsch |first2=Aaron E. |last3=Kazmierczak |first3=Jeanette |last4=Reddy |first4=Francis |last5=Boyd |first5=Padi |title=NASA’s TESS Releases First Science Image |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13069

TESS actually completed its commissioning phase at the end of July and the science phase officially started on July 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-s-tess-spacecraft-starts-science-operations |title=NASA's TESS spacecraft starts science operations |website=nasa.gov |language=en-US |access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two years of operation TESS will monitor both the southern (year 1) and northern (year 2) [[Celestial sphere|celestial hemispheres]]. During its mission TESS will tile the sky in 26 separate segments, with a 27.4-day observing period per segment (a bit over one [[sidereal month]]).&lt;ref name='Home TESS'&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tess.mit.edu/ |title=Home - TESS - Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |website=tess.mit.edu |language=en-US |access-date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific instrumentation ===
The sole instrument on TESS is a package of four wide-field-of-view [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras. Each camera features four low-noise, low-power 4 megapixel CCDs created by [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]]. The four CCDs are arranged in a 2x2 detector array for a total of 16 megapixels per camera and 16 CCDs for the entire instrument.  Each camera has a {{nowrap|24° × 24°}} [[field of view]], a {{cvt|100|mm|0}} effective [[entrance pupil|pupil diameter]], a lens assembly with seven optical elements, and a [[band-pass filter|bandpass]] range of {{nowrap|600 to 1000 nm}}.&lt;ref name="tess-nasa-faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/documents/TESS_FactSheet_Oct2014.pdf |title=TESS: Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |publisher=NASA |date=October 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |id=FS-2014-1-120-GSFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricker2015"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://seagerexoplanets.mit.edu/ftp/Papers/TESS2015.pdf |title=Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite |journal=Journal of Astronomical Telescopes, Instruments, and Systems |first1=George R. |last1=Ricker |first2=Joshua N. |last2=Winn |first3=Roland |last3=Vanderspek |display-authors=etal |volume=1 |issue=1 |at=014003 |date=January–March 2015 |doi=10.1117/1.JATIS.1.1.014003 |bibcode=2015JATIS...1a4003R |arxiv=1406.0151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TESS lenses have a combined field of view of {{nowrap|24° × 96°}} (2,300&amp;nbsp;deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, around 5% of the entire sky) and a [[focal ratio]] of {{f/|1.4}}. The ensquared energy, the fraction of the total energy of the point-spread function that is within a square of the given dimensions centered on the peak, is 50% within {{nowrap|15 × 15 μm}} and 90% within {{nowrap|60 × 60 μm}}.{{r|Ricker2015}}  For comparison, Kepler's primary mission only covered an area of the sky measuring 105&amp;nbsp;deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, though the K2 extension has covered many such areas for shorter times.

== Ground operations ==
The TESS ground system is divided between eight sites around the United States. These include NASA's [[Space Network]] and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's [[NASA Deep Space Network|Deep Space Network]] for command and telemetry, [[Orbital ATK]]{{'s}} Mission Operations Center, [[MIT]]{{'s}} Payload Operations Center, the [[Ames Research Center]]{{'s}} Science Processing Operations Center, The [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]{{'s}} Flight Dynamics Facility, the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]{{'s}} TESS Science Office, and the [[Space Telescope Science Institute|Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/groundops.html |title=TESS Ground Operations |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stable light source for tests ==
One of the issues facing the development of this type of instrument is having an ultra-stable light source to test on. In 2015, a group at the [[University of Geneva]] made a breakthrough in the development of a stable light source. While this instrument was created to support ESA's [[CHEOPS]] exoplanet observatory, one was also ordered by the TESS program.&lt;ref name="optics20151001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://optics.org/news/6/9/50 |title=Swiss group develops 'most stable light source' for satellite tests |work=Optics.org |first=Matthew |last=Peach |date=October 1, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both plan to look at bright nearby stars using the transit method, CHEOPS is focused on collecting more data on known exoplanets, including those found by TESS and other survey missions.&lt;ref name="astro20150317"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrowatch.net/2015/03/esas-cheops-satellite-pharaoh-of.html |title=ESA's CHEOPS Satellite: The Pharaoh of Exoplanet Hunting |work=Astro Watch |first=Tomasz |last=Nowakowski |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS started science operations on July 25, 2018.&lt;ref name="comet"&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-s-planet-hunting-tess-catches-a-comet-before-starting-science&lt;/ref&gt; The first announced finding from the mission was the observation of [[comet]] [[C/2018 N1]].&lt;ref name="comet" /&gt; The first exoplanet detection announcement was on September 18, announcing the discovery of a super-Earth in the [[Pi Mensae]] system orbiting the star every 6 days, adding to a known super-Jupiter orbiting the same star every 5.9 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1809.05967|title = TESS Discovery of a Transiting Super-Earth in the &amp;Pi; Mensae System|last1 = Huang|first1 = Chelsea X. |display-authors = etal |year = 2018|class = astro-ph.EP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2018, the discovery of an ultra-short period planet was announced, slightly larger than Earth, orbiting the red dwarf [[LHS 3844]]. With an orbital period of 11 hours, [[LHS 3844 b]] is one of the planets with the shortest known period. It orbits its star at a distance of {{convert|932000|km|mi}}. LHS 3844 b is also one of the closest known exoplanets to Earth, at a distance of 14.9 parsec.&lt;ref name="Vanderspek2018"&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=TESS Discovery of an ultra-short-period planet around the nearby M dwarf LHS 3844|last=Vanderspek |first=Roland |display-authors=etal|date=19 September 2018|eprint=1809.07242|class=astro-ph.EP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS's third discovered exoplanet is [[HD 202772Ab]], a hot Jupiter orbiting the brighter component of the visual binary star [[HD 202772]], located in the constellation [[Capricornus (constellation)|Capricornus]] at a distance of about 480 light-years from Earth. The discovery was announced on October 5, 2018. HD 202772Ab orbits its host star once every 3.3 days. It is an inflated hot Jupiter, and a rare example of hot Jupiters around evolved stars. It is also one of the most strongly irradiated planets known, with an equilibrium temperature of {{conv|2100|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name="Wang2018"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wang, Songhu|author2=et al.|title=HD 202772A B: A Transiting Hot Jupiter Around A Bright, Mildly Evolved Star In A Visual Binary Discovered By Tess|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02341.pdf|arxiv=1810.02341|date=5 October 2018|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on exoplanet candidates continue to be made available at MAST. As of 12 October 2018, the total number of candidates was up to 54. This list included the three exoplanets already reported. Forty-four of the candidates were from Sector 1 with additional candidates from Sector 2.  Two systems with two exoplanets and one with three exoplanets were on the list of candidates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/|title=TESS-DATA-ALERTS: Data Products From TESS Data Alerts|website=archive.stsci.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of candidate exoplanets continues to grow as additional results are being published on the same MAST page. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/|title=TESS-DATA-ALERTS: Data Products From TESS Data Alerts|website=archive.stsci.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Utrecht Atlas''''' of the solar spectrum is a detailed inventory in graphical form of spectral lines observed in sunlight at the [[Sonnenborgh Observatory]]. The [[visible spectrum]] is about 390 to 700 [[Nanometer|nm]] and the atlas covers from 361.2 to 877.1&amp;nbsp;nm (plus an appendix) so that the atlas has some coverage of the [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] spectrum of sunlight. The atlas, compiled by Minnaert and his students Mulders and Houtgast, was published in 1940 shortly before the WWII invasion of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=MinnaertRef/&gt;

{{blockquote|The ''Atlas'' contains intensity curves covering the complete solar spectrum from λ 3612 to λ 8771 based on photographs taken at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] together with an appendix covering the region λ 3332 to λ 3637 as derived from plates secured at [[Utrecht]]. The scale in wave length is about 20 millimeters per [[angstrom]] so that the spectrum is represented on a map about 360 feet long. The curves are printed in black on millimeter paper with blue lines. The intensity scale is such that a vertical range of 100 millimeters corresponds to the difference between zero intensity and the continuous background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reviewed Work: ''Photometric Atlas of the Solar Spectrum'' by M.

==History==
In the early nineteenth century, [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] made the first systematic inventory of spectral lines in sunlight. Full understanding of the significance of [[Fraunhofer lines]] required a huge amount of pioneering research in astrophysics and quantum theory. [[Cecilia Payne]] (1925) demonstrated that variations in stellar line strengths can be explained by the [[Saha ionization equation]]. Payne's work lead to a major study of the chemical abundances in the solar atmosphere undertaken by [[Henry Norris Russell|H. N. Russell]], [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter S. Adams]], and [[Charlotte Moore Sitterly|Charlotte Moore]]. Around 1930, the procedures developed by Russell, Adams, and Moore were adapted by Minnaert and Mulders for determining chemical abundances in stellar [[photosphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lorenzano, P.|editor2=Rheinberger, H.-J.|editor3=Ortiz, E.|editor4=Delfino Galles, C.|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|volume=vol.

{{blockquote|In 1936 Mulders went to the Mt Wilson Observatory and took the plates for our ''Photometric Atlas'', while Houtgast developed the modified, home-made instrument, which could be added to the microphotometer and gave direct intensity readings.

You were alone in the building, and in the silence of the darkroom, in the dull red light, you were developing your record. There it emerged, slowly emerged, out of nothingness, and as if by magic there appeared on the paper the profile of the cyanogen band, or of the atmospheric oxygen lines, never earlier observed in their true quantitative shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearnshaw, John B.|title=The Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy|page=149|year=2014|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waf6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Virginia Livingston''' (1906–1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and cancer researcher who advocated the unsupported theory that a specific species of bacteria she named ''Progenitor cryptocides'' was the primary cause of [[cancer]] in humans.  Her theories about ''P. cryptocides'' have not been duplicated by researchers, and a clinical trial of her therapy did not show any efficacy in the treatment of cancer. The [[American Cancer Society]], which did not support Livingston’s treatment protocol for cancer, categorically denied her theory of [[Causes of cancer|cancer origins]].

==Life==
Virginia Livingston was born '''Virginia Wuerthele''' in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]] in 1906.

Both her father and grandfather were physicians and she also pursued a degree in medicine. Prior to attending medical school, Livingston earned three BA degrees in English, history, and economics from [[Vassar College]]. She then attended New York University, [[Bellevue Medical College]] and in 1936, received her degree in medicine. She was one of four women in her graduating class.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book |author=Lerner, Michael G.|authorlink=Michael Lerner (environmentalist)|chapter=Chapter Sixteen: Virginia C. Livingston--Integrating Diet, Nutritional Supplements, and Immunotherapy|title=Choices in healing: integrating the best of conventional and complementary approaches to cancer |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-62104-5 |oclc= |doi= | chapter-url=http://www.commonweal.org/pubs/choices/16.html|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after graduation, Livingston became the first female resident physician at a New York hospital where she was assigned to treat prostitutes infected with venereal diseases. While there, Livingston became interested in the study of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]], and later [[scleroderma]], a disease affecting the tissues and skin. After studying scleroderma tissues with the darkfield microscope, she claimed to find an [[acid-fast]] organism that consistently appeared in her slides. Thinking that scleroderma had some characteristics that were like cancer, Livingston then began studying malignant tissues and subsequently claimed to find evidence of acid-fast organisms in every sample. It was this early research that prompted the young physician to devote her career to the study of a specific microorganism involved in cancer.

==Early research==
In 1946, Livingston published a paper in which she stated she had established that a [[Bacteria|bacterium]] was a causative agent in scleroderma.&lt;ref name="Livingston1947"&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 20248313| year = 1947| last1 = Wuerthele-Caspe| first1 = V| last2 = Brodkin| first2 = E| last3 = Mermod| first3 = C| title = Etiology of scleroderma; a preliminary clinical report| volume = 44| issue = 7| pages = 256–9| journal = The Journal of the Medical Society of New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, she cultured a mycobacteria-like organism in human cancer and, according to her peer-reviewed paper, fulfilled [[Koch's postulates]] establishing an apparent cause and effect.&lt;ref name="Livingston1948"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Livingston | first =V | title =Microorganisms associated with Neoplasms | journal =New York Microscopial Society Bulletin | volume =2 | issue =2 | pages = | year =1947 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Livingston was named chief of the [[Rutgers-Presbyterian Hospital]] Laboratory for Proliferative Diseases in New Jersey where she continued her cancer research.&lt;ref name="Addeo1984"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Addeo, Edmond G. |author2=Virginia Livingston-Wheeler |title=The conquest of cancer: vaccines and diet |publisher=F. Watts |location=New York |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=978-0-531-09806-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Livingston formed a lifetime association with Dr. Eleanor Alexander-Jackson of Cornell University. Jackson's specialty was the study of mycobacteria and particularly, the species responsible for tuberculosis. Jackson had developed specific culture media for growing the microbe and a technique for observing it known as the "triple stain" because she felt this microbe wasn't amenable to conventional modes of culturing and microscopy.

Livingston and Jackson also collaborated on work on the [[Rous sarcoma virus]] (RSV) at Lederle Laboratories.  Livingston claimed that when RSV cultures were passed through special filters designed to hold back all but the smallest virus particles, she was able to grow bacteria; this was considered a controversial claim since bacteria are considerably larger than viruses and are not supposed to exist in filtered RSV serum.  After healthy animals were exposed to the Rous bacterial filtrates, Livingston and Jackson claimed that cancerous lesions developed.&lt;ref name="Wuerthele-Caspe Livingston1953"&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 13242416| year = 1955| last1 = Wuerthele-Caspe| first1 = V| title = Neoplastic infections of man and animals| volume = 10| issue = 8| pages = 261–6| journal = Journal of the American Medical Women's Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led to speculation that such bacteria could be transmitted from poultry to humans and this became a primary reason Livingston ordered her cancer patients to not eat poultry while they underwent her treatment. Scientists have since rejected Livingston's findings, arguing there is no evidence supporting her claim.&lt;ref name=LW&gt;{{cite journal | title =Unproven methods of cancer management: Livingston-Wheeler therapy | journal =CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians | volume =40 | issue = 2| pages =103–108 | year =1990 | pmid =2106368| id = | doi=10.3322/canjclin.40.2.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Livingston published a paper suggesting a causative bacterium in [[Wilson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Livingston1956"&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 13306623| year = 1956| last1 = Wuerthele-Caspe| first1 = V| last2 = Alexander-Jackson| first2 = E| last3 = Gregory| first3 = M| last4 = Smith| first4 = LW| last5 = Diller| first5 = IC| last6 = Mankowski| first6 = Z| title = Intracellular acid-fast microorganism; isolated from two cases of hepatolenticular degeneration| volume = 11| issue = 4| pages = 120–9| journal = Journal of the American Medical Women's Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, she reported isolation of a variably acid-fast mycobacterium in patients with myocardial vascular disease.  During this time, she also began a small test trial of anti-bacterial vaccines made from the body fluids of cancer patients and reported moderate success.&lt;ref name="Livingston1965"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Livingston | first =V | title =Mycobacterial Forms in Myocardial Vascular Disease | journal =The Journal of the Am Med Women's Association | volume =20 | issue =5 | pages =449–452 | year =1965 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the years 1965-1968, Livingston received Fleet Foundation and Kerr Grants, and continued her investigation into a bacterial cause of human cancer. She also published a paper describing the presence of a substance identified as Actinomycin-D which she said could damage chromosomes and promote cancer.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1970.tb45590.x| last4 = Alexander-Jackson| title = Toxic fractions obtained from tumor isolates and related clinical implications| volume = 174| pages = 675–689| issue = 2| pmid = 5278141| last3 = Livingston| year = 1970| last1 = Wolter| last2 = Livingston| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | first1 = G. | first2 = A. | first3 = V. | first4 = E.|bibcode = 1970NYASA.174..675L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1969, Livingston and her husband Afton Munk Livingston, established the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic in [[San Diego]], [[California]], and began formally treating cancer patients. The therapeutic program included autogenous vaccine made from killed bacteria derived from body fluids; a low sodium diet consisting of organic foods, fruits and vegetables high in a substance Livingston called "abscisic acid"; immune enhancing vaccines (gamma globulin, BCG) and antibiotics. Livingston prescribed antibiotics after cross testing them with patients' cultures to see which had the most antibacterial activity. Livingston also recommended that patients not consume poultry products based on her earlier research.

After her husband’s death, she married Owen Webster Wheeler, one of the first patients she claims to have successfully treated for head and neck cancer. Shortly after, the clinic was renamed the Livingston-Wheeler clinic.  In 1970, Livingston officially named her cancer organism ''Progenitor cryptocides'', and presented her findings to the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Livingston1970"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1970.tb45588.x| pmid = 5278140| year = 1970| last1 = Livingston| first1 = VW| last2 = Alexander-Jackson| first2 = E| title = A specific type of organism cultivated from malignancy: bacteriology and proposed classification| volume = 174| issue = 2| pages = 636–54| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|bibcode = 1970NYASA.174..636L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to her biography, ''Progenitor'' was a pseudonym meaning "ancestral" and the name was chosen because Livingston believed the microbe existed as early as the [[Precambrian]] era, and it was an [[Endogeny|endegenous]] component of life itself. The name "cryptocides" was a Greek and Latin word which meant "hidden killer". The microbe was classified under the order [[Actinomycetales]].  Livingston described ''Progenitor'' as an intermittently acid-fast mycobacterium that displayed highly variable growth cycles. According to Livingston the microbe was [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]], and had [[cell wall]]-deficient and filter-passing forms resembling viruses, with the ability to adopt a variety of shapes including [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s, [[rod (geometry)|rods]] and [[Coccus|cocci]].&lt;ref name="Livingston1970"/&gt;

==1974-1990==
In 1974, Livingston published a paper which described her isolation of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) from cancer bacteria.&lt;ref name="Livingston1974"&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 4530542| year = 1974| last1 = Livingston| first1 = VW| last2 = Livingston| first2 = AM| title = Some cultural, immunological, and biochemical properties of Progenitor cryptocides| volume = 36| issue = 6| pages = 569–82| journal = Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences| doi=10.1111/j.2164-0947.1974.tb01602.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then advanced one of her central hypotheses.

Livingston theorized that hCG is both a component of human cancer, but also innately involved in embryonic growth and fetal survival.&lt;ref name = "Addeo1984"/&gt; She wrote that hCG is saturated in the placenta, and blocks the mothers’ antibodies from attacking the fetus, partly made of foreign DNA (and not recognized by host immunity). By the same token, hCG performs a similar function in cancer, conferring protection to malignant tissues. Livingston believed that after Progenitor hybridizes with cancer cells, it imparts an ability for them to produce hCG in a manner similar to that of the developing fetus. Based on this duality of function, Livingston called hCG “the hormone of life and the hormone of death”. She also stipulated that vaccines which target hCG-producing bacteria could also halt the progression of cancer. And she claimed that absicins could also neutralize hCG.

==Controversy==
Though some [[Cancer bacteria|bacteria have been associated with cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 4| pages = 14| pmc = 1479838| title = Bacteria and cancer: cause, coincidence or cure? A review| doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-4-14| year = 2006| journal = Journal of Translational Medicine| pmid = 16566840| last1 = Mager | first1 = D. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for instance ''[[Helicobacter pylori|H. pylori]]'' has been associated with [[stomach cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 75| title = Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer: the causal relationship| issue = 1| pages = 25–35| journal = Digestion | first2 = C.| last2 = Beglinger| pmid = 17429205| year = 2007| last1 = Peter | first1 = S.| doi = 10.1159/000101564}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Livingston's postulated relationship between cancer and ''P. cryptocides'' was never proven in several follow up studies conducted by independent investigators. Researchers confirmed that bacteria provided by Livingston produced hCG, but several other studies demonstrated that numerous bacteria in both cancer patients and healthy individuals also produced the substance.

Occurring before the existence of techniques to analyze DNA, Livingston and other investigators' ability to differentiate bacteria based on morphology and chemical characteristics was limited. However, even given technological limitations at the time, Livingston's classification methods were described as full of "remarkable errors", attributing characteristics to [[Actinomycetales]] (the [[order (biology)|order]] Livingston believed ''P. cryptocides'' belonged to) shared by no other members of the order.  Some evidence supports ''P. cryptocides'' is the result of a mistaken identification of a ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' strain of bacteria and later studies of the samples provided by Livingston proved to be ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis|Streptococcus faecalis]]''.&lt;ref name = "LW"/&gt;

The American Cancer Society (ACS) did not support Livingston’s treatment protocol for cancer, and has categorically denied her theory of the  cancer bacterium ''P. cryptocides'' the primary cause of human cancer.  The ACS also challenged the efficacy of Livingston’s autogenous vaccine and concluded in its report that there was no corroboration of either ''P. cryptocides'' or the efficacy of her autologous vaccine.&lt;ref name = "LW"/&gt;  Since Livingston hadn’t stocked earlier cultures of her alleged microbe, it is not possible to decipher precisely what those cultures contained.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Clinical testing==
A [[case-control study]] using self-selected, [[Matching (statistics)|matched]] but not [[Random sample|randomized]] groups with [[Cancer staging|late stage cancer]] compared survival and quality of life between cancer patients receiving conventional treatment and those undergoing the Livingston-Wheeler therapy. The results were reported in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 1991, and found no differences in survival among patients whether treated conventionally, or via Livingston's treatment. The ''NEJM'' report also stated that when comparing the two groups, the "[[quality of life]] were consistently better among conventionally treated patients from enrollment on".  Based on this trial, the ACS deemed Livingston's cancer therapy without efficacy, and considered it an "unproven therapy".&lt;ref name="Cassileth et al."&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cassileth | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Lusk | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Guerry | first3 = D. | last4 = Blake | first4 = A. D. | last5 = Walsh | first5 = W. P. | last6 = Kascius | first6 = L. | last7 = Schultz | first7 = D. J. | title = Survival and Quality of Life among Patients Receiving Unproven as Compared with Conventional Cancer Therapy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 324 | issue = 17 | pages = 1180–1185 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2011162 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199104253241706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both groups of patients in the trial deteriorated at equal rates---all in effect dying of their disease---patients in the Livingston-treated group were reported to have had a "poorer quality of life" at the start of the trial.&lt;ref name="Cassileth et al."/&gt; The study's lead investigator, Barrie Cassileth, acknowledged that "the University of Pennsylvania patients had a significantly better quality of life at all times, including enrollment" and that, quality of life "was different at base line", with Livingston's patients rated worse.&lt;ref name="Cassileth et al." /&gt; Patients in both treatment arms also received conventional therapies in addition to Livingston's therapy. Livingston's patients also received BCG during the trial---an FDA-approved cancer adjuvant which has been found effective for several cancers, including those of the bladder and colon.

At the study's conclusion, Barrie Cassileth commented:

"This study...involved only patients with diagnoses and stages of disease for which there is no effective conventional treatment. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to patients with less advanced stages of disease or to other treatment regimens." Cassileth also said, her study group "hypothesized that survival time would not differ between the two groups on the basis of the assumption that the unproved remedy would be no more effective with end-stage disease than conventional care, itself largely ineffective".

==Death==
Shortly after speaking before an Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) hearing on alternative cancer therapies and attending her 60th reunion at Vassar College in 1990, Livingston accompanied her daughter Julie Anne Wagner on a European trip. She developed chest pains while visiting the Greek islands and then succumbed to heart failure in Athens on June 30, before being transported to a Paris Hospital.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Moss | first =R | title =The Cancer Chronicles | journal = | volume =6 | issue = | pages = | publisher = | year =1990 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wild West Tech''''' is a program that aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the United States from 2003 to 2005. The show was originally hosted by [[Keith Carradine]] (2003–04), but his half-brother, [[David Carradine]], took over hosting duties for season 2 and subsequent seasons. The show illustrates a variety of technologies used in the [[Wild West]], and features interviews with numerous Western historians, as well as re-creating versions of important events in Western history.

The series was created by Dolores Gavin (History Channel) and supervising producer Louis Tarantino.

==Format==

Each episode is dedicated to some broader aspect of Wild West life. Once the context is established in brief by the host, more specific elements are developed. Throughout the program, professors, writers, and other experts explain finer points while [[historical reenactment]]s and dramatizations portray just how key 19th century events may have transpired. The production aims to put the viewer into the spirit of the Old West with its host inhabiting an unnamed frontier town, delivering commentary.

A new spin on the typical technology fact program, this program often covers subjects from the [[American Old West]] that are not generally discussed in more traditional settings. For example, one episode takes a look at the [[brothel]], focusing on the inventions and technological innovations used to make the institution of prostitution less harsh on the lives of the women involved.

Another explains that Morphine was first isolated in 1803 by the German pharmacist [[Friedrich Sertürner|Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner]], but it was not until the development of the [[hypodermic needle]] (1853) that its use spread and it spread quite a bit in the American West. It was used for pain relief and as a "cure" for opium or alcohol addiction. Its extensive use during the [[American Civil War]] resulted in over 400,000 sufferers from the "soldiers disease" (addiction).

The same episode informs the viewers that [[heroin]], along with other drugs, was only criminalized in the United States by the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914 decades after it was derived.

Other topics include the technological histories of various alcoholic beverages, [[bar (establishment)|saloons]], weapons, and [[cowboy]] gangs.

==Episode guide==
Two pilot episodes were produced, hosted by Keith Carradine, to help sell the History Channel on the concept of the series. Seasons 2 and 3 were hosted by David Carradine.

==Trivia==
The History Channel sometimes airs re-edited versions of the episodes to fill odd bits of time on the schedule; these 30 minute versions feature no new content.

There is a video that documents how Keith lost the show to David in a [[poker]] game that appears at the beginning of episode 2–1.

Shortly before leaving the show, Keith Carradine grew a mustache for his role in the TNT production of ''[[Monte Walsh (2003)|Monte Walsh]]''.
