Since laws [[List of countries' copyright lengths|vary globally]], the copyright status of some works are not uniform.

==Entering the public domain in countries with life + 70 years==
With the exception of [[Belarus]] and [[Spain]] (which has a copyright term of Life + 80 years for creators that died before 1987), a work enters the [[public domain]] in Europe 70 years after the creator's death, if it was published during the creator's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/publishing/eu-extends-copyright-term-to-70-years-1005348552.story |title=EU Extends Copyright Term To 70 Years &amp;#124; Billboard |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0116:EN:NOT Directive 2006/116/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; The list is sorted alphabetically and includes a notable work of the creator that entered the public domain on January 1, 2020.

==Entering the public domain in Australia==
{{See also|Copyright law of Australia}}

In 2004 copyright in Australia changed from a "plus 50" law to a "plus 70" law, in line with America and the European Union. But the change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which bought some e.g. British authors back into copyright, especially those who died from 1925 to 1944). Hence the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia; but the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, and no more Australian authors will come out of copyright until 1 January 2026 (those who died in 1955).

Unpublished works by authors who died in 1949 will enter the public domain. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New copyright duration changes coming|url=https://www.communications.gov.au/departmental-news/new-copyright-duration-changes-coming|website=Australian Government-Department of Communications &amp; The Arts|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any published literary, artistic, dramatic, or musical work (other than computer programs) by a not generally known author (anonymous or pseudonymous) from 1949 will enter the public domain.

==Entering the public domain in the United States==
{{See also|Public domain in the United States}}

No United States audio recordings will enter the public domain (as those before 1972 were covered by state laws only), but international audio recordings published in 1924 enter the public domain.  All sheet music [[1924 in music|published in 1924]] enter the public domain.  Under the [[Music Modernization Act]], United States audio recordings published in 1924 will enter the public domain in 2025.

Under the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], 
books [[1924 in literature|published in 1924]],
films [[1924 in film|released in 1924]],
and other works published in 1924, will enter the public domain in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Copyright and the Public Domain |publisher=Public Domain Information Project |url=http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Copyright-Law.php |accessdate=2015-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801121535/http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Copyright-Law.php |archive-date=2014-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unpublished works whose authors died in 1949 will enter the public domain.

'''Bank of New Zealand v Greenwood''' [1984] 1 NZLR 525 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding land based [[nuisance]] claims in tort.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Reflection of sunlight from Greenwood's architecturally designed glass veranda caused discomfort to people working in the [[Bank of New Zealand]] building opposite it. Greenwood refused to take steps to rectify this, as they claimed that sunlight was not an actionable claim in nuisance.

==Held==
The court ruled that the reflection of sunlight is an actionable claim in nuisance, but instead of making Greenwood remove the offending veranda which would have cost $20,000, it ordered that Greenwood pay for the installation of blinds at the BNZ building.

The '''Bar Standards Board''' regulates [[barrister]]s in [[England and Wales]] for the public interest.
It is responsible for:

* Setting standards of conduct for barristers and authorising barristers to practise;
* Monitoring the service provided by barristers to assure quality;
* Setting the education and training requirements for becoming a barrister as well as setting continuing training requirements to ensure that barristers’ skills are maintained throughout their careers; and
* Handling complaints against barristers and taking enforcement or other action where appropriate

The BSB's functions were originally carried out by the [[General Council of the Bar|Bar Council]], the barristers' representative body, until 2006 when the Bar Council created the BSB as an independent regulator. However, the [[Legal Services Board]] has questioned the independence of the BSB from the Bar Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalfutures.co.uk/blog/brothers-arms "Brothers In Arms?"] Legalfutures.co.uk, 13 December 2013. (Retrieved 18 December 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSB's governing board meets monthly at its headquarters in High Holborn, London, and holds public and private sessions. It has a majority of lay (non-barrister) members and the remainder are barristers. Its chair is The Rt Hon the Baroness Tessa Blackstone who joined in January 2018. The vice-chair, since January 2016, is Naomi Ellenbogen QC, Joint Head of Littleton Chambers. She replaced Patricia Robertson QC.

Members of the BSB's board as of January 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BSB board members |url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/about-bar-standards-board/how-we-do-it/our-governance/our-board/}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:

Barrister Members:
Mr Aidan Christie QC,
Ms Justine Davidge,
Mr Andrew Mitchell QC,
Mr Adam Solomon and
Ms Anupama Thompson.

Lay Members:
Ms Alison Allden OBE,
Mr Steven Haines,
Ms Zoe McLeod,
Lara Fielden,
Kathryn Stone OBE,
Stephen Thornton CBE; and
Ms Nicola Sawford.

==BSB Entities and Alternative Business Structures==
The Bar Standards Board also authorise and regulate "BSB entities", which fall into two distinct bodies: '''BSB authorised bodies''' (previously referred to as "entities") are fully owned and managed by authorised, such as lawyers with a current practising certificate. '''BSB licensed bodies''' (also known as "Alternative Business Structures" or ABSs), however, are owned and managed jointly by both authorised and non-authorised individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/regulatory-requirements/entities,-including-alternative-business-structures/|author=Bar Standard Board|title=Entities, including Alternative Business Structures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar Standards Board held a workshop at the 2016 Annual Bar Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/195278530|title=BSB workshop on Alternative Business Structures}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and authorised the first three Licensed Bodies in April 2017, including VII Law, Minerva Law and ShenSmith Law. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/media/1663530/_1__bsb_entities_register__as_at_28_07_2017__use.xlsx"|title=BSB Entities' Register|publisher=Bar Standards Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensed bodies have been reported by [[Thomson Reuters]] as a leading innovation of the legal industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/legal-uk/2017/05/24/innovation-bar-leading-way/|title=Innovation at the Bar: Who is leading the way?|author=Roxanne Selby|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2012, the one-year anniversary of the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]], he was detained by the Syrian government at [[Adra Prison]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#FREEBASSEL: a campaign to free Bassel Khartabil from Syrian jail|url=http://www.albawaba.com/blog_roundup/freebassel-kharatable-syria-432588|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Al Bawaba|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between then and 3 October 2015, he had been transferred to an unknown location, probably to be judged by a military court.&lt;ref name="transfer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaoriente.com/2015/10/03/we-need-everybodys-help-to-freebassel/|title=WE NEED EVERYBODY’S HELP TO #FREEBASSEL|date=3 October 2015 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003190157/http://mediaoriente.com/2015/10/03/we-need-everybodys-help-to-freebassel/|archivedate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transfergv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2015/10/03/free-bassel-fears-for-imprisoned-syrian-palestinian-blogger-bassel-khartabil-after-he-was-moved-to-an-unknown-location/|title=Fears for Imprisoned Syrian Blogger Bassel Khartabil, Transferred to an Unknown Location|date=3 October 2015|publisher=Global Voices|author=Amira Al Hussaini}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2015, [[Human Rights Watch]] and 30 other human rights organizations issued a letter demanding that Khartabil's whereabouts be disclosed.&lt;ref name="hrwdisclose"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/07/syria-disclose-whereabouts-detained-freedom-expression-advocate|title=Syria: Disclose Whereabouts of Detained Freedom of Expression Advocate|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2015, rumors surfaced that Khartabil had been secretly sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IGF 2015 Flyer on Bassel Khartabil|url = https://www.eff.org/document/igf-2015-flyer-bassel-khartabil|website = Electronic Frontier Foundation|publisher = eff.org |accessdate =15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = #FreeBassel: Death Sentence Rumored for Syrian Web Developer|url = https://globalvoices.org/2015/11/13/freebassel-death-sentence-rumored-for-syrian-web-developer/|website = Global Voices|accessdate =15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, it was revealed by his wife on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nouranoura81/posts/1405322339548963|title=Noura Ghazi Safadi|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria-software-pioneer-executed-.html|title=Widow Confirms Open Software Pioneer Was Executed in Syria|last=The Associated Press|date=2 August 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 August 2017 |language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Khartabil had been executed by the Syrian regime shortly after his disappearance in 2015.&lt;ref name="JWF-2017-08"&gt;{{cite web|title=Horrific: Reports that Bassel Khartabil Has Been Executed in Syria|url=http://jimmywalesfoundation.org/horrific-reports-that-bassel-khartabil-has-been-executed-in-syria/|website=Jimmy Wales Foundation|accessdate=1 August 2017|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Independent 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=One of Syria’s most famous activists has been executed in prison, widow confirms | website=The Independent | date=2 August 2017 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bassel-khartabil-safadi-executed-syria-activist-dead-prison-widow-confirms-democracy-adra-damascus-a7872771.html | accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detention==

On 15 March 2012, Khartabil was detained amid arrests in the [[Mazzeh]] district of Damascus by [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Syria)|Military Security Branch 215]].&lt;ref name="alkarama-1763"&gt;{{cite news |title=UN Calls for the Release of Freedom of Speech Advocate Bassel Khartabil |url=http://en.alkarama.org/1763-syria-un-calls-for-the-release-of-freedom-of-speech-advocate-bassel-khartabil |accessdate=25 June 2015 |publisher=Alkarama |date=23 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625170229/http://en.alkarama.org/1763-syria-un-calls-for-the-release-of-freedom-of-speech-advocate-bassel-khartabil |archivedate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day marked the one-year anniversary of the Syrian uprising, with pro- and anti-government protesters demonstrating in Damascus and elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As revolt against Assad enters 2nd year, ‘up to 500,000’ Syrians may flee crackdown|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/15/200783.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khartabil was interrogated and allegedly tortured for five days by Military Branch 215. One week after his arrest, security forces reportedly took him to his home where they confiscated his computers and his files. He was then transferred to the Interrogation Division Branch 248 and detained there [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] for 9 months. On 9 December 2012, Khartabil was brought before a military prosecutor who charged him with "spying for an enemy State" under Articles 272 and 274 of the Syrian Criminal Code. Khartabil was then sent to the [[Adra Prison]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="alkarama-1763" /&gt;

On 12 December 2013, a request for written answer on the question of Khartabil's imprisonment was raised before the [[European Parliament]] to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative), stating that "his voluntary work, always non-violent in nature, was greatly valued by Syrians of all backgrounds, and it is strongly suspected that his arrest was part of an effort to restrict access to online communities and discourses and stifle free expression in Syria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Request for Written Answer on the Question of the Imprisonment of Bassel Safadi Khartabil|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2013-014046+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate=15 March 2014 |publisher=European Parliament |date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2014, the written answer from High Representative/Vice-President [[Catherine Ashton]] was published, stating that "The HR/VP deplores the ongoing imprisonment of Bassel Safadi Khartabil, shares the concerns at his situation and follows it very closely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission on the Question of the Imprisonment of Bassel Safadi Khartabil|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2013-014046&amp;language=EN|accessdate=9 April 2014 |publisher=European Parliament |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2015, the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention|United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] (WGAD) adopted an Opinion on Khartabil's case, calling his detention "arbitrary" and asking for his immediate release.&lt;ref name="alkarama-1763"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Netizen Report: U.K. Spied on Human Rights Organizations in Egypt, South Africa |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/24/netizen_report_u_k_spied_on_human_rights_organizations_in_egypt_south_africa.html |accessdate=25 June 2015 |publisher=Slate |date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WGAD concluded that Kharbatil's detention violated Articles 9, 14 and 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), which Syria ratified in 1969.

==Personal life==
Khartabil was arrested a few days before his marriage contract to [[Noura Ghazi]], a lawyer and human rights activist, was to be signed. The contract was finalized later that year, while Khartabil was in prison. The couple first met in [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] in April 2011 after coming back from a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Stories from the Syrian Revolution: Love in the Time of Revolution is a Revolution|url=http://freesyriantranslators.net/2013/02/14/stories-from-the-syrian-revolution-love-in-the-time-of-revolution-is-a-revolution/|accessdate=15 March 2014 |publisher=Free Syrian Translators |date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Valentine's Day 2015, Noura made public a love letter she wrote Bassel where she reflects on what has taken place in Syria in the time he had been imprisoned:

== Imprisonment and public outcry ==

Khartabil was arrested and put in prison on 15 March 2012. He was moved about from one prison to another, including a high-security military prison. At times he was able to get letters out to friends and family while in Adra Prison, but at other times he was allegedly tortured and kept in confinement, without contact. In 2015, he was reportedly executed, but this was not confirmed until 2017.

At the Index on Censorship Awards, Jon Phillips said of Khartabil, "''Locking up Bassel only locks out his personal freedom. By locking up Bassel, his Syrian captors are accidentally locking out themselves from the future...thousands of people that Bassel’s work helped, now help him by spreading the message #FREEBASSEL. This is what truly builds Syria and connects it to the global connected future. This award proves that his lock-up, is NOT a lock-out of his digital freedom.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harmon|first=Elliot|title=Imprisoned internet pioneer Bassel Khartabil wins Index on Censorship Digital Freedom Award|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37612|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=11 May 2015|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

=== Models of ancient Palmyra ===
{{Main|New Palmyra Project}}
[[File:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|A digital reconstruction of the [[Temple of Bel]] from the [[New Palmyra]] project]]

Starting in 2005, Khartabil began collecting photographs of the ancient architecture and archaeology sites in Palmyra, in the hopes of reconstructing the city online, using 3D models and virtual spaces.

His efforts were put on hold when he was imprisoned, and some of his early work was lost. In 2015 his friends and colleagues launched the New Palmyra Project to bring that dream to life. Since then, many of the most famous structures in Palmyra have been modeled, and some life-size models built of structures that were destroyed in the [[Syrian Civil War]].

As of 2017, most of the buildings and statues captured by the New Palmyra Project have been completely destroyed by ISIL.

=== Writing and art ===
Khartabil wrote hundreds of letters while in prison, including some while he was in a high-security military prison, where writing was prohibited. He also produced some paintings and poetry. For a short time, he published some of his writing to an anonymous prison blog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meinsyrianjail.wordpress.com|title=meinsyrianjail|website=meinsyrianjail|language=en-US|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]] account, via a friend.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Jail is not walls, not the executioner and guards. It is the hidden fear in our hearts that makes us prisoners"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Building performance simulation.png|thumb|Building performance simulation model with input and some resulting output|348x348px]]
'''Building performance simulation''' (BPS) (''formerly known as '''building energy simulation''' or '''building energy modeling''''') is the use of software to predict performance aspects of a building. The objective is to create a virtual model that is sufficiently accurate to form a useful representation of the actual building. BPS forecasts the various energy and mass flows within a building, in order to evaluate one or several performance aspects using computer simulation.

== Introduction ==
From a physical point of view, a building is a very complex system, influenced by a wide range of parameters. A [[Simulation modeling|simulation model]] is an abstraction of the real building which allows to consider the influences on high level of detail and to analyze key performance indicators without cost-intensive measurements. BPS is a technology of considerable potential that provides the ability to quantify and compare the relative cost and performance attributes of a proposed design in a realistic manner and at relatively low effort and cost. Energy demand, indoor environmental quality (incl. [[Thermal comfort|thermal]] and visual comfort, [[indoor air quality]] and moisture phenomena), [[HVAC]] and renewable system performance, urban level modeling, [[building automation]], and operational optimization are important aspects of BPS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46693334|title=Energy simulation in building design|last=Clarke|first=J.

Over the last six decades, numerous BPS computer programs have been developed. The most comprehensive listing of BPS software can be found in the BEST directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/|title=Best Directory {{!}} Building Energy Software Tools|website=www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them only cover certain parts of BPS (e.g. climate analysis, thermal comfort, energy calculations, plant modeling, daylight simulation etc.). The core tools in the field of BPS are multi-domain, dynamic, whole-building simulation tools, which provide users with key indicators such as heating and cooling load, energy demand, temperature trends, humidity, thermal and visual comfort indicators, air pollutants, ecological impact and costs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawley|first=Drury B.|last2=Hand|first2=Jon W.|last3=Kummert|first3=Michaël|last4=Griffith|first4=Brent T.|date=2008-04-01|title=Contrasting the capabilities of building energy performance simulation programs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132306003234|journal=Building and Environment|series=Part Special: Building Performance Simulation|volume=43|issue=4|pages=661–673|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical building simulation model has inputs for local weather; building geometry; [[building envelope]] characteristics; internal heat gains from [[lighting]], occupants and [[Plug load|equipment loads]]; heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) system specifications; operation schedules and control strategies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ease of input and accessibility of output data varies widely between BPS tools. Advanced whole-building simulation tools are able to consider almost all of the following in some way with different approaches.

Necessary input data for a whole-building simulation:
* '''Climate:''' ambient air temperature, [[relative humidity]], direct and diffuse [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]], wind speed and direction
* '''Site:''' location and orientation of the building, shading by topography and surrounding buildings, ground properties
* '''Geometry:''' building shape and zone geometry
* '''Envelope:''' materials and constructions, windows and shading, thermal bridges, infiltration and openings
* '''Internal gains:''' lights, equipment and occupants including schedules for operation/occupancy
* '''Ventilation system:''' transport and conditioning (heating, cooling, humidification) of air
* '''Room units:''' local units for heating, cooling and ventilation
* '''Plant:''' Central units for transformation, storage and delivery of energy to the building
* '''Controls:''' for window opening, shading devices, ventilation systems, room units, plant components
Some examples for key performance indicators:
* '''Temperature trends:''' in zones, on surfaces, in construction layers, for hot or cold water supply or in double glass facades
* '''Comfort indicators:''' like [[Predicted Mean Vote|PMV]] and [[Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied|PPD]], radiant temperature asymmetry, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration, relative humidity
* '''Heat balances:''' for zones, the whole building or single plant components
* '''Load profiles:''' for heating and cooling demand, electricity profile for equipment and lighting
* '''Energy demand:''' for heating, cooling, ventilation, light, equipment, auxiliary systems (e.g. pumps, fans, elevators)
* '''Daylight availability:''' in certain zone areas, at different time points with variable outside conditions
Other use of BPS software
* '''System sizing:''' for HVAC components like air handling units, heat exchanger, boiler, chiller, water storage tanks, heat pumps and renewable energy systems.
* '''Optimizing control strategies:''' Controller setup for shading, window opening, heating, cooling and ventilation for increased operation performance.

== History ==
The history of BPS is approximately as long as that of [[computer]]s. The very early developments in this direction started in the late 50's and early 60's in the United States and Sweden. During this period, several methods had been introduced for analyzing single system components (e.g. gas boiler) using steady state calculations.The very first reported simulation tool for buildings was '''BRIS''', introduced in 1963 by the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Gösta|title=The BRIS simulation program for thermal design of buildings and their services|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=January 1990|volume=14|issue=4|pages=385–400|doi=10.1016/0378-7788(90)90100-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 60's, several models with hourly resolution had been developed focusing on energy assessments and heating/cooling load calculations. This effort resulted in more powerful simulation engines released in the early 70's, among those were BLAST, DOE-2, [[ESP-r]], HVACSIM+ and [[TRNSYS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/%5Cproceedings%5CBS1999%5CBS99_P-01.pdf|title=Early history and future prospects of building system simulation|last=Kusuda|first=T.|date=1999|website=IBPSA Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[1970s energy crisis|1970's energy crisis]] intensified these efforts, as reducing the energy consumption of buildings became an urgent domestic policy interest. The energy crisis also initiated development of U.S. building energy standards, beginning with [[ASHRAE 90.1#Standard 90-1975|ASHRAE 90-75]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sukjoon|first=Oh,|date=2013-08-19|title=Origins of Analysis Methods in Energy Simulation Programs Used for High Performance Commercial Buildings|url=http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/151151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of building simulation represents a combined effort between academia, governmental institutions, industry, and professional organizations. Over the past decades the building simulation discipline has matured into a field that offers unique expertise, methods and tools for [[building performance]] evaluation. Several review papers and state of the art analysis were carried out during that time giving an overview about the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augenbroe|first=Godfried|last2=Hensen|first2=Jan|date=2004-08-01|title=Simulation for better building design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013230400085X|journal=Building and Environment|series=Building Simulation for Better Building Design|volume=39|issue=8|pages=875–877|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hensen, J.

In the 1980s, a discussion about future directions for BPS among a group of leading building simulation specialists started. There was a consensus that most of the tools, that had been developed until then, were too rigid in their structure to be able to accommodate the improvements and flexibility that would be called for in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.A.; Sowell, E.F.; the Simulation Research Group (1985): ''A Proposal to Develop a Kernel System for the Next Generation of Building Energy Simulation Software'', Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, Nov. 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the very first equation-based building simulation environment '''ENET'''&lt;ref&gt;Low, D. and Sowell, E.F. (1982): ''ENET, a PC-based building energy simulation system,'' Energy Programs Conference, IBM Real Estate and Construction Division, Austin, Texas (1982), pp. 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; was developed, which provided the foundation of '''SPARK'''. In 1989, Sahlin and Sowell presented a '''[[Neutral Model Format]]''' (NMF) for building simulation models, which is used today in the commercial software [[IDA Indoor Climate and Energy|IDA ICE]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlin, P. and Sowell, E.F. (1989).

A.|date=1993-01-01|title=Development and integration of an equation-solving program for engineering thermodynamics courses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cae.6180010310/abstract|journal=Computer Applications in Engineering Education|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=265–275|doi=10.1002/cae.6180010310|issn=1099-0542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997, Mattsson and Elmqvist reported on an international effort to design '''[[Modelica]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattsson|first=Sven Erik|last2=Elmqvist|first2=Hilding|date=April 1997|title=Modelica - An International Effort to Design the Next Generation Modeling Language|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017436287|journal=IFAC Proceedings Volumes|series=7th IFAC Symposium on Computer Aided Control Systems Design (CACSD '97), Gent, Belgium, 28–30 April|volume=30|issue=4|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/S1474-6670(17)43628-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPS still presents challenges relating to problem representation, support for performance appraisal, enabling operational application, and delivering user education, training, and accreditation. Clarke (2015) describes a future vision of BPS with the following, most important tasks which should be addressed by the global BPS community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Joe|date=2015-03-04|title=A vision for building performance simulation: a position paper prepared on behalf of the IBPSA Board|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2015.1007699|journal=Journal of Building Performance Simulation|volume=8|issue=2|pages=39–43|doi=10.1080/19401493.2015.1007699|issn=1940-1493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Better concept promotion
* Standardization of input data and accessibility of model libraries
* Standard performance assessment procedures
* Better embedding of BPS in practice
* Operational support and fault diagnosis with BPS
* Education, training, and user accreditation

== Accuracy ==

In the context of building simulation models, error refers to the discrepancy between simulation results and the actual measured performance of the building. There are normally occurring [[uncertainties in building design and building energy assessment|uncertainties in building design and building assessment]], which generally stem from approximations in model inputs, such as occupancy behavior. Calibration refers to the process of "tuning" or adjusting assumed simulation model inputs to match observed data from the utilities or [[Building Management System]] (BMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raftery|first=Paul|last2=Keane|first2=Marcus|last3=Costa|first3=Andrea|date=2011-12-01|title=Calibrating whole building energy models: Detailed case study using hourly measured data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778811004415|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=12|pages=3666–3679|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=T.

ASHRAE recommends a R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; greater than 0.75 for calibrated models. The criteria for NMBE and CV RMSE depends on if measured data is available at a monthly or hourly timescale.

== Technological aspects ==
Given the complexity of building energy and mass flows, it is generally not possible to find an [[Closed-form expression|analytical solution]], so the simulation software employs other techniques, such as response function methods, or [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]] in [[finite difference]]s or [[Finite volume method|finite volume]], as an approximation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of today's whole building simulation programs formulate models using [[imperative programming]] languages. These languages assign values to variables, declare the sequence of execution of these assignments and change the state of the program, as is done for example in [[Compatibility of C and C++|C/C++]], [[Fortran]] or [[MATLAB]]/[[Simulink]]. In such programs, model equations are tightly connected to the solution methods, often by making the solution procedure part of the actual model equations.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wetter|first=Michael|last2=Bonvini|first2=Marco|last3=Nouidui|first3=Thierry S.|date=2016-04-01|title=Equation-based languages – A new paradigm for building energy modeling, simulation and optimization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778815303315|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=117|pages=290–300|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of imperative programming languages limits the applicability and extensibility of models. More flexibility offer simulation engines using symbolic [[Differential-algebraic system of equations|Differential Algebraic Equations]] (DAEs) with general purpose solvers that increase model reuse, transparency and accuracy. Since some of these engines have been developed for more than 20 years (e.g. IDA ICE) and due to the key advantages of equation-based modeling, these simulation engines can be considered as [[State of the art|state of the art technology.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahlin|first=Per|last2=Eriksson|first2=Lars|last3=Grozman|first3=Pavel|last4=Johnsson|first4=Hans|last5=Shapovalov|first5=Alexander|last6=Vuolle|first6=Mika|date=2004-08-01|title=Whole-building simulation with symbolic DAE equations and general purpose solvers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132304000307|journal=Building and Environment|series=Building Simulation for Better Building Design|volume=39|issue=8|pages=949–958|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahlin|first=Per|last2=Eriksson|first2=Lars|last3=Grozman|first3=Pavel|last4=Johnsson|first4=Hans|last5=Shapovalov|first5=Alexander|last6=Vuolle|first6=Mika|date=August 2003|title=Will equation-based building simulation make it?-experiences from the introduction of IDA Indoor Climate And Energy|url=https://www.academia.edu/16918862/Will_equation-based_building_simulation_make_it_-experiences_from_the_introduction_of_IDA_Indoor_Climate_And_Energy|journal=Proceedings of Building …|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Building simulation models may be developed for both new or existing buildings. Major use categories of building performance simulation include:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* '''Architectural Design''': quantitatively compare design or [[Retrofitting|retrofit]] options in order to inform a more [[energy-efficient building design]]
* '''HVAC Design:''' calculate thermal loads for sizing of mechanical equipment and help design and test system control strategies
* '''Building Performance Rating:''' demonstrate [[Building performance simulation#Performance-Based Compliance|performance-based compliance]] with energy codes, green certification, and financial incentives
* '''Building Stock Analysis:''' support development of energy codes and standards and plan large scale energy efficiency programs
* '''CFD in buildings:''' simulation of boundary conditions like surface heat fluxes and surface temperatures for a following [[CFD in buildings|CFD]] study of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Wei|last2=Han|first2=Xu|last3=Zuo|first3=Wangda|last4=Sohn|first4=Michael D.|title=Building energy simulation coupled with CFD for indoor environment: A critical review and recent applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.046|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=165|pages=184–199|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software tools ==
There are hundreds of software tools available for simulating the performance of buildings and building subsystems, which range in capability from whole-building simulations to model input calibration to building auditing. Among whole-building simulation software tools, it is important to draw a distinction between the '''''simulation engine''''', which dynamically solves equations rooted in [[thermodynamics]] and [[building science]], and the '''''modeler application (interface)'''''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In general, BPS software can be classified into&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Østergård|first=Torben|last2=Jensen|first2=Rasmus L.|last3=Maagaard|first3=Steffen E.|date=2016-08-01|title=Building simulations supporting decision making in early design – A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211600280X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=61|pages=187–201|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applications with integrated simulation engine (e.g. EnergyPlus, ESP-r, IES-VE, IDA ICE)
* Software that docks to a certain engine (e.g. [[Designbuilder]], eQuest, RIUSKA, Sefaira)
* Plugins for other software enabling certain performance analysis (e.g. DIVA for Rhino, Honeybee, [[Autodesk]] Green Building Studio)

Contrary to this presentation, there are some tools that in fact do not meet these sharp classification criteria, such as ESP-r which can also be used as a modeler application for EnergyPlus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lists.strath.ac.uk/archives/esp-r/2015/003176.html|title=Exporting ESP-r models to E+ .idf files|last=|first=|date=|website=Answered question in the ESP-r support forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also other applications using the IDA simulation environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equa.se/de/tunnel|title=IDA Tunnel|last=|first=|date=|website=Software "Tunnel" uses IDA simulation environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes "IDA" the engine and "ICE" the modeler. Most modeler applications support the user with a graphical user interface to make data input easier. The modeler creates an input file for the simulation engine to solve. The engine returns output data to the modeler application or another visualization tool which in turn presents the results to the user. For some software packages, the calculation engine and the interface may be the same product. The table below gives an overview about commonly used simulation engines and modeler applications for BPS.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annex 43/Task 34 Final Task Management Report - Testing and Validation of Building Energy Simulation Tools|last=Judkoff|first=Ron|publisher=International Energy Agency (IEA)|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BPS in practice ==
Since the 90's, building performance simulation has undergone the transition from a method used mainly for research to a design tool for mainstream industrial projects. However, the utilization in different countries still varies greatly. Building certification programs like [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (USA), [[BREEAM]] (UK) or [[DGNB]] (Germany)  showed to be a good driving force for BPS to find broader application. Also, national building standards that allow BPS based analysis are of good help for an increasing industrial adoption, such as in the United States ([[ASHRAE 90.1]]),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sweden (BBR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boverket.se/en/start-in-english/|title=BBR - Swedish building regulation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland (SIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sia.ch/en/the-sia/|title=Swiss society of architects and engineers (SIA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom (NCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uk-ncm.org.uk/|title=UKs National Calculation Method|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish building regulations are unique in that computed energy use has to be verified by measurements within the first two years of building operation. Since the introduction in 2007, experience shows that highly detailed simulation models are preferred by modelers to reliably achieve the required level of accuracy. Furthermore, this has fostered a simulation culture where the design predictions are close to the actual performance. This in turn has led to offers of formal energy guarantees based on simulated predictions, highlighting the general business potential of BPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gbpn.org/databases-tools/bc-detail-pages/sweden#Summary|title=Swedish code summarized in global performance network|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance-based compliance ==
In a performance-based approach, compliance with building codes or standards is based on the predicted energy use from a building simulation, rather than a prescriptive approach, which requires adherence to stipulated technologies or design features. Performance-based compliance provides greater flexibility in the building design as it allows designers to miss some prescriptive requirements if the impact on building performance can be offset by exceeding other prescriptive requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbei.psu.edu/eeb-codes-performance-based-codes/|title=A new paradigm for building codes|last=Senick|first=Jennifer|date=|website=cbei.psu.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certifying agency provides details on model inputs, software specifications, and performance requirements.

The following is a list of U.S. based energy codes and standards that reference building simulations to demonstrate compliance:
* [[ASHRAE 90.1]]
* [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC)
* [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED)
* [[California Building Standards Code|California Title 24]]

In the 1990s, a '''trade dispute''' over fresh [[salmon]] arose between [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In 1995, Canada made a complaint to the [[World Trade Organization]], of which both countries are members, about Australia's restriction on imports of fresh salmon, which were part of a [[quarantine]] measure for health purposes.

[[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|WTO dispute resolution]] favored Canada, both in a 1997 panel decision and in a subsequent decision by the WTO [[Appellate Body]]. The WTO determined that the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (SPS Agreement) did not allow Australia's import ban. The WTO ordered Australia to lift its ban and increased quarantine requirements not only for salmon, but for imports of other species of fish as well.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia - Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon|url=http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/international-organisations/wto/wto-dispute-settlement/Pages/australia-measures-affecting-importation-of-salmon-wt-ds18.aspx|website=dfat.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parties settled their dispute in 2000.

==Salmon industry and origins of the dispute==
In the 1990s, major world salmon exporters include Canada, Norway, Chile, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Michael Richardson, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fish.t_0.html Ottawa Sees Protectionism by Canberra; Canada's Beef: Salmon], ''New York Times'', November 10, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Australia had a 100 million [[Australian dollar|AUD]] (75.1 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) salmon industry, with a total value of Australian salmon exports (mostly to east Asia, particularly Japan) of about 40 million dollars.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

In 1975, Australia imposed a ban on imports of fresh salmon under a quarantine regulation intended to prevent entry of imported diseases into fish stock in Australia.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; Australia did allow imports of non-fresh salmon, including salmon that had been heat-treated by [[canning]] (see [[salmon cannery]]) or [[smoking]], which reduces the risk of disease. In 1995, the annual value of such imports to Australia was about 52 million dollars, with almost half of these imports coming from Canada.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; Australian salmon had an advantage in Japanese and other markets, selling for premiums up to 20 percent over other imported fresh salmon, because of Australian environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

In the 1990s, however, tensions arose between Canada and Australia over Australia's regulation, negatively affecting the [[Australia–Canada relations|two countries' relations]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt; The Australians argued that the ban was justified on health grounds; the Canadians argued that there was no scientific evidence that Canadian fresh-salmon imports would be unsafe and that the ban was simply [[protectionism]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

==WTO case and settlement==
In the 1990s, Canada brought a dispute to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTC) against Australia regarding the importation of salmon. The official title of the case was '''Australia — Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon''', Dispute DS18.&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds18_e.htm Dispute Settlement: Dispute DS18: Australia — Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon], World Trade Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was the first challenged under the 1994 Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) reached following the 1994 [[Uruguay Round]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

The case formally began with Canada's request for consultations on October 1995.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Canada alleged that Australia's prohibition on Canadian salmon imports under the Australian quarantine regulation was inconsistent with the SPS Agreement and articles XI and XIII of the 1994 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

Following requests from Canada to establish a panel, the DSB did so in April 1997.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The [[European Communities]], [[India]], [[Norway]], and the [[United States]] reserved their third-party rights.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The panel was composed in May 1997, and the panel report circulated in June 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The panel determined that Australia's important ban was "inconsistent with Articles 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6 of the SPS Agreement, and also nullified or impaired benefits accruing to Canada under the SPS Agreement."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In June 1998, Australia filed a notice of its intention to appeal the panel's decision to the WTO [[Appellate Body]].&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body report circulated in October 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body reversed the panel with respect to its reasoning on Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement, but found that Australia "had acted inconsistently" with those sections.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Appellate Body also broadened the panel's determination that Australia had acted inconsistently with Articles 5.5 and 2.3 of the SPS Agreement.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Finally the Appellate Body "reversed the panel's finding that Australia had acted inconsistently with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement but was unable to come to a conclusion whether or not Australia's measure was consistent with Article 5.6 due to insufficient factual findings by the panel."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;  The decision directed Australia not only to lift the ban on Canadian salmon, but also the quarantine requirements for several other species of fish.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;

The DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report in November 1998.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;  Australia expressed its intention to abide by the DSB's decision.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In December 1998, Canada requested arbitration under to Article 21.3(c) of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) "to determine the reasonable period of time for implementation of the recommendations of the DSB."&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The Article 21.3(c) Arbitration Report was circulated in February 1999; it determined that the reasonable period of time for implementation was eight months (i.e., the period ending on July 6, 1999).&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

After Canada brought this dispute to the WTO, Australia published the "1999 Import Risk Analysis" arguing that the import of frozen, fresh or chilled salmon is a health risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia-Salmon|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds18sum_e.pdf|website=wto.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Canada made requests under the DSU for a determination by the original panel of whether the implementation measures taken by Australia were consistent with WTO rules as determined in the dispute-resolution proceedings.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; At its meeting of July 28, 1999, the DSB agreed to take up Canada's request and referred the matter back to the original panel. The EC, Norway and the U.S. again reserved their third-party rights.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

The compliance panel was composed in September 1999 and circulated its report in February 2000, finding:&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

{{quote|

*Due to delays in the entry into force of several implementing measures which extended beyond the reasonable period of time within which Australia had to implement the DSB recommendations, no measures to comply existed in the sense of Article 21.5 of the DSU in respect of a number of covered products and during specific periods of time. As a result, during those periods, Australia failed to bring its measure into conformity with the SPS Agreement in the sense referred to in Article 22.6 of the DSU.
*Australia, by requiring that only salmon product that is "consumer-ready" as specifically defined can be imported into Australia and released from quarantine, was maintaining sanitary measures that were not "based on" a risk assessment, which was contrary to Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement. The panel also considered the same requirement to be in violation of Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement.
*Finally, the panel found that Australia violated Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement as a result of a measure enacted by the Government of Tasmania that effectively prohibits the importation of certain Canadian salmon product into most parts of Tasmania without being based on a risk assessment and without sufficient scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;}}

The DSB adopted the report of the compliance panel in March 2000.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

In July 1999, before compliance proceedings began, Canada requested authorization from the DSB, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, to suspend concessions to Australia because of its non-compliance.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Australia objected to Canada's proposed level of suspension of concessions and requested that the matter be referred to arbitration, pursuant to Article 22.6.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The DSB agreed to this request, but the arbitration proceedings were suspended until after the compliance proceedings concluded.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt;

At the DSB meeting of May 18, 2000, following the compliance panel's decision, and following discussion between the WTO and the governments of the two countries, sectors of each government and the panel, Canada announced that it had come to an agreement with Australia to bring the dispute to a close.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The parties exchanged letters detailing the agreement.&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; Under the agreement, "Canada would monitor closely Australia's commitment to implement the agreement" by June 1, 2000.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTO"/&gt; The agreement became effective on schedule on June 1, 2000.&lt;ref name="Importation of Salmon"/&gt;

==Countries ==

=== Canada ===

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA) verifies that exported foods and food products meet the Canadian standards just as an importing country would. Countries have their own requirements for foods and food products and the Canadian government understands this and respects those requirements.&lt;ref name=CFIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Exports|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/exports/eng/1323723342834/1323723662195|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has implemented the fish inspection act to help regulate the export of fish and fish products.&lt;ref name="Fish Export Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fish Export Policy|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/fish-and-seafood/exports/policy/eng/1329762426884/1329762515816|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts Canada has put towards achieving a substantial export in their fish (salmon) shows speculation towards Australia.

=== Australia ===

[[Aquaculture in Australia]] is the country's fastest growing [[primary industry]] accounting for 34% of the countries seafood production. Salmon is a part of this movement across the country with Atlantic salmon becoming a mainstream fish produced through the aquaculture systems. Salmon farms are found in [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]] and while they are making an effort to improve [[salmon farming]] offshore and inshore it is still producing a small amount of salmon for Australia.

Although the countries were developing a negative trade relationship, Australia values its long-standing close and productive relationship with Canada. Their trade relationship dates back over 100 years and the two countries continuously work together. Australian and Canadian military forces fought side by side in both World Wars, The Korean War and the 1990-91 Gulf War. Both countries have forces in Afghanistan making movements to stabilize that country as close military allies.&lt;ref name="Australia-Canada Relations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia-Canada relations|url=http://www.canada.embassy.gov.au/otwa/relations.html|website=www.canada.embassy.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carriage of Goods by Sea Act''' ("COGSA")&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode46a/usc_sup_05_46_10_28.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Law of the United States|United States]] [[statute]] governing the rights and responsibilities between [[wikt:shipper|shipper]]s of [[cargo]] and [[ship-owner]]s regarding ocean shipments to and from the United States.  It is the U.S. enactment of the International Convention Regarding Bills of Lading, commonly known as the "[[Hague Rules]]". It was found in [[Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Title 46]] Appendix of the [[United States Code]], starting at Section 1301, but has been moved to a note in 46 [[United States Code]] 30701.&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. 109-304, § 6(c), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1516&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress]], concerned that the Hague Rules did not offer shippers enough protection against damage to cargo by shipowners,  amended the Hague Rules in a number of minor, but important, ways. It increased the amount that shipowners would have to pay cargo owners for damage in transit from [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 100 per package to US$500 per package or, for goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit. This "package limitation" has become one of the most contentious and litigious areas in the field of cargo damage,  particularly as it relates to the transportation of goods by ocean [[Intermodal container|shipping containers]].

== History of Limitation of Liability for Cargo Damage ==
At the time of the passage of COGSA most cargo was shipped in boxes, crates, and bags. Shortly after its passage, cargo owners determined that cargo could be handled more efficiently if placed on [[pallet]]s, a process that results in numerous boxes or bags of cargo being consolidated on a single pallet. Shipowners, seeing an opportunity to reduce their liability for cargo damage, argued to the courts that the pallets were now "packages" and that they were entitled to limit their liability to $500 per pallet. Some courts agreed.

[[Image:teu.jpg|left|thumb|A {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[intermodal container|ISO container]], or TEU.]]

Later, shipowners began offering cargo owners the opportunity to ship their cargoes in large ocean [[Containerization|shipping container]]s.  The containers came in two sizes &amp;mdash; {{convert|8|ft|m}} high x {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide x {{convert|20|ft|m}} long (2.4&amp;nbsp;m x 2.4&amp;nbsp;m x 6&amp;nbsp;m) or 8 x 8 x {{convert|40|ft|m}} long. The term "[[Twenty-foot equivalent unit]]" or TEU derived from this size - a TEU was a space aboard a ship that was {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|8|ft|m}} high by {{convert|20|ft|m}} long.

Shipowners, again seeing an opportunity to limit their liability,  began arguing that the containers were "packages" and that they could limit their liability to $500 per container,  even though the contents of a container may be valued at over $500,000. Again, some courts agreed.

It is this imbalance, both in the relative bargaining power of cargo owners, and the superior bargaining power of shipowners, and the imbalance between $500 per container and the true value of a shipment which has led to countless [[lawsuit]]s and judicial opinions over the "package limitation" problem.

The rest of the world, seeing this as an attempt by shipowners to free themselves from responsibility for protecting cargo, amended the Hague Rules in 1968 with the [[Visby Amendments]] which eliminated the "per package" limitation and substituted a limitation per kilogram. In so doing, litigation concerning limitations on liability became virtually non-existent outside the United States. However, Congress failed to pass the Visby Amendments to the Hague Rules.

== Limitation of Liability for Cargo not shipped in Packages ==
Many types of cargo are not shipped in packages such as automobiles, yachts, cranes, and heavy construction equipment.  For those cargoes, Congress had intended{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} the limitation on liability for shipowners to be $500 per 100 cubic feet (3.7&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

At the time of the passage of COGSA the customary freight unit for most cargo was the "revenue ton" - the number of long tons (2240&amp;nbsp;lb, 1017&amp;nbsp;kg) or measurement tons (100 cubic feet) that would produce the most revenue for the shipowner.  For example, a cargo of [[aluminium]] [[ingot]]s, which were not packaged for shipment,  would be heavy and dense, so the customary freight unit for aluminum ingots would be the [[long ton]],  a measurement of weight.  By comparison, a shipment of [[canoe]]s, which were not packaged for shipment, would be light but would take up a large volume, ensuring the customary freight unit would be the measurement ton of {{convert|100|cuft|m3}}.  If a canoe were {{convert|2|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|2|ft|m}} high by {{convert|10|ft|m}} long (0.6&amp;nbsp;m x 0.6&amp;nbsp;m x 3&amp;nbsp;m), its measurement would be 40 cubic feet (2 x 2 x 10) which would be one measurement ton (anything less than 100 would be 1 by default) and hence the limitation would be $500 per canoe.

The courts, possibly believing that Congress' approach was too cumbersome, jettisoned the word "customary" from the phrase "customary freight unit" and decided that whatever freight unit the shipowner applied would be the freight unit for determining the limitation on liability.  Again, seeing an opportunity to limit their liability for cargo damage,  shipowners began freighting all cargo by unit, rather than by units of weight or measurement. Consequently, an automobile which might have a volume of 400 cubic feet (15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or 4 measurement tons, which would previously entitle the carrier to a limitation of $2000, was now freighted as "one automobile" thereby reducing the shipowner's liability from $2000 per automobile to $500.

'''Citizens band radio''' (also known as '''CB radio''') is, in many countries, a system of short-distance radio communications between individuals typically on a selection of 40 channels within the 27 [[Hertz|MHz]] (11 m) band. Citizens band is distinct from other [[personal radio service]] allocations such as [[Family Radio Service|FRS]], [[GMRS]], [[Multi-Use Radio Service|MURS]], [[UHF CB]] and the [[Amateur Radio|Amateur Radio Service]] ([[amateur radio operator|"ham"]] radio). In many countries, CB operation does not require a license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other [[two-way radio]] services, citizens band channels are shared by many users. Only one station may transmit at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available. It is customary for stations waiting to use a shared channel to broadcast the single word "Break" followed by the channel number, during a lull in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4340705|title=The Big dummy's guide to C.B. radio|date=1977|publisher=Book Pub. Co|others=Houston, Albert.|isbn=0913990043|edition=2d|location=Summertown, Tenn.|oclc=4340705}}&lt;/ref&gt; This informs people using the channel that others are waiting.

A number of countries have created similar radio services, with varying technical standards and requirements for licensing. While they may be known by other names, such as the General Radio Service in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/smt-gst.nsf/en/sf01016e.html|title=RIC-18 — General Radio Service (GRS)|first=Government of Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Spectrum, Information Technologies and|last=Telecommunications|date=|website=strategis.ic.gc.ca|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112203042/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/smt-gst.nsf/en/sf01016e.html|archivedate=12 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often use similar frequencies (26 to 28&amp;nbsp;MHz) and have similar uses, and similar technical standards. Although licenses may be required, eligibility is generally simple. Some countries also have personal radio services in the UHF band, such as the European [[PMR446]] and the Australian [[UHF CB]].

====Origins====

[[File:QSL KHI-6261.jpg|thumb|right|A QSL card issued by a US CB station in 1963.]]
The citizens band radio service originated in the United States as one of several personal radio services regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). These services began in 1945 to permit citizens a radio band for personal communication (e.g., radio-controlled model airplanes and family and business communications). In 1948, the original CB radios were designed for operation on the 460–470&amp;nbsp;MHz UHF band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocom.com/wtcollect/27_megacycle_history_in_the_u.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128232848/http://retrocom.com/wtcollect/27_megacycle_history_in_the_u.htm |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }} 27 Megacycle History, retrieved 2010 Feb 9&lt;/ref&gt; There were two classes of CB radio: "A" and "B". Class B radios had simpler technical requirements, and were limited to a smaller frequency range. [[Alfred J. Gross|Al Gross]] established the Citizens Radio Corporation during the late 1940s to manufacture Class B handhelds for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Kneitel (1988:13)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultra-high frequency]] (UHF) radios, at the time, were neither practical nor affordable for the average consumer. On September 11, 1958&lt;ref&gt;Kneitel (1988:14)&lt;/ref&gt; the Class D CB service was created on 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, and this band became what is popularly known today as "Citizens Band". There were only 23 channels at the time; the first 22 were taken from the former [[amateur radio service]] 11-meter band, and channel 23 was shared with radio-controlled devices. Some hobbyists continue to use the designation "11 meters" to refer to the Citizens Band and adjoining frequencies. [[Part 95]] of the Code of Federal Regulations regulates the Class D CB service, on the 27&amp;nbsp;MHz band, since the 1970s and continuing today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/62bRm7l4h?url=http://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=135&amp;tn=472290 FCC Part 95 Overview] Retrieved 2011-10-21.
&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 460–470&amp;nbsp;MHz band was reassigned for business and public-safety use; Class A CB is the forerunner of the [[General Mobile Radio Service]] (GMRS). Class B CB is a more distant ancestor of the [[Family Radio Service]]. The [[Multi-Use Radio Service]] is another two-way radio service in the [[Band III|VHF high band]]. An unsuccessful petition was filed in 1973 to create a Class E CB service at 220&amp;nbsp;MHz, which was opposed by amateur radio  organizations&lt;ref&gt;In the Americas, the [[1.25 meters|220 MHz]] band is used by ham operators&lt;/ref&gt; and others. There are several other classes of personal radio services for specialized purposes (such as [[remote control]] devices).

During the 1960s, the service was popular among small businesses (e.g., electricians, plumbers, carpenters), [[truck driver]]s and radio hobbyists. By the late 1960s advances in [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] electronics allowed the weight, size, and cost of the radios to fall, giving the public access to a communications medium previously only available to specialists.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; CB clubs were formed; a [[CB slang]] language evolved alongside [[ten-code|10-codes]], similar to those used in [[emergency service]]s.

After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the U.S. government imposed a [[National Maximum Speed Law|nationwide 55 mph speed limit]], and fuel shortages and rationing were widespread. CB radio was used (especially by [[truck driver|truckers]]) to locate service stations with better supplies of fuel, to notify other drivers of [[speed traps]], and to organize blockades and convoys in a 1974 strike protesting the new speed limit and other trucking regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19750216&amp;id=qm0fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZtUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=841,5104091&amp;hl=en|title=The Southeast Missourian - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radios were crucial for independent truckers; many were paid by the mile, which meant their productivity was impacted by the 55-mph speed limit.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[The Independent Institute]]|work=Independent Review|year=2011|volume=15|issue=3|title="I Can't Drive 55": the economics of the CB radio phenomenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of CB radios in 1970s films such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977), ''[[Breaker! Breaker!]]'' (1977) and ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), popular [[novelty song]]s such as [[C.W. McCall]]'s "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]" (1975),&lt;ref name="Novelty songs"&gt;Novelty songs praising CB in 1975/1976 were:
* [[C.W. McCall]]'s "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]" (1975) which climbed to Number One in the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in January 1976, to #2 in the UK Charts during the spring of 1976, and inspiring the 1978 film of the same name.
* "[[The White Knight (Cledus Maggard song)|The White Knight]]", a novelty [[country music]] song made famous by [[Jay Huguely]], who — recording as Cledus Maggard &amp; The Citizen's Band — enjoyed a brief run of national popularity with the song when it became popular in [[1976 in country music|1976]].
* In the UK, [[BBC Radio One]] [[dj]]'s [[Dave Lee Travis]] and [[Paul Burnett]] covered the song "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]" with an altered UK applying song text, released as ''Convoy GB'' under the moniker name [[Laurie Lingo &amp; the Dipsticks]], chart-peaking at #4  in the spring of 1976.

Originally, CB (named Citizens Radio by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] as of 1972) required a purchased license ($20 in the early 1970s, reduced to $4 on March 1, 1975) and the use of a [[callsign (radio)|callsign]]; however, when the CB craze was at its peak many people ignored this requirement and invented their own nicknames (known as "handles").  Rules on authorized use of CB radio (along with lax enforcement) led to widespread disregard of the regulations (notably in [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] height, distance communications, licensing, call signs and transmitter power).

[[File:Citizens Radio License 1972.jpg|thumb|Image of Citizens Radio license 1972 issued by the United States Federal Communication Commission.]]

[[Betty Ford]], the former [[First Lady of the United States]], used the CB handle "First Mama".&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, Michael, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/us/31betty.html Back in View, a First Lady With Her Own Legacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216222605/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/us/31betty.html |date=2016-12-16 }}", The New York Times, 31 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Voice actor [[Mel Blanc]] was also an active CB operator, often using [[Bugs Bunny|"Bugs"]] or [[Daffy Duck|"Daffy"]] as his handle and talking on the air in the [[Los Angeles]] area in one of his many voice characters. He appeared in an interview (with clips having fun talking to children on his home CB radio station) in the ''NBC Knowledge'' television episode about CB radio in 1978. Similar to internet [[chat room]]s a quarter-century later, CB allowed people to get to know one another in a quasi-anonymous manner.

Originally, there were 23 CB channels in the U.S.; the 40-channel band plan was implemented in 1977.  Additionally, there were two more channels between 22 &amp; 23, commonly referred to as 22A &amp; 22B.  Several people had 22A, but not many had 22B.  In the early 1970s Radio Shack sold a "base station" CB radio that contained a crystal for each of the 23 channels, two extra slots existed, and you could order the 22A &amp; 22B crystals for an easy plug-in. Channel 9 was officially reserved for emergency use by the FCC in 1969.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Chilton (1977:12)&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 10 was originally often used for highway travel communications east of the [[Mississippi River]], and channel 19 west of the Mississippi; channel 19 then became the preferred highway channel in most areas, as it did not have [[adjacent-channel interference]] problems with channel 9. Many CBers called channel 19 "the trucker's channel". Channel 11 was originally restricted by the FCC for use as the calling channel.

The original FCC output power limitation for CB radios was "5 watts DC input to the final amplifier stage", which was a reference to the earlier radios equipped with tubes.  With solid state radios becoming more common in the 1970s, this specification was rewritten by the FCC at the same time the authorized channels were increased to 40.  The current specification is simply "4 watts output (AM) or 12 watts output (SSB)" as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio.  The old specification was often used in false advertising by some manufacturers who would claim their CB radios had "5 watts" long after the specification had changed to 4 watts output.  The older 23-channel radios built under the old specifications typically had an output of around 3.5 to 3.8 watts output when measured at the antenna connector.  The FCC simply rounded up the old "5 watts DC input to the final amplifier stage" specification to the new "4 watts output as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio", resulting in a far simpler and easier specification.

Initially, the FCC intended for CB to be the "poor man's business-band radio", and CB regulations were structured similarly to those regulating the [[business band]] radio service.  Until 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Chilton (1977:14)&lt;/ref&gt; only channels 9-14 and 23&lt;ref&gt;Channels 10-14 and 23, after channel 9 was reserved for emergency use&lt;/ref&gt; could be used for "interstation" calls (to other licensees). Channels 1-8 and 15-22 were reserved for "intrastation" communications (among units with the same license).&lt;ref&gt;The terms "interstation" and "intrastation" appear in the FCC's Part 95 rules from that time period.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the inter-station/intra-station rule was dropped, channel 11 was reserved as a calling frequency (for the purpose of establishing communications); however, this was withdrawn in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Chilton (1977:120)&lt;/ref&gt; During this early period, many CB radios had "inter-station"  channels colored on their dials, while the other channels were clear or normally colored (except channel 9, which was usually colored red).  It was common for a town to adopt an inter-station channel as its "home" channel. This helped prevent overcrowding on Channel 11, enabling a CBer to monitor a town's home channel to contact another CBer from that town instead of a making a general call on Channel 11.

====Boating and the U.S. Coast Guard====

Since CB was coming down in price and [[Marine VHF radio|VHF Marine Band]] was still expensive, many boaters put CB radios on their boats. Business caught on to this market, and introduced marine CBs containing a weather band (WX). There was a lot of controversy about whether or not the Coast Guard should monitor CB radio, but they did, using Motorola base stations installed at their search and rescue stations. The Coast Guard stopped this practice in the late 1980s and recommends VHF Marine Band radios for boaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Information for Boaters|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtBoater|publisher=United States Coast Guard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614020205/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtBoater|archivedate=2011-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Present day usage}}21st-century use====

CB has lost much of its original appeal due to development of [[mobile phones]], the [[internet]] and the [[Family Radio Service]]. Changing [[radio propagation]] for long-distance communications due to the 11-year [[sunspot cycle]] is a factor at these frequencies. In addition, CB may have become a victim of its own popularity; with millions of users on a finite number of frequencies during the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, channels often were noisy and communication difficult. This caused a waning of interest among hobbyists. Business users (such as tow-truck operators, plumbers and electricians) moved to the VHF and UHF business-band frequencies. The business band requires an FCC license, and usually results in an assignment to a single frequency. The advantages of fewer users sharing a frequency, greater authorized output power, clarity of [[Frequency modulation|FM]] transmission, lack of interference by distant stations due to "skip" propagation, and consistent communications made the VHF ([[Very high frequency|Very High Frequency]]) radio an attractive alternative to the overcrowded CB channels.

Channel 9 is restricted by the FCC to only emergency communications and roadside assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/citizens-band-cb-service|title=Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS)|author=|date=4 August 2011|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204202207/https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/citizens-band-cb-service|archivedate=4 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most highway travelers monitor channel 19. CB radio is still used by truck drivers, and remains an effective means of obtaining information about road construction, accidents and [[Speed limit enforcement|police speed traps]].

===Australia===
Before CB was authorized in Australia, there were hand-held 27&amp;nbsp;MHz "walkie-talkies" which used several frequencies between the present CB channels, such as 27.240&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.bigpond.net.au/acrm/histpref.html ACRM: CB Radio History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917214644/http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/acrm/histpref.html |date=2006-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.16384620:STANDARD::pc=PC_293|title=ACMA: 27 MHz Handphone Stations Class Licence|author=|date=|website=acma.gov.au|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1970s, hobbyists were experimenting with handheld radios and unauthorized 23-channel American CB radios. At that time in Australia, the 11-meter band was still used by licensed ham operators and Emergency Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.bigpond.net.au/acrm/histmovt.html#1975 ACRM: Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917215924/http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/acrm/histmovt.html |date=2006-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet available for CB use. A number of CB clubs had formed by this time which assigned call signs to members, exchanged [[QSL card]]s, and lobbied for the legalisation of CB. In late 1977, having legalised Australian CB and allowed the import/sale of American and Japanese 23-channel sets, the Federal Government drafted new interim regulations for Australian 18-channel transceivers. The new RB249 regulations came in on January 1, 1978 and the last official registration date for 23-channel sets was January 31, 1978. After this date, use of unregistered 23-channel CB sets was deemed illegal and unlicensed sets were no longer be eligible to be licensed. The 18-channel band plan used 16 channels of the 23 channel CB radios plus 2 extra channels, namely 27.095 and 27.195, to make up the 18 channels. The original channels 1,2,3,4,10,21 and 23 were deleted from the 18-channel band plan. So channel 1 on an 18 channel was actually channel 5 on a 23-channel radio.&lt;ref&gt;These roughly corresponded to the present channels 5–22, except for the two unique frequencies that are known as 11A (Channel 7 on an 18 channel Australian CB) and 19A (Channel 16 on an 18-channel Australian CB) or remote control frequencies but are no longer part of the Australian 27 MHz CB band since 40 Channels was introduced. See [http://acbro.org/ozchannels.htm ACBRO: "Aussie" 18-Channel Radio Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040113190735/http://www.acbro.org/ozchannels.htm |date=2004-01-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1982, the American 40-channel band plan was adopted.

From the outset, the government attempted to regulate CB radio with license fees and call signs, but eventually they abandoned this approach. Enthusiasts rushed for licences when the doors opened at post offices around Australia in mid-1977 and by the end of the first quarter of 1978 there had been an estimated 200,000 licences issued (Australia's Population in 1978 was 14.36 Million). The regulations called for one licence per CB radio. The price for a licence in 1977 was AU$25 Per Year (In mid 1977 the Australian Dollar exchange rate was AU 90 cents to US $1), a not insubstantial amount for the average Australian wage-earner. Australian CB radio uses AM, USB, and LSB modes (No FM) on 27MHz, allowed output power being 4 Watts AM and 12 Watts SSB. UHF is 477 MHz, with an output power of 5 Watts. When CB was first legalised the 27&amp;nbsp;MHz CB Band was intended to be closed to Australian CBers in 1982 and only the 477 MHz UHF band was to continue, but this did not eventuate. The first 477MHz CB radio in 1977 was designed and made in Australia by Philips and was a 40 channel CB called the FM320. 27&amp;nbsp;MHz CB Channel Allocation in Australia is Channel 8 (27.055&amp;nbsp;MHz) Truckies or Highway Channel, Channel 9 (27.065&amp;nbsp;MHz) Emergency, Channel 11 (27.085&amp;nbsp;MHz) AM Call Channel, Channel 16 (27.155&amp;nbsp;MHz) LSB SSB Call Channel, 35 (27.355&amp;nbsp;MHz) LSB 2nd SSB Call Channel. UHF CB Channel Allocation is Channel 5 Emergency, Channel 11 Call Channel, Channel 40 Truckies or Highway. (NOTE: Australians refer to heavy transport drivers as "Truckies", a local variation of the American term "Truckers". Aussie "Truckies" generally shied away from using the much-cliched American CB language and codes, glamorised in movies and popular US folk lore.)

The first CB club in Australia was the Charlie Brown Touring Car Club (CBTCC){{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, which formed in [[Morwell, Victoria]] in 1967 and consisted mainly of [[four-wheel drive]] enthusiasts. The club used the prefix "GL" (for [[Gippsland]]), since "CB" could not be used. After July 1, 1977, the club changed its name to Citizens Band Two Way Communication Club (CBTCC).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other early clubs were "LV" ([[Latrobe Valley]]) and "WB" (named after Wayne Britain). Members of these clubs are still active, and have also become [[amateur radio operator]]s. Other regional Australian cities which became CB radio "hotspots" were cities such as Seymour, Benalla, Holbrook and Gundagai, all located on the busy Hume Highway between Melbourne and Sydney. Other regional cities such as Bendigo, Mildura, Mount Gambier and Port Augusta, developed lively, colourful CB radio communities.

With the introduction of [[UHF CB]] radios in 1977, many operators used both UHF and HF radios and formed groups to own and operate local FM repeaters. Members of the CBTCC formed what became known as Australian Citizens Radio Movement (ACRM) in the early 1970s; this organization became the voice for legalization of CB radio throughout Australia. After peaking in the 1970s and early 1980s, the use of 27&amp;nbsp;MHz CB in Australia has fallen dramatically due to the introduction of 477&amp;nbsp;MHz [[UHF CB]] (with FM and repeaters) and the proliferation of cheap, compact handheld UHF transceivers. Technology such as mobile telephones and the internet have provided people with other choices for communications. The Australian government has changed the allocation of channels available for UHF CB Radio from 40 to 80, and doubled the number of repeater channels from 8 to 16.  This was done by taking the existing channels that had a spacing of 25&amp;nbsp;kHz between (Known as wide band) them and placing new channels in between the old 40 channels. So now the channels have 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between them (now called narrow band). But the original 40 channels are still on the original frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;for more information visit http://www.uhfcb.com.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508232930/http://www.uhfcb.com.au/ |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia also has Marine Radio Using 27&amp;nbsp;MHz.
There are several frequencies allocated to 27&amp;nbsp;MHz Marine Radio in Australia. The frequencies range from 27.6800&amp;nbsp;MHz to 27.9800&amp;nbsp;MHz. Mode:AM  Power:4W Maximum. These Frequencies and Allocation are:

27.6800 Ch 68 - Commercial calling and working
27.7200 Ch 72 - Professional fishing calling and working (ship-shore/ship-ship)
27.8200 Ch 82 - Professional fishing calling and working (ship-shore/ship-ship)
27.8600 Ch 86 - Supplementary distress, safety and calling
27.8800 Ch 88 - Distress, safety and calling
27.9000 Ch 90 - Non-commercial calling and working (ship-shore)
27.9100 Ch 91 - Non-commercial calling and working (ship-shore)
27.9400 Ch 94 - Non-commercial club calling and working (ship-ship/ship-shore)
27.9600 Ch 96 - Non-commercial calling and working (ship-ship)
27.9800 Ch 98 - Rescue calling and working (ship-ship/ship-shore)

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the General Radio Service uses the identical frequencies and modes as the United States citizens band, and no special provisions are required for either Canadians or Americans using CB gear while traveling across the border. The General Radio Service was authorized in 1962. Initially, CB channels 1 through 3 remained allocated to amateur radio and channel 23 was used by [[pager|paging services]]. American CB licensees were initially required to apply for a temporary license to operate in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Matt P. Spinello, ''Touring Canada With Your CB Rig'', in ''Elementary Electronics'' magazine, Davis Publications, New York;  Volume 10 No. 2, July/August 1972, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1977, the service was expanded to the same 40 channels as the American service.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada Department of Communications, "[http://www.spectralumni.ca/Brochures/TRC-40.pdf TRC 40: Licensing of General Radio Service Equipment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203636/http://www.spectralumni.ca/Brochures/TRC-40.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}'', January 1, 1977;   retrieved 3 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]], CB radios were first introduced about 1977 when some transceivers were imported illegally from Australia, Japan and the United States. The dates are hard to confirm accurately, but early use was known around large cities such as [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Medan]]. The Indonesian government legalized CB on 6 October 1980 with a decision by the Minister of Communications, the "Ministerial Decree on the Licensing for the Operation of Inter-Citizens Radio Communication". Because many people were already using 40-channel radios prior to legalization, the American band plan (with AM and SSB) was adopted; a [[Personal radio service#Indonesia|VHF band]] was added in 1994, along with allowing use of the Australian [[UHF CB]] channel plan at 476-477&amp;nbsp;MHz On November 10, 1980, the Indonesian Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications issued another decree establishing RAPI (''Radio Antar Penduduk Indonesia'') as the official citizens band radio organization in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbradio.idxc.org/ Indonesian DX Club: CB Radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202205052/http://cbradio.idxc.org/ |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, citizens band radios became legal when the "Notification of Issuance Of Class Assignments" by Communication and Multimedia Malaysia was published on 1 April 2000. Under this class assignment, a CB radio is classified as a "Personal Radio Service device". The frequency band is HF, 26.9650&amp;nbsp;MHz to 27.4050&amp;nbsp;MHz (40 channels), power output is 4 watts for AM and FM and 12 watts PEP for SSB. Channel 9 is reserved for emergencies, and channel 11 is a calling channel. On UHF 477&amp;nbsp;MHz, citizens band PRS radio devices are allowed 5 watts power output on FM on 39 assigned channels spaced at 12.5-kHz intervals between 477.0125&amp;nbsp;MHz and 477.4875&amp;nbsp;MHz. Channel 9 is reserved for emergencies, and channel 11 for calling.  A short-range [[Simplex communication|simplex]] radio communications service for recreational use is from 477.5250–477.9875&amp;nbsp;MHz FM mode with 38 channels and a power output of 500&amp;nbsp;mW. A CB radio or Personal Radio Service Device under Class Assignment does not need an individual license to operate in Malaysia if it adheres to the rules of the ''Warta Kerajaan Malaysia'', Communication and Multimedia Act 1998 (Act 588), Notification of Issuance Of Class Assignment, P.U.(B)416 Jil. 48, No. 22(e) Personal Radio Service Device, 1 November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skmm.gov.my/link_file/registers/cma/ClassAssignment/pdf/Class%20Assign-BI-register.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130012827/http://skmm.gov.my/link_file/registers/cma/ClassAssignment/pdf/Class%20Assign-BI-register.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2010 the MCMC (Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission) released a new Notification of Issuance of Class Assignments, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 Class Assignments No. 1 of 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sppd.skmm.gov.my/skmmgovmy/files/attachments/CA_01_April_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235306/http://sppd.skmm.gov.my/skmmgovmy/files/attachments/CA_01_April_2010.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skmm.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf/Class-Assignment-No-1-of-2017.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235218/https://www.skmm.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf/Class-Assignment-No-1-of-2017.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This includes a new UHF PMR 446&amp;nbsp;MHz allocation: an eight-channel [[Analog signal|analog]] Personal Mobile Radio 446&amp;nbsp;MHz (Analog PMR446) with frequencies from 446.00625–446.09375&amp;nbsp;MHz (12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing) FM with 0.5 watt power output, and 16 channels for [[Digital signal (signal processing)|Digital]] Personal Mobile Radio 446&amp;nbsp;MHz (Digital PMR 446). Frequencies for Digital PMR 446 are from 446.103125–446.196875&amp;nbsp;MHz with 6.25&amp;nbsp;kHz [[channel spacing]] in 4FSK mode and a power output of 0.5 watt.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|CB radio in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, small but growing numbers of people were illegally using American CB radios during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The prominence of CB radio grew in Britain partly due to the popularity of novelty songs like CW McCall's "Convoy" and Laurie Lingo &amp; The Dipsticks' "Convoy GB" in 1976 (both of which were Top 5 hits)&lt;ref name="Novelty songs" /&gt; and the movie ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' in 1978. CB radio use was even featured on one part of the popular television programme ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''. By 1980, CB radio was becoming a popular pastime in Britain; as late as the summer of 1981 the British government was still saying that CB would never be legalized on 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, proposing a UHF service around 860&amp;nbsp;MHz called "Open Channel" instead. However, in November 1981 (after high-profile public demonstrations) 40 frequencies unique to the UK, known as the [[27 MHz CB27/81 Bandplan|27/81 Bandplan]] using FM were allocated at 27&amp;nbsp;MHz plus 20 channels on 934&amp;nbsp;MHz (934.0125 to 934.9625&amp;nbsp;MHz with 50-kHz-spacing). CB's inventor, [[Alfred J. Gross|Al Gross]], made the ceremonial first legal British CB call from [[Trafalgar Square]] in London.

The maximum power allowable on the MPT 1320 27/81 system was 4 watts (in common with the American system), although initially radios were equipped to reduce output power by 10 [[Decibel|dB]] (to 0.4 watts) if the antenna was mounted more than 7 meters above ground level. The power-reduction switch is also useful in reducing [[Electromagnetic interference|TV interference]]. MPT 1320 also restricted antennas to a maximum length of 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters, with base loading being the only type permitted for 27&amp;nbsp;MHz operation. Over the next several years antenna regulations were relaxed, with antenna length increasing to 1.65 meters and centre- or top-loading of the main radiating element permitted. On September 1, 1987 the UK added the usual 40 frequencies (26.965–27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz) used worldwide, for a total of 80 channels at 27&amp;nbsp;MHz; antenna regulations were further relaxed, and the 934&amp;nbsp;MHz band was withdrawn in 1998.

CB radio in the UK was deregulated in December 2006 by the regulatory body [[Ofcom]], and CB radio in the UK is now license-free. The old MPT 1320 27/81 band will continue to be available for the foreseeable future. On 27 June 2014, changes were made by Ofcom to allow the use of AM &amp; SSB modes on CB in the UK legally for the first time. The rules regarding non-approved radios and power levels above 4 watts on AM/FM and 12 W on SSB still apply, despite deregulation. Persons using illegal equipment or accessories still risk prosecution, fines or confiscation of equipment, although this is rarely enforced. AM and SSB on the freeband and amplifier use are common among enthusiasts. [[Packet radio]] is legal in the UK, although not widely used. Internet gateway stations are also beginning to appear; although illegal on 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, these units are connected to other CB stations around the world.

Although the use of CB radios in the UK is limited they are still popular, especially with the farming community, truckers and mini-cab services.&lt;ref&gt;Finlo Rohrer (August 14, 2006). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4789887.stm Over and out?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904005853/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4789887.stm |date=2011-09-04 }}" ''BBC News Magazine''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The widely used channel for the [[National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs|Young Farmers' Club]] is channel 11. The normal calling and truckers' channel is channel 19, although many truck organisations and groups use other channels to avoid abuse.

==Frequency allocations==
CB radio is not a worldwide, standardized radio service. Each country decides if it wants to authorize such a radio service from its domestic frequency authorizations, and what its standards will be; however, similar radio services exist in many countries. Frequencies, power levels and modes (such as [[frequency modulation]] (FM), [[amplitude modulation]] (AM), and [[single-sideband modulation]] (SSB), often vary from country to country; use of foreign equipment may be illegal. However, many countries have adopted the American channels and their associated frequencies, which is generally in AM mode except some higher channels which are sometimes in SSB mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Citizens Band (CB) Scanner Frequencies and Radio Frequency Reference|url = http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=7731|website = www.radioreference.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150914173859/http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=7731|archivedate = 2015-09-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate channels ===
When looking at the FCC/CEPT channel list there are some channels with an offset of 20&amp;nbsp;kHz instead of the regular 10&amp;nbsp;kHz step. These intermediate frequencies are reserved for the Radio Control Radio Service (RCRS) (formerly known as the Class C Citizens Radio Service until the 1976 changes). The RCRS service is commonly used for remote control of model aircraft and boats. It is an unofficial practice to name these channels by their next lower standard channel number along with an "A". Specifically channel 11A is used to power [[Eurobalise]]s.

=== SSB usage ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[Single-sideband modulation|Single-sideband]] (SSB) operation involves the selection of either the Lower Side Band (LSB) or the Upper Side Band (USB) mode for transmit and receive.  SSB radios also have the standard AM mode for communicating with standard CB radio models. With the original 23&amp;nbsp;CB channels SSB stations commonly used channel&amp;nbsp;16, to avoid interference to those using [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] (SSB stations are authorized to use 12&amp;nbsp;watts, as opposed to 4&amp;nbsp;watts for AM stations) and to more easily locate other SSB stations. With the FCC authorization of 40 channels, SSB operation shifted to channels&amp;nbsp;36–40. Channel&amp;nbsp;36 (or 38 for LSB) became the unofficial SSB "calling channels" for stations seeking contacts, with the subsequent conversation moving to channels&amp;nbsp;37–40. CBers with AM-only radios are asked to not use channels&amp;nbsp;36 through 40. In return, SSB stations stay off the remaining 35&amp;nbsp;channels so they could be used by AM stations. This agreement provides interference-free operation for all operators by separating the far more powerful SSB stations from the AM stations. This solution also resolves the confusion created by the false advertising that SSB radios have 120&amp;nbsp;channels compared to only 40 for AM radios.

While a SSB radio has three possible "modes" (AM, LSB, USB) it can operate in, operation is still limited to the same 40&amp;nbsp;channels. Some manufacturers tried to sell more radios by claiming that with three different modes possible for each channel, it was the equivalent to 120&amp;nbsp;channels.  Reality is far different: Attempting an SSB conversation while an AM conversation is in progress results in jammed communications for everyone. In general, each channel can only support one AM conversation and no others; if no AM conversation is in progress, two SSB conversations can share one channel without interference if one is in LSB and the other in USB mode. For a particular conversation, everyone must be tuned to the same channel and same mode in order to talk with each other.

=== Country-specific variations ===
{{Main article|Personal radio service}}

The [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations]] (CEPT) adopted the North American channel assignments, except channel nº 23, frequency 27.235&amp;nbsp;MHz; channel nº 24, frequency 27.245&amp;nbsp;MHz; channel nº 25, frequency 27.255&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="legifrance.gouv.fr"/&gt; However, legal CB equipment sold in Europe does follow the North American channel designation. Some member countries permit additional modes and frequencies; for example, [[Germany]] has 40 additional channels at 26&amp;nbsp;MHz for a total of 80. The [[United Kingdom]] has an additional 40 channels between 27.60125 and 27.99125&amp;nbsp;MHz, also making 80 in total. Before CEPT, most member countries used a subset of the 40 US channels.

In [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] the channels are shifted 5&amp;nbsp;kHz down; for example, channel 30 is 27.300&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Many operators add a switch to change between the "zeroes" (the Russian/Polish channel assignment) and the "fives" (the international/European assignment). Most contemporary radios for that markets can do "fives" as well as "zeroes" out of the box.  Since roughly 2005–2006, Russia and Poland have adopted use of the standard US channel offset as well as the older channel plan, for two overlapping "grids" of channels.

Russia uses an alphanumeric designation for their CB channel plans, due the fact that several "grids" or "bands" of 40 channels each are used, along with both AM and FM mode.  Russian CB allocations follow the CB band 26.965 – 27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz (designated as band C), as well as 26.515 – 26.955&amp;nbsp;MHz (designated as band B) and 27.415 – 27.855&amp;nbsp;MHz (designated as band D).  Some radios refer to the "mid band" (standard CB band) as "band D" which shifts the letters up one (making 26.515 to 26.955&amp;nbsp;MHz "band C" and 27.415 – 27.855&amp;nbsp;MHz "band E".

For the convenience of users of the grid were marked by letters. Classic is considered the marking when the main range is designated "C" letter. The most common description of the channel is considered to be similar to the following: (C9FM or C9EFM or C9EF or 9EF).

In it:
* the first letter ( "C") is indicated by a grid that contains a set of 40 channels. If the first letter is not specified, it is considered that it is ( "C"). For example, (C9EF, 9EF)
* hereinafter ( "9") – the channel number. Sometimes less than 10 channels are designated 2 digits. For example, (C9EF, C09EF)
* behind it – an optional designation ( «E») for "European" or mandatory ( «R») for "Russian" size frequency nets. For example, (C9EF, C9F, C9RF)
* end – the used modulation ( «FM») or ( «F»), ( « AM») or ( «A»). e.g. (C9EFM, C9EF, C9EAM, C9EA )

An example of correct designations: C9EF, C9EA, C9RF, C9RA

The 25 – 30&amp;nbsp;MHz band (including the CB allocations and frequencies above and below the 26.5 – 27.860&amp;nbsp;MHz band) is heavily used for taxi cab and other mobile two-way communications systems in Russia, Ukraine and other former USSR country states.

[[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]] have unique allocations that do not correspond to those of any other country. New Zealand authorizes use of their New Zealand specific 40-channel 26.330 – 26.770&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency plan in addition to the "standard" 40-channel 26.965 – 27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency plan for a total of 80 HF CB channels. New Zealand has also adopted the Australian UHF CB System as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhfcb.com.au/New-Zealand-PRS.php|title=UHF CB Australia - New Zealand PRS - News - Repeater Locations &amp; Information|author=|date=|website=www.uhfcb.com.au|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312193015/http://uhfcb.com.au/New-Zealand-PRS.php|archivedate=12 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's CB allocation consists of 8 voice and 2 R/C channels with a maximum power output of 500&amp;nbsp;mW.  AM mode is the only mode permitted and antennas must be non-removable and less than 199&amp;nbsp;cm (78 inches) long. In Japan, the 26 – 28&amp;nbsp;MHz range is allocated to fishery radio services and these frequencies are heavily used for marine communications.  Japan's "double side band fishery radio" or "DSB Fishery Radio Service" covers 26.760&amp;nbsp;MHz-26.944&amp;nbsp;MHz, 27.016&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 27.524-27.988&amp;nbsp;MHz.  However, frequencies such as 27.005&amp;nbsp;MHz AM are widely pirated in Japan with very high power transmitters.  This causes interference to the authorized low-power 1 W DSB (1 watt AM) fishery radio service.  Instead of 26 – 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, Japan has authorized several UHF-FM CB-type personal radio services in the 348&amp;nbsp;MHz, 420 – 422&amp;nbsp;MHz and 903 – 904&amp;nbsp;MHz bands.

[[Indonesia]] has the usual 40 channels at 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, plus a unique 60-channel allocation from 142.050&amp;nbsp;MHz – 143.525&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postel.go.id/content/ID/regulasi%5Cfrekuensi%5Ckepmen%5Ckm%20nomor%2077-2003%20krap.pdf An Indonesian government decision regarding CB, with frequency charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120224026/http://www.postel.go.id/content/ID/regulasi/frekuensi/kepmen/km%20nomor%2077-2003%20krap.pdf |date=2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], CB operators can use up to [[:pt:Serviço Rádio do Cidadão#Frequência e canalização|80 channels]] (from 26.965&amp;nbsp;MHz to 27.805&amp;nbsp;MHz).

[[South Africa]], like New Zealand and the UK, permits the use of two HF CB bands.  South Africa has a 23-channel AM/SSB 29&amp;nbsp;MHz CB allocation (called "29 Megs" or "29 MHz CB") from 29.710&amp;nbsp;MHz to 29.985&amp;nbsp;MHz in 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz steps.  South Africa also permits use of standard CB channels 19 through 27 (27.185 to 27.275&amp;nbsp;MHz) with AM/SSB permitted.  Many radios sold in South Africa feature both the 27&amp;nbsp;MHz and 29&amp;nbsp;MHz bands.  A license from [[ICASA]] is required to purchase or use a CB radio in South Africa.

[[Hungary]] allows use of the "low channels" for a total of 80 channels (26.515&amp;nbsp;MHz to 27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz).

[[Germany]] authorizes a similar allocation, with 40 channels from 26.965 to 27.405&amp;nbsp;MHz and another 40 channels from 26.565 to 26.955&amp;nbsp;MHz in straight 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps.

The [[Czech Republic]] authorizes 80 channels as well (same as the German 80 channel plan).  As in Germany, digital modes are allowed on certain frequencies (channel 24 – 27.235&amp;nbsp;MHz, channel 25 – 27.245&amp;nbsp;MHz, channel 52 – 26.675&amp;nbsp;MHz, channel 53 – 26.685&amp;nbsp;MHz, channel 76 – 26.915&amp;nbsp;MHz, and channel 77 – 26.925&amp;nbsp;MHz). [[Gateway (telecommunications)|Internet gateways]] and [[radio repeater]]s are allowed on channels 18 (27.175&amp;nbsp;MHz) and 23 (27.255&amp;nbsp;MHz).  Paging is permitted on channel 1 (26.965&amp;nbsp;MHz) and channel 80 (26.955&amp;nbsp;MHz) is the recommended call channel for Czech CB radio operators.

Using radios outside their intended market can be dangerous, as well as illegal, as frequencies used by Citizen's Band radios from other countries may operate on frequencies close to, or used by, emergency services (for example, the Indonesian service around 142&amp;nbsp;MHz operates on frequencies allocated to a public safety network shared with police, fire and EMS services in Ontario, Canada).

In the [[Philippines]], up to present time, the use of 27&amp;nbsp;MHz CB is still banned since the Marcos regime banned it in 1980s. A few operators still illegally utilize the 40 CB channels. There are active CB groups that are now asking Senator [[Bongbong Marcos]], the son of the late president [[Ferdinand Marcos]], to lift the ban and make the use of CB radios legal again.

=={{anchor|Usage today}}Current use==
CB was the only practical two‑way radio system for the individual consumer, and served several subsets of users such as truck drivers, radio hobbyists, and those in need of short‑range radio communications, such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters, who needed to communicate between job site and main office. While some users have moved on to other radio services, CB is still a popular [[hobby]] in many countries. The 27&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies used by CB, which require a relatively long aerial and tend to propagate poorly indoors, discourage the use of handheld radios. Many users of handheld radios (families, hunters and hikers) have moved on to 49&amp;nbsp;MHz and the UHF [[Family Radio Service]]; those needing a simple radio for professional use (e.g., tradesmen) have moved on to "dot-color" Business Band radios and the VHF [[Multi-Use Radio Service]].

CB is still popular among long-haul truck drivers to communicate directions, traffic problems and other relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Adams ''Trucking:Tractor-Trailer Driver Handbook/Workbook,'' page 558, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lg3rFnEkOPQC&amp;pg=PA558 the first DB radio]&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial "travelers channel" in most of the world is channel 19; in Australia it is channel 8 (27.055&amp;nbsp;MHz) and UHF channel 40 (477.400&amp;nbsp;MHz). In Russia it is channel 15 (in addition to traditional "emergency" 9 and "truckers" 19 channels) and in Greece it is channel 13, all AM. These frequencies may have evolved because tuned circuits (particularly antennas) work best in the middle of the band; the frequency for channel 19 (not channel 20) is the center of the 40-channel US band and other things being equal, signals will be transmitted and heard the farthest. Since less standardization exists in Europe, CB there is more associated with hobbyists than with truckers.

Legal (short‑range) use of CB radio is sometimes impeded by users of illegal high‑power transmitters, which can be heard hundreds of miles away. The other problem with short‑range CB use is propagation; during long‑range [[Skywave|"skip"]] conditions local signals are inaudible due to reception of multiple distant signals.

In the United States, the number of users and law enforcement financing by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] mean that only the worst offenders are sanctioned, which makes legitimate operation on the citizens band unreliable. Most offenders are not caught for interfering with other CB users; often, their self‑modified equipment generates [[harmonic]]s and [[Spurious tone|spurs]] which cause interference to services outside the citizens band and to consumer equipment.

The maximum legal CB power output level in the U.S. is 4 watts for AM (un-modulated carrier; modulation can be four times the carrier power, or 16 watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]]) and 12 watts for [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]], as measured at the transmitter antenna connection.  However, external [[linear amplifier]]s are often used illegally.

During the 1970s the FCC banned the sale of linear amplifiers capable of operation from 24 to 35&amp;nbsp;MHz to discourage their use on the CB band, although the use of high‑power amplifiers continued. Late in 2006, the FCC amended the regulation to exclude only 26 to 28&amp;nbsp;MHz to facilitate amateur 10-meter operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbradiosource.com/cb-info/archives#fccOmnibus|title="Omnibus" Amateur Radio Report and Order|author=|date=|website=cbradiosource.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813044934/http://cbradiosource.com/cb-info/archives#fccOmnibus|archivedate=13 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lax enforcement enables manufacturers of illegal linear amplifiers to openly advertise their products; many CB dealers include these amplifiers in their catalogs. Due to their rampant, unchecked use of linear amplifiers, American CB Radio operators are often referred to as "Alligators", by operators in other countries. (Suggesting American operators are "All Mouth and No Ears".) Attempts by law-abiding CB users to increase regulatory oversight have been ineffective.

==Technology==
At the beginning of the CB radio service, transmitters and receivers used [[vacuum tube]]s; solid-state transmitters were not widely available until 1965, after the introduction of RF-power [[transistor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/k5dh/raytheon/raytheon.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424214057/http://www.qsl.net/k5dh/raytheon/raytheon.html |archivedate=2010-04-24 |df= }} gives the history of one US manufacturer's line of CB equipment&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walkie-talkie]] hand-held units became affordable with the use of transistors. Early receivers did not cover all the channels of the service; channels were controlled by plug-in quartz [[crystal oscillator|crystals]], with one of several operating frequencies selected by a panel control in more expensive units. [[Superheterodyne]] receivers (using one or two conversion stages) were the norm in good-quality equipment, although low-cost toy-type units used [[Regenerative circuit#Super-regenerative receiver|super-regenerative]] receivers. With the earliest sets two quartz crystals were needed for transmitting and receiving on each channel, which was costly. By the mid-1960s "mixer" circuits made frequency-synthesized radios possible, which reduced cost and allowed full coverage of all 23 channels with a smaller number of crystals (typically 14). The next improvement came during the mid-1970s; crystal synthesis was replaced by [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]] technology using ICs, enabling 40-channel sets with only one crystal (10.240&amp;nbsp;MHz). Almost all were [[Amplitude modulation|AM]]-only, although there were a few [[single-sideband modulation|single sideband]] sets.

Most CB radios sold in the United States have the following features:
* Automatic noise limiter or [[noise blanker]]: Reduces background noise (such as spark ignition)
* CB/[[NOAA Weather Radio|WX]] switch: Selects weather-radio receiver
* [[Automatic level control]] (ALC): Limits the transmitter modulation level to reduce distortion
* [[Public address system|PA]]: Some transceivers can drive an external speaker and act as a low-power public address system, or "bullhorn".
* RF gain: Adjusts the RF amplifier gain of the receiver; used to reduce received background noise, and to reduce "clipping" due to over-amplification of already-strong signals (for example, when the receiver is near the transmitter)
* NOR/9/19: Quickly tunes preset channels for calling or emergency use
* [[Standing wave ratio|SWR]]: Meter used to monitor reflected power caused by [[Electrical length|mismatched antennas]] and [[Characteristic impedance|antenna cables]]
* Volume control

[[Microphone]] choices include:
* [[Microphone#Dynamic microphone|Dynamic microphone]]: Uses magnetic coil and permanent magnet
* Ceramic mic: Uses a [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] element; rugged, low-cost but high-[[Electrical impedance|impedance]]
* Echo mic: Deliberately introduces distortion and echo into transmitted audio
* [[Electret microphone]]: Uses an electrostatic method to convert sound to electrical signals
* [[Noise-canceling microphone]]: Uses two elements to reduce background noise
* Power mic: An amplified microphone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcompanydriver.com/cb-basics.htm NewCompanyDriver – Learn the basics of CB radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001182648/http://newcompanydriver.com/cb-basics.htm |date=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antennas==
[[File:CB antenna.jpg|thumb|left|Typical center-loaded mobile CB antenna. Note the [[loading coil]], which shortens the antenna's overall length.|alt=CB antenna with loading coil, mounted on pickup-truck metal tool box]]
27&amp;nbsp;MHz is a relatively long wavelength for mobile communications, and the choice of antenna has a considerable impact on the performance of a CB radio. A common mobile antenna is a quarter-wave vertical whip. This is roughly nine feet (2.7 m) tall; it is mounted low on the vehicle body, and often has a spring-and-ball mount to enhance its flexibility when scraping or striking overhead objects. Where a nine-foot whip is undesirable, shorter antennas include [[loading coil]]s to make the antenna impedance the same as a physically longer antenna.  The loading coil may be on the bottom, middle, or top of the antenna, while some antennas are wound in a continuously-loaded helix.

Many truckers use two co-phased antennas, mounted on their outside mirrors. Such an array is intended to enhance performance to the front and back, while reducing it to the sides (a desirable pattern for long-haul truckers). However, the efficiency of such an arrangement is only an improvement over a single antenna when the co-phased antennas are separated by approximately eight feet or more, restricting this design to use mainly on tractor-trailers and some full-size pickups and SUVs. Some operators will use only one of the two antennas; this removes both the complexity and benefit of a true co-phased array, but gives a symmetrical cosmetic appearance preferred by some truck drivers.

Another mobile antenna is the continuously-loaded half-wave antenna. These do not require a [[ground plane]] to present a near-50-[[ohm]] load to the radio, and are often used on fiberglass vehicles such as snowmobiles or boats. They are also useful in base stations where circumstances preclude the use of a ground-plane antenna. Handheld CBs may use either a telescoping center-loaded whip or a continuously-loaded "rubber ducky" antenna.

Base CB antennas may be vertical for omnidirectional coverage, or directional "beam" antennas may be used to direct communications to a particular region. Ground-plane kits exist as mounting bases for mobile whips, and have several wire terminals or hardwired ground radials attached. These kits are designed to have a mobile whip screwed on top (a full-length, quarter-wave steel whip is preferred) and mounted on a mast. The ground radials replace the vehicle body (which is the [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] for a mobile whip in a typical vehicle installation).

=={{anchor|Shooting skip}}Working skip==
{{Main article|Skywave}}
All frequencies in the [[high frequency|HF]] spectrum (3–30&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be refracted by charged ions in the [[ionosphere]]. Refracting signals off the ionosphere is called [[skywave]] propagation, and the operator is said to be "shooting skip". CB operators have communicated across thousands of miles and sometimes around the world. Even low-power 27&amp;nbsp;MHz signals can sometimes propagate over long distances.

The ability of the ionosphere to bounce signals back to earth is caused by solar radiation{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and the amount of ionization possible is related to the [[Solar cycle|11-year sunspot cycle]]. In times of high sunspot activity, the band can remain open to much of the world for long periods of time. During low sunspot activity it may be impossible to use skywave at all, except during periods of [[Sporadic E propagation|Sporadic-E propagation]] (from late spring through mid-summer). Skip contributes to noise on CB frequencies. In the United States, it is illegal to engage in (or attempt to engage in) CB communications with any station more than {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from an operator's location.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Part 95 Subpart D.&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction exists to keep CB as a local (line-of-sight) radio service; however, in the United States the restriction is widely ignored. The legality of shooting skip is not an issue in most other countries . A recent FCC decision now allows the shooting of skip in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01016.html#General|title=RIC-18 — General Radio Service (GRS)|first=Government of Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Spectrum, Information Technologies and|last=Telecommunications|date=|website=www.ic.gc.ca|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615020420/http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01016.html#General|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freebanding and export radios==
Operation on frequencies above or below the citizens band (on the "uppers" or "lowers") is called "freebanding" or "outbanding".&lt;ref&gt;The term "outbanding" was introduced by Kneitel in the August 1979 issue of S9 Magazine.(Kneitel 1988:165)&lt;/ref&gt;  While frequencies just below the CB segment (or between the CB segment and the amateur radio [[10-meter band]]) seem quiet and under-utilized, they are allocated to other radio services (including government agencies) and unauthorized operation on them is illegal. Furthermore, illegal transmitters and amplifiers may not meet good engineering practice for harmonic distortion or "[[Spectral splatter|splatter]]", which may disrupt other communications and make the unapproved equipment obvious to regulators. Freebanding is done with modified CB or amateur equipment, foreign CB radios which may offer different channels, or with radios intended for export. Legal operation in one country may be illegal in another; for example, in the UK until June 2014 only 80 FM channels were legal.

Unlike amateur radios with continuous frequency tuning, CBs manufactured for export are channelized. Frequency selection resembles that of modified American CBs more than any foreign frequency plan. They typically have a knob and display that reads up to channel 40, but include an extra band selector that shifts all 40 channels above or below the band and a "+10 kHz" button to reach the model control "A" channels. These radios may have 6 or even 12 bands, establishing a set of quasi-CB channels on many unauthorized frequencies. The bands are typically lettered A through F, with the normal citizens band as D.

For example, a freebander with an export radio who wants to use 27.635&amp;nbsp;MHz would choose channel 19 (27.185&amp;nbsp;MHz) and then shift the radio up one band (+450&amp;nbsp;kHz). It requires arithmetic on the part of the operator to determine the actual frequency, although more expensive radios include a [[frequency counter]] or a frequency display—two different components, providing an identical result. Illegal operations may unintentionally end up on frequencies very much in use. For instance, channel 19 shifted two bands up is 28.085&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is in a Morse code/data-only part of the 10-meter ham band. Voice transmissions in a Morse code-only segment are easily detectable by authorities.
Amateur Radio Service operators record, locate, and report frequency trespassing and intrusions of their government or ITU allocations by pirate transmissions or illegal operators to the FCC for enforcement action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/fcc-enforcement-1|title=FCC Enforcement|author=|date=|website=www.arrl.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910164423/http://www.arrl.org/fcc-enforcement-1|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freeband operators use [[amateur radio]]s modified to transmit out of band, which is illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s [[Yaesu FT-101]] was modified for CB by replacing a set of crystals used to tune portions of the 10-meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting above and below the legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels.&lt;ref&gt;(Kneitel 1988:174)&lt;/ref&gt; On some newer radios, the modification may be as simple as disconnecting a jumper wire or a diode. Many types of amateur transceivers may be found on CB and freeband, ranging from full-coverage HF transceivers to simpler [[10 meters|10-meter]] mobile radios. In the United States, the FCC bans the importation and marketing of radios it deems easily modifiable for CB;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swap.qth.com/fcc/fcc-cbtable2.htm|title=QTH.COM: FCC information regarding Illegal CB Radios|author=|date=|website=swap.qth.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109065038/https://swap.qth.com/fcc/fcc-cbtable2.htm|archivedate=9 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is illegal to transmit on CB frequencies with a ham radio except in emergencies where no other method of communication is available.

A [[gray market]] trade in imported CB gear exists in many countries. In some instances, the sale or ownership of foreign-specification CB gear is not illegal but its use is.  With the FCC's minimal enforcement of its CB rules, enthusiasts in the US use "export radios" or European [[frequency modulation]] (FM) CB gear to escape the crowded AM channels. American AM gear has also been exported to Europe.

"Export radios" are sold in the United States as [[10 meters|10-meter]] Amateur Radio transceivers. Marketing, import and sale of such radios is illegal if they are distributed as anything other than Amateur Radio transceivers. It is also illegal to use these radios outside of the Amateur Radio bands by anyone in the US, since they are not type-certified for other radio services and usually exceed authorized power limits. The use of these radios within the Amateur Radio Service by a licensed Amateur Radio operator within his/her license privileges is legal, as long as all FCC regulations for Amateur Radio are followed. The term "export radio" is a misnomer, since it implies that they cannot be used in the country in which they are sold and hints that the radio is legal in another country. However, the typical "export radio" has a combination of features, frequency coverage and output power which make it illegal worldwide; in reality, there is no country to which these radios may be legally exported.

==Callbook==
A callbook is a directory of radio station call signs. Originally a bound book that resembled a telephone directory, it contains the name and addresses of radio stations in a given jurisdiction (country). ''[[Modern Electrics]]'' published the first callbook in the United States in 1909. Today, the primary purpose of a callbook is to allow radio operators to send a confirmation post card, called a QSL card to an operator with whom they have communicated via radio. Callbooks have evolved to include on-line databases that are accessible via the Internet to instantly obtain the address of another amateur radio operator and their QSL Managers. The most well known and used on-line QSL database for the 11-meter/freebander community is QRZ11.COM, designed after its "big brother" [[QRZ.com]] for amateur radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~uparc/documents/First%20Annual%20Official%20Wireless%20Blue%20Book%20-%201909.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706002250/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~uparc/documents/First%20Annual%20Official%20Wireless%20Blue%20Book%20-%201909.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrz11.com|title=QRZ11|author=|date=|website=www.qrz11.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223052034/http://www.qrz11.com/|archivedate=23 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_highlights/2014_cq/2014_02_cq/CQ_2014_02_OPT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215042512/http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_highlights/2014_cq/2014_02_cq/CQ_2014_02_OPT.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qrz11.phpbb8.de/download/file.php?id=44&amp;sud=21333 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103528/http://qrz11.phpbb8.de/download/file.php?id=44&amp;sud=21333 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dx27.net/viewpage.php?page_id=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123935/http://www.dx27.net/viewpage.php?page_id=4 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugar-delta.it/site/index.php|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.sugar-delta.it|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927214446/http://www.sugar-delta.it/site/index.php|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
During the 1970s and 1980s heyday of CB radio, many citizens band-themed magazines appeared on newsstands. Two magazines that dominated the time period were S9 CB Radio and CB Radio Magazine. S9's successor was ''[[Popular Communications]]'', which had the same editor under a different publisher beginning in 1982. It covered hobby radio as well as CB. The same publisher produced a magazine called RADIO! for [[RadioShack]] stores in the mid-1990s. In Australia, CB Action Magazine was produced monthly from mid-1977 and continuing publication through until the early 1990s. CB Action spawned several other popular publications, including a communications and scanning magazine and the hugely popular Amateur Radio Action magazine, produced over several decades and running to some 18 volumes.

In the early 2000s, ''[[National Communications Magazine]]'' added CB radio coverage to its coverage of [[Scanner (radio)|scanner radios]] and to this day remains the only magazine covering CB radio in [[North America]].

'''''Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States''''', 318 U.S. 363 (1943), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that federal [[negotiable instruments]] were governed by federal law, and thus the federal court had the authority to fashion a [[federal common law|common law rule]].{{ref|citation}}

==Facts &amp; procedural history==
On April 28, 1936, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] mailed a [[Cheque|check]] for $24.20, drawn on the [[Treasurer of the United States]], to Clair Barner. The check was Barner's paycheck from the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Barner never received the check, which was stolen by an unknown party. The thief [[forgery|forged Barner's signature]] and cashed the check at the [[J.C. Penney]] department store in [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania]], where the thief [[Identity theft|assumed the identity]] of Mr. Barner. J.C. Penney then turned the check over to Clearfield Trust Co. as its collection agent. Clearfield Trust Co. collected the check from the [[Federal Reserve]] Bank, knowing nothing about the [[forgery]].

On May 10, 1936, Barner informed his supervisors at the WPA that he had not received his paycheck.  His complaint made its way up the chain of command, and on November 30, 1936, Barner signed an [[affidavit]] alleging that the endorsement of his name on the check was forged. Neither J.C. Penney Co. nor Clearfield Trust Co. had any notice of the forgery until January 12, 1937, when the U.S. government sent its first notice about it. The United States sent its initial request for reimbursement on August 31, 1937, and filed suit against Clearfield Trust Co. in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]] on November 16, 1939. The government based its [[cause of action]] on the express [[guaranty]] of prior endorsements by Clearfield Trust Co.

The District Court determined that the dispute should be governed by the state law of [[Pennsylvania]].  It then dismissed the government's complaint on grounds of [[Laches (equity)|laches]], holding that because the United States unreasonably delayed in notifying Clearfield Trust Co. of the forgery, it was barred from recovery.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] reversed the dismissal.

==Decision==
Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], writing for a unanimous United States Supreme Court, first distinguished the case from ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'', holding that because the U.S. government was exercising a [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]]-permitted function in disbursing its own funds and paying its [[debt]]s, the [[commercial paper]] it issues should be governed by federal law rather than state law. Thus, the [[Erie doctrine]] rule -- that a [[United States District Court]] must apply the law of the state in which it is sitting -- did not apply. In the absence of an applicable Act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], a federal court had the right to fashion a governing common law rule by its own standards.

While the Court's decision explicitly retained the option of applying state law in fashioning a federal common law rule, the Court chose instead to fashion its own rule based on prior decisions. Justice Douglas identified a major federal interest in permitting the Court to fashion its own rule: uniformity in dealing with the vast amount of [[negotiable instruments]] and [[commercial paper]] issued by the federal government. Douglas reasoned that if each transaction were subject to the application of a multiplicity of different state laws, confusion and uncertainty in the administration of federal programs would be the result.

Justice Douglas chose to follow the rule set forth in ''[[United States v. National Exchange Bank of Providence]]'', {{ussc|214|302|1909}}, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the U.S. government, “''as drawee of commercial paper stands in no different light than any other drawee''” and could recover on a check as a drawee from a person who had cashed a [[pension]] check with a forged endorsement, despite the government's protracted delay in giving notice of the forgery. The ''National Exchange Bank'' case held the government to conventional business terms, but said nothing about whether lack of prompt notice was a defense for nonpayment of a check. The Court held that the Pennsylvania state law -- requiring prompt notice from the drawee -- presumed injury to the defendant by the mere fact of delay. In this case, not only did Clearfield Trust Co. fail to demonstrate that it had suffered a loss because of the delay in notice, it could still recover the amount of the check from J.C. Penney, because none of its employees detected the fraud. The court chastised both companies for their "neglect and error" in accepting the forged check, and suggested that they should only be permitted to shift the loss to the drawee only when he can demonstrate that the delay in notice caused him damage.

}}

'''''Coleman v Power''''' (2004) 220 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 is a [[High Court of Australia]] case that deals with the [[implied freedom of political communication]] found in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]].

== Background ==
Coleman was a law and politics student from [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]]. He started handing out flyers in a shopping centre alleging [[police corruption]] in the Queensland police force. He was asked to stop by Power, a police officer, but refused. Coleman was subsequently arrested for insulting language, but violently resisted arrest. He was charged with using "insulting words" under the ''Vagrancy Act'' as well as assaulting and obstructing a police officer.

Coleman argued he was not guilty of using insulting words because they were political communication and thus protected under the implied freedom of political communication. A magistrate found him guilty, but he then appealed. All subsequent appeals failed to some extent. He then appealed to the High Court.

== Decision ==

The court held that his conviction under s7(1)(d) of the Vagrancy Act should be set aside but that the conviction for assaulting/obstructing a police officer should stand.

Gummow, Hayne and Kirby JJ held the impugned section of the VA to be valid, concluded that it would infringe the second limb of the [[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] test to the extent that it applied to political communication and read it down so that it did not. What Coleman said was not insulting as intended to be outlawed by the Act, they reasoned. They accepted that communications alleging corruption of police were protected by the implied right to freedom of political communication. They also accepted that political communication could include insults. Further, they noted that insulting words were a well-known tradition in Australian politics from "its earliest history".

McHugh J also held that the impugned section infringed the second limb of the [[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] test to the extent that it applied to political communication. Rather than read the section down, he declared it invalid altogether.

This meant that a 4-judge majority had ruled his conviction under the VA should be overturned. As the Act had been found valid by all except McHugh J, Coleman's convictions for assaulting/obstructing a police officer were not overturned.

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2005''' was the nineteenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], between 25 November and 27 November 2005, and hosted by [[Prime Minister of Malta|Prime Minister]] [[Lawrence Gonzi]].

Malta is the smallest country to have hosted a CHOGM, committing the country to a major undertaking.&lt;ref name="Malta Notebook"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |date=January 2006 |title=Malta Notebook |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=95 |issue=383 |pages=35–38 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530500505742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the event passed smoothly, marked by the visit of both [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Head of the Commonwealth]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[aircraft carrier]] and [[Royal Navy]] [[flagship]], [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS Ark Royal]].

==Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group==
The [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] (CMAG) put much emphasis on the position held by [[President of Pakistan|Pakistani President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]], and overcame opposition from [[Pakistan]] to declare that his holding the two positions of President and [[Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army|Chief of Army Staff]] were "incompatible with the basic principles of democracy and the spirit of the Harare Commonwealth principles" and that "until the two offices are separated, the process of democratization will not be irreversible".&lt;ref name="Malta Notebook" /&gt;

Of note to commentators and the media was the non-discussion of [[Uganda]],&lt;ref name="Malta Notebook" /&gt; where opposition leader [[Kizza Besigye]] was arrested days before the CHOGM, and two months before the country's first multiparty elections since [[Yoweri Museveni]] took power in 1986.  Uganda's capital, [[Kampala]], had been arranged to host the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007|2007 CHOGM]], and the Commonwealth leaders were keenly aware that to hold the CHOGM in a country that was deemed undemocratic would reflect badly on the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] and undermine the Commonwealth's commitment to human rights and good governance.&lt;ref name="Malta Notebook" /&gt;

CMAG membership rotated once again, with [[Malaysia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Lucia]], and the [[United Kingdom]] joining it, as the [[Bahamas]], [[India]], [[Samoa]], and [[Nigeria]] left.&lt;ref name="Malta Notebook" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16176">'''Conflict Armament Research''' (CAR) is a UK-based investigative organization that tracks the supply of conventional weapons, ammunition, and related military materiel (such as IEDs) into conflict-affected areas. Established in 2011, CAR specialises in working with governments to find out how weapons end up in war zones, and in the hands of terrorists and insurgent groups.

The group maintains the iTrace Global Weapon Reporting system, which is funded by the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1518089813376&amp;uri=CELEX:32017D2283|title=Council Decision (CFSP) 2017/2283|last=|first=|date=11 December 2017|work=europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government of Germany. CAR also provides technical support services including training and capacity-building.

==Areas of Work==

=== Investigations ===
CAR has worked in 27 conflict-affected countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1518089813376&amp;uri=CELEX:32017D2283|title=Annex - Council Decision 2017/2283|last=|first=|date=11 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams embed with national security and defence forces to document weapons at the point of use, and track their sources back through the chain of supply. Investigators photograph all markings and distinguishing characteristics, GPS-record all recovery sites and use in-field interviews with local stakeholders to build a case for each item documented. CAR does not rely on photographs sourced from social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/methodology/|title=Methodology|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All verified data is uploaded to CAR's iTrace system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itrace.conflictarm.com/Home/Login|title=iTrace|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is used to map the global chain of supply of arms, from the place of manufacture, to the point of capture or recovery.

=== iTrace ===
iTrace is a project funded by the EU and the Government of Germany. The iTrace system maps weapons data collected by the organization's field investigative teams. The database is "the world's largest public repository of diverted conventional weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1518089813376&amp;uri=CELEX:32017D2283|title=Annex, Council Decision 2017/2283|last=|first=|date=11 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; iTrace is designed to help national authorities to identify points and risks of diversion, and to generate map weapon flows.

=== Services ===
CAR provides technical, policy, and support services to governments, international, regional and non-governmental organizations. These services include: policy support for weapon marking, identification, and record-keeping; IED and UXO contamination mapping; guidance and training on arms management; and analytical input to international arms control processes such as the [[Arms Trade Treaty]] (ATT) and the [https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/salw/programme-of-action/ UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons] (PoA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/services/|title=Services|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting ==

===Iraq and Syria===
In December 2017, CAR published a report documenting more than 40,000 items recovered from Islamic State (IS) forces between 2014 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Weapons of the Islamic State|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group reported that the majority of arms and ammunition were originally made in China and Russia, with almost a third of recovered weapons having first been produced by EU member states that were former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/14/nearly-third-weapons-used-isil-battlefield-manufactured-eu-report/|title=Nearly a third of all weapons used by Isil on the battlefield were manufactured in EU, report claims|last=Ensor|first=Josie|date=14 December 2017|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these items had been re-exported by the US and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups before ending up in IS hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/14/politics/isis-weapons-report/index.html|title=Report details where ISIS gets its weapons|last=Crawford|first=Jamie|date=14 December 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAR found that one Bulgarian-made anti-tank missile sold to the US Army made its way to IS forces in just 59 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-uncovered/isis-weapons-arsenal-included-some-purchased-u-s-government-n829201?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma|title=ISIS weapons arsenal included some purchased by U.S. government|last=Joselow|first=Gabe|date=14 December 2017|website=NBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also found that IS "has been able to manufacture their own weapons and IEDs on an industrial scale thanks to a robust chain of supply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/14/politics/isis-weapons-report/index.html|title=Report details where ISIS gets its weapons|last=Crawford|first=Jamie|date=14 December 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish territory was the main, but not only, source of chemical explosive precursors for IEDs made by IS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/en-kapsamli-rapor-isidin-bomba-malzemelerinin-cogu-turkiyeden/|title=En kapsamlı rapor: IŞİD'in bomba malzemelerinin çoğu Türkiye'den|last=Eroglu|first=D.|date=14 December 2017|website=Diken|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAR has also documented attempts by IS forces to develop weaponised drones, including a visit to a drone workshop in Ramadi, Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/isil-ramps-fight-weaponised-drones-161231130818470.html|title=ISIL ramps up fight with weaponised drones|last=Beck|first=John|date=3 January 2017|website=Al Jazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Frontline Perspective: Islamic State's Weaponised Drones|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yemen ===
CAR has provided information on how rebel groups in Yemen are getting weapons, including assault rifles and anti-tank guided weapons that were seized from [[dhow]]s in February and March 2016 by [[United States Naval Forces Central Command|Combined Maritime Forces]], and that were "suspected to have originated in Iran and were destined for Somalia and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemen]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-officials-iran-supplying-weapons-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-n674181|title=U.S. Officials: Iran Supplying Weapons to Yemen's Houthi Rebels|last=Kube|first=C.|date=27 October 2016|website=NBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Maritime interdictions of weapon supplies to Somalia and Yemen|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=November 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, CAR reported on a remote-controlled 'drone boat' that had been reportedly seized in Yemen's coastal waters, providing a breakdown of how the water-borne IED had been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Frontline Perspectives: Anatomy of a drone boat|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan and South Sudan ===
Reports from CAR show that despite active UN and EU arms embargoes, the Sudanese government has continued to import military and dual-use goods, some of which it has used in the conflict in [[South Kordofan]] and Blue Nile state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Sudanese stockpiles and regional weapons diversion|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=May 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudan has used foreign imports to build up its own domestic production capabilities. CAR says that since 2014 newly-manufactured Sudanese military materiel has been found in the hands of armed groups in South Sudan, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Libya, Mali, and Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/05/24/sudan-accused-of-bypassing-arms-embargo-to-import-weapons|title=Sudan accused of bypassing arms embargo to import weapons|last=Smart-Abbey|first=N.A.|date=24 May 2017|website=africanews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 CAR reported that South Sudan's military has seized a stash of weapons that may have been supplied to a rebel group by [[Khartoum]], which says it is not involved in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/report-khartoum-possibly-arming-rebels-in-south-sudan/2804032.html|title=Report: Khartoum Possibly Arming Rebels in South Sudan|last=Joselow|first=Gabe|date=2 June 2015|work=Voice of America|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications|title=Weapons and Ammunition airdropped to SPLA-iO forces in South Sudan|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sahel===
Based on field investigations carried out in eight countries during 2015 and early 2016, CAR found evidence of widespread circulation of illicit arms between armed groups in West Africa. The group documented how weapons looted or leaked from Libyan stockpiles after the civil war in 2011 had fuelled armed actors in Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/jihadists-insurgents-plundering-state-arsenals-across-sahel/3604404.html|title=Jihadists, Insurgents Plundering State Arsenals Across Sahel|last=Dettmer|first=J|date=20 November 2016|website=Voice of America|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAR also discovered a new set of weapons used in a series of attacks against hotels and security forces by Islamist armed groups in the Sahel that were "unlike any previously documented in the sub-region."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Investigating cross-border transfers in the Sahel|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=November 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These matched with weapons found in Iraq and Syria, and suggest, according to CAR, possible links in supply sources between groups active in Iraq and Syria and in West Africa.

==== Mali ====
Joint investigations by CAR and the [[Small Arms Survey]] in Mali following the Tuareg rebellion in 2012 identified a range of weapons, ammunition, and related materiel in the hands of various armed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Rebel forces in Northern Mali|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=April 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30210:mali-rebels-used-libyan-weapons-report&amp;catid=49:National%2520Security&amp;Itemid=115|title=Mali rebels used Libyan weapons - report|last=|first=|date=19 April 2013|website=DefenceWeb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed groups in Mali have received supplies sourced from Libya and captured from military stockpiles in Mali. Weapons confiscated from armed groups in northern Mali include 7.62 x 39&amp;nbsp;mm to 14.5 x 114&amp;nbsp;mm calibre ammunition, mortar rounds, rocket-propelled grenades, and air-to-ground rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armstreatymonitor.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ATT-Monitor-Case-Study-3-Tackling-Terror.pdf|title=Tackling Terror: How the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) could help stop the diversion of arms and ammunition in West Africa|last=ATT Monitor|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central African Republic ====
The group have reported on weapons and ammunition used in the Central African Republic on all sides. Stockpiles held by the [[Séléka]] included small arms produced in Sudan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflictarm.com/publications/|title=Non-state armed groups in the Central African Republic|last=Conflict Armament Research|first=|date=January 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Séléka forces had used Belgian, Czech, and UK ammunition manufactured in 2007–10, German military trucks, and 2011-manufactured Chinese [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] rounds.  [[Anti-balaka]] militias had used 12-gauge shotgun shells manufactured in Spain, Italy and Cameroon. Some of these arms appeared to have been diverted from their original intended users. Chinese-manufactured grenades, widely held by [[Séléka]]  and [[anti-balaka]] forces, and common among armed civilians, appear to have been intended to be shipped to Nepal. The report also found that Chinese made Type 82-2 hand grenades can be bought for under US $1, making them cheaper than a bottle of Coca-Cola.

'''David Bravo Bueno''' (born February 20, 1978) is a Spanish lawyer specialized in intellectual property rights.
He is well known for his strong defense of the right to make a private copy of [[copyright]]ed works, as it is explicitly allowed by the Spanish legislation. He is often requested to participate in TV debates about so-called [[piracy]] and [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|p2p]] file sharing.

== Private copy ==

Bravo argues that downloading files is undoubtedly legal and uploading, although more controversial, is surely not a crime, within the current Spanish legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.wikinews.org/wiki/Entrevista_a_David_Bravo Entrevista a David Bravo] at [[Spanish Wikinews]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views are grounded mainly on the Intellectual Propierty Law (1996), Article 31, 2nd Chapter, "Reproduction without authorization" and the Penal Code, Article 270.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bufetalmeida.com/?id=91] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[SGAE]] (General Association of Authors and Editors) strongly disagrees with Bravo and the Spanish government often makes campaigns backing SGAE's views on the matter{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

==Books==
* ''Copia este libro'' (''Copy this book)'': among many other issues, Bravo discusses how the current Spanish legislation allows the right to copy copyrighted works without the author's consentment ("private copy").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elastico.net/archives/005194.html Copia este libro, de David Bravo, en PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debt consolidation''' is a form of debt [[refinancing]] that entails taking out one [[loan]] to pay off many others.&lt;ref name=Investopia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fontinelle|first1=Amy|title=Alternatives To Balance Transfers|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112614/alternatives-balance-transfers.asp|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Investopia|date=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high [[consumer debt]] but occasionally refers to a country's [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] approach to [[debt|corporate debt]] or [[Government debt]].&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite news|last1=Global risk insights|title=China's Interest Rate Cut Not as Reformist As It Seems|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2770105-chinas-interest-rate-cut-not-as-reformist-as-it-seems|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|date=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process can secure a lower overall [[interest rate]] to the entire debt load and provide the convenience of servicing only one loan.&lt;ref name="Ryan2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Ryan|title=Personal Financial Literacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdWrPiSGXY4C&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=14 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-5829-4|pages=292–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{more|consumer debt}}
Debt generally refers to [[money]] owed by one party, the [[debtor]], to a second party, the [[creditor]]. It is generally subject to repayments of [[Principal (finance)|principal]] and [[interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp|title=Debt Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interest]] is the fee charged by the [[creditor]] to the [[debtor]], generally calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year known as an [[interest rate]] and generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly. Debt can be [[Secured loan|secured]] with [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] or [[Unsecured debt|unsecured]]. 

Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of [[home loans]], [[credit card debt]] and [[car finance|car loans]]. [[Household debt]] is the consumer debt of the adults in the household plus the [[mortgage]], if applicable. In many countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, [[student loan|student loans]] can be a significant portion of debt but are usually regulated differently than other debt.&lt;ref name=Studentloands&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rowan|first1=Rachel|title=Student Loans Around the Globe|url=https://www.tuition.io/blog/2013/06/student-loans-around-the-globe/|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Tuition.io - Student Loan|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall debt can reach the point where a [[debtor]] is in danger of [[bankruptcy]], [[insolvency]], or other fiscal emergency.&lt;ref name="VittMacBean2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lois A. Vitt|author2=E. Craig MacBean|author3=Jürg K. Siegenthaler|author4=Institute for Socio-Financial Studies|title=Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lc3zy80-h_AC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 November 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32834-3|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Options available to overburdened debtors include [[credit counseling]] and [[personal bankruptcy]]. 

Other consumer options include:
*[[debt settlement]], where an individual's debt is negotiated to a lesser interest rate or principal with the creditors to lessen the overall burden;
*[[debt relief]], where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven; and 
*debt consolidation, where the individual is able to acquit the current debts by taking out a new [[loan]]. 
Sometimes the solution includes some of each of these tactics.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Coping with Debt|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0150-coping-debt|website=FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION|publisher=US Government|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Process===
The bulk of the consumer debt, especially that with a high interest, is repaid by a new loan. Most debt consolidation loans are offered from [[Financial institution|lending institutions]] and secured as a [[second mortgage]] or [[home equity line of credit]].&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; These require the individual to put up a home as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] and the loan to be less than the [[equity (finance)|equity]] available. 

The overall lower interest rate is an advantage of the debt consolidation loan offers consumers. Lenders have fixed costs to process payments and repayment can spread out over a larger period. However, such consolidation loans have costs: fees, interest, and "points" where one point equals to one percent of the amount borrowed. In some countries, these loans may provide certain tax advantages.&lt;ref name=Foxtaxbreaks&gt;{{cite news|last1=Detweiller|first1=Gerri|title=Congress Extends Tax Break for Troubled Homeowners, But Headaches Aren’t Over|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/12/18/congress-extends-tax-break-for-troubled-homeowners-but-headaches-arent-over/|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Fox Business News|date=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are secured, a lender can attempt to seize property if the borrower goes into [[default (finance)|default]]. 

Personal loans comprise another form of debt consolidation loan. Individuals can issue debtors a [[personal loan]] that satisfies the outstanding debt and creates a new one on their own terms. These loans, often unsecured, are based on the personal relationship rather than collateral.

==Student loan consolidation==
In the United States, federal [[student loan]]s are consolidated somewhat differently from in the UK, as federal student loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

===United States===
In a [[federal student loan consolidation]], existing loans are purchased by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].  Upon consolidation, a fixed interest rate is set based on the then-current interest rate. Reconsolidating does not change that rate. If the student combines loans of different types and rates into one new consolidation loan, a weighted average calculation will establish the appropriate rate based on the then-current interest rates of the different loans being consolidated together.&lt;ref name="Lucas2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Lucas|title=Costs and Policy Options for Federal Student Loan Programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug0Dn3NoZxcC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=August 2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-3158-7|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal student loan consolidation is often referred to as refinancing, which is incorrect because the loan rates are not changed, merely locked in. Unlike private sector debt consolidation, student loan consolidation does not incur any fees for the borrower; private companies make money on student loan consolidation by reaping subsidies from the federal government.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK [[student loan]] entitlements are guaranteed, and are recovered using a means-tested system from the student's future income. Student loans in the UK can not be included in [[bankruptcy]], but do not affect a person's credit rating because the repayments are deducted from salary at source by employers, similar to [[Income Tax]] and [[National Insurance]] contributions. Many students, however, struggle with commercial debt well after their courses have finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creditaction.org.uk/assets/PDF/statistics/2011/august-2011.pdf|title=Debt Facts and Figures - Compiled August 2011|date=August 2011|publisher=creditaction.org.uk|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia’s student loan system once had 35 years to pay back loans, but it’s currently 15. Those seriously delinquent on student loans face arrest at the border. &lt;ref name=Studentloands /&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, an increasing number of student loans are in arrears. This has caused the Asian nation to take harsher steps when it comes to lending determinations. In an effort to prevent future defaults, Japan has begun associating loan approvals to academic performance.&lt;ref name=Studentloands /&gt;

The '''''Electoral Act 1856'''''&lt;ref&gt;''The Electoral Act 1856'' (19 Vic, No 24)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Australian Democracy, Documenting a Democracy, ''[http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-84.html Electoral Act 1856 (Vic)]''&lt;/ref&gt; was an Act of the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] which provided for the election of members of the first [[Parliament of Victoria]] later that year. Besides providing for the division of the colony into provinces and districts for the election of members of Parliament, for the creation of an [[electoral roll]] and for other matters, the Act also introduced voting by [[secret ballot]] in the [[colony of Victoria]]. It provided for a government–supplied ballot paper containing each candidates' names.&lt;ref name=sec36&gt;Section 36 of Act&lt;/ref&gt; The elector was required to cross out the name of those candidates he (and it was only he) did not wish to vote for, fold the ballot paper in a way that the vote could not be seen and place the ballot paper in a ballot box in view of the polling officers.&lt;ref name=sec36/&gt;

The Act was passed by a one-vote majority in the outgoing Legislative Council on 13 March 1856, and received [[Royal assent|assent]] from the [[Governor of Victoria]] on 19 March of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-21.html Payment of Members Act 1870 (Vic)]&lt;/ref&gt; in time for the election of the new Parliament of Victoria later that year. The innovation of the secret ballot was pioneered in Victoria by the former mayor of Melbourne, [[William Nicholson (Australian politician)| William Nicholson]]. &lt;ref&gt; Blainey, G 2016, ‘’The story of Australia’s people: the rise and rise of a new Australia’’, Viking, Penguin Random House, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was the fourth jurisdiction in the world to enacted a law for a secret ballot. France adopted a secret ballot law in 1795. The movement for a secret ballot in [[South Australia]] was led by pioneer and advocate South Australian Electoral Commissioner [[William Boothby]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Australian Dictionary of Biography, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/boothby-william-robinson-3026 William Boothby]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tasmania]] adopted a secret ballot law on 7 February 1856. South Australia enacted a similar law two weeks after the Victorian law, on 2 April 1856. The South Australian system in 1858 required an elector to place an X against the name of his preferred candidate instead of crossing out unwanted names and for the ballot paper to show 'no other matter or thing' apart from the names of candidates and on the back the returning officer's initials.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; The other Australian colonies followed the SA example: [[New South Wales]] (1858), [[Queensland]] (1859), and [[Western Australia]] (1877). [[New Zealand]] implemented secret voting in 1870. 

When the secret ballot was adopted in the United States, it was called 'the Australian ballot'.

{{Rape}}
{{masculism sidebar}}
A '''false accusation of rape''' is the reporting of a [[rape]] where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of false rape allegations, but it is generally agreed that, for about 2% to 10% of rape allegations, a thorough investigation establishes that no crime was committed or attempted.&lt;ref name="DiCanio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Causes of false accusations of rape may fall into two categories: [[false memory|false memories]] (accidental self-deception) or [[lie]]s (attempted deliberate deception of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hutcherson |first=Audrey N. |date=2011 |title=Psychology of Victimization |chapter=Fact or Fiction?: Discriminating True and False Allegations of Victimization |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268215733_Fact_or_Fiction_Discriminating_True_and_False_Allegations_of_Victimization |location= |publisher=Nova Science Publishers Inc |page=1–79 |isbn=978-1614705055 |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;False memories
There are a number of ways in which an alleged victim can accidentally come to believe that they have been raped by the person(s) they accuse. These include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/nov/24/false-memories-abuse-convict-innocent |title=False memories of sexual abuse lead to terrible miscarriages of justice |author=[[Chris French]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 November 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Recovered memory therapy]]: memories of sexual abuse 'recovered' during therapy in the absence of any supporting evidence, based on the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of "[[Repression (psychology)|repression]]"&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;
* The victim's confusion of the memory of the real rapist with the memory of someone else&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;
* [[Memory conformity]]: memory can become contaminated when co-witnesses discuss their recall of events&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

;Lies
There are a number of motivations an accuser may have to falsely claim they have been raped. According to [[Sandra Newman]], these can be put into four categories:&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/ |title=What kind of person makes false rape accusations? |author=[[Sandra Newman]] |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=11 May 2017 |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Personal gain
* Mental illness
* Revenge
* The need for an [[alibi]]

== Estimates of prevalence ==
It is extremely difficult to assess the prevalence of false accusations.&lt;ref name="Spohn"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spohn|first=Cassia|last2=White|first2=Clair|last3=Tellis|first3=Katharine|date=2014-03-01|title=Unfounding Sexual Assault: Examining the Decision to Unfound and Identifying False Reports|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=161–192|doi=10.1111/lasr.12060|issn=1540-5893}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jurisdictions have a distinct classification of false accusation, resulting in these cases being combined with other types of cases (e.g. where the accuser did not physically resist the suspect or sustain injuries) under headings such as "unfounded" or "unproved". There are many reasons other than falsity that can result in a rape case being closed as unfounded or unproven.&lt;ref name="practical"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC|title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|editor-last=Hazelwood|editor-first=Robert R.|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Ann Wolbert|isbn=9781420065053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAOJ"/&gt; DiCanio (1993) states that while researchers and prosecutors do not agree on the exact percentage of cases in which there was sufficient evidence to conclude that allegations were false, they generally agree on a range of 2% to 10%.&lt;ref name="DiCanio"&gt;DiCanio, M. (1993). ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to varying definitions of a "false accusation", the true percentage remains unknown.&lt;ref name = "Forensic277"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forensic Victimology: Examining Violent Crime Victims in Investigative and Legal Contexts|last = Turvey|first = Brent E.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0124080843|location = |page = 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another complicating factor is that data regarding false allegations generally do not come from studies designed to estimate the prevalence of false allegations; rather, they come from reviews of data regarding investigations and prosecutions within criminal justice systems. The goal of such investigations is to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, not to evaluate the cases for which there is not sufficient evidence to prosecute and classify such cases as "false" or "true".&lt;ref name=Heenan2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;{{Cite report|last=Briefing|first=Country|last2=Burman|first2=Scotland|last3=Lovett|first3=M|last4=Kelly|first4=Liz|date=2009-04-01|title=Different systems, similar outcomes?

Claire E. Ferguson and John M. Malouff conducted a meta-analysis of confirmed false rape reporting rates in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' in 2016, and found that 5.2% of cases were confirmed false rape reports. The authors note that the "total false reporting rate... would be greater than the 5% rate found here" if possible false allegations were also included alongside confirmed allegations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Claire E.|last2=Malouff|first2=John M.|date=2016-07-01|title=Assessing Police Classifications of Sexual Assault Reports: A Meta-Analysis of False Reporting Rates|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1185–1193|doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0666-2|pmid=26679304|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crown Prosecution Service report (2011–2012) ===
A report by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) examined rape allegations in England and Wales over a 17-month period between January 2011 and May 2012. It showed that in 35 cases authorities prosecuted a person for making a false allegation, while they brought 5,651 prosecutions for rape. [[Keir Starmer]], the head of the CPS, said that the "mere fact that someone did not pursue a complaint or retracted it, is not of itself evidence that it was false" and that it is a "misplaced belief" that false accusations of rape are commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/13/rape-investigations-belief-false-accusations|title=Rape investigations 'undermined by belief that false accusations are rife'|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=March 13, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the report also showed that a significant number of false allegations of rape (and domestic violence) "involved young, often vulnerable people. About half of the cases involved people aged 21 years old and under, and some involved people with mental health difficulties.

===Lisak (2010)===
[[David Lisak]]'s study, published in 2010 in ''Violence Against Women'', classified as demonstrably false 8 out of the 136 (5.9%) reported rapes at an American university over a ten-year period.&lt;ref name="VAW" /&gt;

:Applying IACP guidelines, a case was classified as a false report if there was evidence that a thorough investigation was pursued and that the investigation had yielded evidence that the reported sexual assault had in fact not occurred. A thorough investigation would involve, potentially, multiple interviews of the alleged perpetrator, the victim, and other witnesses, and where applicable, the collection of other forensic evidence (e.g., medical records, security camera records). For example, if key elements of a victim's account of an assault were internally inconsistent and directly contradicted by multiple witnesses and if the victim then altered those key elements of his or her account, investigators might conclude that the report was false. That conclusion would have been based not on a single interview, or on intuitions about the credibility of the victim, but on a "preponderance" of evidence gathered over the course of a thorough investigation."&lt;ref name="VAW"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318.full.pdf+html |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assualt &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010 | doi = 10.1177/1077801210387747 | pages = 1318&amp;ndash;1334 |pmid=21164210|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101025446/https://icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf|archivedate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ministry of Justice (2008–2009) ===
The UK [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] in their Research Series published a report describing the analysis of 1,149 case files of violent crimes recorded April 2008 to March 2009. They noted that 12% of rape allegations fell into a broader definition of false accusations (victim was intoxicated, there was a delay in reporting the crime, victim retracted the complaint after the fact, or no evidence of bodily harm was recorded). Approximately 3% of the false rape allegations were identified as malicious (determined to be intentionally false). When it came to cases with grievous bodily harm (GBH), even the broader definition (no evidence, delayed report, retraction, or intoxicated victim) accounted for only 2% of crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217471/understanding-progression-serious-cases.pdf|title=2012 Ministry of Justice report "Understanding the progression of serious cases through the Criminal Justice System"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandy Burton, Rosie McLeod, Vanessa de Guzmán, Roger Evans, Helen Lambert and Gemma Cass|date=2012|title=Understanding the progression of serious cases through the Criminal Justice System: Evidence drawn from a selection of case files|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217471/understanding-progression-serious-cases.pdf|journal=Ministry of Justice Research Series 11/12|volume=|pages=V|via=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 paper by Philip N.S. Rumney in the ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'' offers a review of studies of false reporting in the US, New Zealand and the UK.&lt;ref name="rumney"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rumney|first1=Philip N.S.|year=2006|title=False Allegations of Rape|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=430300|journal=[[Cambridge Law Journal]]|volume=65|issue=1|pages=128–158|doi=10.1017/S0008197306007069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumney draws two conclusions from his review of literature. First, the police continue to misapply the "no-crime" or "unfounding" criteria.  Studies by Kelly ''et al''. (2005), Lea ''et al''. (2003), HMCPSI/HMIC (2002), Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgment.  Rumney notes that some officers seem to "have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization".  He adds that "qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation".

Rumney's second conclusion is that it is impossible to "discern with any degree of certainty the actual rate of false allegations" because many of the studies of false allegations have adopted unreliable or untested research methodologies. He argues, for instance, that in addition to their small sample size, the studies by Maclean (1979) and Stewart (1981) used questionable criteria to judge an allegation to be false. MacLean deemed reports "false" if, for instance, the victim did not appear "dishevelled" and Stewart, in one instance, considered a case disproved, stating that "it was totally impossible to have removed her extremely tight undergarments from her extremely large body against her will".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1981) quoted in {{cite journal | last1 = Rumney | first1 = Philip N.S. | year = 2006 | title = False Allegations of Rape | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=430300 | journal = [[Cambridge Law Journal]] | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 128–158 | doi=10.1017/s0008197306007069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
American psychologist [[David Lisak]] criticized the collection of studies used in Rumney's 2006 paper, which estimated the rate of false allegations as between 1.5–90%. Lisak stated that many of the stats are misleading upon investigation and "when the sources of these estimates are examined carefully it is clear that only a fraction of the reports represent credible studies and that these credible studies indicate far less variability in false reporting rates." Lisak points out that even in the original paper Rumney concludes that many of the studies have inadequacies and should not be used to estimate the frequency of false rape reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisak|first=David|last2=Gardinier|first2=Lori|last3=Nicksa|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Cote|first4=Ashley M.|date=2010-12-01|title=False Allegations of Sexual Assualt &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318|journal=Violence Against Women|language=en|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1318–1334|doi=10.1177/1077801210387747|issn=1077-8012|pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI statistics (1995–1997) ===
In the US, [[FBI]] reports from 1995, 1996, and 1997 consistently put the number of "unfounded" forcible rape accusations around 8%. In contrast, the average rate of unfounded reports for all "[[index crimes]]" (murder, aggravated assault, forcible rape, robbery, arson, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) tracked by the FBI is 2%.&lt;ref name="fbi.gov"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1996/96sec2.pdf ''Crime in the United States 1996: Uniform Crime Statistics'', "Section II: Crime Index Offenses Reported."] FBI, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/1995/95sec2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/1997/97sec2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate, however, does not appear in subsequent FBI reports.&lt;ref&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/1998/98sec2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/1999/99sec2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2000/00sec2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate was criticised by academic Bruce Gross as almost meaningless as many jurisdictions from which FBI collects data use different definition of "unfounded", which, he wrote, includes cases where the victim did not physically fight off the suspect or the suspect did not use a weapon, and cases where the victim had a prior relationship to the suspect.&lt;ref name="AAOJ"&gt;Gross, Bruce (Spring 2009).

===Kanin (1994)===
In 1994, Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] investigated the incidences of false rape allegations made to the police in one small urban community in the Midwest United States (population 70,000) between 1978 and 1987. He states that unlike in many larger jurisdictions, this police department had the resources to "seriously record and pursue to closure all rape complaints, regardless of their merits". He further states each investigation "always involves a serious offer to [[polygraph]] the complainants and the suspects" and "the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false".

The number of false rape allegations in the studied period was 45; this was 41% of the 109 total complaints filed in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Kanin, Eugene J., "{{cite journal|url=http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|title=False Rape Allegations|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=23|pages=81–92|issue=1|date=February 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303082400/http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1007/bf01541619 |pmid=8135653| last1 = Kanin | first1 = Eugene J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers verified, whenever possible, for all of the complainants who recanted their allegations, that their new account of the events matched the accused's version of events.

After reviewing the police files, Kanin categorized the false accusations into three broad motivations: alibis, revenge, and [[attention-seeking]]. These motivations were assigned prevalence of roughly 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. This categorization was supported by the details of complainant recantations and other documentation of their cases.

Kanin also investigated the combined police records of two large Midwestern universities over a three-year period (1986–1988), and found that 50% of the reported forcible rapes were determined to be false accusations (32 of the total 64). No polygraphs were used, the investigations were the sole responsibility of a ranking female officer, and a rape charge was only counted as false under complainant recantation. In this sample, the motivations mentioned above were roughly evenly split between alibi and revenge, with only one case characterized as attention-seeking.

==== Criticism ====
Critics of Kanin's report include [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. He states, "Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations."&lt;ref name="SAR"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Sexual Assault Report |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=David |last=Lisak |date=September–October 2007 |title=False allegations of rape: a critique of Kanin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisak, Kanin's study lacked any kind of systematic methodology and did not independently define a false report, instead recording as false any report which the police department classified as false, whereas Kanin stated that the women filing the false allegations of rape had recanted. The department classified reports as false which the complainant later said were false, but Lisak points out that Kanin's study did not scrutinize the police's processes or employ independent checkers to protect results from bias.&lt;ref name="VAW"/&gt;

Kanin, Lisak writes, took his data from a police department which used investigation procedures (polygraphs) that are discouraged by the U.S. Justice Department and denounced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These procedures include the "serious offer", in this department, of polygraph testing of complainants, which is viewed as a tactic of intimidation that leads victims to avoid the justice process&lt;ref name="VAW"/&gt; and which, Lisak says, is "based on the misperception that a significant percentage of sexual assault reports are false".&lt;ref name="SAR"/&gt; The police department's "biases...were then echoed in Kanin's unchallenged reporting of their findings".&lt;ref name="SAR"/&gt; While also noting some of the same criticisms of Kanin, Rumney's 2006 metastudy of US and UK false rape allegation studies adds that "if, indeed, officers did abide by this policy then the 41% could, in fact, be an underestimate given the restrictive definition of false complaints offered by the police in this study. The reliability of these findings may be somewhat bolstered by the fact that the police appeared to record the details and circumstances of the fabrications."&lt;ref name=rumney /&gt;

Bruce Gross writes in the ''Forensic Examiner'' that Kanin's study is an example of the limitations of existing studies on false rape accusations. "Small sample sizes and non-representative samples preclude generalizability."&lt;ref name="AAOJ"/&gt; Philip N.S. Rumney questions the reliability of Kanin's study stating that it "must be approached with caution". He argues that the study's most significant problem is Kanin's assumption "that police officers abided by departmental policy in only labeling as false those cases where the complainant admitted to fabrication. He does not consider that actual police practice, as other studies have shown, might have departed from guidelines."&lt;ref name=rumney/&gt;

==Police handling of rape reports==
Surveys of police and prosecutors find that many in law enforcement consistently over-estimate the prevalence of false accusations, leading to what some researchers have characterized as a culture of skepticism toward accusers in sexual assault cases. &lt;ref name="Lovett"/&gt;

== Possible effects of media representation ==
There are studies about the extent which the media affects the public perception of false rape accusations. Incorrect assumptions about false rape allegations increases the likelihood that a person who reports rape will be blamed or disbelieved.&lt;ref name="CFCA"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/2017/09/19/resource-challenging-misconceptions-about-sexual-offending-creating-evidence-based|title=Resource - Challenging misconceptions about sexual offending: Creating an evidence-based resource for police and legal practitioners|work=Child Family Community Australia|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Sacks in ''[[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]]'' says that the media perpetuates rape myths when reporting on sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Meghan|last2=Ackerman|first2=Alissa|last3=Shlosberg|first3=Amy|date=2017-12-04|title=Rape Myths in the Media: A Content Analysis of Local Newspaper Reporting in the United States|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321504595|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1237–1246|doi=10.1080/01639625.2017.1410608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapes that are reported in news media are typically sensational and do not often correspond with the reality of most rapes,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Filing false vice reports: Distinguishing true from false allegations of rape|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1889186116300026|journal=The European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/j.ejpal.2016.02.002|issn=1889-1861 | last1 = De Zutter | first1 = André W.E.A. | last2 = Horselenberg | first2 = Robert | last3 = van Koppen | first3 = Peter J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the person knows as opposed to a stranger.&lt;ref name="CFCA" /&gt; Sacks says, the media also normalizes sexual violence in general, often blames the person who reported the assault, and commonly expresses sympathy for the alleged perpetrators instead of the victim.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt; Laura Niemi, a postdoctoral psychology associate at Harvard University, speculated that mythologizing of rape could contribute to the idea that "no normal person" could rape. As a result, the people commonly had a difficult time believing someone they know or like is a rapist, and this could contribute to the idea that the person who reported the rape is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-psychology-of-victim-blaming/502661/|title=The Psychology of Victim-Blaming|last=Roberts|first=Kayleigh|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context'', André De Zutter and a team described how false rape allegations often resemble stories of rape portrayed in the media, which are not typical of most true incidents of rape. False stories tend to be quick and straightforward with few details or complex interactions, and usually involve only vaginal intercourse. Some behaviors associated with lying by juries is actually typical of true rapes, including kissing or a previous relationship with the rapist.  True rape reports often include many details rarely seen in media or false rape reports, for example pseudo-intimate actions, detailed verbal interactions and an otherwise wide range of behaviors besides simply face-to-face vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

Pam Vogel of [[Media Matters for America]] in the Spring 2017 issue of AMASS released the results of a study which found that [[ESPN]] networks discussed sexual assault or domestic violence about 30 hours and 40 minutes of airtime out of more than 8,600 total hours in the first quarter of 2017. The speakers were 74% male, and about 1/3 of that time was spent discussing an ESPN documentary about false rape accusations against a lacrosse team at Duke University. Vogel concludes that the high focus on false allegations could contribute to the myth that rapes are rare and false reports are common, when the facts do not back up those perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Pam.

== Consequences of false accusations of rape in the UK ==

=== Consequences to accuser ===
==== Prosecution ====
Individuals suspected of making a false accusation of rape may be charged with the civil crime of "wasting police time" or the criminal charge of "Perverting the Course of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf/|title=Perverting the Course of Justice, March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/|title=Perverting the Course of Justice in Rape and Domestic Violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a five-year period ending in 2014, a total of 109 women were prosecuted for crimes related to making false accusations of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3613506/prosecuting-women-for-false-rape-allegations/|title=Time.

Another report identified 121 charging decisions involving allegations of false accusations of rape and an additional 11 false allegations of both domestic violence and rape between January 2011 and May 2012 and found of these cases, 35 were prosecuted based upon false accusations of rape. A further 3 were prosecuted based upon charges of false accusations of both rape and domestic abuse.

==Allegations of rape during the Jim Crow era==

In 1895, [[Ida B. Wells]] published ''The Red Record'' which documented lynchings from 1892 and their causes. She compiled statistics of 241 lynchings which showed that rape and murder were the two most common reasons used to justify lynchings. Wells found little evidence that victims were lynched because they had committed rape or some other offense. Instead she found that African American businesses were competing with white-owned businesses and in some cases African American men had consensual sexual relationships with white women and were lynched after the relationships were discovered by other people. Subsequent analyses have confirmed Wells' argument that economic competition led to lynchings and found that lynchings increased during difficult economic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brundage |first1=William Fitzhugh |title=Under sentence of death : lynching in the South |date=1997 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0807846368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzHVqJV-U9gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Louisiana between 1889 and 1896 rape was the second most common reason used to justify a lynching and a survey done in the 1930's of a small town in Mississippi, 60 percent of respondents stated that lynching was an appropriate response to a case of rape and that it was necessary to maintain law and order and protect white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inverarity |first1=James M. |title=Populism and Lynching in Louisiana, 1889-1896: A Test of Erikson's Theory of the Relationship between Boundary Crises and Repressive Justice |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1976 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=262–280 |doi=10.2307/2094473 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1224%28197604%2941%3A2%3C262%3APALIL1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable events===

There are several notable cases of violence after an accusation of rape during the Jim Crow era. 

In the [[Tulsa race riot]] of 1921 mobs killed 36 people and hospitalized an additional 800 people. The riot began over an allegation that a black man had attempted to rape a white 17 year-old elevator operator. 

The [[Rosewood massacre]] of 1923 began after a white woman in nearby Sumner claimed she had been raped by a black man from Rosewood. An angry mob surrounded a house with black residents and a standoff ensued. The mob killed several people inside and two white people were killed outside. This attracted additional angry mobs who razed Rosewood. Black residents fled into the forest, escaped in cars, and on a train. At a minimum, eight black people and two white people were killed but it is possible that as many 150 black residents were killed.

Two white women accused the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a group of nine African American boys and young men, of rape on a train in 1931. Eight of the boys were found guilty and the case was appealed to the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] and then twice to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In [[Powell v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court reversed the Alabama Supreme Court decision because the Court found that the defendants had inadequate counsel. In [[Patterson v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court sent the case back to Alabama for retrial on the grounds that there were no black jurors in their trials, a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Eight of the nine Scottsboro boys were ultimately found guilty and received long prison sentences.

Racially charged allegations of rape continue to the present time. In the [[Central Park jogger case]], one hispanic and four black teens were found guilty of raping a white woman in 1989. Their cases were vacated in 2002 and they received a $41 million settlement in 2014.

'''Feminist legal theory''', also known as '''feminist jurisprudence''', is based on the belief that the [[law]] has been fundamental in [[women]]'s historical subordination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fineman|first1=Martha A.|title=Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law|volume=13|issue=1|pages=13–32|url=http://www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/AmericanUniversityJournal/2005/No1/american/fineman.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project of [[feminist theory|feminist]] [[legal theory]] is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women's former subordinate status. Second, feminist legal theory is dedicated to changing women's status through a rework of the law and its approach to [[gender]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legal Feminism: Activism, Lawyering, and legal Theory|last=Scales|first=Ann|publisher=University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''feminist jurisprudence'' was coined in the late 1970s by [[Ann C. Scales|Ann Scales]] during the planning process for Celebration 25, a party and conference held in 1978 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first women graduating from Harvard Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cain|first=Patricia A.|date=September 2013|title=Feminist Jurisprudence: Grounding the Theories|url=|journal=Berkley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice|volume=4|pages=193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The term was first published in 1978 in the first issue of the Harvard Women's Law Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-chapters/12461699/feminist-jurisprudence Feminist Jurisprudence]. Connection.ebscohost.com (1991-11-18). Retrieved on 2015-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Martha Fineman]] founded the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]] at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] to explore the relationships between feminist theory, practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/centers/feminism-and-legal-theory-project.html.|title=Feminism and Legal Theory Project {{!}} Emory University School of Law {{!}} Atlanta, GA|website=Emory University School of Law|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main approaches ==
Some approaches to [[feminist]] [[jurisprudence]] are: 
*the liberal equality model;
*the sexual difference model;
*the dominance model;
*and the [[postmodern]] or anti-[[essentialist]] model.

Each model provides a distinct view of the legal mechanisms that contribute to women's subordination, and each offers a distinct method for changing legal approaches to gender.

== The liberal equality model ==
{{further|Liberal feminism}}
The [[liberalism|liberal]] [[equality under the law|equality]] model operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice.  This model focuses on ensuring that women are afforded [[gender equality|genuine equality]] including race, sexual orientation, and gender—as opposed to the nominal equality often given them in the traditional liberal framework—and seeks to achieve this either by way of a more thorough application of liberal values to women’s experiences or the revision of liberal categories to take gender into account. For example, when black women are only provided legal relief when the case is against her race or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1989|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=|journal=University of Chicago Legal Forum|volume=1989|pages=149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sexual difference model ==
The difference model emphasizes the significance of [[Gender Discrimination|gender discrimination]] and holds that this discrimination should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. Only by taking into account differences can the law provide adequate remedies for women’s situation, which is in fact distinct from men’s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=, Berkeley Journal of Gender|date=2013|title=Difference, Dominance, Differences: Feminist Theory, Equality, and the Law|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bglj/vol5/iss1/8|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.15779/Z388C4M|issn=1933-1045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference model is in direct opposition to the sameness account which holds that women’s sameness with men should be emphasized. To the sameness feminist, employing women’s differences in an attempt to garner greater rights is ineffectual to that end and places emphasis on the very characteristics of women that have historically precluded them from achieving equality with men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The dominance model ==
The dominance model rejects liberal feminism and views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. It thus joins certain strands of [[critical legal theory]], which also consider the potential for law to act as an instrument for [[wikt:domination|domination]]. This theory focuses on how male dominate females, but it also talks about other groups being oppressed such as how legal aid is not often offered to the transgender population. Also, any white female would have good legal representation compared to minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spade|first=Dean|date=November 2010|title=Be Professional|url=|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the account of dominance proposed by [[Catharine MacKinnon]], sexuality is central to the dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Lives Before the Law: Constructing a Feminist Jurisprudence|last=Baer|first=Judith A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacKinnon argues that women's sexuality is socially constructed by male dominance and the sexual domination of women by men is a primary source of the general social subordination of women.

== The anti-essentialist model ==
Feminists from the [[postmodern]] camp have deconstructed{{huh|date=October 2017}} the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated.{{huh|date=October 2017}}  Anti-essentialist and [[Intersectionality|intersectionalist]] critiques of feminists have objected to the idea that there can be any universal women’s voice and have criticized feminists, as did [[Black feminism]], for implicitly basing their work on the experiences of white, middle class, heterosexual women.  The anti-essentialist and intersectionalist project has been to explore the ways in which race, class, sexual orientation, and other axes of subordination interplay with gender and to uncover the implicit, detrimental assumptions that have often been employed in feminist theory. This model is about dismantling {{huh|date=October 2017}} white feminism and [[First-wave feminism|First wave feminist]] and about building on actual equality for all regardless or gender, race, sexual orientation, class, or disability.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, J Cali.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5076">The '''forestry service'''&lt;ref&gt;From German ''Forsteidienst''&lt;/ref&gt; was a form of [[alternative service]] offered to [[German language|German speaking]] [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] in lieu of military service in Russia from 1881 to 1918. At its peak during World War I, 7,000 men served in forestry and agricultural pest control in [[Ukraine]] and South Russia. The program ended in the anarchy of the Russian Revolution.

==Background==
[[Nonresistance|Nonresistant]] [[Vistula delta Mennonites|Mennonites from West Prussia]] started settling in Russia in 1789, induced by land and special privileges including exemption from military service. By 1870 their population had grown to over 45,000 and was a significant economic force in south Russia. In 1870 the government announced that special privileges enjoyed by all colonists would end by 1880. Mennonite leaders sent delegations to [[Saint Petersburg]] for three successive years, but failed to retain the military exemption they so valued.

With loss of privileges looking likely, emigration to North America was promoted as a viable alternative. Realizing that 40,000 of Russia's most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent [[Eduard Totleben]] to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, he exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and promised some form of alternative to military service. His intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations with the government in 1880 over acceptable types of alternative service, the forestry service program was deemed the best of the alternatives because it would have no military connection.

==Structure==
The forestry service began in 1881, after the end of special privileges granted to colonists in Russia. Men served in large groups for four years planting and caring for trees on the [[steppe]]s of South Russia. [[Phylloxera]] units in [[Crimea]] focused on eradicating harmful insects from vineyards. Mennonite congregations provided for housing, feeding and all other necessities of the men. The Russian government provided supervision of the projects, tools needed for the job and paid each man 20 [[Russian ruble|kopeks]] (a minimal amount) per work day.

Just as Mennonite colonies&lt;ref&gt;See [[Chortitza]] and [[Molotschna]], the two largest colonies.&lt;/ref&gt; were insulated from Russian society, the forestry camps were also sheltered from outside contact. Mennonite congregations provided a pastor and a superintendent to oversee each camp. The expense of running the camps, which included constructing barracks, was quite high. Voluntary contributions from Mennonite congregations, who had an incentive to provide an alternative to military service, were sufficient to run the program for nearly three decades.

Initially about four hundred men served in this program annually. By 1913 up to a thousand were serving and during World War I, 7000.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;Braun.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar program allowed Mennonite men to serve in hospital units and transport wounded from the battlefield to [[Moscow]] and [[Ekaterinoslav]] hospitals.

==Demobilization==
The forestry units functioned right up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The camps became impossible to maintain in the chaos of South Russia and the assets, all church property, were sold and camps closed in 1918 with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives to military service remained available, but under military control, until 1936.&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

==Epilogue==
The lessons learned with respect to providing an alternate to military service for [[conscientious objector]]s was a model for [[Civilian Public Service]] in the United States during World War II. [[Peace churches]] almost exclusively financed Civilian Public Service, while draftees served in forestry, agricultural and other types of units.

'''Francesco Mario Pagano''' (8 December 1748&amp;nbsp;– 29 October 1799) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[jurist]], [[author]], [[Intellectual|thinker]], and the founder of the Neapolitan school of law.&lt;ref name=CambHistPolTht&gt;''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', ed. Goldie &amp; Wokler, 2006, p. 765&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as one of the most influential [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Tessitore, ''Comprensione storica e cultura'', Guida, 1979, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A moderate reformist, he is seen as a forerunner of the [[Italian unification]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brienza]] in the southern [[Province of Potenza]].  He studied at the [[University of Naples Federico II]] under [[Antonio Genovesi]].  At the age of twenty, he became special lecturer in [[moral philosophy]] there, at the same time practising law. He was friend of [[Gaetano Filangieri]], entering the masonry with him, and was elected venerable master of the Neapolitan [[masonic lodge|lodge]] "La philantropia". Pagano was one of the men who powerfully helped Italy in her social and scientific advancement and in the 1790s he had striven more than any other intellectual to give a political form to the 18th century reform tradition in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Imbruglia, ''Naples in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

His work ''Saggi politici'' (1783–85) provided a philosophical history of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], arguing against torture and capital punishment and advocating more benign penal codes. ''Considerazioni sul processo criminale'' (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), gave him international popularity and was much praised by ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'', the main newspaper of the [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]].&lt;ref&gt;Biancamaria Fontana, ''The Invention of the Modern Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794 he defended [[Vincenzo Galiani]], [[Vincenzo Vitaliani]] and [[Emanuele De Deo]]&amp;nbsp;– three alleged conspirators against [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]]; after they were sentenced to death, Pagano was deprived of his professorship, arrested, imprisoned and expelled from the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basilicatanet.it/conoscerebasilicata/cultura/biblioteca/Francesco%20Mario%20Pagano_en.htm Francesco Mario Pagano (1748-1799)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225174541/http://www.basilicatanet.it/conoscerebasilicata/cultura/biblioteca/Francesco%20Mario%20Pagano_en.htm |date=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After fleeing Naples in 1796, he returned in 1799 and drafted the constitution of the short-lived [[Neapolitan Republic (Napoleonic)|Neapolitan Republic]]. The document bore similarities to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] but presented original traits such as the institution of the "body of ephors", an authority who would have overseen the maintenance of the law. It is considered the precursor of the modern [[constitutional court]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Rosa Di Simone, ''Istituzioni e fonti normative in Italia dall'Antico Regime al fascismo'', p. 111, Giappichelli, Torino, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the republic, Pagano was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Castel Nuovo]]. He was executed by hanging at the [[Mercato (Naples)|"Piazza del Mercato"]] in Naples, along with other revolutionaries: [[Domenico Cirillo]], [[Giorgio Pigliacelli]] and [[Ignazio Ciaia]].

Pagano's other juridical or philosophical works included ''Progetto di Costituzione della Repubblica napoletana'', ''Sul processo criminale'', ''Esame politico dell’intera legislazione romana'', and ''Discorso sull’origine e natura della poesia''. He also translated works from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and wrote six tragedies (''Gerbino'', ''Agamennone'', ''Corradino'', ''Gli esuli tebani'', ''Prometeo'', and ''Teodosio'') and one comedy (''Emilia'').

'''''Hate on Trial: The Case Against America's Most Dangerous Neo-Nazi''''' is a book by [[Morris Dees]] and [[Steve Fiffer]] recounting the civil trial of Berhanu v. Metzger in which the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] and [[Anti-Defamation League]] sued [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] and [[White Aryan Resistance]].

The SPLC and ADL successfully argued that Meztger’s organization was civilly liable for the murder of [[Mulugeta Seraw]] receiving a $12.5 million judgement.&lt;ref&gt;The jury divided the judgement against the defendants as follows: Kyle Brewster, $500,000; Ken Mieske, $500,000;, John Metzger, $1 million; WAR, $3 million; Tom Metzger, $5 million; in addition, the jury awarded $2.5 million for Mulugeta's unrealized future earnings and pain and suffering.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30613FD34540C758EDDA90994D8494D81 | title=Sending a $12.5 Million Message to a Hate Group | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 26, 1990  | first=  Robb| last= London| accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York Times]] book review, "the descriptions of the people involved are well wrought, and a moral quest fuels this book with driving power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DB163AF932A15750C0A965958260 | title=The High Price of Hate  | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= March 21, 1993 | first= Jason| last=  Berry| accessdate =2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''League of peace''' ([[Latin]]: '''''foedus pacificum''''') is an expression coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]". The league of peace should be distinguished from a [[peace treaty]] (''pactum pacis'') because a peace treaty prevents or terminates only one war, while the league of peace seeks to end all wars forever. This league does not hold any power of the state, but only exists for "the maintenance and security of the freedom of the state and of other states in league with it, without there being any need for them to submit to civil laws and their compulsion, as men in a state of nature must submit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch 1795|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29651">[[Sampling (music)|Music sampling]] is the subject of many legal disputes, chiefly in the realm of [[copyright law]] as it applies to [[musical composition]]s and [[sound recording]]s.

Early sampling artists simply used portions of other artists' recordings without permission, to make something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenbaum|first=John|date=April 8, 1999|title=MUSIC SAMPLING AND COPYRIGHT LAW|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/studentpap/undergrad%20thesis1%20JLind.pdf|journal=CACPS UNDERGRADUATE THESIS #1, SPRING 1999|volume=|pages=1–5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as music incorporating samples began to make significant money, some sampled artists, publishers, and record companies began to take legal action, claiming [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/28/133306353/Digital-Music-Sampling-Creativity-Or-Criminality|title=Digital Music Sampling: Creativity Or Criminality?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, after the threat or initiation of a [[lawsuit]], such disputes are settled out of court, often with the sampling artist obtaining a license at considerable cost and making other concessions to appease the aggrieved party; other times, the sampling artist contests the infringement claims, such as by arguing in court that the copyright law does not cover their particular use of the work. The outcome of these court cases, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom, have shaped [[common law]], defining ways [[statutory law]]—which does not directly cover sampling—can be applied to sampling disputes.

In accordance to the [[United States constitution]], the laws of [[copyright]] permit a number of rights to authors so that they may "Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts." This principle brings to light the true reason for copyright law - to develop boundaries economically and legally where learning, science, and culture can progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller aka DJ Spooky|first1=Paul D.|last2=Doctorow|first2=Cory|last3=Reich|first3=Steve|title=Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture|date=2008|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63363-5|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect peoples ideas and intellectual property.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

===Early cases===
Using tape as a means of sampling goes back to at least 1961, when [[James Tenney]] created Collage #1 ("Blue Suede") from samples of [[Elvis Presley]]'s recording of "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]." At the time, artists such as [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] experimented by manipulating existing works such as radio broadcasts. Gysin's work tended to favor his permutation poems as the vehicle for cut-ups with spliced repetition of the same series of words rearranged in every conceivable pattern, frequently utilizing snippets of speeches or news broadcasts. Burroughs preferred a much more frantic and disorganized sound that would later spawn similar disjointed collage material from modern groups such as [[Negativland]]. Burroughs would record, for instance, a radio broadcast about military action, then dub parts of the broadcast likely at random often stuttering and distorting the original work far beyond comprehension.

However, before then, the 1956 novelty hit single "[[The Flying Saucer (song)|The Flying Saucer]]", by Buchanan and [[Dickie Goodman|Goodman]], used segments of the original recordings of 18 different chart hits from 1955 to 1956, intertwined with spoken "news" commentary in the style of [[Orson Welles]]' "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|War of the Worlds]]" radio broadcast, to tell the story of a visit from a [[flying saucer]]. After the record was issued, an agreement was reached with music publishing houses for them to take a share of royalties from the records sold. Although his partnership with Buchanan soon ended, [[Dickie Goodman]] continued to make similar records through the 1960s and 1970s, one of his biggest hits being "[[Mr. Jaws]]" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dickie-goodman-p17945/biography  Greg Prato, Biography of Dickie Goodman, Allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chuckthewriter.com/goodman.html  Chuck Miller, ''Dickie Goodman: We've Spotted The Shark Again'', originally published in ''Goldmine'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon and Garfunkel]] sampled themselves in using a portion of their song "[[The Sounds of Silence]]" in "Save the Life of My Child" from their 1967 "[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]" album. [[The Beatles]] also used the technique on a number of popular recordings in the mid to late '60s, including "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]", "[[Revolution 9]]" and "[[I Am the Walrus]]." [[John Kongos]] is credited in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the first person to sample a song with his single, "[[He's Gonna Step on You Again]]". [[Timothy Leary]] sampled the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]] among others on his album [[You Can Be Anyone This Time Around]] in 1970.

In the early 1970s, [[DJ Kool Herc]] often looped hard funk break beats at block parties in The Bronx. However, sampling did not truly take off in popular music until the early eighties when pioneering [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] producers, such as [[Grandmaster Flash]], started to produce hip hop records using sampled [[break (music)|break]]s rather than live studio bands, which had until then been the norm.

Conventional wisdom would hold that the first popular rap single to feature sampling was "[[Rapper's Delight]]" by [[The Sugarhill Gang]] on the [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill Records]] label in 1979. However, instead of 'sampling' "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" by [[Chic (band)|Chic]], Sugar Hill employed a group of session musicians known as Positive Force to record a cover of "Good Times," which was then rapped over.

Earliest examples of this practice include [[Grandmaster Flash]]'s - "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]" (1981) (which was made by recording vinyl manipulation on a pair of turntables and used the "[[Apache (instrumental)|Apache]]" break by the [[Incredible Bongo Band]] amongst other famous breaks), Brother D and the Collective Effort's "How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise" (1984) (which sampled the beat and bass line from [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s 1978 hit "[[Got to Be Real]]") and [[UTFO]]'s "[[Roxanne, Roxanne]]" (1984). Bill Holt's [[Dreamies]] (1974) is often cited as one of the earliest examples of sampling in popular music. Later examples of sampling include [[Big Audio Dynamite]] and their 1985 album ''[[This Is Big Audio Dynamite]]'' and the single [[E=MC² (song)|E=MC²]] on which [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] (formerly of [[The Clash]]) sampled snippets of audio from various films including works by [[Nicolas Roeg]]. The 1981 album by [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Brian Eno]], ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', used sampling extensively for the songs' vocals.

One of the first major legal cases regarding sampling was with UK dance act [[MARRS|M{{pipe}}}A{{pipe}}}R{{pipe}}}R|S]]' "[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up the Volume]]". As the record reached the UK top ten, producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] obtained an injunction against the record due to the unauthorized use of a sample from their hit single "Roadblock". The dispute was settled out of court, with the injunction being lifted in return for an undertaking that overseas releases would not contain the "Roadblock" sample, and the disc went on to top the UK singles chart. The sample in question had been so distorted as to be virtually unrecognizable, and SAW didn't realize their record had been used until they heard co-producer Dave Dorrell mention it in a radio interview.

In 1987, [[The JAMs]] released [[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]. 1987 was produced using many unauthorized samples that plagiarized a wide range of musical works. They were ordered by the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] to destroy all unsold copies of the album because of the uncleared samples, after a complaint from ABBA. In response, The JAMs disposed of many copies of 1987 in unorthodox, attention-grabbing ways. They also released a version titled "[[1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)]]", stripped of all unauthorized samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single.

[[2 Live Crew]], a hip-hop group familiar with controversy, was often in the spotlight for their obscene and sexually explicit lyrics. They sparked many debates about censorship in the music industry. However, it was their 1989 album ''[[As Clean as They Wanna Be]]'' (a re-tooling of ''[[As Nasty as They Wanna Be]]'') that began the prolonged legal debate over sampling. The album contained a track entitled "Pretty Woman," based on the well-known [[Roy Orbison]] song [[Oh, Pretty Woman]]. 2 Live Crew's version sampled the guitar, bass, and drums from the original without permission. While the opening lines are the same, the two songs split ways immediately after.&lt;ref name="McLe_0385513259_7p_all_r1.qxd"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406011209/http://kembrew.com/documents/mcleod-freedomofexpression3.pdf ''Freedom of Expression: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity''] by Kembrew McLeod&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Roy Orbison's version – "Pretty woman, walking down the street/Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet."&lt;br /&gt;
2 Live Crew's version – "Big hairy woman, all that hair ain't legit,/Cause you look like [[Cousin Itt]]."&lt;ref name="2Live Crew"&gt;[http://www.benedict.com/Audio/Crew/Crew.aspx 2Live Crew&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124205211/http://benedict.com/Audio/Crew/Crew.aspx |date=2012-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to this, while the music is identifiable as the Orbison song, there were changes implemented by the group. The new version contained interposed scraper notes, overlays of solos in different keys, and an altered drum beat.&lt;ref name="2Live Crew"/&gt;

The group was sued by the song's copyright owners Acuff-Rose. They claimed that 2 Live Crew's unauthorized use of the samples devalued the original, and was thus copyright infringement. The group claimed they were protected under [[fair use]]. The case of [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]] came to the Supreme Court in 1994.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{ussc|name=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.|volume=510|page=569|pin=|year=1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the case, the Supreme Court didn't consider previous rulings in which any commercial use (and economic gain) was considered copyright infringement. Instead they re-evaluated the original frame of copyright as set forth in the Constitution. The opinion that resulted from ''Emerson v. Davies'' played a major role in the decision.&lt;ref name="McLe_0385513259_7p_all_r1.qxd"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[In] truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before." ''Emerson v. Davies'', 8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (CCD Mass. 1845)&lt;ref name="2Live Crew"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Perhaps what played a larger role was the result from the ''[[Folsom v. Marsh]]'' case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work." ''Folsom v. Marsh'', 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass. 1841)&lt;ref name="2Live Crew"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court ruled that any financial gain 2 Live Crew received from their version did not infringe upon Acuff-Rose because the two songs were targeted at very different audiences. 2 Live Crew's use of copyrighted material was protected under the fair use doctrine, as a [[parody]], even though it was released commercially.&lt;ref name="McLe_0385513259_7p_all_r1.qxd"/&gt; While the appellate court had determined that the mere nature of the parody made it inherently unfair, the Supreme Court's ruling reversed this, with Justice David Souter writing that the lower court was wrong in determining parody alone to be sufficient for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;

===1990s and the introduction of "sample clearances"===
{{anchor|Sample clearance|Sample clearances}}&lt;!-- Titles like [[Sample clearance]] redirect to this anchor. If sources place the origin of this in the 1980s, move the anchor.--&gt;
[[Rick James]] sued [[MC Hammer]] for [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] on the track "[[U Can't Touch This]]" (which sampled his 1981 song "[[Super Freak]]"), but the suit was settled out of court when Hammer agreed to credit James as co-composer, effectively cutting James in on the millions of dollars the record was earning. Hammer was also sued by [[Felton Pilate]] (who had worked with the successful vocal group [[Con Funk Shun]]) and by several of his former backers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mc-hammer-1 MC Hammer: Biography from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Hammer also admitted in [[deposition (law)|depositions]] and court documents to getting the idea for the song "Here Comes The Hammer" from a [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian recording artist]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] named Kevin Christian. Christian had filed a 16 million dollar [[lawsuit]] against Hammer for [[copyright infringement]] for his song entitled "Oh-Oh, You Got The Shing". This fact compounded with witness testimony from both Hammer's and Christian's entourages and other evidence including photos brought about a settlement with [[Capitol Records]] in 1994. The terms of the [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] remain sealed. Hammer settled with Christian the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13360829.html|title = Songwriter claims Hammer stole his song: sues him.

In the early 1990s, [[Vanilla Ice]] (Rob Van Winkle) sampled the [[bass guitar|bass]]line of the 1981 song "[[Under Pressure]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[David Bowie]] for his 1990 single "[[Ice Ice Baby]]".&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Mickey|title=Is Hip Hop Dead? |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-275-99461-9 |page=118 |chapter=Vanilla Ice: The Elvis of Rap }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[David Bowie]] did not receive credit or royalties for the sample.&lt;ref name="Westfahl"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Westfahl |first1=Gary |title=Science Fiction, Children's Literature, and Popular Culture|year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-30847-0 |page=100 |chapter=Legends of the Fall: Behind the Music }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 interview, Rob Van Winkle said the two melodies were slightly different because he had added an additional note. In later interviews, Van Winkle readily admitted he had sampled the song and claimed his 1990 statement was a joke; others, however, suggested he had been serious.&lt;ref name="Stillman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_766d27d2-dc56-5ff3-9040-47e44d46094f.html |title=''Word to your mother''|accessdate=2009-02-13 |last=Stillman |first=Kevin |coauthors= |date=February 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Iowa State Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Nick |authorlink=Nick Adams (comedian) |title=Making Friends with Black People |year=2006 |publisher=Kensington Books |isbn=0-7582-1295-X |page=75 |chapter=When White Rappers Attack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Winkle later paid Mercury and Bowie, who have since been given songwriting credit for the sample.&lt;ref name="Stillman"/&gt;

More dramatically, [[Biz Markie]]'s album ''I Need a Haircut'' was withdrawn in 1992 following a US federal court ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc. |vol=780 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=182 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1991 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/780/182/1445286/ |accessdate=2018-03-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his use of a sample from [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]]'s "[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]" was willful infringement. This case had a powerful effect on the record industry, with record companies becoming very much concerned with the legalities of sampling, and demanding that artists make full declarations of all samples used in their work. On the other hand, the ruling also made it more attractive to artists and record labels to allow others to sample their work, knowing that they would be paid&amp;mdash;often handsomely&amp;mdash;for their contribution.

A notable case in the early 1990s involved the dispute between the group [[Negativland]] and [[Casey Kasem]] over the band's use of un-aired vocal snippets from Kasem's radio program American Top 40 on the Negativland single "[[Negativland#U2 record incident|U2]]".

Sample clearance is when you can get permission from the song owners to use it as a sample.  Once you have the permission to use it, you have the "Clearance" to use the song.   To get a clearance you have to get permission from the song owner, and the recording owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makeitinmusic.com/sample-clearance-tale/|title=Sample clearance - a cautionary tale|date=2011-10-11|work=Make It In Music|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable case involved British [[Electronic Dance Music|dance music]] act [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]]. Shut Up and Dance were a fairly successful [[Breakbeat Hardcore]] and [[rave music|rave]] scene outfit who, like their contemporaries, had liberally used samples in the creation of their music - without '''sample clearance'''&lt;!--"Sample clearance" and related terms link to this section.--&gt; from the individuals concerned.  Although frowned upon, the British music industry usually turned a blind eye to this mainly underground scene, however, with rave at its commercial peak in the UK, Shut Up and Dance released the single "Raving I'm Raving", an upbeat breakbeat hardcore record which shot to #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1992. At the core of "Raving" were significant samples of [[Marc Cohn]]'s hit single "[[Walking in Memphis]]" with some of the lyrical content changed and sung by Peter Bouncer. Shut Up and Dance hadn't sought clearance from Marc Cohn for the samples they used in "Raving" and Marc Cohn took legal action against Shut Up and Dance for breach of copyright. An out of court settlement was eventually reached between Shut Up and Dance and Cohn which saw "Raving" in its current form banned and the proceeds from the single given to charity. Shut Up and Dance were later commissioned to produce remixes for [[Cher]]'s 1995 cover version of "Walking In Memphis" and were allowed by Cohn to use parts from the deleted "Raving I'm Raving" for this remix. Undeterred from earlier sampling issues they then went on to have relatively good success in the UK with a cover of [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[Save A Prayer]]", entitled "Save it til the mourning after" reaching No. 25 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1995.

The Shut Up and Dance case had major ramifications on the use of samples in the UK and most artists and record labels now seek clearance for samples they use. However, there are still cases which involve UK artists using uncleared samples. In October 1996, [[The Chemical Brothers]] released the single "[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]" inspired by [[The Beatles]]' "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and featuring [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] [[Noel Gallagher]] on vocals - a well-known admirer of The Beatles' work. Setting Sun hit #1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on its first week of release and the common consensus was The Chemical Brothers had sampled/looped significant parts of Tomorrow Never Knows in the creation of Setting Sun. The three remaining Beatles took legal action against the Chemical Brothers/[[Virgin Records]] for copyright infringement, however, a [[musicology|musicologist]] proved the Chemical Brothers had independently created Setting Sun - albeit in a similar vein to Tomorrow Never Knows.

In 1997, the [[The Verve|Verve]] had a hit single with "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", which samples a 1965 symphonic version of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] song "[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]". Rolling Stones manager [[Allen Klein]] sued, claiming they had used a longer-than-agreed sample, and the Verve lost all songwriting royalties and publishing rights. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said the case "can either be viewed as a cautionary tale or one of the most unjust chapters in musical copyright history".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-lists/songs-on-trial-12-landmark-music-copyright-cases-166396/de-la-soul-vs-the-turtles-1991-61686/|title=Songs on Trial: 12 Landmark Music Copyright Cases|last=Runtagh|first=Jordan|date=2016-06-08|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In the middle of 2001, [[Mariah Carey]] released her first single from ''Glitter'', entitled "Loverboy", which featured a sample of "[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Firecracker]]" by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. A month later, [[Jennifer Lopez]] released "[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]" with the same "Firecracker" sample. Carey quickly discarded it and replaced it with "Candy" by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]].

In 2001, [[Armen Boladian]] and his company [[Bridgeport Music|Bridgeport Music Inc.]] filed over 500 copyright infringement suits against 800 artists using samples from [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s catalogue.

[[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] recorded a track entitled "Psycho of Greed" (2002) for their album ''[[Revolverlution]]'' that contained a continuous looping sample from [[The Beatles]]' track "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]". However, the clearance fee demanded by [[Capitol Records]] and the surviving Beatles was so high that the group decided to pull the track from the album.

[[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]] with the release of ''[[The Grey Album]]'' in 2004, which is a remix of [[The Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled album]] and rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'' has been embroiled in a similar situation with the [[record label]] [[EMI]] issuing [[cease and desist]] orders over uncleared Beatles samples.

On March 19, 2006, a judge ordered that sales of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s album ''[[Ready to Die]]'' be halted because the title track sampled a 1972 song by the [[Ohio Players]], "Singing in the Morning", without permission.&lt;ref name=biggie&gt;{{cite news

In 2007 the song "[[Do It (Nelly Furtado song)|Do It]]" performed by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Nelly Furtado]] was revealed to actually be "Acidjazzed Evening", a [[chiptune]]-style track composed by the Finnish demoscene artist [[Janne Suni]], but with muted bassline, added rums and lyrics. [[Timbaland]], the song's producer, admitted to "sampling" Suni's work, but did not believe his usage constituted "stealing". See [[Timbaland plagiarism controversy]]

On November 20, 2008, electronic band [[Kraftwerk]] convinced the German Federal Supreme Court that even the smallest shreds of sounds ("Tonfetzen") are "copyrightable" (e.g. protected), and that sampling a few bars of a drum beat can be an infringement.&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1504982 Metall Auf Metall (Kraftwerk, et al. v.

===2010s===

In 2011, Lynn Tolliver won a $1.2 million lawsuit over unauthorized sampling of his song "[[I Need a Freak]]", most notably used by [[The Black Eyed Peas|Black Eyed Peas]] in the song "[[My Humps]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/black-eyed-peas--2/57591|title = DJ wins $1.2 million in lawsuit over 'My Humps' sample |website = NME.com|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2011/06/former_cleveland_dj_lynn_tolli.html|title = Former Cleveland DJ Lynn Tolliver wins $1.2 million in music sample suit|website = cleveland.com|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theboombox.com/rapper-wins-lawsuit-over-black-eyed-peas-sample/|title = Rapper Wins Lawsuit Over Black Eyed Peas Sample|website = The Boombox|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was back in court in 2014 over royalty issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://legacy.wkyc.com/story/news/local/summit-county/2014/08/19/ninth-district-state-court-can-hear-dispute-among-authors-of-part-of-black-eyed-peas-hit-song/14289217/|title = Summit County: Court to hear authors dispute of Black Eyed Peas song|website = WKYC|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] won a lawsuit against the estate of [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] over the sampling of "Jimmy Smith Rap", a spoken-word piece, in his song [[Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2|"Pound Cake" / "Paris Morton Music 2"]]. A district judge ruled that Drake's manipulation of a passage from the piece, which discussed the superiority of [[jazz music]] over other genres, was a transformative use.&lt;ref name="thr-jsrsampling"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drake Beats Lawsuit Over Sampling With Winning "Fair Use" Argument|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/drake-beats-lawsuit-sampling-winning-fair-use-argument-1008935|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues in practice===
The most recent significant copyright case involving sampling held that even sampling three notes could constitute copyright infringement (''[[Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films]]'', 410 F.3d 792 (6th Cir. 2005)). This case was roundly criticized by many in the music industry, including the [[RIAA]].

There has been a second important US case on music sampling involving the [[Beastie Boys]] who sampled the sound recording of a flute track by [[James Newton]] in their song "Pass the Mic." The Beastie Boys properly obtained a license to use the sound recording but did not clear the use of the ''song'' (the composition on which the recording is based including any music and lyrics). In ''Newton v. Diamond and Others'' 349 F.3d 591 (9th Cir. 2003) the US Appeals Court held that the use of the looped sample of a flute did not constitute copyright infringement as the core of the song itself had not been used.

A June 2006 case involving [[Ludacris]] and [[Kanye West]] held that their use of the phrases "like that" and "straight like that" which had been used on an earlier hip-hop track by another artist was not infringing use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kanye, Ludacris Prevail In Copyright Case|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58252/kanye-ludacris-prevail-in-copyright-case|website=http://billboard.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Orleans–based company [[Cash Money Records]] and former rapper [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] were taken to court by local performer DJ Jubilee (signed to Take Fo' Record Label) for using chants from his song titled "Back That Ass Up". Both artists had used the same chant in each song, but Juvenile won the case because of the title's name change to "Back That Azz Up", which sold 2 million copies. Because of the name change, Jubilee lacked evidence that Juvenile had stolen from him, and Jubilee could not earn Juvenile's income from his song.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Today, most mainstream acts obtain prior authorization to use samples, a process known as "clearing" (gaining permission to use the sample and, usually, paying an up-front fee and/or a cut of the royalties to the original artist). Independent bands, lacking the funds and legal assistance to clear samples, are at a disadvantage - unless they seek the services of a professional sample replay company or producer.

[[Creative Commons]] licenses allow for legal sampling of the work as long as the license does not carry the No Derivatives (ND) tag and the derivative work complies with other license conditions.

The '''Legislative Council of Eastern-Bengal and Assam'''&lt;ref name="Bareh2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamlet Bareh|title=Encyclopaedia of North-East India: Assam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odY_PWn7pesC&amp;pg=PA271|year=2001|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-789-4|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[legislative council]] of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]], a province of the [[British Indian Empire]] covering [[Bangladesh]] and [[Northeast India]]. It would meet in the Government House of [[Dacca]], the provincial capital. Its ex-officio head was the Lieutenant Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/core/parliamentinfo.aspx?committee=assam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==
The first Legislative Council was formed under the [[Indian Councils Act 1892]]. The Lt. Governor recommended members from the recommendations of District Boards, municipalities, landlords and chambers of commerce. The Lt. Governor required the assent of the [[Viceroy of India]] to appoint the nominees. The council was entitled to discuss budgets and make suggestions to the government, but lacked voting powers. Most members of the council were Europeans, with a minority being native Indian subjects.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bengal_Legislative_Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morley-Minto Reforms==
The [[Indian Councils Act 1909]], crafted by [[John Morley]] and [[Lord Minto]], ushered partially elected legislative councils. The reforms increased the representation of native subjects. Land owners received the [[right to vote]]. [[Muslims]] were granted the right to a [[separate electorate]], as part of [[affirmative action]]. The Legislative Council assembled for the purpose of making Laws and Regulations under the Provisions of the Indian Council Acts, 1861, 1892 and 1909. It advised the Executive Council of the Lt. Governor.&lt;ref&gt;Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). "Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909", in The Government of India. Clarendon Press. pp. 432-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bengal_Legislative_Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The council included 41 members after the Morley-Minto Reforms. Its composition is illustrated in the following.&lt;ref name="Broomfield1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. H. Broomfield|title=Elite Conflict in a Plural Society: Twentieth-century Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2jUSq08eCcC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1968|publisher=University of California Press|page=38|id=GGKEY:PGQKZ3RNLLG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic coverage==
East Bengal had the most seats on the council due to its large population. Colonial Assam, which covers the Indian states of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Nagaland]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]; had 5 seats on the 41-member council due to its smaller population.

[[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]], Article 52, provides for the general protection of civilian objects, hindering attacks to military objectives.  Article 52 states, "''In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.''"

Any attack must be justified by [[military necessity]]:  An attack or action must be intended to help in the military defeat of the enemy, it must be an attack on a military objective,&lt;ref name="military objective"&gt;Article 52 of ''Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides a widely-accepted definition of military objective: "In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage" {{harv|Moreno-Ocampo|2006|loc=page 5, footnote 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Collateral damage|harm caused to civilians or civilian property]] must be [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] and not "excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated".&lt;ref name="military objective"/&gt;

Some targets are clearly legitimate. These include all military personnel who are not ''[[Hors de combat]]''. It also includes anyone who takes a direct part in military hostilities. It also include military equipment and bases and any buildings used as fortifications whether designed as such or used by the military ad hoc.{{sfn|Rado|2001}}

Civilian infrastructure such as, rail, road, ports, airports and telecommunications used for the transportation of military assets, or used by the military for electronic communications are all considered to be legitimate military targets.{{sfn|Rado|2001}}

Where it start to get more nuanced is if the harm to civilians or civilian property is "excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated". During the [[Second World War]] there was a song called ''[[The Thing-Ummy Bob|a thing-ummy-bob]]'' which contain the lines "And it's the girl that makes the thing that holds the oil, that oils the ring that works the thing-ummy-bob, that's going to win the war".{{sfn|Jones|2006|page=196}} Whether such a girl is a legitimate target is an area that probably has to be decided on a case by case basis.  However  Protocol I suggests that if it is not clear, then the parties to the conflict should err on the side of caution as Article 52 states "In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house, or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used".&lt;ref name="military objective"/&gt;{{sfn|Rado|2001}}

The '''Maxims of Islamic Law''' were established after representatives of all schools of thought regarding Muslim Jurisprudence came together to reach a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Abd-Allah, Umar Faruq. "Islam and the cultural imperative." CrossCurrents (2006): 357-375. [http://www.nawawi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Article3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}
Maxims refer to a body of abstract rules that were produced after a detailed study of the fiqh. They’re theoretical guidelines corresponding to different areas of [[fiqh]], which may be dealing with anything from evidence to [[matrimonial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamali, Mohammad Hashim. Principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The Islamic Text Society, 1991., https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single2/en_Principles_of_Islamic_Jurisprudence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fiqh]] is Islamic jurisprudence,through the human interpretation of [[Islamic law]].

==The five Normative Maxims of Islamic law are==
* Al-umuru bi-maqasidiha: Acts are judged by the intention behind them
* Ad-dararu yuzal: Harm must be eliminated 
* Al-yaqinu la yazulu bish-shakk: Certainty is not overruled by doubt
* Al-'addatu muhakkamatun: Custom is the basis of judgement
* Al-mashaqqatu tujlab at-taysir: Hardship begets facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godlas|first1=Alan|title=The five Universal Maxims of Islamic Law|url=http://islam.uga.edu/law_maxims.html|website=Islamic Studies- University of Georgia|accessdate=16 November 2016|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Nauru]] on 27 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=51785 |title=Nauru Government confident that public will back constitutional reforms |publisher=Rnzi.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked to vote on amendments to the [[Constitution of Nauru|constitution]], most notably a change to a directly elected [[President of Nauru|president]] (instead of one chosen by [[Parliament of Nauru|parliament]]) and a strengthening of human rights legislation (but also a clarification of the distribution of powers and other, less notable amendments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201002/2810451.htm?desktop |title=Stories:Nauru to hold constitutional referendum |publisher=Australia Network News |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-thirds majority was required for the amendments to pass.&lt;ref name="naurugov1"&gt;[http://www.naurugov.nr/parliament/projects/constitution/index.html#referendum Constitutional Review Project] Parliament of Nauru&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was part of a large-scale constitutional renewal; the referendum had to be held to approve changes to some especially protected parts of the constitution, while other changes were made by simple parliamentary vote. Any changes would only take effect on the day of the next general election, likely in May/June 2011.&lt;ref name="naurugov1"/&gt;

Turnout was 78%, with almost 4,400 votes cast; the constitutional changes were rejected by majority of two thirds, almost 3,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201002/2832338.htm?desktop |title=Stories:Changes to Nauru's constitution rejected at referendum |publisher=Australia Network News |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=52184 |title=Nauruans vote against proposed Constitutional Amendments |publisher=Rnzi.com |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered immediately afterwards whether another referendum might be held at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=52201 |title=Nauru leaders disappointed with referendum rebuff |publisher=Rnzi.com |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Non-combatant''' is a [[term of art]] in the [[law of war]] and [[international humanitarian law]], describing [[civilian]]s who are not taking a direct part in hostilities;&lt;ref&gt;Article 51.3 of [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]] explains that "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;/ref&gt; persons—such as [[combat medic]]s and [[military chaplain]]s—who are members of the [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] but are protected because of their specific duties (as currently described in [[Protocol I]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]], adopted in June 1977); [[combatant]]s who are placed ''[[hors de combat]]''; and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[nationality|nationals]] (including [[military personnel]]) who are not fighting for one of the belligerents involved in an [[armed conflict]]. This particular status was first recognized under the [[Geneva Conventions]] with the [[First Geneva Convention]] of 1864.

Article 42 of Protocol I states that [[Attacks on parachutists|pilots and aircrews who are parachuting from aircraft in distress cannot be attacked]] regardless of what territory they are over. If pilots or aircrews land in territory controlled by the enemy, they must be given an opportunity to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] before being attacked unless it is apparent that they are engaging in a hostile act or attempting to escape. [[Airborne forces]] who are descending by [[parachute]] from an aircraft, whether it is disabled or not, are not given the protection afforded by this Article and, therefore, may be attacked during their descent unless they are ''[[hors de combat]]''.

Article 50 of Protocol 1 defines a civilian as a person who is not a privileged combatant. Article 51 describes the protection that must be given to civilians (unless they are [[unprivileged combatant]]s) and civilian populations. Chapter III of Protocol I regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] also prohibits attacks directed against civilians.

While not all [[State (polity)|states]] have ratified Protocol I or the Rome Statute, these provisions reiterated existing customary laws of war which is binding of all belligerents in an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Customary laws of war:
*{{cite web|author=ICRC |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter1_rule3 |title=Customary IHL: Rule 3. Definition of Combatants|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |accessdate=April 2014}}

Article 3 in the general section of the [[Geneva Conventions]] states that in the case of armed conflict not of an international character (occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties) that each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions to "persons taking no active part in the hostilities" (non-combatants).&lt;ref name="GCIV Art 3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Plenipotentiaries  |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5 |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

The term is widely used in economics in this sense. In certain cases, it proceeds under very specifically defined forms, such as driving stakes or other such markers into the land claimed, which form gave rise to the term “staking a claim.” "[[adverse possession|Squatter’s rights]]" are another form of appropriation, but are usually asserted against land to which ownership rights of another party have been recognized. In legal regimes recognizing such acquisition of property, the ownership of duly appropriated holdings enjoys such protections as the law provides for ownership of property in general.

Under some systems using this method of acquiring ownership of land, it is permitted to employ violence in defending the duly appropriated holding against encroachment against the ownership or usage claims, again usually according to specifically defined forms including warnings to the encroaching party, exhaustion or unavailability of duly constituted law-enforcement resources, etc..

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] and other property-rights-oriented ideologies define appropriation as requiring the “mixing” of the would-be owner’s labor with the land claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N.: ''[[Man, Economy and State]] with [[Power and Market]]'', page 169. Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example of such mixing is [[farming]], although various extractive activities such as mining, and the grazing of herds are often recognized. Personal, physical residence is often recognized after some minimum documented continuous period of time, as is built structures on the land whose ownership has not previously been recognized by the authority whose recognition is sought.

Appropriation through use can apply to resources other than the exclusive right to use of the surface of the land. As mentioned, mineral rights are recognized under various conditions, as are [[riparian rights]]. Appropriation can apply to inland waters within a certain distance of appropriated land, and even to the liquid water in a reservoir, lake, or stream. {{cnspan|text=Appropriation has been applied under common law to resources as disparate as radio broadcast frequencies and [[Internet]] Web site names|date=February 2016}}, but many such claims have been overturned through legislated arrangements mandating other standards for the assignment of ownership rights in such things.

Appropriation as a means of acquiring property is related to the schools of thought that call for ongoing use as a condition of continued ownership, as is the case in some regimes with trademarks, but it applies to initial ownership.

The '''Prelinger Archives''' is a collection of [[films]] relating to [[U.S. cultural history]], the evolution of the American [[landscape]], [[everyday life]] and [[social history]].&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;  It was physically located in [[New York City]] from 1982–2002 and is now in [[San Francisco]].

The Archives were founded by [[Rick Prelinger]] in 1982&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Audio: [http://www.kqed.org/epArchive/R905141000 Richard and Megan Prelinger] interview at [[KQED-FM]] (NPR) (1 hour)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to preserve what he calls "[[ephemeral]]" films: films sponsored by corporations and organizations, educational films, and amateur and home movies. Typically, [[Sponsored_film|ephemeral films]] were produced to fulfill specific purposes at specific times, and many exist today only by chance or accident.  About 65% of the Archive's holdings are in the [[public domain]] because their copyrights have expired, or because they were U.S. productions that were published without proper copyright notice.

The stated goal of the Prelinger Archives is to "collect, preserve, and facilitate access to films of historic significance that haven't been collected elsewhere."

By 2001, it had acquired 60,000 completed films of varying lengths and over 30,000 cans of unedited film. In 2002, the [[Library of Congress]] acquired the physical films held in the Archives as of that date;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.panix.com/~footage/lcfaq.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Archives made two subsequent donations to Library of Congress totalling some 65,000 cans of film, primarily industrial and educational titles.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; As of spring 2015, the Archives holds about 8,000 films in videotape and digital form, approximately 14,000 home movies, and 1,000 industrial and sponsored films acquired since 2002.

Compared to many other moving image archives, Prelinger Archives provides a relatively high level of public access to its collections.  Over 6,400 [[public domain]] films are available for download and unrestricted reuse on the Internet at the [[Internet Archive]]. All the films in the archives can be licensed for production use through [[Getty Images]].

Prelinger Archives currently focuses principally on collecting home movies and amateur film from North America.

[[File:Pro-test-June2006.jpg|right|thumb|A Pro-Test march on 3 June 2006, [[Oxford]], UK]]
'''Pro-Test''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] group that promoted and supported [[animal testing]] in [[medical research]]. It was founded on 29 January 2006 to counter [[SPEAK (animals)|SPEAK]], an animal-rights campaign opposing the construction by [[Oxford University]] of a [[Health science|biomedical]] and [[Animal testing|animal-research]] facility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/hcruling.shtml University of Oxford News Release: High Court Ruling] (10 November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; which SPEAK believes may include a [[primate]]-testing centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speakcampaigns.org.uk/primatelab.php SPEAK website: The New Primate Laboratory] (undated) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201151235/http://speakcampaigns.org.uk/primatelab.php |date=1 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Test held its first rally on 25 February 2006, attracting hundreds in support of the research facility and opposed by a smaller number of anti-lab demonstrators.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=295032006 Marchers outnumber rights activists] (''[[The Scotsman]]'', 24 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded by Laurie Pycroft from [[Swindon]] when he was 16. After forming the group, British newspapers described Pycroft as a "[[sixth form]] drop-out," "bedroom [[wikt:Blogger|blogger]],"&lt;ref name="bblogger"&gt;[http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1717620,00.html Bedroom blogger, 16, takes on animal rights protesters] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 25 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and "campaigning hero."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2058853,00.html Focus: A campaigning hero] (''[[The Times]]'', 26 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It is now run by a committee of ten: academics ([[Tipu Aziz]], John Stein, and David Priestman), five Oxford graduate and undergraduate students, medical writer Alison Eden, and Pycroft.&lt;ref name=committee&gt;[http://www.pro-test.org.uk/ "The Pro-Test Committee"], Pro-Test website, retrieved 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Test says that it stands for "science, reasoned debate and, above all, the welfare of mankind. … We support only non-violent [[protest]] and we condemn those using violence or intimidation to further their goals. We strongly support animal testing as crucially necessary to further medical science."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test.org.uk/About.php Pro-Test website]  (undated) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015165110/http://www.pro-test.org.uk/About.php |date=15 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, five years after its first rally, Pro-Test wound up its activities, saying it had "successfully met its goals of defending the construction of the Oxford Lab, increasing awareness of the importance of animal research, and bringing the public on-side in support of life-saving medical research." Its US-based spin-off, Speaking of Research, remained active in the UK and US.

==Background==
The construction site of the [[Oxford]] research centre is located on [[South Parks Road]] behind a five-metre (15&amp;nbsp;ft) barrier. Construction work is carried out by workmen wearing balaclavas and using unmarked vehicles, after the first contractor, Walter Lilly, owned by Montpellier plc, pulled out in the face of threats.&lt;ref name="scientists"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,,1716797,00.html?gusrc=rss Scientists to speak out for animal tests] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is intended to become the "centre for all animal research at Oxford," according to Mark Matfield, former director of the [[Research Defence Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/news/20040720/02/ Activists halt Oxford lab] (''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'' 20 July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in "the closure of a number of existing animal facilities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/biomed.shtml University of Oxford News Release: Biomedical research facility] (19 July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Pro-Test coincided with threats made by the [[Animal Liberation Front]], against Oxford staff and students, on the ''[[Bite Back]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/communiques/2006-02-02_oxford.htm Communiqué from ALF activists]  (2 February 2006) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622213254/http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/communiques/2006-02-02_oxford.htm |date=22 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ALF spokesman, [[Robin Webb]] confirmed that "high-level student groups working against [[SPEAK (animals)|SPEAK]] protesters may be targeted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk3/news/students_will_be_the_next_target Students will be the next target] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218163556/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk3/News/students_will_be_the_next_target |date=18 February 2006 }} (''[[The Oxford Student]]'', 12 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pycroft describes in his [[blog]], hosted at the [[LiveJournal]] website, how he set up Pro-Test after visiting his girlfriend in Oxford on 28 January 2006 and watching a SPEAK demonstration from the window of a coffee shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sqrrl101.livejournal.com/145774.html Science: 1 Ignorance: 0] (''[[LiveJournal]]'' entry, dated 28 January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test.org.uk/Action.php Pro-Test website: Past Action]  (undated) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015165115/http://www.pro-test.org.uk/Action.php |date=15 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pycroft, his girlfriend, and one other, staged a personal counter-[[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]].

After writing about the experience on his blog, Pycroft has said he was receiving 300 hits an hour within days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/students/comment/story/0,,1700196,00.html In praise of ... student protest] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and after attracting interest from the media, Oxford students, and the pro-animal-testing movement, he decided to schedule a second demonstration to coincide with a SPEAK protest on 25 February 2006. According to ''The Times'', "Pro-Test’s tactics mirror those of [[animal rights]] activists, with about 150 students using websites and chat forums to organise protests."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2019256,00.html Students fight back for animal research] (''[[The Times]]'' 1 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Daily Telegraph,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XUETSVKHA2ME1QFIQMGSFFOAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2006/02/26/nvivi26.xml] "Telegraph"&lt;/ref&gt; over 800 students, academics and members of the public took part in the 25 February 2006 protest in the centre of [[Oxford]] which passed without violent incident,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/default.asp?dismode=article&amp;artid=5800  Police praise protestors after peaceful demonstrations - Oxford]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Thames Valley Police website, 25 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; marching at the same time as more than 150 SPEAK protestors&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/4750516.stm Animal lab supporters go on march] ([[BBC News]] website, 25 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated in various locations across the city.

A number of politicians and scientists addressed the Pro-Test demonstrators. These included [[Evan Harris]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] science spokesperson and MP for [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]]; the Radcliffe Hospital's neurosurgeon and Pro-Test committee member Professor [[Tipu Aziz]],&lt;ref name=committee/&gt; whose research into [[Parkinson's disease]] "involves the use of primates," &lt;ref name="scientists"/&gt; and who recently spoke out in support of testing [[cosmetics]] on animals;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,,1723189,00.html "Scientist backs animal testing for cosmetics"] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Festing]] of the [[Research Defence Society]], a lobby group funded by the pharmaceutical industry and universities; and Pro-Test committee member Professor John Stein,&lt;ref name=committee/&gt; an Oxford [[neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] who "induces Parkinson's disease in monkeys and then attaches [[electrode]]s to their brains to test therapies which may help human sufferers," according to ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name="bblogger"/&gt; In his speech to the crowd, Stein declared, "This is a historic day; we are drawing a line in the sand." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/content/news-storypage.jsp?id=1025192 "Oxford swamped by Protest demo"] , [[4 News]] website, 25 February 2006. {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==June 2006 rally==
Supporters of Pro-Test marched through Oxford on Saturday, 3 June 2006. Their route led them through Radcliffe Square, the High Street and ended nearby the laboratory in the University's science area. Speakers included [[Colin Blakemore]] (then chief executive of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]), [[Evan Harris]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and [[Alan Duncan]] MP (the [[Shadow Cabinet]] [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|Trade and Industry Secretary]]). David Priestman, a researcher of [[genetic disorder]]s in children at Oxford University, told the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' his reasons for joining the rally:&lt;ref&gt;Emma-Kate Lidbury. [http://www.oxfordmail.net/news/headlines/display.var.782908.0.protest_rally_gains_support.php Pro-test rally gains support], ''Oxford Mail'', 5 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|I have worked in animal research for nearly 30 years and at last I can speak out about what I do. I'm exceptionally proud of my work. What right have animal rights activists to say my work is not scientific?}}

==February 2008 rally==
Pro-Test held a third rally in Oxford on 9 February 2008. According to the BBC, around 200 people marched in protest at "fear and intimidation" from animal rights groups.&lt;ref name=BBCFeb&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7236585.stm Pro-animal testing group in rally], ''[[BBC News]]'', 9 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the start of the event, a lone animal rights protestor started to shout in counter protest, but was escorted away by the police.&lt;ref name=BBCFeb/&gt;

Speakers at the rally included Robin Lovell-Badge, a [[stem cell]] researcher at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Evan Harris and Laurie Pycroft. Peter Hollins, chief executive of the [[British Heart Foundation]] and chair of the [[Coalition for Medical Progress]], was also scheduled to attend but was unable due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test.org.uk/index.php Pro-Test Celebrates Science and Battles Extremism], Pro-test website&gt;  11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-Test in the United States==
In Spring 2008, Pro-Test Spokesman, Tom Holder, set up [[Speaking of Research]], a group based in the US with similar goals to that of Pro-Test&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS184569+28-Mar-2008+PRN20080328 Reuters - Speaking of Research: Students Stand up for Animal Testing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006103232/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS184569+28-Mar-2008+PRN20080328 |date=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2009 more than 700 staff, students and Los Angeles residents led by the neuroscientist Professor David Jentsch held a rally to launch the UCLA chapter of Pro-Test, and to stand up to the animal rights extremists who has targeted Prof. Jentsch and other scientists in a campaign of harassment and arson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/supporters-of-biomedical-research-89486.aspx UCLA Newstoom: Supporters of Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-animals23-2009apr23,0,3197423.story LA Times]&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, Tom Holder announced the launch of The Pro-Test Petition which aims to give people in the US the "opportunity to show [their] support for the scientists and [their] opposition to the use of threats and violence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raisingvoices.net The Pro-Test Petition]&lt;/ref&gt; This petition, to defend animal research, is similar to [[The People's Petition]] which gained over 20,000 signatures in the United Kingdom.

==Other activities==
An unnamed Oxford academic told the BBC that "a war is looming over 'scientific freedom' and the 'future of progress'," and suggests that the Pro-Test campaign is part of a wider reaction against animal-rights activism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4739376.stm  The pro-test protesters] ([[BBC News]] website, 22 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Test have taken the case for animal research to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], participating in a debate at The Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW). The debate focused specifically upon whether the Oxford biomedical research lab should be built and involved both MPs and members of the public. The principal speakers were Iain Simpson, press officer for Pro-Test, and Dr. Jarrod Bailey of Europeans for Medical Progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_PageID=2180&amp;i_ToolbarID=6 'Dirty dozen' claims debunked in parliamentary debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002110930/http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_ToolbarID=6&amp;i_PageID=2180 |date=2 October 2006 }} ([[Research Defence Society]] website, 15 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Test handed out doughnuts and cakes to workers on the South Parks Road site on 31 March 2006 to show their support for their work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1744052,00.html Student group shows support for Oxford lab builders] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Test fielded Pycroft for a debate at the [[Oxford Union]] on the motion "This house would not test on animals". Supporting the motion were Dr [[Gill Langley]], Dr Andrew Knight, [[Uri Geller]] and Alistair Currie. On the opposing side were Pycroft, Professor [[Colin Blakemore]], Professor John Stein and Professor Lord [[Robert Winston]]. The motion was defeated, 273 to 48 of the Union members voting with the opposing side.

A cross-college student [[referendum]] proposed by Pro-Test was held on 16 November 2006. It proposed support for the Oxford lab's construction and animal testing in general, and found support from approximately 90% of voters. [http://www.pro-test.org.uk/b2evo/index.php?blog=5&amp;title=90_4_of_oxford_students_support_animal_r&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1]

On 9 May 2006, the [[BBC]] reported that Pro-Test had bought ten shares in [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK), as a "gesture of solidarity" with the company and its investors. An animal rights group had earlier sent letters to individual [[shareholders]] threatening to reveal personal details unless their shares were sold.

Pro-Test announced that their share purchase was to demonstrate that "intimidation has no place in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4756381.stm  Glaxo wins injunction over threat] ([[BBC News]] website, 9 May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] gave his support to Pro-Test and [[The People's Petition]] in an article for the ''Sunday Telegraph'', citing "the Pro-Test demonstration in Oxford, which... deserves support" as an example of the change in public attitudes in the UK. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/14/nrights214.xml] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909030103/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt2006wk4/news/blair_speaks_out_in_support_of_pro-test] [http://www.oxfordmail.net/news/headlines/display.var.761191.0.pms_protest_stance_welcomed.php]

The BBC programme [[Newsnight]] hosted a debate on animal testing on 24 July 2006. Tipu Aziz, John Stein and Iain Simpson of Pro-Test featured in the debate, as did members of SPEAK and Europeans for Medical Progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5210868.stm Half 'against funding animal labs'] [[Newsnight]], 24 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==
In February 2011, five years after its first rally, Pro-Test announced that it had wound up its activities after it claimed to have "successfully met its goals of defending the construction of the Oxford Lab, increasing awareness of the importance of animal research, and bringing the public on-side in support of life-saving medical research." However, its initially US-based spin-off, [[Speaking of Research]], "continues to be active in the UK and US."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test.org.uk/ Pro-Test]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-Test Italia==
[[File:Manifestazione pro-test Milano.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A Pro-Test Italia demonstration in [[Milan]]]]
In September 2012, an [[Italy|Italian]] spin-off of Pro-Test was created and named "[[:it:Pro-Test|Pro-Test Italia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/voice-of-pro-test-1.12945 Pro-Test Italia] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 8 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been founded by a group of scientists and students concerned about the spiralling of violence and pressure over government and public opinion against [[animal testing]]; these circumstances led to the closure of "Green Hill", a beagle-breeding facility in Northern Italy in July 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/court-orders-temporary-closure-of-italian-dog-breeding-premises-1.11121 Court orders temporary closure of Italian dog-breeding premises] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 2 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; after several raids during the previous months by animal-rights activists, one of which including the stealing of some dogs from the facility on 28 April 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Manifestazione Pro-Test Italia Roma 2.jpg|thumb|300px|A Pro-Test Italia demonstration in [[Rome]]]]
On 20 April 2013, another foray to an animal testing facility took place at the [[University of Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/animal-rights-activists-wreak-havoc-in-milan-laboratory-1.12847 Animal-rights activists wreak havoc in Milan laboratory] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 22 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the release of mice and rabbits and consistent damage to researches carried out for years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35291/title/Italy-Animal-Lab-Trashed/ Italy Animal Lab Trashed] ([[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] 24 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;). It was made by the same group of activists, united under the banner of "Stop Green Hill".&lt;br /&gt;
Following this event, Pro-Test Italia called for a rally in defense of animal testing on 1 June in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=theScientist&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35850/title/Defending-Animal-Research/ Defending Animal Research] ([[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] 4 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It was meant to condemn the animal-rights activists’ actions and to raise awareness about the importance of animal testing in medical research.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/italian-scientists-fight-back-on-animal-testing-1.13116 Italian scientists fight back on animal testing] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 3 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The protest also had positive press coverage in international scientific journals such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; and [[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]].&lt;ref name=theScientist/&gt;
Some animal-rights activists tried to interfere but the Police prevented any escalation.

On 8 June 2013 Pro-Test Italia organized in various Italian cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiaxlascienza.it/ita/mappa.html Cities involved in "Italia unita per la corretta informazione scientifica"]&lt;/ref&gt; the event "Italia unita per la corretta informazione scientifica" (Italy united for scientific information).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2013/06/around-italy-researchers-rally-defend-science Around Italy, Researchers Rally to Defend Science] ([[Science (journal)|Science]] 10 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiaxlascienza.it/eng/manifesto.html Italy united for scientific information]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2013 a second demonstration took place,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/09/italian-scientists-protest-proposed-animal-law.html Italian scientists protest proposed animal law] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 19 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; this time in [[Rome]], to persuade the Italian government to revise the national amendments to the European Directive 2013/63/EU which could put at risk biomedical research in Italy.

==Pro-Test Deutschland==
In May 2015, a group of students and scientists in Germany decided to follow the example of their colleagues in the UK and Italy and founded "Pro-Test Deutschland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test-deutschland.de/en/ Pro-Test Deutschland]&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Test Deutschland is a non-profit organization that first began as a reaction to the decision made by [[Nikos Logothetis]], director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics]] in [[Tübingen]] to discontinue his research with nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/embattled-max-planck-neuroscientist-quits-primate-research Embattled Neuroscientist Quits Primate Research] ([[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 4 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Logothetis’s  decision came after an undercover animal rights activist had filmed in the monkey facility of the Tübingen institute. The film was broadcast on national television in September 2014, leading to protests and hostility against the institute and against animal research in general.

After these events there was a lack of response by the scientific community to come out publicly in support of basic animal research like that conducted at the Tübingen institute. Many officials seemed quite unprepared for such a situation. Pro-Test Deutschland therefore decided to promote the education of its members and the public about how to speak and communicate about animal research effectively.

Pro-Test Deutschland issued a mission statement in which they point out that scientists do not lack moral fibre but rather a voice to speak about science. Pro-Test Deutschland intends to lend its voice so the public and scientists can engage in an informed and fair debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-test-deutschland.de/en/ueber-uns/mission/ Mission Statement of Pro-Test Deutschland]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Pro-Test UK and Pro-Test Italia, who take a very vocal position for animal research, and raise support through public actions and demonstrations, Pro-Test Deutschland is more interested in sharing information and engendering an open, educated and unbiased debate.

To date Pro-Test Deutschland mostly focuses its activities on maintaining an informative and well-balanced website containing FAQs and fact checking sections as well as on community outreach and media communication. Additionally, Pro-Test Deutschland is engaging with the Tübingen public more directly by means such as information booths in the Market Square. Since journalists in Germany wishing to report on animal research had heretofore been lacking reliable information in German, Pro-Test Deutschland quickly received a lot of attention, with national newspapers printing interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2015/44/tierversuche-affen-labor-tierschutz Warum brauchen wir den Affen?] ([[Die Zeit]] 29 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and national radio inviting one of their speakers to panel discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/tuebingen-verzicht-auf-primatenforschung.1771.de.html?dram:article_id=326555 Verzicht auf Primatenforschung] (Deutschland Radio 29 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Test Deutschland, being initially based in Tübingen, has by now grown to include students and scientists in other German towns and cities such as [[Frankfurt]], [[Bonn]], [[Münster]], [[Göttingen]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-test-deutschland.de/en/engagieren/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">A '''proxy murder''' is when someone commits any type of [[homicide]], most likely by one person ordering another person, or through the use of a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/proxy+murder|title=proxy murder|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hit men ==
A common example of this would be a person contracting a hit man,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=hitman|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hitman|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a hired killer. Hit men commit the act of murder on a specific target or targets, and may receive payment in exchange for the murder or murders committed. This is what is known as contract killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/contract+killing|title=contract killing|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hit men are most often associated with organized crime, e.g. the [[Mafia]] and street gangs, and they have also recently been found on the [[dark web]] advertising their services.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell delivers remarks at the ABA's national institute on bitcoin and other digital currencies. (2015). (). Lanham: Federal Information &amp; News Dispatch, Inc. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1691319644&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honor killing ==
{{main|Honor killing}}
Honor killing is a type of murder when a person kills a member of his or her family for tarnishing the family image. Usually the victim is a woman who has violated sexual norms, such as refusing an arranged marriage or having relationships with unapproved, unrelated men. It is often a proxy murder, in which the order to kill is given out by the head of the family, usually the father, instructing a brother to kill his sister. In some very rare cases, hit men have been hired to perform the honor killings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Deol, S. S. (2014). Honour killings in Haryana State: A content analysis. International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences, 9(2), 192–208. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1676622133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous cases ==

=== John Bodkin Adams ===
A famous case involving proxy murder was that of [[John Bodkin Adams]]. John Bodkin Adams was an Irish physician who was investigated from 1946 to 1952 when 152 of his patients died mysteriously. Out of the 152, 130 of them mentioned Adams in their will, leaving him various amounts of money and items. Adams was accused of having his assisting nurses give lethal doses of opiates. Adams was arrested and tried for several counts of murder. He admitted to helping his nurses deliver morphine to patients, but he said it was to ease their passing, not to kill them. Adams was acquitted for several of the murders, and many others were withdrawn because the cases were not strong enough to hold up in court. In the end, Adams was convicted of fraud for lying on cremation papers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ramsland, Katherine,PhD., C.M.I.-V. (2009). Francis camps: Inside the palace of truth. Forensic Examiner, 18(2), 80-82. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/347577577&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Manson ===
The person instigating a proxy murder may or may not be legally guilty of the crime of murder. This legal distinction varies where in the world the murder takes place. The person who instigated the murder is usually guilty as well. They may be charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, or being an accessory to murder. An example of this is [[Charles Manson]] and the Manson Family Murders. Manson was the leader of the Manson Family cult that resided in California in the late 1960s. In 1969, the Manson Family committed nine murders across a five-week span. One of the more notable people murdered was actress [[Sharon Tate]]. Charles Manson did not commit any of the murders himself, but instructed the members of the Manson family to do it instead. In 1971, Manson was convicted on the charge of conspiracy. The court ruled that Manson had as much guilt tied to him with that of his followers. Manson had been sentenced to 9 concurrent life sentences at the Corcoran State prison in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/30/us/manson-family-murders-fast-facts/index.html|title=Manson Family Murders Fast Facts - CNN.com|last=Library|first=C. N. N.|website=CNN|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mark Hopkinson ===
A notorious case of proxy murder was that of [[Mark Hopkinson]], who ordered the bombing deaths of an attorney and his family in 1977 in [[Evanston, Wyoming]]. That bombing killed attorney Vincent Vehar, his wife, and one of his sons. 
While in prison awaiting trial for the Vehar murders, Hopkinson ordered the torture-murder of one of his employees, Jeff Green, who was about to testify against Hopkinson in court.

The man who bombed the Vehar house received a twenty-year sentence, but the hitmen who murdered Jeff Green have never been found. Hopkinson was nevertheless convicted of ordering all four murders and was executed by [[lethal injection]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukisthoughts.blogspot.com/2018/07/evil-in-heartland-story-of-mark.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/man-who-killed-people-lives-quietly-in-wyoming-s-bridger/article_077eb6c9-d476-57f9-ae67-30b675780630.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority''' (PPDA) is a [[parastatal]] organisation in Uganda that is responsible for regulation and supervision of procurement and disposal of government-owned property and other assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=22 August 2017 | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1335046/ppda-suspends-58-providers | title=PPDA suspends 58 providers | newspaper=[[New Vision]] |
first=Billy |last=Rwothungeyo |date= 27 November 2013 | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The headquarters of the PPDA are located on the 5th Floor, in the [[Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited|UEDCL Towers]], at 37 Nakasero Road, on [[Nakasero|Nakasero Hill]], in the [[Kampala Central Division|Central Division]] of [[Kampala]], the capital and largest city of Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ppda.go.ug/write-to-us/ |title=Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority: Write to Us| location=Kampala | publisher=Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA)| author=PPDA |accessdate=22 August 2017 |date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of the location of the organisation's headquarters are:00°19'34.0"N, 32°34'38.0"E (Latitude:0.326111; Longitude:32.577222).&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps| accessdate=22 August 2017 | url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/0%C2%B019'34.0%22N+32%C2%B034'38.0%22E/@0.3261111,32.5766565,117m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d0.3261111!4d32.5772222 | title=Location of the Headquarters of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 2003, the [[Parliament of Uganda|Ugandan parliament]] enacted the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority Act (PPDA Act). Following that, in February 2003, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA), was created and became operational. It is the "regulator of public procurement and disposal of public assets in Uganda".&lt;ref name="When"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=22 August 2017 | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1315030/public-procurement-disposal-public-assets-authourity | title=Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authourity |location=Kampala |date=4 March 2013 |
author=Vision Reporter |newspaper=[[New Vision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|March 2013}}, the PPDA faced challenges in the following areas: (1) At that time, the 70 employees were not enough to cater to the many services required of staff.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt; (2) The Authority supervises procurement and disposal of assets in the central government and in all local governments across the country. However, the staffing and funding at the authority has remained static since its creation in 2003.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt; (3) The Authority's offices are in Kampala. However, increasingly, the authority's services are needed in far-flung upcountry locations. There is difficulty in meeting the need for the authority's services upcountry, in view of limited resources in the areas of staff and funding.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt; (4) Corruption remains a big challenge.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt; (5) There are inadequate number of trained professionals in procurement in Uganda. The lack of experienced trained procurement officers in the districts and some central government ministries creates hardship in observing procurement regulations and guidelines.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt;

'''''RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.''''', 641 F. Supp. 2d 913 (2009), is a [[United States District Court]] case involving [[RealNetworks]], the movie studios and [[DVD Copy Control Association]] regarding the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)]] claims on the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD, and a breach of license agreement. The district court concluded that RealNetworks violated the [[anti-circumvention]] and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA when the DVD copying software RealDVD bypasses the copy protection technologies of DVD.

This lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of DVDs.

== Background ==
This case involves the digital media company [[RealNetworks]], [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD CCA) and the major motion picture studios. [[RealNetworks]] licensed the [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), a technology commonly used on copyrighted [[DVD]]s to prevent unauthorized copying, from DVD CCA and released the product [[RealDVD]] that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted DVDs.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim&gt;''RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.'',[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/RealDVD/Real%20v%20DVD-CCA%2C%20PI%20Order%20081109.pdf 641 F. Supp. 2d 913], 2009 U.S. Dist. (N.D. Cal. August 11, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some major movie studios feel that RealDVD can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental DVDs instead of purchasing.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Healey, Jon. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/09/mpaa-v-realnetw.html MPAA vs. RealNetworks], The Los Angeles Times, September 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HollywoodHatred&gt;Von Lohmann, Fred.[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/10/why-hollywood-hates-realdvd Why Hollywood Hates ReadDVD], Electronic Frontier Foundation, October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; RealNetworks, on the other hand, believes that copying of DVD is now legal after the favorable ruling of a 2007 California Superior Court case against [[Kaleidescape]], a manufacturer of high-end media servers capable of copying copyrighted DVD content to the servers.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaleidescape&gt;''DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc.'',[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/h031631.pdf 176 Cal. App. 4th 697], 2009 Cal. App. (Cal. App. 4th August 12, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, RealNetworks sued the DVD CCA and several major movie studios on September 30, 2008 seeking for a [[declaratory judgment]] that RealDVD neither violated the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) {{usc|17|1201}} nor breached the licensing contract with DVD CCA. On the same day, the studios sued RealNetworks by alleging that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the contract.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;

== District court ruling ==
The district court issued a [[temporary restraining order]] on October 3, 2008 after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of RealDVD. The temporary restraining order was turned into a [[preliminary injunction]] against RealNetworks on August 11, 2009 by Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]], barring the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD or any other similar software product after the court found that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the CSS licensing agreement with DVD CCA.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimesRuling&gt;Stone, Brad. [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/realnetworks-loses-first-round-in-realdvd-case/ RealNetworks Barred From Selling DVD Copy Maker], The New York Times, August 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCMag&gt;Hachman, Mark. [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2351471,00.asp RealNetworks Loses DVD Copying Decision], PC Magazine, August 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DMCA claims on Content Scramble System ===
The DMCA prohibits circumvention of "effective" access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent "effective" access control or copy control of copyrighted works.&lt;ref name=DMCA&gt;{{usc|17|1201}}&lt;/ref&gt; RealNetworks alleged that that CSS is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked.&lt;ref name=WhyMPAAShouldLose&gt;Von Lohmann, Fred.[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/10/why-mpaa-should-lose-against-realdvd Why MPAA Should Lose Against RealDVD], Electronic Frontier Foundation, October 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flourish&gt;Pegoraro, Rob.[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2009/08/dvd-copying_tools_lose_in_courour.html?pcode=RN&amp;rsrc=vegas.litigation.page.null&amp;cpath=CNT DVD-Copying Tools Lose in Court, Flourish in Real Life], The Washington Post, August 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court ruled that the DMCA statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access and/or copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner. Since the court concluded that CSS is still effective for ordinary uses, the DMCA claim against RealNetworks is valid.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt;

The court decided that RealDVD is primarily designed or produced to circumvent CSS technology. In particular, the court found that the removal of crucial CSS technology in DVD drive-locking, secure storage of content keys on DVD, CSS authentication and CSS bus encryption during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard drive is a circumvention of CSS, even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive.&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt; The court further explained that even though RealNetworks is a licensee of CSS technology, it does not shield RealNetworks from DMCA claim because the removal of CSS technology is a violation of DMCA.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;

=== DMCA claims on Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard ===
RealDVD also circumvented copy control measure in Sony [[ARccOS Protection]] and Macrovision [[RipGuard]], which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the DVDs, by mimicking the way human watches a DVD or by skipping the unreadable data.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt; RealNetworks contended that Sony [[ARccOS]] and Macrovision [[RipGuard]] are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process. The district court rejected this argument because ARccOS and RipGuard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable. RealNetworks then argued that ARccOS and RipGuard are never encountered during normal playback, leaving a back door to copying wide open, thus, they are not effective copy control measures. But the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law, then "effective" copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying. Finally, RealNetworks asserted that regular DVD players can make temporary copies as [[cache (computing)|cache]], so ARccOS and RipGuard do not prevent copying. However, the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback, but copies made by RealDVD are permanent.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;

=== RealNetworks accused of evidence destruction ===
Before the March 16, 2009 hearing the DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. wrote to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel that RealNetworks had destroyed critical pieces of evidence and that this had irrevocably damaged the integrity of the judicial process. The claim was that RealNetworks knew from the start that what they were producing had a high likelihood of resulting in legal action so the company took measures to cover its tracks along the way. The documentation of this released to the public was heavily redacted, however it indicated that RealNetworks intentionally eliminated engineering notebooks, code files, and documents that pointed to the fact that the RealDVD software was mainly produced by hackers.&lt;ref&gt;

The MPAA claims that Real knew from the beginning that it would probably be sued—evidence that could be used to argue that Real knew it was doing something illegal—but has since deleted documents demonstrating that. Other documents, such as relevant code files, waffled between being "no longer in RealNetworks' possession" and being infected with a virus, according to the MPAA.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breach of license agreement ===
RealNetworks argued that it fully complied with the CSS license agreement not only by preserving all of the associated protection but also by adding [[Advanced Encryption System]] (AES) encryption to the copied content so that only the person who made the copy can play back the copied content with RealNetworks' player. However, the court decided that preserving the CSS protection only once during the initial playback of the DVD is not enough and any subsequent absence of CSS technology during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard drive is a contract violation.&lt;ref name=RealPrelim/&gt;

=== Antitrust claims ===
On May 14, 2009, RealNetworks amended the lawsuit to include [[antitrust]] claims against DVD CCA and the major studios, alleging that the delayed product launch of RealDVD, temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are the results of DVD CCA and the movie studios conspiring to deny the licensing of CSS to make hard drive copies of DVD content.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimesRuling/&gt;&lt;ref name=RealAntiTrust&gt;''RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc'',[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2008cv04548/207693/484/ No. 3:2008cv04548(MHP)], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1433 (N.D. Cal. January 8, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court dismissed the claim because consumer can get the same hard drive copies through digital downloads, and some DVDs even come with an additional, non-CSS encrypted DVD that allows the users to copy the content onto the hard drive. Also, even if RealNetworks is able to obtain a license to circumvent CSS, RealNetworks still violated the DMCA for circumventing ARccOS and RipGuard.&lt;ref name=RealAntiTrust/&gt;

== Subsequent development ==
In November 2009, RealNetworks filed an appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], asking to remove the injunction on the sales of RealDVD. RealNetworks claimed that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting a request by the major studios to halt sales of the software and was wrong to presume RealDVD would cause the film industry irreparable harm.&lt;ref name=Appeal&gt;Sandoval, Greg. [http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10394587-261.html RealNetworks appeals injunction on RealDVD sales], Cnet News, November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, RealNetworks and DVD CCA reached a settlement in which RealNetworks agreed to the injunction against selling the RealDVD software and a payment of $4.5 million in legal cost to the studios. It would also refund the payments from the approximately 2,700 current users of RealDVD.&lt;ref name = Settlement&gt;Goel, Vindu.

Despite the defeat of DVD-copying tools in this and other court cases, many similar software, such as [[HandBrake]] which by itself only works with unprotected digital media,&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/SupportFAQ&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be free and widespread on the internet. Some believe that this indicates the ineffectiveness of the major studios' effort to restrict the copying of DVDs through legal rulings.&lt;ref name=HollywoodHatred/&gt;&lt;ref name=DVD-copying&gt;Pegroraro, Rob.

== Summary ==

In ''Remix'' [[Lawrence Lessig]], a [[Harvard]] law professor and a respected voice in what he deems the "[[copyright]] wars", describes the disjuncture between the availability and relative simplicity of [[remix]] technologies and copyright law. Lessig insists that copyright law as it stands now is antiquated for digital media since every "time you use a creative work in a digital context, the technology is making a copy" (98). Thus, amateur use and appropriation of digital technology is under unprecedented control that previously extended only to professional use.

Lessig insists that knowledge and manipulation of multi-media technologies is the current generation's form of "literacy"- what reading and writing was to the previous. It is the [[vernacular]] of today. The children growing up in a world where these technologies permeate their daily life are unable to comprehend why "remixing" is illegal. Lessig insists that amateur appropriation in the digital age cannot be stopped but only 'criminalized'. Thus most corrosive outcome of this tension is that generations of children are growing up doing what they know is "illegal" and that notion has societal implications that extend far beyond [[copyright]] wars. The book is now available as a free download under one of the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons' licenses]] ([[CC BY-NC]] 3.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on remix.lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix Remix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060619/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix |date=2016-04-02 }} on [[scribd.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2011/10/clawback-of-lessigs-remix.html |title=The Clawback of @lessig's "Remix" |date=2011-10-12 |author=Eric Hellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Read-Only Culture vs. Read/Write Culture ==
Lessig outlines two cultures - the read-only culture (RO) and the read/write culture (RW). The '''RO culture''' is the culture we consume more or less passively. The information or product is provided to us by a 'professional' source, the [[content industry]], that possesses an authority on that particular product/information. [[Analog signal|Analog]] technologies inherently supported RO culture's business model of production and distribution and limited the role of the consumer to just that, 'consuming'.

Digital technology, however, does not have the 'natural' constraints of the analog that preceded it. ''"What before was both impossible and illegal is now just illegal"''(38). [[Steve Jobs]] was the first to see potential in this new market made possible by digital technology. RO culture had to be recoded in order to compete with the "free" distribution made possible by the Internet. [[iTunes]] Music store was proof of this. While it provided digital music it was protected by a [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) code from re-distribution. Lessig uses this key example to show that it is possible to achieve a business model which balances access and control and is equally attractive to both the consumers and the creators. In addition, digital technologies have changed the way we think about 'access'. Today most of us would never structure our day around a particular program because we know that it is most likely available online - even if not necessarily free of charge. Lessig insists, using [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] as his premiere example, that the future of entertainment and advertising lies in accumulating information about a consumer and tailoring the product to their preferences.

As opposed to RO culture, '''Read/Write culture''' has a reciprocal relationship between the producer and the consumer. Taking works, such as songs, and appropriating them in private circles is exemplary of RW culture, which was considered to be the 'popular' culture before the advent of reproduction technologies. The technologies and copyright laws that soon followed, however, changed the dynamics of popular culture. As it became professionalized people were taught to defer production to the professionals.

Lessig posits that digital technologies provide the tools for reviving RW culture and democratizing production. He uses blogs to explain the three layers of this democratization. Blogs have redefined our relationship to the content industry as they allowed access to non-professional content. The 'comments' feature that soon followed provided a space for readers to have a dialogue with the amateur contributors. 'Tagging' of the blogs by users based on the content provided the necessary layer for users to filter the sea of content according to their interest. The third layer added bots that analyzed the relationship between various websites by counting the clicks between them and, thus, organizing a database of preferences. The three layers working together established an "ecosystem of reputation"(61) that served to guide users through the [[blogosphere]]. Lessig uses the blog model to demonstrate a wider conclusion - while there is no doubt many amateur online publications cannot compete with the validity of professional sources, the democratization of digital RW culture and the 'ecosystem of reputation' provides a space for many talented voices to be heard that was not available in the pre-digital RO model.

== The Remix ==

Lessig argues that today digital culture permeates our lifestyle to such extent - an average teenager will spend an hour per weekend day using the computer for leisure and only 7 minutes reading - that ''"it is no surprise that these other forms of 'creating' are becoming an increasingly dominant form of 'writing'"''(69). Previous generations used textual quotes to build on writings before them. Today, this process of quoting or collage is manifest through digital media. The remix utilizes the (multi-media) language through which the current generations communicate. They quote content from various sources to create something "new". Thus, the [[remix]] provides a commentary on the sounds and images it utilizes the same way a critical essay provides commentary on the texts it quotes. One of Lessig's favorite remix examples is the "Bush and Blair Love Song" which remixes images of President Bush and [[Tony Blair]] to make it appear as if they are [[lip-synching]] [[Lionel Richie]]'s "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]". ''"The message couldn't be more powerful: an [[emasculated]] Britain, as captured in the puppy love of its leader for Bush"'' (74). This remix in Lessig's eyes is exemplary of the power this type of expression holds - to not tell but show. Using preexisting images is vital to the art form because the production of meaning draws heavily on cultural reference an image or sound brings with it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Their meaning comes not from the content of what they say; it comes from the reference, which is expressible only if it is the original that gets used. (p.74)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lessig describes the remix phenomenon instrumental in creating cultural literacy and a critical view of media and advertising that permeates our daily lives. But, as it stands today, copyright law will inhibit education employing these digital forms of literacy for institutions will shy away from use that might be deemed 'illegal'. Yet, Lessig reiterates, the remix form of expression cannot be killed, only criminalized.

== Commercial Economies vs. Sharing Economies ==

In addition to describing two cultures Lessig also proposes two economies: the commercial and the ''sharing''. The ''commercial economy'' is governed by the simple logic of the market, where products and services have a tangible economic value, be it money or labor. The Internet has been extremely successful as a portal for commercial economies to flourish - improving existing businesses and serving as a platform for thousands of new ones. It has been exceptionally fruitful of businesses that cater to a niche market - exemplified by such companies as Amazon and [[Netflix]] which provide a range of items that could not be accommodated by one physical space. This dynamic has been outlined by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''''s editor in chief, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail]]''. Another obvious success story of a digital commercial economy is [[Google]], which has managed to create value from value others have already created.

The ''[[sharing economy]]'' functions outside monetary exchange. We all belong to sharing economies - most obvious examples are our friendships and relationships. This economy is regulated not by a metric of price but by a set of social relations. Like the commercial economy, the sharing economy extends into the digital realm. Lessig's favorite example is [[Wikipedia]] itself. The top ten most visited website relies on user contribution - from creation to editing - for its content and gives no monetary incentive for this contribution. While providing the option of anonymity, the users of [[Wikipedia]] have been remarkably consistent with the site's suggestions - be it regarding consistent aesthetic or neutral point of view. A vital characteristic of a successful sharing economy is people are in it because they want to be.

== Hybrids ==
Lessig does a number of case studies of three types of successful hybrids.

===Community spaces===
Lessig cites sites such as [[Dogster]], [[Craigslist]], [[Flickr]], and [[YouTube]] as successful internet community spaces that answer demand of the users who, in turn, reciprocate through sharing content and self-regulating by flagging inappropriate content. At the same time the sites make revenue through advertisements but are extremely careful to not overwhelm the users and disrupt the sense of community.

===Collaboration spaces===
Collaboration hybrids center on the belief of the users that they are working towards a common goal or ''building'' something together. Lessig's notable examples are volunteers of Usenet that help those technologically in need solve computer problems – from minor to complex. They are not paid or recognized by [[Microsoft]] yet they are instrumental in building value for the company. Similarly, ''[[Yahoo! Answers]]'' launched in December 2005 has gathered an enormous following of people answering other people's questions for free. They do not participate for any incentive other than to share their expertise and help others. In this category Lessig also cites the now infamous Heather Lawver 2000 case after the teenager started a fan site for [[J.K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] series, only to be constantly 'threatened' by Warner for illegal use of copyrighted content. Eight years later many large corporations have, at least in part, learned from Warner's mistake and Lawver's persuasive argument of the [[Potter Wars]]: fans are "a part of your marketing budget that you don't have to pay for". Thus lighter control of content use allows fans to share their appropriation of content while promoting it free. Everyone wins.

===Communities===
Lessig's third category lacks the 'spaces' qualification of the previous two because they create a community on a much grander, or more comprehensive scale. One such community is Second Life through which users can immerse themselves in a virtual environment and build a multi-faceted life not unlike real life but without the same limitations, while creating value by producing and sharing new codes for the program.

Lessig concludes that a feeling of ownership and contribution is vital to making hybrid communities function. These communities are not built on sacrifice but on mutual satisfaction in which both the consumer and producer benefit.

Parallel economies can coexist, the author insists, and are not mutually exclusive. In fact, crossover is not uncommon, particularly in the world of the [[Creative Commons]] which Lessig helped found. Many artists that have initially licensed their work under a [[Creative commons license|CC license]], that allowed others to share and remix their work as long as they were credited, have used the momentum from this visibility to crossover to the commercial economy.

Lessig warns that hybrid economies will do well to avoid what he calls sharecropping, that is corporations forcing the remixer to give up the right to his/her creation (providing they don't own the rights to all/some of its components)even if they plan to use their work for commercial purposes. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The hybrid that respects the rights of the creator - both the original creator and the remixer - is more likely to survive that the one that doesn't. (p. 246)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reforming copyright law ==

Lessig outlines five steps that will put us on [[copyright reform|the path towards more efficient and sound copyright law]].

# '''Deregulating Amateur Activity.''' Primarily this means exempting noncommercial and, particularly ''amateur'', use from the rights granted by copyright. In addition, this loosening of control will, in turn, remove some of the burden from the corporations' monitoring for misuse of their content.
# '''Clear Title.''' As of now, there is no comprehensive and accessible registry that lists who owns rights to what. In addition to making the above clear, Lessig insists that author/owner should have to register their work in order to extend the copyright after a shorter period of time and for the work, otherwise, to enter public domain. He insists that this change would be instrumental to digital archiving and access for educational purposes.
# '''Simplify.''' Building on his previous suggestions, Lessig insists that the system should be simplified. If a child is expected to comply with copyright law, they should be able to understand it.
# '''Decriminalizing the Copy.''' As mentioned before the production of the 'copy' is a commonplace in daily transaction within the digital realm. If our daily activity triggers federal regulation on copyright law, it means that this regulation reaches too far. Thus the law must be rearticulated as to not include uses that are irrelevant to copyright owner's control.
# '''Decriminalizing File Sharing.''' Lessig suggests this should be done either by "authorizing at least noncommercial file sharing with taxes to cover a reasonable royalty to the artists whose work is shared, or by authorizing a simple blanket licensing procedure, whereby users could, for a low fee, buy the right to freely file-share" (p.&amp;nbsp;271)

== Conclusion ==

In his final chapter "Reforming Us", Lessig insists that in order to move towards ending the senseless copyright wars, which are mostly harming our children, we must understand that governmental control has its limits.

The children growing up in a digital age are seeing these laws as senseless and corrupt and, more importantly, trivial as they continue to remix and download despite it. Lessig warns that this phenomenon can have a larger trickle-down effect towards a child's view of law in general. When put in this light, [[copyright reform]] carries much larger implications for the morality of the digital age generations.

== In popular culture ==

On an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' with Lessig as a guest, Stephen Colbert made fun of the book's status under Creative Commons by taking a copy, signing it, and then proclaiming it the 'Colbert' edition for sale. Lessig laughed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |title=The Colbert Report with Lawrence Lessig |date=2009-01-09 |publisher=[[The Colbert Report|colbertnation.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- no apparent distinction between [[Rogue security software]] and [[Rogueware]], and both already covered completely by [[Scareware]] (see 2nd para of lead there). No benefit to the reader to split hairs. --&gt;
'''Scareware''' is a form of [[malware]] which uses [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to cause shock, [[anxiety]], or the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying [[Potentially unwanted program|unwanted software]]. Scareware is part of a class of malicious software that includes [[rogue security software]], [[ransomware]] and other scam [[software]] that tricks users into believing their computer is infected with a virus, then suggests that they download and pay for [[Rogue security software|fake antivirus software]] to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8313678.stm|title=Millions tricked by 'scareware'|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the virus is fictional and the software is non-functional or [[malware]] itself.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7955358.stm 'Scareware' scams trick searchers]. [[BBC News]] (2009-03-23). Retrieved on 2009-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anti-Phishing Working Group]], the number of scareware packages in circulation rose from 2,850 to 9,287 in the second half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/10/supportonclick_scareware_scam/|publisher=The Register| date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2009-04-12 |title=Scareware scammers adopt cold call tactics}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 2009, the APWG identified a 585% increase in scareware programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiphishing.org/reports/apwg_report_h1_2009.pdf Phishing Activity Trends Report: 1st Half 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "scareware" label can also apply to any application or virus which pranks users with intent to cause anxiety or panic.

== Scam scareware ==
Internet security writers use the term "scareware" to describe software products that produce frivolous and alarming warnings or threat notices, most typically for fictitious or useless commercial [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[registry cleaner]] software.  This class of program tries to increase its perceived value by bombarding the user with constant warning messages that do not increase its effectiveness in any way.  Software is packaged with a look and feel that mimics legitimate security software in order to deceive consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/20/scareware_psychology/|title=Scareware Mr Bigs enjoy 'low risk' crime bonanza|author=John Leydon|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2009-10-21|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some websites display pop-up advertisement windows or banners with text such as: "Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2-removevirus.com/remove-warning-your-computer-may-be-infected/|title=Fake Warning Example |author=Carine Febre |date=2014-10-20|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=Carine Febre}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediate removal may be required. To scan, click 'Yes' below." These websites can go as far as saying that a user's job, career, or marriage would be at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Hdg_xtqps|title=Symantec Security Response: Misleading Applications|publisher=[[Symantec]]|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products using advertisements such as these are often considered scareware. Serious scareware applications qualify as [[rogue software]].

Some scareware is not affiliated with any other installed programs. A user can encounter a pop-up on a website indicating that their PC is infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/search-results-for-air-france-flight-447-lead-to-rogue-antivirus/|title=Air France Flight 447 Search Results Lead to Rogue Antivirus|author=JM Hipolito|publisher=[[Trend Micro]]|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, it is possible to become infected with scareware even if the user attempts to cancel the notification.
These popups are especially designed to look like they come from the user's operating system when they are actually a webpage.

A 2010 study by [[Google]] found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[Google]]|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/leet10.pdf|date=2010-04-13|accessdate=2010-11-18|author=Moheeb Abu Rajab and Luca Ballard|title=The Nocebo Effect on the Web: An Analysis of Fake Anti-Virus Distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting on March 29, 2011, more than 1.5 million [[web sites]] around the world have been infected by the [[LizaMoon]] [[SQL injection]] attack spread by scareware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass 'scareware' attack hits 1.5M websites, still spreading |date=April 1, 2011 |work=On Deadline |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/04/mass-scareware-attack-hits-15m-websites-so-far/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malicious Web attack hits a million site addresses |date=April 1, 2011 |work=Reuters.com |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/hackers-idUSN0116927520110401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Google discovered that scareware was using some of its servers to check for internet connectivity.  The data suggested that up to a million machines were infected with scareware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14232577|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Google to Warn PC Virus Victims via Search Site|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has placed a warning in the search results of users whose computers appear to be infected.

Another example of scareware is Smart Fortress. This site scares people into thinking they have lots of viruses on their computer and asks them to buy the professional service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.kaspersky.com/us/viruses/rogue?qid=208286259 "Smart Fortress 2012"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spyware ===
[[File:SpySheriffPopUp.png|thumb|right|Dialog from [[SpySheriff]], designed to scare users into installing the rogue software]]
Some forms of [[spyware]] also qualify as scareware because they change the user's desktop background, install icons in the computer's [[notification area]] (under [[Microsoft Windows]]), and claiming that some kind of spyware has infected the user's computer and that the scareware application will help to remove the infection. In some cases, scareware trojans have replaced the desktop of the victim with large, yellow text reading "Warning! You have spyware!" or a box containing similar text, and have even forced the screensaver to change to "bugs" crawling across the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bugs on the screen|url=http://forum.sysinternals.com/bugs-on-the-screen_topic14840.html|website=Windows Sysinternals}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winwebsec]] is the term usually used to address the malware that attacks the users of Windows operating system and produces fake claims similar to that of genuine anti-malware software.&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spywareloop.com/news/scareware |title= Scareware in SpyWareLoop.com|author=  Vincentas |newspaper=''Spyware Loop'' |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SpySheriff]] exemplifies spyware and scareware: it purports to remove spyware, but is actually a piece of spyware itself, often accompanying [[SmitFraud]] infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm spywarewarrior.com] filed under "Brave Sentry."&lt;/ref&gt; Other antispyware scareware may be promoted using a [[phishing]] scam.

==Uninstallation of security software==
Another approach is to trick users into uninstalling legitimate antivirus software, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, or disabling their firewall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/20/social_engineering_scareware/ theregister.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Since antivirus programs typically include protection against being tampered with or disabled by other software, scareware may use social engineering to convince the user to disable programs which would otherwise prevent the malware from working.

==Legal action==
In 2005, [[Microsoft]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] successfully sued Secure Computer (makers of [[Spyware Cleaner]]) for $1&amp;nbsp;million over charges of using scareware pop-ups.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Washington's attorney general has also brought lawsuits against Securelink Networks, High Falls Media, and the makers of Quick Shield.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, [[Microsoft]] and the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] [[attorney general]] filed a lawsuit against two Texas firms, Branch Software and Alpha Red, producers of the [[Registry Cleaner XP]] scareware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7645420.stm|title=Fighting the scourge of scareware|date=2008-10-01|accessdate=2008-10-02|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lawsuit alleges that the company sent incessant pop-ups resembling system warnings to consumers' personal computers stating "CRITICAL ERROR MESSAGE! - REGISTRY DAMAGED AND CORRUPTED", before instructing users to visit a web site to download Registry Cleaner XP at a cost of $39.95.

On December 2, 2008, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] ("FTC") filed a Complaint in federal court against Innovative Marketing, Inc., ByteHosting Internet Services, LLC, as well as individuals  [[Sam Jain]], Daniel Sundin, James Reno, Marc D’Souza, and Kristy Ross.  The Complaint also listed Maurice D’Souza as a Relief Defendant, alleged that he held proceeds of wrongful conduct but not accusing him of violating any law.  The FTC alleged that the other Defendants violated the FTC Act by deceptively marketing software, including WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus.  According to the complaint, the Defendants falsely represented that scans of a consumer’s computer showed that it had been compromised or infected and then offered to sell software to fix the alleged problems.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prank software ==
Another type of scareware involves software designed to literally [[scare]] the user through the use of unanticipated shocking images, sounds or video.

* An early program of this type is [[NightMare (scareware)|NightMare]], a program distributed on the [[Fred Fish|Fish Disks]] for the [[Amiga]] computer (Fish #448) in 1991. When NightMare executes, it lies dormant for an extended and random period of time, finally changing the entire screen of the computer to an image of a skull while playing a horrifying shriek on the audio channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/fish.html Contents of disk #448]. Amiga-stuff.com - see DISK 448.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anxiety-based scareware puts users in situations where there are no positive outcomes.  For example, a small program can present a [[dialog box]] saying "Erase everything on hard drive?" with two buttons, both labeled "OK".  Regardless of which button is chosen, nothing is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheflash.com/downloads/dark-drive.php Dark Drive Prank]&lt;/ref&gt;
* This tactic was used in an advertisement campaign by [[Sir-Tech]] in 1997 to advertise ''[[Virus: The Game]]''. When the file is run, a full screen representation of the desktop appears. The software then begins simulating deletion of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] folder. When this process is complete, a message is slowly typed on screen saying "Thank God this is only a game." A screen with the purchase information appears on screen and then returns to the desktop. No damage is done to the computer during the advertisement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">The {{Nihongo|'''Separation Edict'''|身分統制令|Mibun Tōsei Rei, literally the “Social Status Control Edict”}} was a law composed of three articles which was promulgated by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] on 8 October 1591, the 19th year of the [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tensho]] era during the Azuchi–Momoyama period.

== Summary of its contents ==
The law prohibits [[samurai]] and their retainers the buke hokonin, which were in turn divided into the chugen and the komono, from becoming peasants or merchants, and also bans peasants from abandoning their fields to engage in commerce or wage labor and warriors from employing buke hokonin who fled from their original masters. It lays down punishments for those who violate these provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Turnbull, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2010), 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to ensure stable revenue from the land tax and a pool of warriors in view of the imminent [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|invasion of Korea]].

== Translation of the Edict ==
1. Townspeople and farmers should investigate if any samurai, chugen, or komono have become merchants or farmers since the expedition against [[Date Masamune]] in [[Mutsu Province|Oshu]] in the seventh month of last year. If any such people are found, they must be expelled. If any such people are hidden, the entire village will be punished.

2. If any peasant abandons his fields and engages in commerce or wage labor, not only the farmer himself but his fellow villagers will be punished. Those not involved in either military service or working the fields will be investigated and expelled. If an official does not execute these instructions, he will have his lands seized for negligence. If there is any concealment by townspeople or farmers, the whole county or town will be held accountable.

3. Do not employ anyone who has left his former master without permission whether he is a samurai or a komono. Thoroughly investigate an individual's background to ensure he has not done so. If he has done so, he shall be arrested and handed back to his former master. If this law is ignored or if a violator of the law is deliberately released then it is ordered that two or three people will be decapitated in the violator's place and their heads will be delivered to his former master. If this order is not carried out the person who sought to employ the violator will be punished.

== Theory of Shosaku Takagi ==
Though the Separation Edict was widely considered to be the law that first established the rigid class system of the subsequent [[Tokugawa shogunate]] based on the [[four occupations]], Japanese historian Shosaku Takagi has called this into question. He believes that during this period of history the word "samurai" did not refer to warriors, but rather to the wakato, who were retainers of warriors just like the chugen and the komono. Takagi thus believes that the draconian social class structures imposed by the Separation Edict were actually intended specifically for the buke hokonin, including the wakato, chugen, and komono, and not for most of the individuals engaged in military service. According to this theory, the feudal class structure in Japan was in fact not legally mandated in 1591, but much later in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Tsukada, "[http://urbanscope.lit.osaka-cu.ac.jp/journal/pdf/vol001/01-tsukada.pdf Yado and Kuchiire]," Urbanscope, Volume 1 2010, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Takagi acknowledges that the portions of the Edict relating to the peasantry did contribute to class separation.&lt;ref&gt;Shosaku Takagi, 日本近世国家史の硏究 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1990), 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="943">'''Soviet–Estonian Non-Aggression Pact''' was a [[non-aggression pact]], signed between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Estonia]] on May 4, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1932/151.html League of Nations Treaty Series, Vol. CXXXI, 1932, pp. 297-307.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The terms of the treaty were:

Article 1. Each party guarantees the borders of each other, set by the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], and must not infringe upon each other's borders.
Article 2. Each party agrees not to form a coalition against one another, form an alliance against one another, or politically or economically embargo each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5642">{{Cleanup|date=June 2016 | reason = The [[Office of Thrift Supervision|OTS]] ceased to exist on 19 October 2011.}}
All [[regulation|regulated]] [[financial institution]]s in the [[United States]] are required to file periodic financial and other information with their respective regulators and other parties.  [[Savings and loan association|Thrifts]] are required by the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS), among other requirements, to file a key quarterly financial report called the '''Thrift Financial Report''' ('''TFR''') to be filed electronically with the OTS.  In 2007, there had been a proposal that thrifts convert to filing a similar report, the ''Report of Condition and Income'' commonly referred to as the [[Call Report]], which banks prepare and file with the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://files.ots.treas.gov/25264.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/2759712/Proposed-Rule-Savings-associations-Consolidated-Reports-of-Conditions-and-Income-Call-Report-conversion-from-Thrift-Financial-Report&lt;/ref&gt;  Since thrifts continue to file TFRs today, the proposal was dismissed or set aside for the time being.

Specifically, OTS regulation 12 CFR 563.180 requires the completion of the TFR by all savings associations as defined in 12 CFR 561.43. The TFR is filed electronically on a quarterly basis and is due no later than 30 days after quarter end, except for Schedule HC, Thrift Holding Company, and Schedule CMR, Consolidated Maturity and Rate, which are due no later than 45 days after quarter end.

The TFR contains 17 schedules, which include financial statements and supplemental information filed for the reporting savings association consolidated with its subsidiaries. Information on the TFR, including income and expense and cash flow data, is reported for the quarter, not year-to-date, with the exception of Schedule FS, Fiduciary and Related Services, in which fiduciary and related services income is reported for the calendar year-to-date. Most information on the TFR is available to the public for individual institutions; however, certain information is considered proprietary and is not released. All data are released in aggregate form. See this list of TFR schedules and their availability to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://ots.gov/?p=NewsFilingInformation&lt;/ref&gt;  TFRs, and Call Reports filed are publicly available at the FDIC website; TFR schedules for an institution can be viewed (htm pages) or can be downloaded as [[Text file|text]] (.txt) files to be viewed or manipulated as desired with programs such as [[Microsoft Excel]] or [[Microsoft Word]].

With the implementation of the [[Dodd Frank Act]] and the sunset of the OTS on July 21, 2011, all thrift institutions are required to submit [[Call Report]]s instead of TFR effective March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.fdic.gov/Call_TFR_Rpts/inform.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==TFR content (schedules)==

The TFR comprises these 17 schedules, not all of which may be viewable online for a filer:&lt;ref&gt;http://files.ots.treas.gov/4210051.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*Schedule NS – Optional Narrative Statement – Statement by institution management concerning issues relevant to the TFR
*Schedule SC – Consolidated Statement of Condition – Assets, liabilities and equity capital
*Schedule SO – Consolidated Statement of Operations – Income and expense
*Schedule VA – Consolidated Valuation Allowances – Reconciliation of valuation allowances, charge-offs and recoveries, and other data on troubled assets
*Schedule PD – Consolidated Past Due and Nonaccrual – Information on delinquent and nonaccrual loans
*Schedule LD – Consolidated Loan Data – Information on high loan-to-value loans secured by 1–4 family residential properties without PMI or government guarantee
*Schedule CC – Consolidated Commitments and Contingencies
*Schedule CF – Consolidated Cash Flow Information – Information on mortgage, deposit, and other activity affecting cash flow during the quarter
*Schedule DI – Consolidated Deposit Information – Information on deposits and escrows
*Schedule SI – Supplemental Information – Information on QTL, loans to insiders, reconciliation of equity capital, transactions with affiliates, mutual fund and annuity sales, average balance sheet data, and other data
*Schedule SQ – Consolidated Supplemental Questions – Questions concerning structural and other activity during the quarter
*Schedule SB – Consolidated Small Business Loans – Data completed annually as of June 30 to comply with Section 122 of the FDIC Improvement Act during the quarter
*Schedule FS – Fiduciary and Related Services – Data on trust assets and activities. Summary data is completed quarterly; more detailed information is reported annually at December 31
*Schedule HC – Thrift Holding Company – Summary of holding company financial data for both the parent only and consolidated
*Schedule CSS – Subordinate Organization Schedule: Information on required subordinate organizations and joint ventures, completed annually at December 31
*Schedule CCR – Consolidated Capital Requirements – Balances necessary to compute the OTS minimum capital requirement
*Schedule CMR – Consolidated Maturity and Rate – Information on interest rate and repricing/maturity characteristics of selected balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items

'''The Library of Trinity College Dublin''' ({{Lang-ga|Leabharlann Choláiste na Tríonóide}}) serves  [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and the [[University of Dublin]]. It is a [[legal deposit]] or "copyright library", which means that publishers in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] must deposit a copy of all their publications in the library, free of charge.&lt;ref name="TCDDeposit"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tcd.ie/library/collection-man/legal-deposit.php |accessdate=16 November 2018 |title=Legal Deposit (Copyright Libraries) |work=Trinity College Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only Irish library to hold such rights for the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="TCDDeposit"/&gt; The Library is the permanent home to the [[Trinity College Harp|Brian Boru harp]] which is a national symbol of Ireland, a copy of 1916 [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]], and the [[Book of Kells]]. Two of the four volumes of the Book of Kells are on public display, one opened to a major decorated page and the other to a typical page of text. The volumes and pages shown are regularly changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Library/bookofkells/book-of-kells/ |title=Book of Kells - The Old Library &amp; the Book of Kells Exhibition : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=2014-12-04 |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013714/http://www.tcd.ie/Library/bookofkells/book-of-kells/ |archivedate=15 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the University of Dublin also have access to the libraries of [[Tallaght Hospital]] and the [[Irish School of Ecumenics]], [[Milltown, Dublin|Milltown]].

==Constituent buildings==
The Library proper occupies several buildings, four of which are at the Trinity College campus itself, with another part of the Trinity Centre at [[St. James's Hospital]], [[Dublin]]:
*The original (Old) Library is [[Thomas Burgh (1670-1730)|Thomas Burgh]]’s magnum opus. A pretty big building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street.  The Book of Kells is located in the Old Library, along with the [[Book of Durrow]], the [[Book of Howth]] and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions, and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [[Trinity College Harp|Brian Boru harp]], one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the Library. Housed within the Old Library are:
**Early Printed Books and Special Collections
**Manuscripts &amp; Archives Research Library (M&amp;ARL)
*The Berkeley/Lecky/Ussher (BLU) Arts Libraries complex, incorporating:
**The [[Bishop Berkeley|Berkeley]] Library, in Fellows Square
**The [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|Lecky]] Library, attached to the Arts Building
**The [[James Ussher|Ussher]] Library, overlooking [[College Park, Dublin|College Park]]
**The Glucksman Map Library
**The Preservation and Conservation Department
*The [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] Science and Engineering Library
*The 1937 Reading Room (for graduate use)
*The [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]] Medical Library (JSML), housed at St James's Hospital

Further materials are held in storage in Stacks, either in closed access within College or at a book depository in the Dublin suburb of [[Santry]].

==History==
The Library began with the founding of Trinity College in 1592. In 1661, [[Henry Jones (bishop)|Henry Jones]] presented it with the Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript. [[James Ussher]] (1625–56), [[Archbishop of Armagh]], whose most important works were ''"Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge"'' (1632) and ''"Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates"'' (1639), left his valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the Library. His complete works were published by the Library in twenty-four volumes.&lt;ref name="Library History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Library/epb/history.php|title=History of the Library|publisher=Tcd.ie|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, the Library was given [[legal deposit]] rights, making it the only library in Ireland to have such rights for the United Kingdom at that time.&lt;ref name="Library History"/&gt; 

==Legal deposit library status==
According to the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, the Library is entitled, along with the [[National Library of Ireland]] and the libraries of the [[National University of Ireland]], the [[University of Limerick]], and [[Dublin City University]], to receive a copy of all works published in the Republic of Ireland. Also, as a result of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]], which continues a more ancient right dating from 1801, the Library is entitled, along with the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge University Library]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and the [[National Library of Scotland]], to receive a copy on request of all works published in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Long Room==
[[File:County Dublin - Long Room-Trinity College - 20180703092642.jpg|thumb|Detail of Long Room shelving]]
[[File:James_Malton_Trinity_College_Library_Dublin.jpg|thumb|Watercolour of Long Room before the roof was raised]]
The {{convert|65|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} main chamber of the Old Library, the Long Room, was built between 1712 and 1732 and houses 200,000 of the Library's oldest books. Initially, The Long Room had a flat ceiling, shelving for books only on the lower level, and an open gallery. By the 1850s the room had to be expanded as the shelves were filled due to the fact that the Library had been given permission to obtain a free copy of every book that had been published in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Ireland and Britain]]. In 1860, The Long Room's roof was raised to accommodate an upper gallery.&lt;ref name="Old Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/library/old-library/long-room/|title=The Long Room|publisher=Tcd.ie|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Long Room is lined with marble busts. The marble bust collection was formed when 14 busts from the sculptor [[Peter Scheemakers]] were acquired by the college. Many of the busts are of great philosophers, writers, and men who supported the college. The most outstanding bust in the collection is of the writer [[Jonathan Swift]], created by [[Louis François Roubiliac]].&lt;ref name="Old Library"/&gt;

The Long Room also holds one of the last remaining copies of the 1916 [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]]. This proclamation was read by [[Patrick Pearse]] near the General Post Office on 24 April 1916. Visitors may also view the [[Trinity College harp]] (also known as the "[[Brian Boru harp]]") in The Long Room that is the oldest of its kind in Ireland dating back to the 15th century. The harp is made out of oak and willow and includes 29 brass strings.&lt;ref name="Old Library"/&gt;

===In popular culture===
The [[Jedi]] archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' bear a startling resemblance to the Long Room of the Trinity College Library. This resemblance resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the building's likeness in the film. However, [[Lucasfilm]] denied that the Long Room was the basis for the Jedi archives, and officials from Trinity College Library decided not to take any legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Eoghan|title=Trinity to strike back at return of the Jedi|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/trinity-to-strike-back-at-return-of-the-jedi-26244343.html|accessdate=30 July 2015|agency=The Irish Independent|date=29 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jedi Archives Clones Long Room, Trinity Attacks|url=http://archiseek.com/2002/jedi-archives-clones-long-room-trinity-attacks/|website=Archiseek|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Who Makes Movies?''''' was a propaganda campaign run jointly by several international associations looking to crack down on [[copyright infringement]] of [[motion pictures]], most notably the [[MPAA]], as part of the larger "Respect Copyrights" campaign. The campaign was endorsed by several motion picture workers' guilds, including the [[Directors Guild of America]], the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts]], the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[Writers Guild of America]].

==Installments==
Five short films were created, each profiling the work done by primarily [[blue-collar]] workers in the production of a [[feature film]]. These films were shown as [[movie trailer]]s in large [[movie theater]]s, and were also made available on the website ''respectcopyrights.org''.

The films profile:
* A set painter
* A director animator
* A [[Grip (job)|grip]]
* A [[make-up]] artist
* A [[stunt double|stuntman]]
In addition to explaining their jobs, the worker gives details about their life to the viewer. For example, the set painter declares "I met my wife when I did ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]''." The worker then appeals to the viewer to not download movies as it reduces the income of ordinary, common workers. It is an attempt to dispel the concept that copyright infringement only reduces the profits of large, faceless movie studios and rich [[movie star]]s. One problem raised with the spots is that blue collar workers highlighted are typically paid hourly or daily and do not share in movie profit participation.

==Comparison to other campaigns==
The campaign attempts to appeal to a consumer's compassion, much in the same way that the ''[[Home Taping is Killing Music]]'' campaign appealed to the consumer's interest in the art form.

==Parody and criticism==
Some critics found the tone of the ads to be disingenuous, and "holier-than-thou".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62197,00.html | title = Anti-Piracy Campaign Gets a Laugh | work = [[Wired magazine|Wired]] | date = 9 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also pointed out that advertising as a movie trailer was targeting the people who were already paying to see movies, and added to the growing inconveniences associated with attending movies in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/16/who_makes_movies_zom.html | title = Who makes movies? Zombies, fluffers and writers | work = [[Boing Boing]] | date = 16 May 2005 | first = Cory | last = Doctorow | authorlink = Cory Doctorow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ads inspired many parodies, including:
* A [[short film]], also named "Who Makes Movies?", providing a fictional sixth installment from the perspective of a [[fluffer]] in the [[adult film]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455860/ | title = Who Makes Movies? | work = [[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was written and directed by Chris Luccy and stars Tom Konkle as "Handy" Randy Palmer. The film is accompanied by the parody website "Respect-Porno.org".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://respect-porno.org/ |title=RespectPorno |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070304163025/http://www.respect-porno.org:80/ |archivedate=March 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A widely distributed internet video called "Who Steals Movies?", from the perspective of a common movie [[copyright infringement|bootlegger]] who will be out of money if the MPAA's campaign is successful.
* The November 11, 2006 ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'' strip portrays the story of Rufus "Spielberg" Jenkins, who decries the effects of internet piracy on his theater-taping bootlegging business.
*One year later, the television adaptation of ''[[The Boondocks (series)|The Boondocks]]'' criticized ''Who Makes Movies'' by comparing stealing a seat in a theater to robbing &amp; violently murdering an old woman in the episode "[[...Or Die Trying]]".

{{Evidence law}}

A '''witness''' is someone who has, who claims to have, or is thought, by someone with authority to compel testimony, to have knowledge relevant to an event or other matter of interest. In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what he or she knows or claims to know about the matter before some official authorized to take such testimony.

A percipient witness or ''eyewitness'' is one who testifies what they perceived through his or her [[sense]]s (e.g.: seeing, hearing, smelling, touching).  That perception might be either with the unaided human sense or with the aid of an instrument, e.g.: microscope or stethoscope, or by other scientific means, e.g.: a chemical reagent which changes color in the presence of a particular substance.

A ''[[hearsay]]'' witness is one who testifies what someone else said or wrote.  In most court proceedings there are many limitations on when hearsay evidence is admissible.  Such limitations do not apply to grand jury investigations, many administrative proceedings, and may not apply to declarations used in support of an arrest or search warrant.  Also some types of statements are not deemed to be hearsay and are not subject to such limitations.

An ''[[expert witness]]'' is one who allegedly has specialized knowledge relevant to the matter of interest, which knowledge  purportedly helps to either make sense of other evidence, including other testimony, documentary evidence or physical evidence (e.g., a fingerprint).  An expert witness may or may not also be a percipient witness, as in a doctor or may or may not have treated the victim of an accident or crime.

A ''reputation witness'' is one who testifies about the reputation of a person or business entity, when reputation is material to the dispute at issue. They are a person who aids that because of a persons interactions and personality the defendant is guilty/innocent

In law a witness might be compelled to provide testimony in court, before a grand jury, before an administrative tribunal, before a deposition officer, or in a variety of other proceedings (e.g., judgment debtor examination).  Sometimes the testimony is provided in public or in a confidential setting (e.g., grand jury or closed court proceeding).

Although informally a witness includes whoever perceived the event, in law, a witness is different from an informant. A ''confidential informant'' is someone who claimed to have witnessed an event or have hearsay information, but whose identity is being withheld from at least one party (typically the criminal defendant).  The information from the confidential informant may have been used by a police officer or other official acting as a hearsay witness to obtain a search warrant.

A ''[[subpoena]]'' commands a person to appear. It is used to compel the [[testimony]] of a witness in a [[trial (law)|trial]]. Usually, it can be issued by a [[judge]] or by the [[lawyer]] representing the [[plaintiff]] or the [[defendant]] in a [[civil trial]] or by the [[prosecutor]] or the [[defense attorney]] in a [[Criminal procedure|criminal proceeding]]. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is compulsory to comply, to take an [[oath]], and to tell the truth, under penalty of [[perjury]].

=== Calling a witness ===
[[File:Heinrich Buscher.jpg|thumb|left|{{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich Buscher|de}} as a witness during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]]]

In a court proceeding, a witness may be ''called'' (requested to testify) by either the [[prosecution]] or the [[Defense (legal)|defense]]. The side that calls the witness first asks questions in what is called [[direct examination]]. The opposing side then may ask their own questions in what is called [[cross-examination]]. In some cases, [[redirect examination]] may be used by the side that called the witness but usually only to contradict specific testimony from the cross-examination.

'''Recalling a witness''' means calling a witness, who has already given testimony in a proceeding, to give further testimony. A court may give leave to a party to recall a witness only to give evidence about a matter [[wikt:adduce|adduced]] by another party if the second party's testimony contradicts evidence given by the original witness on direct examination.

===Testimony===
Witnesses are usually permitted to testify only what they experienced first-hand. In most cases, they may not testify about something they were told ([[hearsay]]). That restriction does not apply to expert witnesses, but they may testify only in the area of their expertise.

==Reliability==
Eyewitness testimony is generally presumed to be more reliable than [[circumstantial evidence]]. Studies have shown, however, that individual, separate witness testimony is often flawed, and parts of it can be meaningless. That can occur because of flaws in [[eyewitness identification]] (such as faulty observation and recollection, or bias) or because a witness is lying. If several people witness a crime, it is [[probative]] to look for similarities in their collective descriptions to substantiate the facts of an event but to keep in mind the contrasts between individual descriptions.

One study involved an experiment, in which subjects acted as [[juror]]s in a criminal case. Jurors heard a description of a robbery-murder, a prosecution argument, and then an argument for the defense. Some jurors heard only [[circumstantial evidence]]; others heard from a clerk who claimed to identify the defendant. In the former case, 18% percent found the defendant guilty, but in the latter case, 72% found the defendant guilty (Loftus 1988).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Police lineup]]s in which the eyewitness picks out a suspect from a group of people in the police station are often grossly suggestive, and they give the false impression that the witness remembered the suspect. In another study, students watched a staged crime. An hour later they looked through photos. A week later they were asked to pick the suspect out of lineups. 8% of the people in the lineups were mistakenly identified as criminals. 20% of the innocent people whose photographs were included were mistakenly identified (University of Nebraska 1977).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Weapon focus]] effects in which the presence of a weapon impairs [[memory]] for surrounding details is also an issue.

Another study looked at 65 cases of "erroneous criminal convictions of innocent people." In 45% of the cases, eyewitness mistakes were responsible.&lt;ref name="borchard"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/convictinginnoce00borcrich/convictinginnoce00borcrich_djvu.txt Convicting the Innocent: Sixty-Five Actual Errors of Criminal Justice] by Borchard, pg 367&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal study of eyewitness memory is usually undertaken within the broader category of [[cognition|cognitive processes]], the different ways in which we make sense of the world around us. That is done by employing the mental skills at one's disposal like thinking, perception, memory, awareness, reasoning, and judgment. Although cognitive processes can be only inferred and cannot be seen directly, they all have very important practical implications within a legal context.

If one were to accept that the way people think, perceive, reason, and judge is not always perfect, it becomes easier to understand why cognitive processes and the factors influencing the processes are studied by psychologists in matters of law, one being the grave implications that this imperfection can have within the criminal justice system.

The study of witness memory has dominated the realm of investigation. As Huff and Rattner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=160583|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; note, the single most important factor contributing to wrongful conviction is eyewitness misidentification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huff |first1=C. Ronald |last2=Rattner |first2=Arye |last3=Sagarin |first3=Edward |last4=MacNamara |first4=Donal E. J. |title=Guilty Until Proved Innocent: Wrongful Conviction and Public Policy |journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency |date=5 September 2016 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=518–544 |doi=10.1177/0011128786032004007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credibility==
{{Main|Credible witness}}
Several factors affect witnesses' [[credibility]]. Generally, they are deemed to be credible if they are recognized (or can be recognized) as a source of reliable information about someone, an event, or a phenomenon. As an example, the 2009 arrest of an [[illegal immigrant]] from [[El Salvador]] in the murder of federal intern [[Chandra Levy]] saw many questions arise surrounding the credibility of various witnesses.  Contesting the credibility of so-called "expert" witnesses rose into more common practice in the 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT18650918.2.23 |title=Law and Police |publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=A strong effort was made to impeach her credibility as a witness... it is competent to prove that the witness is an expert and not a mere pretender.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xWNFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4bsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4802,3268733 |title=Last Day of the Scandal Trial |publisher=Ithaca Democrat |date=8 July 1875 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=There was an irreconcilable difference of opinion as to the credibility of witnesses on each side.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
