      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">'''Abdul Nasser''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الناصر }}) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''Nasser''. The name means "servant of the Helper", ''An-Nasser'' being a [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric name]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. Because the letter ''n'' is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter ''l'' of the ''al-'' can be assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Nasser'', the pronunciation can correspond to ''Abd an-Nasser''. Alternative transliterations of the last element include ''Naaser'', ''Nasir'' and others, with the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

'''Antoine Kombouaré''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃twan kɔ̃bwaʁe}} ; born 16 November 1963) is a former [[New Caledonia]]n [[Association football|footballer]].

==Playing career==
Kombouaré started his career at [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and moved to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in 1990. At the Parisian club, he became famous for a winning header he scored in the dying seconds of a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] quarter-final match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] during the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|1992–93 season]]. The header qualified PSG for the next round with a 4–1 scoreline. Kombouaré had already scored a decisive goal in similar circumstances against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in the previous round. His habit of netting tie-deciding headers earned him the name of ''"Casque d'Or"'', which means "Golden Helmet" in French. In [[1994–95 UEFA Champions League|1994–95]], during a [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter-final against Johan Cruyff's [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] "dream team", Kombouaré captained PSG to a resounding and unexpected 2–1 win which qualified the French side for the semi-final, which they lost to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].

In all, Kombouaré spent five seasons in Paris, winning the [[Coupe de France]] in 1993 and 1995 and the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] in 1995. He also played nine games in the title-winning side of 1993–94 under [[Artur Jorge (footballer)|Artur Jorge]]. From 1992–93, he found his first-team appearances restricted by the presence of fellow defenders [[Alain Roche]], [[Paul Le Guen]] and [[Ricardo Gomes|Ricardo]]. Kombouaré became a cult hero among PSG fans for his habit of scoring late-minute winning goals and his presence and composure in big games.

Kombouaré signed for Swiss side [[FC Sion|Sion]] in 1995 for an undisclosed fee, then joined [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] a year later for £300,000; he was signed by manager [[Roy Aitken]] to add experience to the shaky Aberdeen defence. He made 50 appearances for Aberdeen and scored three goals. He left Aberdeen in May 1998. To this day, he is the only player to ever take a shot that cleared the top of the Richard Donald Stand at [[Pittodrie]].

==Managerial career==

===Strasbourg===
In 2003, Kombouaré was already being tipped to coach PSG, the club where he made his name as a player, and had spent four years coaching the reserves team with positive results. However, the arrival of [[Vahid Halilhodžić]] at the helm forced him to change his plans. He therefore joined [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|Strasbourg]] where he achieved an impressive 13th spot in the league, playing some good football along the way. However, a poor start to the [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05 season]] prompted him to leave the Alsace-based club.

===Valenciennes===
In July 2005, Kombouaré was appointed at [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], then playing in the [[Ligue 2|second tier of French football]]. In his first season, he led them to promotion to the [[Ligue 1|top flight]], a level from which the club had been relegated in 1993. In the three seasons that followed, Kombouaré helped the club to stabilize itself at the top level of French football. He improved the club's position in every season: 14th in [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07]], 13th in [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08]] and 12th in [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09]], establishing his credentials as a coach who could achieve impressive results on a tight budget.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
In May 2009, Kombouaré's former club PSG came calling back to him, offering him the position of manager. He accepted and signed a three-year contract, replacing [[Paul Le Guen]], with whom he had played at Nantes and PSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sky Sports|author=Haond, Patrick|title=Kombouare agrees PSG deal|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11800_5352235,00.html|date=28 May 2009|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2009–10 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2009–10]], the [[Paris]]ian club, in spite of its new signings such as [[Mevlüt Erdinç]] and [[Grégory Coupet]], performed poorly in the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|league]] and finished in mid-table. Kombouaré made up for this by leading the club to success in the [[2009–10 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], where they beat [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the [[2010 Coupe de France Final|final]].

In [[2010–11 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2010–11]], he again led the club to the [[2011 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France Final]], which they lost to French champions [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. In the [[2010–11 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]], PSG looked set for a final showdown with fierce rivals [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], but were stunned by [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] in the semi-final. The side performed much better in the [[2010–11 Ligue 1|league]], finishing fourth in spite of a limited playing squad. The Parisians almost achieved qualification to the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], but were let down by tiredness and an inability to perform when it mattered most.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, the attacking brand of football played under Kombouaré's guidance brought acclaim from both fans and writers for the capital club, with many people{{who|date=December 2011}} agreeing that PSG were playing their best football since [[Luis Fernandez]]'s first spell as coach between 1994 and 1996.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

During the [[2011–12 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2011–12 season]], PSG crashed out of the [[2011–12 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] and the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] during the first half of the season, and on 29 December 2011 – with his club top of the Ligue 1 table – Kombouaré was sacked by PSG sporting director [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]] and replaced by [[Carlo Ancelotti]], putting an end to much speculation about his position at the club. Despite holding top spot in Ligue 1 when he was sacked, the club ultimately finished as runners-up to champions Montpellier.

===Al-Hilal===
On 27 June 2012, it was confirmed that Kombouaré was appointed head coach of Saudi Arabian side [[Al-Hilal FC]] on a one-year deal with an option for a second, but he was sacked on 31 January 2013.

===Lens===
On 18 June 2013, Kombouaré became manager of [[RC Lens|Lens]], earning his team a promotion in his first season at the club after it finished in second place in the [[2013–14 Ligue 2]].

===Guingamp===
On 30 May 2016, Kombouaré became manager of Ligue 1 side [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]]. They finished the season in mid-table. On 6 November 2018, he was sacked due to poor results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guingamp se sépare d'Antoine Kombouaré |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Guingamp-va-se-separer-d-antoine-kombouare/956438|work=[[L'Équipe]]|date=6 November 2018|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee''' ({{nowrap|August 26}}, 1921 – {{nowrap|October 21}}, 2014) was an American newspaperman. He was the executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' from 1968 to 1991.&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; He became a national figure during the [[:Category:Presidency of Richard Nixon|presidency of Richard Nixon]], when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the [[Pentagon Papers]] and oversaw the publication of [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]'s stories documenting the [[Watergate scandal]]. At his death he held the title of vice president at-large of the ''Post''.

He was also an advocate for education and the study of history,&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; including working for years as an active trustee on the boards of several major educational, historical, and archeological research institutions.&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt;

==Early life==
A member of the [[Boston Brahmin]] [[Crowninshield family]], Bradlee was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on {{nowrap|August 26}}, 1921. His father was [[Frederick Bradlee|Frederick Josiah Bradlee, Jr.]] (1892–1970), a direct descendant of Nathan Bradley—the first American Bradley, born in the colony of Massachusetts in 1631. His mother, Josephine de Gersdorff (1896–1975), was awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] for starting an orphanage that sheltered children from Nazi Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Honors&gt;{{cite web |title=Honors |date=December 2, 2007 |accessdate=October 22, 2014 |website=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/01/AR2007120101576.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradlee's maternal grandfather, Carl August de Gersdorff (1865–1944), the son of a German immigrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick |title=The Ultimate Paper Trail |date=July 7, 2006 |accessdate=October 21, 2014 |website=FishbowlDC |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/the-ultimate-paper-trail_b2816 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010941/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/the-ultimate-paper-trail_b2816 |archivedate=October 23, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy New York lawyer. Bradlee's maternal grandmother was Helen Suzette Crowninshield (1868–1941), daughter of artist [[Frederic Crowninshield]] (1845–1918), another member of the Crowninshield family.&lt;ref name="welch"&gt;{{cite book |title= Welch Genealogy |first=Charles Alfred |last=Welch |pages=35–36|url=https://archive.org/details/welchgenealogy00welc }}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great-uncle was U.S. lawyer [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], 34th U.S. ambassador to Britain, and his great uncle was [[Frank Crowninshield|Francis Welch "Frank" Crowninshield]], the creator and editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]'', and a roommate of [[Condé Montrose Nast|Condé Nast]]. He had a brother named Frederick Bradlee (1919–2003), a writer and Broadway stage actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frederic Bradlee -- Actor and Writer, 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/nyregion/frederic-bradlee-actor-and-writer-84.html |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150527233110/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/nyregion/frederic-bradlee-actor-and-writer-84.html |archivedate=May 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=32787 Frederick Bradlee; Internet Broadway Database] accessed September 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevalier Josephine de Gersdorff, Bradlee's mother, was a direct descendant of [[Heinrich XXIX, Count of Reuss-Ebersdorf]], who was a [[lineal descendant]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[John of Denmark]], King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]], and [[John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]]. Through his father Frederick, Bradlee was also a lineal descendant of King [[Henry VII of England]] by an unknown British woman through their son Sir [[Roland de Velville]]. His maternal great-grandfather was Dr. Ernst Bruno von Gersdorff, who was a third cousin of [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom through Heinrich XXIX.&lt;ref name="Third Cousins To Queen Victoria"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd|title=Surprising Connections #6 and 7: Boston Cousins of Queen Victoria and Yankee Anecestors of Mrs. Thomas Philip "Tip" O'Neill Jr.|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/boston-cousins-of-queen-victoria-and-yankee-ancestors/|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society - Founded 1845|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Desendancy of John II of France and Bonne of Bohemia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd|title=The Royal Descendants of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies or the United States|year=2008|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Company|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8063-1786-1|page=910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee, the second of three children, grew up in a wealthy family with domestic staff.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt; With his brother, Freddy, and sister, Constance, he learned [[French language|French]], took piano lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] decimated the family's wealth however. During the [[Clutch Plague]], Bradlee's father worked odd jobs to support his family, including keeping the books for various clubs and institutions and supervising the janitors at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt;

Bradlee attended [[Dexter School]] before finishing at [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], where he played varsity baseball.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt; While attending St. Mark's, he contracted [[polio]].&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; He exercised regularly at home and developed strong arms and chest. He was able to fight off the effects of polio and could walk without limping.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; Thereafter he attended [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of the [[A.D. Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-harvard-finals-club-members/user-x|title=Famous Harvard Finals Club Members|work=Ranker|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek–English major and joined the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|Naval ROTC]].&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt;

== Career ==
===World War II===
Bradlee received his [[Officer's commission|naval commission]] two hours after graduating in 1942, joined the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], and worked as a communications officer in the Pacific during World War II. His duties included handling classified and coded cables, serving primarily on the destroyer [[USS Philip (DD-498)|USS ''Philip'']] fighting off the shore of Guam and arriving at [[Guadalcanal]] with the Second Transport Group, part of Task Group 62.4, commanded by Rear Admiral [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]]. Bradlee's main battles were [[Vella Lavella]], Saipan, Tinian, and Bougainville. He also fought in the biggest naval battle ever fought, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Campaign]], in the [[Borneo Campaign]], and made every landing in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Benjamin C. |last=Bradlee |title=Answering the Call: Benjamin C.

Bradlee's first marriage was to Jean [[Saltonstall family|Saltonstall]], who also came from a wealthy and prominent [[Boston Brahmin]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karr|first1=Ronald|editor1-last=Weir|editor1-first=Robert|title=Class in America: An Encyclopedia [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia Vol 3|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313337192|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on {{nowrap|August 8}}, 1942,&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; and had one son, [[Ben Bradlee Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Dylan |last1=Byers |first2=Hadas |last2=Gold |authorlink=Hadas Gold|title=Ben Bradlee dies |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 24, 2014 |website=Politico |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/ben-bradlee-dies-112094.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022013430/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/ben-bradlee-dies-112094.html |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a deputy managing editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Bradlee Jr. |date=2004 |accessdate=October 24, 2014 |website=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/bios/bradlee.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104043403/http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/bios/bradlee.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
After the war, in 1946, Bradlee became a reporter at the ''[[New Hampshire Sunday News]]'', a venture he helped launch. After he sold the paper, in 1948 he started working for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as a reporter.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; He got to know associate publisher Philip Graham, who was the son-in-law of the publisher, [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]. On {{nowrap|November 1}}, 1950, Bradlee was alighting from a streetcar in front of the White House just as [[Truman assassination attempt|two Puerto Rican nationalists attempted to shoot their way]] into [[Blair House]] in an attempt to kill President [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hunter and John Bainbridge, Jr., ''American Gunfight: The Plot To Kill Harry Truman - And The Shoot-Out That Stopped It'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2005), {{ISBN|0-7432-6068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 Graham helped Bradlee become assistant [[attaché|press attaché]] in the American embassy in Paris &lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt;

===Government work===
In 1952, Bradlee joined the staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the embassy's propaganda unit. USIE produced films, magazines, research, speeches, and news items for use by the [[CIA]] throughout Europe. USIE (later known as [[USIA]]) also controlled the [[Voice of America]], a means of disseminating pro-American "cultural information" worldwide. While at the USIE, according to a Justice Department memo from an assistant U.S. attorney in the [[Rosenberg Trial]], Bradlee was helping the [[CIA]] manage European propaganda regarding the spying conviction and execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] on {{nowrap|June 19}}, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mr. Maran &lt;!-- as given --&gt; |title=Office Memorandum |date=December 13, 1952 |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |url=http://www.namebase.org/foia/bradlee.html |publisher=United States Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo, addressed to U.S. Attorney Myles Lane and dated December 13, 1952, states that "[Mr. Bradlee] further advised that he was sent here by Robert Thayer, who is the head of the CIA in Paris ... he stated that he was supposed to have been met by a representative of the CIA at the airport but missed connections" and that "he has been trying to get in touch with [CIA Director] Allen Dulles." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Deborah |date=1991 |title=Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and Her Washington Post Empire.  |location= New York|publisher= Sheridan Press|page= 286 |isbn= 9780941781138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This memorandum was cited as evidence of Bradlee's CIA connections by author Deborah Davis in her 1979 biography of Washington Post publisher [[Katharine Graham]], ''[[Katharine the Great|Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and her Washington Post Empire]]''. Graham and Bradlee, in a controversial action that drew widespread accusations of censorship, demanded and obtained the recall of the book by Davis's publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which first disavowed the book, and then recalled and shredded 20,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Felsenthal |first=Carol |date=1993 |title=Power, Privilege and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story |location=New York |publisher=Seven Stories Press |pages=369–70 |isbn=9781888363869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis subsequently won a judgment against her publisher, however,&lt;ref&gt;Felsenthal, ''Power, Privilege and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story,'' p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; and the Justice Department memorandum that formed the primary basis for her claims regarding Bradlee's CIA affiliation was never disavowed, even by Bradlee himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradlee|first=Ben|title=A Good Life – Newspapering and Other Adventures|date=1995 |location= New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |pages=267–8 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in two subsequent editions of Davis's book without challenge and was cited by author Carol Felsenthal, in her 1999 book ''Power, Privilege, and The Post: The Katharine Graham Story''. Reporter Christopher Reed, in his obituary on Bradlee in ''[[The Guardian]]'', states that Bradlee "spent many years undercover as a counter-espionage informant, a government propagandist and an unofficial asset of the Central Intelligence Agency," initially by promulgating "CIA-directed European propaganda urging the controversial execution of the convicted American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reed |first=Christopher |date=2014-10-21 |title=Ben Bradlee Obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee was officially employed by USIE until 1953, and he began working for ''Newsweek'' in 1954.&lt;ref name=nyt2014 /&gt; While based in France, Bradlee divorced his first wife and married Antoinette Pinchot in 1957.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; At the time of the marriage, Antoinette's sister, [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], was married to [[Cord Meyer]],&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bizarre Tale of Ben Bradlee, JFK, and the Master Spy|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/22/the-bizarre-tale-of-ben-bradlee-jfk-and-the-master-spy.html|publisher=Daily Beast|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a key figure in [[Operation Mockingbird]],&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; a CIA program to influence the media. Antoinette Bradlee was also a close friend of Cicely d'Autremont, who was married to CIA counterintelligence chief [[James Jesus Angleton]]. Bradlee became friends with Angleton&lt;ref name="Daily Beast" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; but the two allegedly parted ways after the October 12, 1964, murder of Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, whose CIA connections and romantic ties to the late President John F. Kennedy made her death the object of intense scrutiny. Bradlee and Angleton gave conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the search for and disposition of the diary in which Pinchot Meyer recorded her affair with Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron and Nobile, Phillip. "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair." ''New Times''. July 9, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, while working as a reporter for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Bradlee created controversy when he interviewed members of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]]. They were [[Algeria]]n guerrillas who were in rebellion against the French government at the time.
According to Deborah Davis, author of the [[Katharine Graham]] biography ''Katharine the Great'', this had all the "earmarks of an intelligence operation". As a result of these interviews, Bradlee was forced to leave France.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Reed |title=Ben Bradlee obituary |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022024449/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Washington Post''===
[[File:Weekend at Newport- Golfing. Ben Bradlee, President Kennedy. Newport, RI (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Bradlee became friends with John F. Kennedy, golfing together in 1963]]
As a reporter in the 1950s, Bradlee became close friends with then-senator [[John F. Kennedy]], who had graduated from Harvard&lt;ref name="Kennedy Harvard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|title=John F. Kennedy graduates from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, June 1940.|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/WQWPwtgb-k65YMF85D6uIA.aspx|website=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years before Bradlee, and lived nearby. In 1960 Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and [[Richard Nixon]] in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, ''Conversations With Kennedy'' (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, Washington Bureau chief for ''Newsweek'', a position from which he helped negotiate the sale of the magazine to ''The Washington Post'' holding company. Bradlee maintained that position until being promoted to managing editor at the ''Post'' in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.

After Bradlee and Pinchot divorced, Bradlee married fellow journalist [[Sally Quinn]] on {{nowrap|October 20}}, 1978.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; Quinn and Bradlee had one child, [[Quinn Bradlee]], who was born in 1982 when Quinn was 40 and Bradlee was 60. In 2009 they appeared with Quinn Bradlee on the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and spoke of their son's having been born with Velo-cardio-facial syndrome, also known as [[DiGeorge syndrome]].

Bradlee retired as the executive editor of ''The Washington Post'' in September 1991 but continued to serve as vice president at large until his death.&lt;ref name=nyt2014 /&gt; He was succeeded as executive editor at the ''Post'' by [[Leonard Downie Jr.]], whom Bradlee had appointed as managing editor seven years earlier.
{{Watergate}}
Under Bradlee's leadership, ''The Washington Post'' took on major challenges during the [[Nixon administration]]. In 1971 ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''Post'' successfully challenged the government over the right to publish the [[Pentagon Papers]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; One year later, Bradlee backed reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] as they probed the break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters in the [[Watergate Hotel]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; According to Bradlee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/woo1int-1 |title=Biography and Video Interview of Ben Bradlee at Academy of Achievement |publisher=Achievement.org |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512205057/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/woo1int-1 |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's [[FBI]] associate director [[Mark Felt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=John |last1=Helton |first2=Todd |last2=Leopold |title=Washington Post's Ben Bradlee dies |date=October 22, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |website=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/us/ben-bradlee-dies/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025052433/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/us/ben-bradlee-dies/ |archivedate=October 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 ''Post'' reporter [[Janet Cooke]] won a Pulitzer Prize for "Jimmy's World", a profile of an 8-year-old [[heroin]] addict.

Retrieved December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As executive editor, Bradlee was roundly criticized in many circles for failing to ensure the article's accuracy. After questions about the story's veracity arose, Bradlee (along with publisher [[Donald E.

===Other work===

He had an acting role in ''[[Born Yesterday (1993 film)|Born Yesterday]]'', the [[1993 in film|1993]] remake of the 1950 romantic comedy. In 1983 he gave the inaugural [[Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecture Series|Vance Distinguished Lecture]] at [[Central Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Alayna. (2013, February 17).[http://www.ccsu.edu/cf_news/view.cfm?newsid=2777 Vance Series Adds to its Tradition of Distinguished Guest Speakers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414230946/http://www.ccsu.edu/cf_news/view.cfm?newsid=2777 |date=April 14, 2014 }}. ''New Britain Herald''. Retrieved on 2013-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; On {{nowrap|May 3}}, 2006, Bradlee received a [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C. Prior to receiving the honorary degree, he taught occasional journalism courses at Georgetown.

In 1991 he was persuaded by then–governor of Maryland [[William Donald Schaefer]] to accept the chairmanship of the Historic [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]] Commission and continued in that position through 2003. He also served for many years as a member of the board of trustees at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]],&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; and endowed the Benjamin C. Bradlee Annual Lecture in Journalism there. He continued to serve as vice chairman of the school's board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smcm.edu/trustees St. Mary's College of Maryland Board of Trustees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415130823/http://www.smcm.edu/trustees |date=April 15, 2009 }} from the college's website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Bradlee delivered the [[Theodore H. White]] lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore H. White lecture|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/th_white_1991_bradlee.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. His message:  Lying in Washington, whether in the White House or the Congress, is wrong, immoral, tearing at the fiber of our national instincts and institutions — and must stop. He said, "Lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years,  that we've all become immunized to it."  He went on to suggest that the deceit was degrading the respect for the truth.

In the fall of 2005, [[Jim Lehrer]] conducted six hours of interviews with Bradlee on a variety of topics, from the responsibilities of the press to Watergate to the [[Plame affair|Valerie Plame affair]]. The interviews were edited for an hour-long documentary, ''Free Speech: Jim Lehrer and Ben Bradlee'', which premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on {{nowrap|June 19}}, 2006.

==Later life and death==
At ''The Washington Post'', Bradlee carried the title vice president at large. He and Quinn lived at the [[Laird-Dunlop House|Todd Lincoln House]] in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Washington, D.C]]. The middle part of the house was built in 1792. They also restored [[Porto Bello (Drayden, Maryland)|Porto Bello]], their home in [[Drayden, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Brown |title=Porto Bello Restored |date=n.d. |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |website=Southern Accents |url=http://www.southernaccents.com/architecture/preservation/porto-bello-restored-00400000025395/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304212828/http://www.southernaccents.com/architecture/preservation/porto-bello-restored-00400000025395/ |archivedate=March 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee received the [[French Legion of Honor]], the highest award given by the French government, at a ceremony in 2007 in Paris.&lt;ref name=Honors/&gt;

Bradlee was named as a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama]] on {{nowrap|August 8}}, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients|title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was presented the medal at a White House ceremony on {{nowrap|November 20}}, 2013.

== Controversy ==
Bradlee has drawn criticism from several quarters{{Clarify|reason="several quarters" is not specific enough, clarity is needed as to who leveled criticism|date=January 2018}} for his perjury at the 1965 trial of the man accused of murdering Bradlee's sister-in-law [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], who was shot to death on October 12, 1964, while walking on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal|Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal]] towpath in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. Attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense (Alfred Hantman&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dovey Johnson Roundtree|Dovey J. Roundtree]]&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"&gt;McCabe, Katie, and Roundtree, Dovey Johnson. ''Justice Older Than the Law: The Life of Dovey Johnson Roundtree.'' Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum &amp; Nobile, "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair," p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; along with authors [[Peter Janney]]&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nina Burleigh]],&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, Nina. ''A Very Private Woman - the Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer.'' New York: Bantam Books, 1998, pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt; have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir ''A Good Life''.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum &amp; Nobile, ''The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair,'' p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchot Meyer biographers Janney&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; and Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of substantial information under oath. "Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his 'derisive scorn' for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law," author Burleigh wrote. "The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] champion of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was 'a family document.'"&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman,'' pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 memoir ''A Good Life'',  Bradlee revealed that his sister-in-law's diary contained information about her affair with the late President Kennedy and the fact that Bradlee had conspired with CIA counterintelligence chief [[James Angleton]] and others to destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, Ben., ''A Good Life – Newspapering and Other Adventures.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,  1995. pp. 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1965 trial, however, he failed to mention the diary when asked under oath what he had found when searching her studio on the night of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr.'' Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20, 1965, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, prosecuting attorney Hantman said that having knowledge of the diary at the trial "could have changed everything."&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Mary's Mosaic, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 autobiography, ''Justice Older than the Law'', defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expresses shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book, and states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;James Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document ... Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Volunteer service==
For many years Bradlee served on the board of trustees of [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]].&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; He was very active on the board and also played major roles in the establishment of the [[Center for the Study of Democracy (St. Mary's College of Maryland)|Center for the Study of Democracy]] at the college, where he also served on the advisory board.

He is also known for his work on the board of trustees of the [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|Historic St. Mary's City]] Commission, as well as narrating a documentary produced by the organization on the history of the early [[Province of Maryland|Maryland colony]].

'''Bernard Richard''' (born April 11, 1951) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[social worker]], [[lawyer]], and [[politician]] in the [[New Brunswick|Province of New Brunswick]].

==Early life and education==
Raised and educated in [[Cap-Pelé, New Brunswick]], Richard earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Moncton]] and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of New Brunswick]].

==Political career==
He first entered politics as a young man, running unsuccessfully in [[Shediac]] for the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] as a [[Parti acadien|Parti Acadien]] candidate in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1974|1974 election]]. He became involved in municipal politics in the [[village]] of Cap-Pélé. His second entry into provincial politics was in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1991|1991 election]], this time as a [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal]]. He won. He was re-elected in [[New Brunswick general election, 1995|1995]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1999|1999]] and [[New Brunswick general election, 2003|2003]].

He was named to [[Executive Council of New Brunswick|cabinet]] in 1995 and left in 1998 to contest the leadership of the Liberal Party. He was unsuccessful in his leadership bid and was returned to the cabinet position by [[Camille Thériault]] who was the victor in the contest. Richard managed to be re-election by the largest margin of any candidate in the 1999 election, despite the fact that his party suffering a massive defeat.

When Thériault resigned as leader in 2001, Richard briefly considered another run but instead became [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]]. When [[Shawn Graham]] became leader in 2002, Richard was made [[House Leader]] and finance critic, two key roles in the opposition. Richard maintained these roles after the 2003 election.

The [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Bernard Lord]] had won a bare majority in 2003, winning 28 of 55 seats and were anxious to strengthen their position. After first attempting to convince a Liberal to sit as [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] and then offering cabinet positions and other appointments to several Liberals, Richard accepted the post of provincial [[ombudsman]], thus resigning his seat and increasing the [[Tory]] majority to 28/54 for the ensuing year before a [[by-election]] was held.

On November 6, 2007, New Brunswick news outlets reported that the Progressive Conservatives were encouraging Richard to leave his post as ombudsman and return to politics [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick leadership election, 2008|as leader]] of their party.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McHardie.

Myers was born in North Carolina, but spent her childhood in Ohio and upstate New York.&lt;ref name=wpbriefbio&gt;{{cite news|title=Who runs government: Beth Myers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/beth-myers/gIQAuY3fKP_topic.html|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wprucker&gt;{{cite news|last=Rucker|first=Philip|title=Beth Myers, longtime Romney adviser and confidante, to lead VP search|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/beth-myers-longtime-romney-adviser-and-confidante-to-lead-vp-search/2012/04/16/gIQAj72PMT_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Tufts University with a degree in English in 1979, she joined [[Ronald Reagan]]’s 1980 presidential campaign, becoming an early protege of Republican campaign political strategist [[Karl Rove]].&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt; Her task in the campaign was overseeing voter identification programs in rural counties throughout Texas.&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt; During the 1980s she worked for the state election campaigns of [[Ray Shamie]] in Massachusetts, serving as Shamie's deputy campaign manager, and of Governor [[Bill Clements]] in Texas. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from Southern Methodist University School of Law in 1991. After law school, she worked as a litigation associate at [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld|Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, &amp; Feld LLP]].&lt;ref name=hablaz&gt;{{cite news|last=Haberman|first=Maggie|title=Lazio, 'sprinting' with new staff|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0710/Lazio_sprinting_with_new_staff_.html?showall|newspaper=Politico|date=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers settled with her husband in Massachusetts, where she served as chief of staff to former state treasurer [[Joe Malone (politician)|Joe Malone]].&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt; In 1998, she retired from politics to stay at home and raise her two young children.&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt;

==Gubernatorial experience==

Myers returned to politics during Mitt Romney’s [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 campaign]] for the governorship of Massachusetts, in which she would play the role of the Democratic opponent during debate rehearsals.&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt; After helping Romney win the governor's race, Myers served as Romney’s chief of staff during his [[Governorship of Mitt Romney|four years in office]] (2003—2006).&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Glen|title=Mitt Romney's choice of Beth Myers to lead VP search highlights his small circle of trust|url=http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/04/17/mitt-romney-choice-beth-myers-lead-search-highlights-his-small-circle-trust/56z647zAdJfkn93k1kjyyL/story.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shawmut Group==

On Romney’s leaving the governor’s office in 2006, Myers co-founded a consulting firm, The Shawmut Group, along with two other senior Romney advisors, [[Eric Fehrnstrom]] and [[Peter Flaherty]].&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; One of their most prominent clients has been [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], a then little-known Republican state senator whom they helped win the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|2010 special election]] to fill the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=wprucker/&gt; Myers has also advised Republican [[Rick Lazio]] in his unsuccessful 2010 campaign against [[Andrew Cuomo]] for the governorship of New York.&lt;ref name=hablaz/&gt; Mitt Romney's [[Free and Strong America PAC]] is another client of The Shawmut Group.

==2008 presidential campaign==

Myers worked closely with Romney again in 2007–08, serving as campaign manager in his bid for the presidency.&lt;ref name=wpbriefbio/&gt;

==2012 presidential campaign==

In April 2012, Romney announced that he had chosen Myers to lead his [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|presidential campaign]]’s search to help him select a vice presidential candidate.&lt;ref name=veepsearch&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Emily|title=Romney picks head of Veep search, says talks started this weekend|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/romney-picks-head-of-veep-search-says-talks-started-this-weekend/|publisher=ABC News|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{cite news|last=Peoples|first=Kasie Huntsteve|title=Ryan selection shrouded in secrecy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-08-12/ryan-selection-shrouded-in-secrecy#p1|newspaper=Businessweek|date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romney aides have described Myers as Romney's most trusted advisor.&lt;ref name=politico50&gt;{{cite news|title=50 politicos to watch: players in a Romney presidency|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78292.html|newspaper=Politico|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=veepborg&gt;{{cite news|last=Borger|first=Gloria|title=How Romney chose his running mate|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/11/exclusive-how-romney-chose-his-running-mate/?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|date=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==

In 2013, Myers was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the [[Hollingsworth v. Perry]] case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/28/the-pro-freedom-republicans-are-coming-131-sign-gay-marriage-brief.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 midterm election, Myers' son, Curt Myers, ran for MA State Representative in Brookline, MA. He challenged Rep. [[Frank Smizik]] (D) and lost 80% to 20%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">'''Betty Humby Beecham, Lady Beecham''' (8 April 1908 – 2 September 1958) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pianist]], who married the English conductor and impresario Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] in February 1943. She was 29 years his junior.

==Biography==
Betty Humby was the daughter of Daniel Morgan Humby, a dentist and member of the Royal College of Surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p13720.htm#i137192|title=ThePeerage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 10, she was the youngest person ever to win a scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851258,00.html|title=Time Magazine, June 1941 | date=30 June 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where she also won the [[Sterndale Bennett]] Prize. When she was 14, she taught 30 pupils of her own, and two years later she became a piano professor, under [[Myra Hess]] at [[Tobias Matthay]]'s London music school.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Later she married an Anglican priest, the Revd H. Cashel Thomas, who in the early 1940s was vicar of St Philip's in London. They had a son, Sir Jeremy Cashel Thomas, born 1 June 1931; he became a diplomat.

With the outbreak of World War II, Thomas organised concerts in British cathedrals. In 1940, she left Britain for the United States with her young son, Jeremy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; While in the US she hoped to raise money for London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] for Sick Children, where her brother was chief surgeon.

Having first met in the 1930s in England, Humby and Sir Thomas Beecham were reintroduced in the US by Andrew Schulhof, who managed each of them. He later arranged for them to perform the [[Piano Concerto (Delius)|Delius piano concerto]] together in June 1941 at a studio concert for [[CBS]].

Humby married Beecham on 19 January 1943, one month after a divorce was granted from Beecham's wife Utica Celestia Welles. According to John Lucas's biography, ''Thomas Beecham: An Obsession with Music'', they were married before a police justice in Manhattan. On the advice of their legal advisers, in order to "assure compliance with the technicalities of English law", they underwent a second marriage on 7 September 1944, before Supreme Court Justice Samuel Null in his chambers at Country Court House, New York.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Charles Reid, ''Thomas Beecham: An Independent Biography'', 1961, p. 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in New York City at 31 East 79th Street.

Her best-known recording is probably that of the [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] [[Piano Concerto (Delius)|Piano Concerto]], with her husband conducting the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], in October 1946, shortly after he had founded it. This recording of 1946 replaced an earlier version, made with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] on 3 October 1945, which was not released.&lt;ref&gt;T. Beecham, ''Frederick Delius'' (Severn House Edition 1975) (cf. discography by Malcolm Walker).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lucas biography, her performance of the Delius concerto at Lafayette, Indiana, on 1 December 1950, marked the end of Lady Betty's playing career.

She died of a heart attack in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in 1958. She was 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8FZlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=64kNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5290,196255&amp;dq=Betty%20Humby&amp;hl=en|title=The Vancouver Sun - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was cremated there and the ashes returned to England. They had been in Argentina for Beecham to conduct ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and ''[[Fidelio]]'' at the [[Teatro Colón]].  He cancelled two rehearsals the next day, but continued his schedule.  The last night of ''Fidelio'' was also his swansong as an opera conductor.&lt;ref name=reid/&gt;

A '''chief security officer''' ('''CSO''') is an [[corporation|organization's]] most senior [[corporate officer|executive]] accountable for the development and oversight of policies and programs intended for the mitigation and/or reduction of [[security|compliance, operational, strategic, financial and reputational security risk]] strategies relating to the protection of people, intellectual assets and tangible property.  

The accountabilities of the CSO include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
* In cooperation with the organization’s executive leadership team(s), directs the development of an effective strategy to assess and mitigate risk (foreign and domestic), manage crises and incidents, maintain continuity of operations, and safeguard the organization. 
* Directing staff in identifying, developing, implementing, and maintaining security processes, practices, and policies throughout the organization to reduce risks, respond to incidents, and limit exposure and liability in all areas of information, financial, physical, personal, and reputational risk.
* Ensures the organization’s compliance with the local, national, and international regulatory environments where applicable to the accountability of this role (i.e. privacy, [[Information privacy|data protection]], and environmental, health and safety).
* Researches and deploys state-of-the-art technology solutions and innovative security management techniques to safeguard the organization’s personnel and assets, including intellectual property and trade secrets. Establishes appropriate standards and associated risk controls.
* Develops relationships with high-level officials in law enforcement [and international counterparts] to include in-country security [and international security agencies], intelligence, and other relevant governmental functions as well as private sector counterparts [worldwide].
* Through other internal policy committees, personnel and/or other external resources, coordinates and implements site security, operations, and activities to ensure protection of executives, managers, employees, customers, stakeholders, visitors, etc., as well as all physical and information assets, while ensuring optimal use of personnel and equipment.
 
Digital or cyber security, sometimes referred to as IT security, does have a cooperative inter-connected involvement.  Some organizations have combined various elements of security programs within the "[[chief information security officer]]" (CISO) function. IT security typically addresses security-related risk issues across all layers of an organization's technology stack. This may include:

* Emerging Technologies and Market Trends
* Identity and access management
* Incident and crisis management
* Information and privacy protection
* Risk and compliance management
* Security architecture
* Organizational resiliency programs and assessments
* Threat, intelligence and vulnerability management

A '''construction worker''' is a [[tradesman|tradesperson]], [[laborer]], or [[professional]] employed in the physical [[construction]] of the [[built environment]] and its [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/construction-worker|title=Construction worker definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term construction worker is a generic term and most construction workers are primarily described by the type of work they perform (their [[Tradesman|trade]]).  Construction workers may also [[colloquialism|colloquially]] be referred to as "hard hat workers" or "hard hats",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/hardhat|title=hardhat|work=Wordnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they often wear [[hardhat]]s for safety.

Construction workers often work under a [[construction foreman]].

While most construction workers learn on the job as an informal apprentice to an experienced tradesman, formal [[apprenticeship]] programs are common, particularly in developed countries with [[trade union]]s.

==Trades==
{{main article|List of construction trades}}
The [[division of labor]] of construction encompasses a diverse range of [[Skill (labor)|skilled]] and [[manual labor|manual]] labor.

Among the most common construction trades are those of [[Carpentry|carpenter]], [[electrician]], [[heavy equipment operator]], [[ironworker]], [[laborer]], [[Masonry|mason]], [[plasterer]], [[plumber]], [[pipefitter]], [[Sheet Metal Workers' International Association|sheet metal worker]], [[steel fixer]] (also known as a "rodbuster"), and [[welder]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prospect360.co.uk/uk-construction-trade-list&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Construction safety is very important to ensure a safe environment for the workers. All construction workers need to be educated on safety at each construction site to minimize injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tool to Design for Construction Worker Safety|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0431(1997)3:1(32)|journal = Journal of Architectural Engineering|date = 1997-01-01|issn = 1076-0431|pages = 32–41|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0431(1997)3:1(32)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2008, a [[Human Rights Watch]] report described unsafe and unfair working conditions and failure on the part of the Chinese government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite techreport |editor-first=Sophie |editor-last=Richardson |title=One Year of My Blood: Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in Beijing |institution=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=12 March 2008 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/03/11/one-year-my-blood-0 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimated that, at the end of 2006, 90% of the 40 million construction workers in China were [[migrant worker]]s. Many of the migrant workers turned to construction work after their farming communities collapsed into poverty.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]] labor is prevalent in the construction industry. Because of the questionable legal status of these workers, employers often have the ability to commit crimes such as [[wage theft]] and violation of workplace standards without fear of facing consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/10/176677299/construction-booming-in-texas-but-many-workers-pay-dearly|title=Construction Booming In Texas, But Many Workers Pay Dearly|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar abuse of immigrant labor is also a problem in [[Qatar]] during the lead up to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] where workers mostly from poor countries in the Indian Sub-continent are forced to work in desert conditions for as little as €6.20 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/qatar-construction-workers-earn-55c-an-hour-1.1881868|title=Qatar construction workers earn 55c an hour|work=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobrev was born 20 July 1914 in the village of [[Bailovo]].&lt;ref name="Nst"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bulgarian beggar, dubbed a 'living saint', dies aged 103|url=https://www.nst.com.my/world/2018/02/335563/bulgarian-beggar-dubbed-living-saint-dies-aged-103|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=New Strait Times|date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Dimitar, died in [[World War I]] and his mother, Katerina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Дядо Добри – светецът от Байлово|url=https://bulgarianhistory.org/dqdo-dobri/|website=Българска история|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, had to raise their children by herself.&lt;ref name="Falle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/mundo/fallecio-principal-donante-iglesia-bulgara-mendigo-103-anos_0_SkrijRbvf.html|title=Falleció el principal donante de la Iglesia búlgara, un mendigo de 103 años|publisher=Clarin|date=15 February 2018|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrev did not remember his youth and school years.&lt;ref name="Nst"/&gt;

==Adult life==
Over the years, Dobrev became detached from the material aspects of life and devoted himself entirely to the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], specifically in the Orthodox faith. Around the year 2000, he decided to donate all his belongings to the Orthodox church when he began to live very modestly in a small extension to the [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] parish church in his native village of Bailovo. About that time, he embarked on his mission to raise funds for the restoration of churches and monasteries across Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vaau8iT0D0o|Дядо Добри от Байлово – България}} – част от филма „Лепта" (2000&amp;nbsp;г.), продукция на фондация „Покров Богородичен"&lt;/ref&gt; It is this new direction in life and the example he gave with his asceticism that led many to call him ''The Saint of Bailovo''.&lt;ref name=duma&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.duma.bg/duma/node/24378 | title = Дядо Добре Добрев – божий странник, пътник от бъдещето, Деси Велева | accessdate = 27 September 2012 | date = 17 December 2011 | publisher = в. „Дума" | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130628012652/http://www.duma.bg/duma/node/24378 | archivedate = 28 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his lifetime, Dobrev donated over 80,000 [[Bulgarian lev]] (40,000 euros)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-buzz/98-old-homeless-bulgarian-man-donates-thousands-restore-181548553.html|title=98-year-old homeless Bulgarian man donates thousands to restore churches|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to churches, monasteries and other noble deeds. Among his biggest donations are:
* 10,000 Bulgarian lev (5,000 euros) to the [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] parish church in his native Bailovo&lt;ref name=Staridolska&gt;{{cite news|author=Lubomir|title=Heavenly dreams of Easter|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2012-05-15&amp;article=409813|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=[[Standard (newspaper)|c.

* 25,000 Bulgarian lev (12,500 euros) for restoration of the Eleshnishki Monastery ''[[Mother Mary]]'' located to the east of Sofia, and the local church in the village of [[Gorno Kamartsi]].&lt;ref name=Staridolska /&gt;
* 35,700 Bulgarian lev (17,850 euros) for the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Cathedral of Alexander Nevsky]] in Sofia, which is the biggest donation in the known history of the over 100-year-old cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/27/dobri-dobrev_n_4867974.html|title=This 99-Year-Old Man Begs Every Day And Gives It All Away To Churches And Orphanages|first=Eleanor|last=Goldberg|date=27 February 2014|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Dobrev married around 1940, as [[Bulgaria]] joined [[World War II]]. In one of the [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombings of Sofia]], a bomb fell near him and he lost almost all his hearing.&lt;ref name="BNR"/&gt; Dobrev and his wife had four children, two of whom he outlived.&lt;ref name="Falle"/&gt;
Dobrev was an Orthodox Christian and commonly talked about Jesus to others whether they donated or not. He was usually very thankful to those who donated. 

Dobrev died on 13 February 2018, at [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]]. He was 103.&lt;ref name="BNR"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100932883/elder-dobri-passes-away-at-103 |title=Elder Dobri passes away at 103 |access-date=February 13, 2018 |date=February 13, 2018 |work=[[Radio Bulgaria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Henry''' "'''Ned'''" '''Harriman''' (February 20, 1848 – September 9, 1909) was an American railroad executive.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4fcZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |title= E.

==Early life==
Harriman was born on February 20, 1848 in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]], the son of Orlando Harriman, Sr., an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] clergyman, and Cornelia Neilson.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Edward H.

His father was an ordained deacon in the Presbyterian Church, his mother a well-connected socialite from New Jersey.  ... |newspaper=[[PBS]] |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a brother, [[Orlando Harriman, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Orlando Harriman Dead. Brother of E.H. Harriman and Big Realty Operator |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/30/104888176.pdf |quote=Orlando Harriman, brother or the late EH Harriman, died early yesterday in Dr. John Walker's Sanitarium, 33 East Thirty-third Street, from a complication of ... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 30, 1911 |accessdate=2012-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather, William Harriman, had emigrated from [[England]] in 1795 and engaged successfully in trading and commercial pursuits.

As a young boy, Harriman spent a summer working at the Greenwood Iron Furnace in the area owned by the [[Robert Parker Parrott]] family that would become [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]]. He quit school at age 14 to take a job as an errand boy on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]]. His uncle [[Oliver Harriman]] had earlier established a career there. By age 22, he was a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==Career==
Harriman's father-in-law was president of the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] Company, which aroused Harriman's interest in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] transportation. In 1881, Harriman acquired the small, broken-down Lake Ontario Southern Railroad. He renamed it the Sodus Bay &amp; Southern, reorganized it, and sold it to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] at a considerable profit. This was the start of his career as a rebuilder of bankrupt railroads.

[[File: Will you walk into my parlor - U. Keppler 1907.jpg|thumb|A 1907 cartoon depicting Harriman and his railroads as subject to federal law and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]]]
Harriman was nearly 50 years old when in 1897 he became a director of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. By May 1898, he was chairman of the executive committee, and from that time until his death, his word was the law on the Union Pacific system. In 1903, he assumed the office of president of the company. From 1901 to 1909, Harriman was also the President of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. The vision of a unified UP/SP railroad was planted with Harriman. (The UP and SP were reunited on September 11, 1996, a month after the [[Surface Transportation Board]] had approved their merger.)

At the time of his death Harriman controlled the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the [[St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad|Saint Joseph and Grand Island]], the [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]], the [[Central of Georgia Railroad|Central of Georgia]], the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]], and the [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express Company]]. Estimates of his estate ranged from $150&amp;nbsp;million to $200&amp;nbsp;million. It was left entirely to his wife.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===The Harriman Alaska Expedition===
{{main|Harriman Alaska Expedition}}
In 1899, Harriman sponsored and accompanied a scientific expedition to catalog the flora and fauna of the [[Alaska]] coastline. Many prominent scientists and naturalists went on the expedition, aboard the luxuriously refitted {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} steamer ''George W. Elder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harriman/1899/1899_part/participantharriman.html|website=PBS|title=E.H. Harriman: Harriman Expedition Retraced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest in ju-jitsu===
Harriman became interested in [[ju-jitsu]] after his two-month visit to Japan in 1905.&lt;ref name="Japan_Visit"&gt;{{cite news|title=HARRIMAN TO VISIT JAPAN.; He Will Take His Family and Be Away Several Months.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/06/28/101415304.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 28, 1905|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to America, he brought with him a troupe of six Japanese ju-jitsu wrestlers, including the prominent [[judoka]]s [[Tsunejiro Tomita]] and [[Mitsuyo Maeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JU-JITSU AS IN JAPAN.; E.H.

==Personal life==

===Harriman estate===
In 1885, Harriman acquired "[[Arden (estate)|Arden]]", the {{convert|7863|acre|km2|adj=on}} Parrott family estate in the [[Ramapo Highlands]] near [[Tuxedo, New York]], for $52,500. The property had been a source of charcoal for the Parrott Brothers Iron Works. Over the next several years he purchased almost 40 different nearby parcels of land, adding {{convert|20000|acre|km2}}, and connected all of them with {{convert|40|mi}} of bridle paths. His {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} residence, Arden House, was completed only seven months before he died.

In the early 1900s, his sons [[W. Averell Harriman]] and [[E. Roland Harriman]] hired landscape architect [[Arthur P. Kroll]] to landscape many acres. In 1910, his widow donated {{convert|10000|acre|km2}} to the state of New York for [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]]. The estate was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.  In 1977, they gave the State of Idaho another [https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/harriman Harriman State Park]" on several conditions.  One of these was that the waters of the Henry's Fork, which flowed through the property, had to be managed for catch-and-release fly fishing.  To this day it is considered one of the greatest fly fishing streams in North America.

===Namesakes===
*The [[Union Pacific Harriman Dispatch Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] is named for Edward H. Harriman. 
*[[Harriman Glacier]] in [[Alaska]]'s [[Chugach National Forest]], located in [[Whittier, Alaska]], was named for him by the [[Harriman Alaska Expedition]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harriman’s idea for the club was to provide a place "for the boys, so as to get them off the streets and teach them better manners."&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; By 1901, the club had outgrown its space. Harriman purchased several lots on 10th and [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]], and a five-story clubhouse was completed in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable quotations===
"Much good work is lost for the lack of a little more."

"Cooperation means 'Do as I say, and do it damn quick.'" &lt;ref&gt;attributed to Harriman by Delos F. Wilcox in "Co-operation Between State and Local Authorities in the Control of Public Utilities", Minnesota Municipalities Vol V Number 1, February 1920, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Harriman is mentioned in the movie ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), as the commercial baron whose agents become the title characters' [[Archenemy|nemeses]]. In the film's second train robbery, a railroad employee &lt;!-- Woodcock --&gt; ascribes his refusal to cooperate with the robbery to his obligations to Harriman personally, and one of Butch and Sundance's intimates &lt;!-- the character modeled after [[Etta Place]]--&gt; describes &lt;!--(after the outlaws' initial escape from the specially-equipped train following the second robbed train)--&gt; Harriman's hiring of famed outlaw-hunters to track down the gang's leaders.
*In the movie ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), a railroad official named "Harrigan" takes the same strategy.

'''George Howe''' (1769 – 11 May 1821) was a poet, printer, and editor of the first Australian newspaper, the ''[[Sydney Gazette]]''.

== Early life ==

Howe was the son of Thomas Howe, a government printer on [[Basseterre]], Saint Christopher Island (now better known as [[Saint Kitts]]) in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;J. V. Byrnes, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010519b.htm Howe, George (1769–1821)]', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 1, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1966, pp 557–559. Retrieved 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 21, he went to London and worked as a printer for ''[[The Times]]''. In March 1799, he was charged with [[shoplifting]] and sentenced to death, but this was commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] for life to [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Howe arrived at Sydney on 22 November 1800.&lt;ref name=DAB&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=George|Last=Howe|shortlink=0-dict-biogHi-Hu.html#howe1|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Editor of the ''Sydney Gazette'' ==

A small printing press had been brought to Australia by [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Arthur Phillip]], and a convict named George Hughes used it to print a considerable number of orders, rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=DAB/&gt; Soon after he arrived George Howe became the government printer, and in 1802 printed ''[[New South Wales General Standing Orders]]'' consisting of 146 pages, the first book to be printed in Australia. In May 1803 [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]], in a dispatch to Lord Hobart, mentioned the establishment of the ''Sydney Gazette'' as a weekly publication—its first number had appeared on 5 March and asked that a new font of type should be sent to Sydney. The paper was carried on at the risk of Howe, who, though he had been fully emancipated in 1806,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; did not receive a salary as government printer until 1811 when he was granted only £60 a year. In the meantime Howe conducted the ''Gazette'' under difficulties, often running out of paper and suffering much from patrons who fell behind in their subscriptions. In 1810 a lightning strike almost destroyed Howes's printing office.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Howe tried various expedients to keep his household going, at one time keeping a school and at another becoming a professional debt collector. Another of these expedients was becoming a professional mobile food stand for the public, he did this for 3 years.

In addition to the ''Gazette'' Howe began the publication of the ''New South Wales Pocket Almanac'' in 1806, which became a regular yearly publication from 1808 to 1821. He also began trading in [[sandalwood]], and in 1813 found himself liable for over £90 of duty on two consignments. He appears to have become more prosperous, as in 1817 he was one of the original subscribers when the [[Bank of New South Wales]] was founded. Howe died on 11 May 1821 and left an estate of £400. He was married twice, and his second wife survived him with children of both marriages. He seems to have been a man of indomitable spirit and, considering his difficulties, was a good printer and editor. The memorial placed in the printing office by his son stated that "his charity knew no bounds".

== Family ==
Howe's eldest son, Robert (1795–1829), helped his father from age 9, but as a teenager rebelled, indulging in excessive alcohol consumption and fathering an illegitimate child before converting to Methodism under the guidance of [[Ralph Mansfield]] and returning to the family business in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goff|first=Victoria|title=Convicts and Clerics: Their Roles in the Infancy of the Press in Sydney, 1803–1840|journal=Media History|date=1998|volume=4|page=105|doi=10.1080/13688809809357939|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13688809809357939|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''More Pig Bites Baby!

Howe's [[Typography|typographical]] work. Like many other editors in colonial Australia, Howe was implicated in several libel suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goff|first=Victoria|title=Convicts and Clerics: Their Roles in the Infancy of the Press in Sydney, 1803–1840|journal=Media History|date=1998|volume=4|page=111|doi=10.1080/13688809809357939|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13688809809357939|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, his editorial policies, stemming from his religious convictions and the newspaper's continuing support for the government, led to him being horsewhipped by [[William Redfern]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Starting 1 January 1821, the ''Gazette'' was jointly edited by Mansfield, a division of duties that Howe hoped would facilitate his retirement from the newspaper. Less than a month later, on 29 January 1829, Howe drowned in a boating accident off Fort Denison, leaving his wife, Ann, as proprietor of the ''Gazette'' and Mansfield as the editor.

George Terry Howe (c. 1806–63), Robert's younger half-brother by his father's [[common law marriage|common law]] wife, Elizabeth Easton, went to [[Launceston, Tasmania]] in October 1821, becoming the town's first printer and the founding editor of the ''Tasmanian and Port Dalrymple Advertiser''. In 1825, he was persuaded by the Lt. Governor Sir [[George Arthur]] to form a partnership with James Ross in Hobart, where he was appointed government printer and co-edited the ''Hobart Town Gazette''. In 1827, he left the ''Gazette'' to edit the ''Tasmanian'' for six months before returning to Sydney. He died there on 6 April 1863. He was married and had six daughters and a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Howe, George Terry (1806–1863)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/howe-george-terry-2204/text2853|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Jacobs Sr.''' (1609–1692) was an English colonist in his 70s in the Massachusetts Bay Colony who was accused of witchcraft in 1692 during the [[Salem witch trials]] in Salem Village, Massachusetts. He was convicted and hanged on August 19, 1692. His son, George Jr., was also accused but evaded arrest. Jacobs' accusers included his daughter-in-law and granddaughter, Margaret.&lt;ref name=enders&gt;Enders A. Robinson. ''The Devil Discovered: Salem Witchcraft 1692''. Waveland Press, Prospect Heights, IL. 2001 (1991). pp. 336–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs is believed to be the George Jacob baptized 13 February 1608/09 at St. Dunstan in the West, London, son of barber-surgeon George Jacob and wife Priscilla of [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=William Wyman|year=2004|title=The Probable English Origin of George1 Jacob(s) of Salem, Massachusetts|url=|journal=[[The American Genealogist]]|volume=79|pages=3–12, 209–17, 253–59.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
Jacobs' body was buried near where he was hanged. In the 1970s bones were found that were believed to be his. They were tested and found to have [[osteoarthritis]]. George Jacobs walked with two canes. The bones were found in a drawer at the Danvers Historical Society. At a ceremony in 1992 marking the 300th anniversary of the Salem Witch Trials, Jacobs' remains were reinterred at the Nurse Graveyard at the [[Rebecca Nurse Homestead]], which is maintained as a historic site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebeccanurse.org Rebecca Nurse Homestead], official site, accessed 28 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Trial of George Jacobs''==
The painting below was created by [[Tompkins Harrison Matteson|Thompkins H. Matteson]] in 1855, and is based on the accounts of George Jacobs' granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/salem/people/gjacobspics2.html George Jacobs, Sr.], Salem Witch Trials, Virginia.edu, accessed 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
By moving a cursor across the painting, viewers can identify Jacobs, who is being consoled by his son, also named George. The painting is entitled ''Trial of George Jacobs, August 5, 1692.''

{{Salem Trial of George Jacobs}}
On the left of the painting is Chief Magistrate [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], who would later serve three terms as Governor of Massachusetts. Jacobs' principal accuser was his granddaughter, who implicated him in an attempt to save her own life. Jacobs' daughter-in-law is the woman standing and being held back. She was thought to be mentally ill (brain tumor). [[John Hathorne]], the judge hearing the accusation, is thought to be an ancestor of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. He holds a book and points at Jacobs' granddaughter, as if challenging her to substantiate her earlier written statements. In the foreground are a girl and boy who are having fits, allegedly caused by Jacobs' wizardry. The boy is unknown but the girl may be either Jacobs' servant or accuser [[Ann Putnam Jr.]]

==Representation in other media==
Jacobs appears as a minor character in the 1996 film ''[[The Crucible (1996 film)|The Crucible]],'' based on [[Arthur Miller]]'s [[The Crucible|1953 play about the Salem witch trials]]. He was portrayed by [[William Preston (actor)|William Preston]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4130">'''Gheorghe Marin Fontanin''' (October 1825&amp;ndash;April 24, 1886) was an [[Austrian Empire|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Wallachia]]n and [[Romania]]n educator.

Born in [[Brașov]], in the [[Transylvania]] region, his father Dumitru Marin was a merchant from [[Voinești, Dâmbovița|Izvoarele]], [[Dâmbovița County]], [[Wallachia]], who fled north during the [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|1821 uprising]]. His mother, ''née'' Hagi-Panteli, was from [[Bucharest]]. Gheorghe added ''Fontanin'' to his name; this was a latinization of his father's native village, Izvoarele ("the streams").&lt;ref name="p"&gt;Pătrașcu, pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the Latinist school of Romanian culture, he later helped edit a Latin-Romanian dictionary.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt;

He studied in Brașov and in a private boarding school at [[Sibiu]]. He continued his education at [[Cluj]] and at the [[University of Vienna]], where he took a doctorate in philosophy. In 1848, he was in Bucharest, a participant in [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|that year's revolution]], but fled to Sibiu for a few months after the city was occupied by the Ottomans. He later returned to Bucharest and in 1851 moved to [[Craiova]], where he became director of the [[Carol I National College|Central School]],&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; which had shut down during the revolution. In 1853, early in the [[Crimean War]], the Russian Army closed the school and turned it into a hospital. Fontanin protested and was imprisoned for seven months, but managed to reopen the following year. He ardently supported the [[United Principalities|Union of Wallachia with Moldavia]], and in 1857 presided over the election of [[Dolj County]] deputies for the [[Ad hoc Divans|ad-hoc divan]].&lt;ref name="aman"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://aman.ro/betawp/wp-content/uploads/personalitati/F/fontanin%20george%20marin.pdf "Fontanin, George Marin"], at the Alexandru and Aristia Aman County Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontanin was noted for his considerable knowledge and reserved demeanor, and only formed a few friendships. Preoccupied by scientific problems and uncommunicative, he was seen as a legendary figure by the students.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; He taught various subjects: in the 1850s, he was responsible for Romanian, Latin, history and geography for one grade, and also served as inspector. In 1864, he took on the newly introduced subject of philosophy. His penchant for latinization extended to the schoolboys' names. He often spent summer vacations in Rome, deepening his studies and purchasing books in Latin, Italian, French, German and English, all languages he knew well, in addition to Hungarian and Old Church Slavonic. He was a gifted translator from Latin, also working on Greek philosophy and literature, as well as modern languages. Due to Fontanin's almost pathological reticence, many of his writings remained unpublished.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

In 1870, he was elected a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=F Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; He founded a professor's club at Craiova and served as its president. In 1881, he edited its magazine, ''Vocea română'', where eleven of his poems appeared. Fontanin retired as school director the same year. He died in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">A '''guerrilla librarian''' is a person who may or may not be a professional librarian, but has otherwise taken up the stewardship of books or other material. This stewardship is usually outside the acceptance of authority figures, hence the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] or [[Underground culture (disambiguation)|underground]] nature of the action taken. Guerrilla librarianship can be politicized and occasionally controversial.

==Early history of guerrilla librarians, 1990s==
With the rise of electronic resources, some more “traditional” librarians in the [[San Francisco Public Library]] system were reported to hide books to protect them from destruction. In a column in the April 1997 [[American Library Association|ALA]] publication ''[[American Libraries]]'', the reference librarian Will Manley referred to these librarians as “guerrilla librarians.” &lt;ref&gt;Manley, Will. "Guerrilla librarians." ''American Libraries'', April 1997., 192, Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts with Full Text, EBSCOhost (accessed November 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The librarians attempted to save the books marked for destruction or the discard pile by stamping them with incorrect due dates.&lt;ref&gt;Wisner, William H. ''Whither the Postmodern Library? Libraries, Technology, and Education in the Information Age''.  Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland and Company, Inc., 2000. {{ISBN|0-7864-0795-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In 1987, a planning study was conducted by library consultants Becker &amp; Hayes Inc. This study found that “The library will pursue an active 'weeding' program in the next two decades to extend the useful life of the facility... up to 50 percent of the material could be located off-site.” In 1988, Proposition A was passed by voters to provide $109.5 million for the New Main Library to double existing space and would be applied to just the new building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfpl4.sfpl.org/pdffiles/November8_1988short.pdf November 8, 1988 San Francisco Voter Pamphlet]&lt;/ref&gt; Other resources such as furniture and equipment had to be covered by the public-private partnership called The Library Foundation. After the October 17, 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, City Librarian Ken Dowlin applied to the Federal Emergency Management Authority for a $1 million grant. With this funding, he changed the organization of the books from the Dewey Decimal System to a system he referred to as “leveled access.”

The Mercury Project involved the purchase of new computers, including a supercomputer from the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for an online Public Access Catalogue ([[OPAC]]). The Alexandrian Project aimed to build a new main library building using computers and electronic resources more than books. In 1995, 250,000 library books were weeded, including old, rare and some last copies. Some librarians resisted this idea of the “Library of the Future” that Dowlin
had envisioned. This resistance to these changes created the term “guerrilla librarian,” a librarian who saves books from destruction by either hiding them or stamping them to make the books appear that they had been in recent circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Biller, Walter; [http://www.kirwanesque.net Kirwan, Jim] &amp; Slade, Suzanne. “High Tech Barbarians at the Gates: The Plunder of the San Francisco Public Library.” ''San Francisco Frontlines'', (San Francisco, CA) June 1997.  [http://www.kirwanesque.net/kirwan-politics/politics-san-francisco/#article Reprint of San Francisco Frontlines June 1997 Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Word Watch of April 1997, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' defined guerrilla librarianship as “the use of surreptitious measures by librarians determined to resist the large-scale 'deaccessioning' of rarely used books: 'A branch librarian ... sometimes goes around with a due-date stamp, furtively stamping into currency books that she feels are imperiled.... [Employees of the San Francisco Public Library] call it “guerrilla librarianship”' (The New Yorker).”&lt;ref&gt;Soukhanov, Anne H. “Word Watch” ''The Atlantic Online''. April 1997 [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97apr/watch.htm Word Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current guerrilla librarianship==
In more recent history, the term “guerrilla librarian” has been used to refer to [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] of [[The Clash]]. His recent efforts in July 2009 created the Rock-n-Roll Public Library in London. Including 10,000 items from the guitarist's private collection, the library also contains Clash artwork and Beatles memorabilia. This exhibition is free as a “direct artistic challenge to the likes of the corporate British Music Experience.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/5894780/Clash-guitarist-Mick-Jones-has-become-a-guerrilla-librarian.html Clash guitarist Mick Jones has become a 'guerrilla librarian']&lt;/ref&gt;

Other guerrilla librarians include organizations such as Biologists Helping Bookstores, private citizen scientists re-shelving books to prevent pseudoscience from being placed in with the science categories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/aug/01/reclaimingthe1]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the original 1997 usage of the term, this version of guerrilla librarianship involves the removal or rearrangement of books by the general public regarding bookstores as opposed to librarians in public library settings.

[[Barack Obama]] served three terms in the [[Illinois Senate]] from 1997 to 2004, when he was [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|elected to the United States Senate]]. During this part of his career, Obama continued teaching [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] part time at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] as he had done as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Chicago Law School |date=March 27, 2008 |title=Statement regarding Barack Obama |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/media/index.html |accessdate=March 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608225931/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/media/index.html |archivedate=June 8, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|page=11|first=Lynn|last=Sweet|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/867973,CST-NWS-sweet30.article|title=No 'Professor' Obama at U. of C.|date=March 30, 2008|accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Abdon M|last=Pallasch|title=Professor Obama was a listener, students say|date=February 12, 2007|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/253391,CST-NWS-prof12.article|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|page=5|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102011032/http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/253391,CST-NWS-prof12.article|archivedate=November 2, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Senator [[Alice Palmer (Illinois politician)|Alice Palmer]] announced her desire to run for the [[United States House of Representatives]], leaving the Senate's 13th district seat open. When filing opened in 1995 for her seat, Obama entered the race. Eventually, his challengers were disqualified and he won the Democratic primary unopposed in 1996. He won re election in 1998 and 2002. During his Senate tenure, Obama was involved with a wide range of legislation. 

While serving, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in the [[Illinois's 1st congressional district election, 2000|2000 elections]]. In the redistricting following [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the Democrats gained control of the Illinois Senate, and Obama became more active in his legislation, which included work in areas such as [[health care]], labor, [[law enforcement]], [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]], [[welfare]], and community reinvestment.

Daley]] — who won 45% of the African-American vote and even won Rush's own ward — and was thought to be vulnerable.&lt;ref name=Kleine20000317&gt;{{cite news |author=Kleine, Ted |newspaper=Chicago Reader| date=March 17, 2000 |accessdate=July 26, 2008| url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/obama/000317 |title=Is Bobby Rush in trouble?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support of some veteran Democratic fundraisers who saw Obama as a rising star, along with support of African-American entrepreneurs, helped him keep pace with Rush's fundraising in the district's most expensive race ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Osnos, Evan | authorlink = Evan Osnos |date=February 20, 2000 |title=Rush could face his toughest test; 2 key state senators among primary foes |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 (Metro) |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/49867226.html?dids=49867226:49867226&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Rush charged that Obama was not sufficiently rooted in Chicago's black neighborhoods to represent constituents' concerns, and also benefitted from an outpouring of sympathy when his son was shot to death shortly before the election.&lt;ref name=Kleine20000317/&gt; Obama said Rush was a part of "a politics that is rooted in the past" and said he himself could build bridges with whites to get things done. 

But while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he didn't get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=jbcdnyt/&gt; Starting with just 10 percent name recognition, Obama went on to get only 31 percent of the votes, losing by a more than 2-to-1 margin despite winning among white voters.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Election Commission, [http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/ilh.htm 2000 U.S. House of Representatives Results]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gonyea, Don |date=September 19, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14502364|title=Obama's loss may have aided White House bid |work=Morning Edition |publisher=NPR |accessdate=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Janny |last=Scott |title=A streetwise veteran schooled young Obama |date=September 9, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/us/politics/09obama.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McClelland20070212&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward |last=McClelland |title=How Obama learned to be a natural |date=February 12, 2007 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/02/12/obama_natural/ |work=Salon |accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Senate career==
After losing the primary for U.S. Congress to Bobby Rush, Obama worked to repair relations with black politicians and clergy members, telling them he bore no grudges against the victor. He also became more responsive to requests for state funding, getting money for churches and community groups in his district. Senator Trotter, then the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in 2008 that he knew Obama was responding more to funding requests "because the community groups in his district stopped coming to me".&lt;ref name=jbcdnyt/&gt;

In September 2001, Democrats won a lottery to redraw legislative districts that had been drawn ten years earlier by Republicans and had helped ensure ten uninterrupted years of Republican control of the Illinois Senate.&lt;ref name="Redistricting Lottery"&gt;{{cite news |author=Pearson, Rick |date=September 6, 2001 |title=Democrats win lottery for remap; Bilandic to break deadlock on state redistricting |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-06/news/0109060300_1_democrats-lottery-legislative-districts |accessdate=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the November 2002 election, the Democratic remap helped them win control of the Illinois Senate and expand their majority in the Illinois House to work with the first Democratic Illinois governor in 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Finke, Doug |date=October 21, 2002 |title=Democrats try to sweep state elections; Legislative control comes down to just a few contests |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |page=1 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=JR&amp;p_theme=jr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=Democrats%20AND%20try%20AND%20to%20AND%20sweep%20AND%20state%20AND%20elections&amp;s_dispstring=Democrats%20try%20to%20sweep%20state%20elections%20AND%20date(10/21/2002%20to%2010/21/2002)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=10/21/2002%20to%2010/21/2002)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Finke, Doug |date=November 6, 2002 |title=Democrats take charge of General Assembly |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |page=5 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=JR&amp;p_theme=jr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=Democrats%20AND%20take%20AND%20charge%20AND%20of%20AND%20General%20AND%20Assembly&amp;s_dispstring=Democrats%20take%20charge%20of%20General%20Assembly%20AND%20date(11/6/2002%20to%2011/6/2002)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=11/6/2002%20to%2011/6/2002)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, after six years on the committee and four years as its minority spokesman. The new Democratic majority allowed Obama to write and help pass more legislation than in previous years. He sponsored successful efforts to expand children's health care, create a plan to provide equal health care access for all Illinois residents, and create a "Hospital Report Card" system, and worker's rights laws that protected whistleblowers, domestic violence victims, equal pay for women, and overtime pay.&lt;ref name="factcheck.barackobama.com"/&gt; 

His most public accomplishment was a bill requiring police to videotape interrogations and confessions in potential death penalty cases. Obama was willing to listen to Republicans and police organizations and negotiate compromises to get the law passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Peters |title=Judge him by his laws |date=January 4, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303303.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=A21 |accessdate=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That helped him develop a reputation as a pragmatist able to work with various sides of an issue.&lt;ref name=jbcdnyt/&gt; Obama also led the passage of a law to monitor [[racial profiling]] by requiring police to record the race of drivers they stopped.&lt;ref name=Scott20070730&gt;{{cite news |first=Janny |last=Scott |title=In Illinois, Obama proved pragmatic and shrewd |date=July 30, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/us/politics/30obama.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pearson, Rick; Long, Ray |author2=Ray Long |title=Careful steps, looking ahead |date=May 3, 2007 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0705030101may03,1,7439904.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=1 |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014957/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0705030101may03%2C1%2C7439904.story |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002, Obama introduced SB 1789, which would have adopted [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) for congressional and state primary elections in Illinois and authorized IRV for local elections, although it did not ultimately pass. He resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=. |url=http://www.senatedem.state.il.us/obama/index.html |title=13th District: Barack Obama |format=archive |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |date=August 24, 2000 |publisher=Illinois State Senate Democrats |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824102110/http://www.senatedem.state.il.us/obama/index.html |archivedate=August 24, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Count Imre Cseszneky de Milvány et Csesznek''' (1804-1874) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] agriculturist and patriot, born in 1804 to the impoverished [[Bácska]] branch of the [[Cseszneky]] family. In the 1830s he served as lieutenant. Later he became a talented agriculturist landowner in [[Subotica|Szabadka]] area, who following the steps of Count [[István Széchenyi]] gained distinction by developing Hungarian [[horse breeding]]. 

Cseszneky was the patron of the notable poet, [[Jámbor Pál|Pál Jámbor]] (Hiador) and - following the advice of [[Lajos Kossuth]] - the advocate of [[Mihály Vörösmarty]]'s election in the [[Bácsalmás]] electoral district to the parliament. 

In 1848 he supported with his fortune the establishment of the National Guard (Nemzetőrség) and the Defence Forces of Bácska, in which his brother fought at [[Čantavir|Csantavér]] against the Serbian rebels. 

Due to his role in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] he suffered serious reprisal under the [[Voivodship of Serbia and Tamiš Banat|Serbian Voivodship]].

'''Jason Ballesteros''' (born October 7, 1985) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the [[Meralco Bolts]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA). He was drafted seventh by the [[Meralco Bolts]] in the [[2011 PBA draft]].&lt;ref name="pba-online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pba-online.net/profile/Jason-Ballesteros/239/ |title=Jason Ballesteros Player Profile |publisher=PBA-Online! |date=1985-10-07 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also played for [[Smart Gilas]].

==College career==
Ballesteros played college basketball for the [[San Sebastian Stags]] where he became the team's starting center. While playing for San Sebastian, he was known as one of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA Philippines]]' top defensive players, winning the Defensive Player of the Year award twice, in [[NCAA Season 83|2007]] and [[NCAA Season 84|2008]]. He also made the league's Mythical Five team in his final season in [[NCAA Season 84|2008]].

==Professional career==
Ballesteros was drafted by [[Meralco Bolts]] seventh overall in the [[2011 PBA draft]] that also featured his former [[Smart Gilas]] teammates.

Weeks before the start of the [[2012–13 PBA season|38th PBA season]], he was traded to Barako Bull in exchange for [[Carlo Sharma]] and 3-point bomber [[Sunday Salvacion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |last=Joble |first=Rey |title=Barako Bull acquires ‘project’ Ballesteros from Meralco for Salvacion, Sharma |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/barako-bull-acquires-project-ballesteros-from-meralco-for-salvacion-sharma |work=InterAksyon |date=September 11, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409050052/http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/barako-bull-acquires-project-ballesteros-from-meralco-for-salvacion-sharma |archivedate=April 9, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[San Miguel Beermen]] signed Ballesteros to a two-year deal, but never played a game for them and was released before the Governors' Cup. The Meralco Bolts re-signed him for the rest of the season.

On September 12, 2014, he and Salvacion were sent to [[Blackwater Elite]] in a three-way trade involving [[NLEX Road Warriors]] and [[Meralco Bolts]]. NLEX obtained Blackwater's 2016 and 2017 2nd round pick along with the draft rights for [[Juneric Baloria]]. Meralco received [[Sean Anthony (basketball)|Sean Anthony]] from NLEX via Blackwater as third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |last=Saldajeno |first=Ivan |title=Anthony to Meralco, Baloria to NLEX in three-team PBA transfer |url=http://www.dugout.ph/2014/09/anthony-to-meralco-baloria-to-nlex-in-three-team-pba-transfer.html |work=Dugout |date=September 12, 2014 |accessdate=March 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2016, Ballesteros was traded to [[Mahindra Enforcer]] for [[Kyle Pascual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |title=Mahindra, Blackwater swap bigs |url=http://www.foxsportsasia.com/news/mahindra-blackwater-swap-bigs/ |work=[[Fox Sports Asia]] |date=March 20, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |last=Sacamos |first=Karlo |title=Defense-oriented Jason Ballesteros feels right at home at Mahindra |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/defense-oriented-jason-ballesteros-feels-he-also-has-chance-to-contribute-offensively-for-mahindra-hindi-katulad-sa-blackwater-alam-natin-na-sila-carlo-lastimosa-sila-mike-cortez-pag-na-sa-kanila-na-yung-bola-wala-na |work=Spin.ph |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ballesteros played for [[Smart Gilas]], the Philippine national team, and was one of the Smart Gilas' pioneers. Of all the big men from the first Gilas team, he stayed with the team the longest, from its creation in 2008 until 2011, when he was drafted to the PBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |last=Verora |first=Levi |title=Rajko’s original hardworking big men - The Smart Gilas boys Pt. 6 |url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/52572-rajko-original-hardworking-big-men-smart-gilas-boys-6 |work=[[Rappler]] |date=March 9, 2014 |accessdate=March 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">'''Jehiel ben Solomon Heilprin''' ({{lang-he|יחיאל היילפרין}}; ca. 1660–ca. 1746) was a [[Jews of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] rabbi, [[kabalist]], and chronicler.  He was a descendant of [[Solomon Luria]], and traced his genealogy back through [[Rashi]] to the [[tannaim|tanna]] [[Johanan HaSandlar]]. He was rabbi of {{ill|Glusk, Belarus|lt=Glusk|be|Глуск|pl|Hłusk}}, [[Minsk Voivodeship]] until 1711, when he was called to the rabbinate of [[Minsk]], where he officiated also as head of the [[yeshibah]] until his death. Heilprin was one of the most eminent [[Talmudists]] of his time. He was opposed to [[casuistry]], and on this account succeeded in grouping around him a great number of liberal-minded pupils. For a long time he had to sustain a hard struggle with [[Aryeh Löb ben Asher]], who, while still a young man, had founded a yeshibah at Minsk, which at first was very flourishing. Aryeh Löb attacked Heilprin's method of teaching, and the antagonism between them spread to their pupils. Later, Aryeh Löb, being obliged to assist his father in the district rabbinate, neglected his yeshibah, which was ultimately closed, and Heilprin was no longer molested.

Heilprin devoted a part of his time to the study of [[Kabbalah|Kabala]], on which subject he wrote a work. He was opposed to giving approbations to new books, deviating, as he himself says, only twice from his general principle in this regard. The two works so favored were the ''Ir Ḥomah'' of [[Abraham Judah Elijah]] and the ''Magen HaElef'' of [[Aryeh Löb of Plock]].

==Seder HaDorot==
{{Main|Seder HaDoroth}}

Heilprin is especially known through his ''Seder HaDorot.'' This work consists of three independent volumes or parts:
* The first of these, entitled ''Yemot 'Olam,'' is a history from the Creation down to his own time. The author always endeavors to give, by means of calculation, the dates of [[Biblical]] personages. He bases his work on the ''Yuḥasin'' of [[Abraham Zacuto]], on the ''Shalshelet HaKabbalah'' of [[Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya]], and on the ''Ẓemaḥ Dawid'' of [[David Gans]]. It seems that this first part was written when the author was still young, for the last event which he registered was one occurring in 1697.
* The second part, ''Seder HaTanna'im WehaAmora'im,'' contains lists of the [[Tannaim]] and [[Amoraim]] in alphabetical order with their dates.
* The third part is a kind of catalogue containing first the names of all the authors, then those of their works, both arranged in alphabetical order. Heilprin based this part on the ''Sifte Yeshenim'' of [[Shabbethai Bass]], but added a great number of other titles. He states in the preface the many advantages of a knowledge of the chronological order of the [[Talmudists]], which indeed in certain cases is absolutely necessary.

The whole work is followed by notes on the Talmud, also arranged in alphabetical order. It was published for the first time by Heilprin's grandson, [[Judah Löb Heilprin]], at [[Karlsruhe|Carlsruhe]] in 1769. There exist several other editions, the latest (as of 1906) being the revised one of [[Naphtali Maskileison]], son of [[Abraham Maskileison]], Warsaw, 1882.

Of Heilprin's numerous other works mentioned in the ''Seder HaDorot,'' the only one which has been published is ''Erke HaKinnuyim,'' a dictionary of synonyms and homonyms occurring in the [[Bible]], [[Talmud]], and other works, chiefly cabalistic (Dyhernfurth, 1806).

'''John Erskine''' (October 5, 1879 – June 2, 1951) was an American educator and author, pianist and composer. He was an English professor at [[Amherst College]] from 1903 to 1909, followed by [[Columbia University]] from 1909 and 1937.  During his tenure at Columbia University he formulated the General Honors Course—responsible for inspiring the influential [[Great Books]] movement. He published over 100 books, novels, criticism, and essays including his most important essay, ''[[The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent]]'' (1915).

==Early life and education==
Erskine was born in [[New York City]], New York, the son of Eliza Jane (née Hollingsworth) and James Morrison Erskine.&lt;ref name=ency&gt;{{cite book|title=National cyclopedia of American biography: Current volume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MnXAAAAMAAJ|page=59|year=1927|publisher=J.T.

Professor Erskine was English professor at [[Amherst College]] from 1903 to 1909,&lt;ref name=fnd&gt;{{cite web |title=John Erskine |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13435906&amp; |date= |publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently taught at Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. In 1910, he led foundation of the [[Boar's Head Society]] for literature.&lt;ref name=spectator19100512&gt;

This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay  ''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent''. He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like [[Mark Van Doren]] and later after 1923, [[Mortimer Adler]] took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the [[Great Books]] movement, centered on the [[Great Books of the Western World]]. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join [[University of Chicago]], where he continued to work on the theme with [[Robert Hutchins]], President of the University. Together they subsequently went on to found the [[Great Books of the Western World]] program and the [[Great Books Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |date= |publisher=Columbia College |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erskine co-wrote the 1900 [[Varsity Show]] at Columbia, writing the musical score for ''The Governor's Vrouw'' (1900), a two-act comic opera by [[Henry Sydnor Harrison]] and poet [[Melville Cane]], who also wrote the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Governor's Vrouw libretto cover |url=https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/items/show/4185 |date= |publisher=CU Libraries Exhibitions |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/governors-vrouw-a-comic-opera-in-two-acts/oclc/47805530 The Governor's vrouw : a comic opera in two acts]'', by John Erskine, Henry Sydnor Harrison, Melville Cane. Publisher: New York : Luckhardt &amp; Belder, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Butler Medal in 1919. During his career Erskine published over 100 books,&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; though as a writer he first received acclaim with his novel ''The Private Life of [[Helen of Troy]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name=faculty/&gt; This novel was made into a silent film [[The Private Life of Helen of Troy|by the same the name]] in 1927, directed by [[Alexander Korda]]. Other films based on his works included ''[[A Lady Surrenders]]'' (1930) by [[John M. Stahl]], ''Bachelor of Arts'' (1934) by [[Louis King]] and ''[[The President's Mystery]]'' (1936) directed by [[Phil Rosen]]. The 1956 biopic of French noblewoman [[Diane de Poitiers]] entitled ''[[Diane (film)|Diane]]'' was based on his story with a screenplay by [[Christopher Isherwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0259850}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the author of numerous publications, including several humorous novels retelling myths and legends, besides essays, criticism, and two volumes of autobiography. These included ''[[Penelope|Penelope's]] Man'' and ''Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin Anne.(2009). ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews''. ABC-CLIO, p.37 {{ISBN|0-313-33591-5}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

Erskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist&lt;ref name="KeyHaynes1931"/&gt; and musician. He wrote several books of music and the [[libretto]] for [[George Antheil]]'s opera ''[[Helen Retires]]'' (1931), which was based on ''The Private Life of Helen of Troy''. He was the first president of the [[Juilliard School of Music]] from 1928 to 1937. He was also director of the [[Metropolitan Opera Association]], which runs the [[Metropolitan Opera]], a noted opera company based in New York City.&lt;ref name=faculty/&gt;

Erskine is also credited with writing the subtitles for a number of films, including [[Sacha Guitry]]'s ''[[Le Roman d'un tricheur]]'' (The Story of a Cheat) in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/160351320/|title=New Guitry Film Opens Screen Run at Esquire Today|last=|first=|date=25 December 1938|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Pagnol]]'s [[The Baker's Wife (film)|''The Baker's Wife'']] in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=THE SCREEN; The French Are Telling the Scandalously Funny Story of 'The Baker's Wife' at the World Theatre|last=Nugent|first=Frank S.|date=27 February 1940|work=New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mario Camerini]]'s ''[[The Spirit and the Flesh]]'', an adaptation of [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s classic novel [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1948|title=The Spirit and the Flesh [review]|url=|journal=Showmen's Trade Review|volume=August 28|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of [[Roger Bacon]], Erskine wrote ''A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century,'' a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by [[Columbia University Press]] in 1914. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers. In 1946 he served as the first chairman of the [[American Writers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cain |first=Roy |last=Hoopes |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=0-03-049331-5 |page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married twice to Pauline Ives (m. 1910–1945) and Helen Worden Erskine (m. 1946–1951). With his wife Pauline (Ives), he was the grandfather of actress [[Lindsay Crouse]] and the great-grandfather of actress [[Zosia Mamet]]. He died on June 2, 1951 in New York at the age of 71.&lt;ref name=fnd/&gt;
 
Erskine Place, a street in the [[New York City]] borough of [[The Bronx]], was named after him.

'''Karl Bischoff''' (9 August 1897 – 2 October 1950) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]], [[engineer]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Sturmbannführer]]''. He served at Auschwitz as chief of the Central Construction Office of the [[Waffen-SS]]. While there he was chief of construction of the [[Auschwitz II-Birkenau]] camp.

==Biography==
Born in [[Neuhemsbach]] near [[Kaiserslautern]], Germany. At the age of twenty, he joined the [[Luftwaffe]]. In 1935 he obtained a job at the Luftwaffe Construction Bureau. During the early years of the [[Second World War]], he was involved in the building of air bases in [[France]]. In this position he met [[SS]]-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]], who was responsible for the [[Totenkopfverbande|SS-Amt II]] (Building), which later became ''[[Einsatzkommando|Amtsgruppe C]]'' of the [[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt|WVHA]]. [[Hans Kammler|Kammler]] offered Bischoff a leading post at [[Auschwitz]].

In October 1941 Bischoff arrived in Auschwitz, where he became chief of the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS and the Police Auschwitz in Upper Silesia (for ''i. Zentralbauleitung der Waffen SS und Polizei, Auschwitz [[Oberschlesien|O/S]]'') that had to implement the planned enlargement of the [[concentration camp]] by the creation of a [[POW]] camp, which itself later became part of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp. He showed his ambition shortly after his arrival by claiming the enormous budget of 20 million [[Reichsmarks]]. Unlike his predecessor, Bischoff was an extremely competent and dynamic bureaucrat. Despite all of the difficulties caused by the war, the building activities deemed necessary during the next years were all carried out by Bischoff and his staff. The giant Birkenau camp, the four big [[crematorium|crematoria]], the technically complicated central [[sauna]], the new reception building in the [[Auschwitz I|Stammlager]] and hundreds of other buildings, were planned and realized. For instance, Bischoff laid out the construction plans for the building of Auschwitz II-Birkenau with an original tally of 550 prisoners in each barrack (this meant that each prisoner had one-third the amount of space that he or she was allotted in other Nazi German concentration camps). He changed this tally to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;'Orders and Initiatives' (2005) ''[[Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution']]'' Ep. 2. BBC Television&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 the [[engineer|chief builder]] of the [[crematoria]] was able to inform his superiors in [[Berlin]] about the success of the operation: when the old crematorium in the ''Stammlager'' was included, 4,756 persons could be burned within 24 hours in five crematoria. In 1944, Bischoff was awarded the [[War Merit Cross]], 1st class, but shortly afterward he was informed that further plans for Auschwitz had to be reduced to those facilities considered absolutely necessary. The faltering German position at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] did not favour further development in the area.

In April 1944 he left Auschwitz and became chief of the building bureau of the Waffen-SS in [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]] at Katowice. He remained there until the end of the war. Although almost all of the archives of the Auschwitz building office fell into the hands of the Soviets after the camp was liberated by the [[Red Army]] in January 1945, Bischoff remained in the shadows after the war ended. His involvement at Auschwitz went unrecognized until his death in [[Bremen]] in 1950.

'''Léa Roback''' (3 November 1903&lt;ref name=jewishpubliclibrary.org&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adventures of Lea Roback|url=http://www.jewishpubliclibrary.org/blog/?page_id=1353|publisher=Jewish Public Library|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 28 August 2000) was a Canadian [[trade union]] organizer, social activist, pacifist, and feminist. She campaigned against exclusion, violence, racism and injustice.&lt;ref name=ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca /&gt; A [[polyglot]] and a [[Suffragette|suffragist]], she was a pioneer of feminism in [[Quebec]]. A [[Syndicalism|Syndicalist]],&lt;ref name=Ferretti1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferretti|first=Lucia|title=''Madeleine Parent, Léa Roback, Entretiens avec Nicole Lacelle'' by Nicole Lacelle|journal=Labour/Le Travail|volume=25|year= 1990|page=247&amp;ndash;249|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/LLT/article/viewFile/4769/5642|accessdate=10 May 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Communist]] and a [[Marxist]], she opened the first Marxist book store in [[Montreal]].

==Early years==
Born in Montreal on Guilbault Street in 1903, the second of nine children,&lt;ref name=collectionscanada.gc.ca2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Léa Roback|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1114-e.html|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=10 May 2014|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  she was the daughter of [[Polish Jews|Polish Jewish]] immigrants. Her father was a tailor who, along with his wife, Fanny, ran a general store. They were the only Jews in [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]], the town where Roback grew up.&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Lea’s biography|url=http://www.fondationlearoback.org/bioen.htm|publisher=Fondation Lea Roback|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke [[Yiddish]] at home, French with Beauport locals, and English at school. Her family valued reading and the arts. In her youth, she was influenced by her maternal grandmother, an independent woman.

With her family, Roback returned to Montreal in 1915. While working at British American Dyeworks, she became aware of the differences between the various sectors of Montreal society. Her next job was as a cashier at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Montreal|Her Majesty's Theatre]]. Interested in literature, she saved money to enroll at the [[University of Grenoble]] in 1926,&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org /&gt; earning a Bachelor of Arts degree.&lt;ref name="Forster2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=Merna|title=100 Canadian Heroines: Famous and Forgotten Faces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9NAciHwjUAC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2004|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-514-9|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her return from Grenoble, she joined her sister in [[New York City]]. In 1929, she went to [[Berlin]] to visit her brother Henri, a medical student. She learned the German language, took university courses, and taught English.&lt;ref name=Forster2004 /&gt; She also visited England and Italy,&lt;ref name=ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca&gt;{{cite web|title=Léa Roback (1903–2000) Chevalière (2000)|url=http://www.ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca/membres/membre.asp?id=1239|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec|accessdate=10 May 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing a strong commitment to [[Communism]].&lt;ref name="LindleyStebner2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindley|first1=Susan Hill|last2=Stebner|first2=Eleanor J.|title=The Westminster Handbook to Women in American Religious History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4hLAtDBHskC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2008|publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]]|isbn=978-0-664-22454-7|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1929, Roback became a member of the [[Communist Party of Canada]]. She felt seduced by [[History of the socialist movement in Canada|the socialists]], but she believed they did not put their words into action, hence she shifted her support to [[Marxism]]-[[Leninism]]. In her 1988 interview with Nicole Lacelle, Roback said that it was during this period that she gained genuine political consciousness. In the fall of 1932, when the war in Europe escalated, Roback, a Jew and a foreigner, was forced to leave return to Montreal. In 1934, she spent a few months in the [[Soviet Union]] with a lover.{{efn|Roback married in Europe at some point, but the marriage was annulled.&lt;ref name=Forster2004 /&gt;}} Returning for good to Montreal, she participated in the organization of the unemployed, which was led by [[Norman Bethune]]. She also worked at the Young Women's Hebrew Association. In 1935, she established the first Marxist bookshop in Montreal,&lt;ref name=Forster2004 /&gt;  Modern Book Shop.&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org /&gt;

}}
With [[Thérèse Casgrain]], Roback fought for woman's suffrage in Quebec in 1936.&lt;ref name=collectionscanada.gc.ca2010 /&gt; In the same year, she worked with [[Rose Pesotta]], a veteran union organizer from New York, to establish the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU) in Montreal, leading a strike of 5,000 women in 1937. Roback unionized [[RCA#Phonograph|RCA Victor]] in 1941, where she remained until 1951. She won the first union contract for women in 1943 but did not want to become a union representative or climb up union power structure. In the same year, Roback became a political organizer for [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]].&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org /&gt; She left the Communist party in 1958.&lt;ref name=Rioux2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Rioux|first=Michel|title=Léa Roback|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lea-roback/|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=10 May 2014|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, she became a member and played an active role in the organization "Voice of Women" (''La Voix des Femmes'' in Montreal)&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org /&gt; alongside [[Madeleine Parent]], [[Thérèse Casgrain]], and [[Simonne Monet-Chartrand]]. She denounced the [[Vietnam War]] and [[apartheid in South Africa]], campaigned against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and was a proponent of free access to a quality education. A feminist, she fought to obtain the right to vote for the right to abortion and access to contraception. Roback also fought for the residents of [[Saint-Henri, Montreal|Saint-Henri]] to receive decent housing. At the age of 83 and in the pouring rain, she participated in the women's march for pay equity. In 1985, she became an honorary member of the Canadian Institute for Research on Women.&lt;ref name=collectionscanada.gc.ca2010 /&gt; She died in [[Côte-des-Neiges]] in 2000, becoming a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in the same year.

==Legacy==
Her memory is perpetuated by the work of the Lea Roback Foundation, created in 1993,&lt;ref name=collectionscanada.gc.ca2010 /&gt; which provides scholarships to socially-committed women.&lt;ref name=Rioux2013 /&gt; "Le centre Léa-Roback", a research center in Montreal for social inequalities, is also named in her honour, as is the Maison Parent-Roback in [[Old Montreal]]. Sophie Bissonnette made a documentary on Roback's life in 1991.&lt;ref name=fondationlearoback.org /&gt; Two streets were named in her honour in the 2000s: Rue Léa-Roback in the Saint-Henri district of Montreal, and a street of the same name in Beauport, where she spent time in her youth.

The Léa Roback Foundation (Fondation Léa Roback) awards scholarships to women residing in Québec who are socially committed and economically disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlearoback.org/home.htm Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">'''Metabiography''' is the literary study of the relation of [[Biography|biographies]] to the temporal, geographical, institutional, intellectual or ideological locations of their writers (the biographers). It is a [[hermeneutics]] of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different [[cultural memory|memory cultures]], proposing an essential instability of historical lives.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Steven Shapin]], metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven, 2006. “Lives after death,” ''Nature'', vol. 441: 286.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.

== Metabiography vs. traditional biography ==
As part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years,&lt;ref&gt;Söderqvist, Thomas, 2007. Untitled review of Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography'', ''Isis'', vol. 98: 203-204; Söderqvist however defines metabiography as the critical appraisal of biographical literature about a particular person in the traditional way.&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Henry Guerlac]]’s study of “[[Lavoisier]] and his biographers”&lt;ref&gt;Guerlac, Henry, 1954. “Lavoisier and his biographers,” ''Isis'', vol. 45: 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] biographies&lt;ref&gt;Hall, A. Rupert, 1999. ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth-Century Perspectives''. Oxford [etc.]: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.

== Examples of metabiography in general history ==
In the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, David B., 1996. ''Beethoven in German Politics, 1870-1989''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Lucasta Miller]] who used it to good effect in the case [[Emily Brontë]] (1818–48).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lucasta, 2001. ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Cape&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Gordon S. Wood]]’s study on the Americanization of [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., 2004. ''The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin''. New York, NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.

== Examples of metabiography in the field of scientific biography ==
Examples of scientific metabiography are [[Jan Sapp]]’s “The nine lives of [[Gregor Mendel]],”&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan, 1990. “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel” in Le Grand, Homer E. (ed.), ''Experimental Inquiries''. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp. 137-166. Sapp analyses the different interpretations of Mendel’s work in genetics by later practitioners in the field, who variously described him as a Darwinian, a non-Darwinian, an evolutionist, an opponent of evolutionary theory, a Mendelian geneticist, not a Mendelian geneticist, a man who did or did not falsify his data or even as someone who completely fabricated his experiments on plant hybrids.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Fara’s ''Newton: the Making of Genius''&lt;ref&gt;Fara, Patricia, 2002. ''Newton: the Making of Genius''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|Nicolaas Rupke]]’s ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography''.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press; Rupke shows how from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day Humboldt has served as a nucleus of crystallisation for a variety of successive socio-political ideologies in Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James, 1994. ''The Darwin Legend''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Books; Moore, James, 1999. “Telling tales: Evangelicals and the Darwin legend” in Livingstone, David N., Hart, D.G., and Noll, Mark A. (eds), ''Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 220-233; Colp, Ralph, 1989. “Charles Darwin’s past and future biographies,” ''History of Science'', vol. 27: 167-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the ''Reader’s Guide to the History of Science'' (2000).

'''Michael David Bushell'''&lt;ref&gt;[[General Register Office|GRO]] reference: July 1990, Vol. 30, Page 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 8 June 1990)  is a [[Paralympic]] gold medalist and personal trainer from [[Telford]], [[Shropshire]], England.  He suffers from lumbar sacral spinal agenesis congenital paraplegia and competes in T53 category sprint events. He is the British record holder at 100m and 200, and a European record holder at 100m.

==Early life==
Bushell was born on 8 June 1990 at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.  Due to his health problems doctors initially told his parents that he would probably never be able sit up or mobilise on his own. But Bushell surprised everyone when he started crawling around and eventually walking on his hands in a handstand position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getkidsgoing.com/cgi-bin/newsdesk.cgi?record=21|title=Mickey Bushell's Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletic career==
Bushell competed in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] winning silver in the men's T53100 metres – T53 event.  He also competed in the 200m event, but was knocked out in the first round.

On 19 June 2009, Bushell set a new 100 m T53 world record in Ibach, Switzerland, beating the old record by three one-hundredths of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/8108381.stm|title=Bushell claims 100m world record|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September, in the London 2012 Paralympics, he won a gold medal for Great Britain in the T53 100m in a time of 14.75 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2197779/London-Parlympics-2012-Mickey-Bushell-wins-T53-100m-sprint-gold.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=One better for Bushell as Beijing silver medalist storms to London sprint gold|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; just shy of the World Record time of 14.47 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/disability-sport/19471635|title=Paralympics 2012: Mickey Bushell wins 100m T53 gold|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He added further silverware to his collection in 2014 at the [[2014 IPC Athletics European Championships|IPC Athletics European Championships]] in Swansea, where he claimed gold in the T53 100m. He picked up a silver medal in the 200m in wet and windy conditions, but was just edged out of the medals in the 800m behind his teammate, [[Moatez Jomni]].

After struggling with illness in 2015, Bushell made an encouraging return to action in 2016 by winning the European title in the T53 100m in Grosseto, as well as a 400m bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rio.paralympics.org.uk/meet-the-team/athlete-profile/mickey-bushell|title=Mickey Bushell|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year he competed in the 2016 Paraolympic games in Rio defending his 100m, although was only able to manage a disappointing sixth-place finish crossing the line in 15.09s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/athletics/team-gb/rio-2016-paralympics/news/bushell-disappointed-with-rio-display_281002.html|title=Mickey Bushell "disappointed" by Paralympic performance|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushell is the current British Record holder for the T53 class in the 100m and 200m events, and also the European record holder at 100m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=85422|title=Mickey Bushell|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health issues ==
Bushell suffers from lumbar sacral spinal sgenesis congenital paraplegia. In Bushell's case this means he is missing seven vertebrae from the lower part of the spine just above the coccyx. He has no abdominal wall muscle control, his legs and hips have never fully developed and float unsupported at the lower end of his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scubaverse.com/immerse-school-of-diving-announce-the-mickey-bushell-diving-scholarship/|title=Immerse School of Diving announce the Mickey Bushell Diving Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 during his preparations for the Paraolympic games in Beijing Bushell began suffering from recurrent kidney infection necessitating a nephrectomy.  Despite this potentially career ending condition just three months after the operation he recorded a personal best in the 100m to qualify for the Beijing Paralympics, where he won a silver in the T53.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/14345338|title=Kidney operation spurred me on to win medals - Bushell|last=|first=|date=30 July 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoulder and elbow injuries in 2013 and 2014 further threatened his career, but despite this he still managed to claim silver at the IPC World Championships in Lyon and two medals at the IPC European Championships in Swansea.

Recurrent urinary tract infections in 2015 culminated in life-threatening septacaemia.  At the time this was incorrectly reported by the BBC as a chlamydia infection.  He subsequently made a complete recovery, although his training was significantly set back the seven month recuperation peroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishathletics.org.uk/media/news/2016-news-page/april-2016/04-05-16-bushell/|title=Bushell back from the brink &amp; back to chasing glory|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
After winning gold in London 2012 Bushell was honored with a golden postbox in his home town of Telford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2012/09/05/telford-post-box-going-gold-in-honour-of-mickey-bushell/|title=Telford post box goes gold in honour of Mickey Bushell|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the New Year Honours for services to athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/60367/supplement/24|title=The London Gazette, Supplement no. 60367, p.24|last=|first=|date=29 December 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

==Pastoral career==
[[File:Mike Huckabee at Thomas Road Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|right|Huckabee playing bass guitar at [[Thomas Road Baptist Church|a church in Virginia]] in 2008]]
At age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]].&lt;ref name="scottparks"/&gt; Robison commented, "His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes."&lt;ref name="scottparks"/&gt; Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street First Baptist Church in [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], from 1986 to 1992.

Huckabee started 24-hour television stations in both Pine Bluff and Texarkana, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called ''Positive Alternatives''.&lt;ref name = "Barone 136–137"/&gt; He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="scottparks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isikoff"/&gt; Years later, he wrote about the insights he gained as a minister:

{{quote|My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt...&lt;ref&gt;Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1989, Huckabee ran against [[Ronnie Floyd]] of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marus for the Associated Baptist Press.

In Huckabee's first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator [[Dale Bumpers]], receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/us/the-1992-elections-state-by-state-south.html|title=The 1992 Elections: State by State; South|date=November 5, 1992|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first1=James | last1=Bennet | first2=John H. | last2=Cushman Jr | first3=James | last3=Dao | first4=Jason | last4=DeParle | first5=Clifford | last5=Krauss | first6=Stephen | last6=Labaton | first7=Neil A. | last7=Lewis | first8=David | last8=Margolick | first9=Maria | last9=Newman | first10=Martin | last10=Tolchin | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same election, Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] was elected [[President of the United States|president]], making lieutenant governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman [[Asa Hutchinson]] urged Huckabee to run in the [[special election]] for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |title=GOP wins one in Arkansas – Republican Party; Mike Huckabee &amp;#124; Campaigns &amp; Elections &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |publisher=FindArticles |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080107151043/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 51–49 percent.&lt;ref name = "Barone 136–137"/&gt; Huckabee became the second Republican since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been [[Maurice Britt]] from 1967 to 1971.

In his autobiography ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: "The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dick Morris]], who had previously worked for [[Bill Clinton]], advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994, and 1998.&lt;ref name = "RexNelson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nelson|first=Rex|date=July 2, 1995|title=Clinton's Hired Gun Gives Huckabee Hand: Lieutenant Governor Shooting for Senate|newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee commented that Morris was a "personal friend".&lt;ref name = "RexNelson"/&gt; A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: "Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'"&lt;ref name = "RexNelson"/&gt;

Morris elaborated, "So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans."&lt;ref name = "RexNelson"/&gt; Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and [[civil rights]] organizations such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, "I will not participate in any program that has [[racism|racist]] overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and [[anti-Semitism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhart |first=Bill |title=Huckabee Won't Appear With Racist |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Tribune]] |date=April 12, 1994 |url=http://www.ferris.edu/isar/institut/CCC/philly.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012016/http://www.ferris.edu/isar/institut/CCC/philly.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3929|title=1994 AR Lt.

In October 1995, [[David Pryor]] announced that he was retiring from the [[United States Senate]]. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls,&lt;ref name = "Barone 136–137"/&gt; but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.&lt;ref name="KevinSack" /&gt;

During his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |author2=Caldwell, Elizabeth |title=Observers Say Arkansans: Arkansas voters didn't like the idea of allowing 26 appointed legislators to serve as delegates to a proposed constitutional convention |newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=December 14, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a [[special election]]. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the [[Republican National Committee]] and the [[Republican Party of Arkansas|Arkansas Republican Party]] against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve {{convert|1300|mi|km}} of highway.&lt;ref name="Oneal"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |title=Road Vote |newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=January 11, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87–13 percent. A second question, a five-cent increase on [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] tax, lost 86–14 percent.&lt;ref name="Oneal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CharacterBook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huckabee |first=Mike |title=Character Is The Issue |publisher=[[Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers]] |year=1997 |location=Nashville |pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee also opposed Tucker's plan for school consolidation.&lt;ref name="CharacterBook" /&gt;

In May 1996, Tucker was convicted "on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans" as part of the [[Whitewater controversy]]. The [[Arkansas Constitution]], like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. Tucker thus promised to resign by July 15.&lt;ref name = "Barone 136–137"/&gt; Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker.&lt;ref name="KevinSack"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EEDB1E39F932A05756C0A960958260 |title=Arkansan Quits Senate Race to Lead State |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Sack |first=Kevin |date=May 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,&lt;ref name="Barone 44"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |work=[[National Journal]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee and the legislature threatened to initiate [[impeachment]] proceedings against Tucker.&lt;ref name="scottparks"/&gt; Huckabee was then duly sworn in as governor.

In [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1998|November 1998]], Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican governor since Reconstruction.
According to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African American vote in his 1998 election;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/01/could_mike_huckabee_be_america_1.asp |title=Could Mike Huckabee be America's Second Black President? |last=Faughnahan |first=Brian |date=January 15, 2008 |publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]] |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahead of debate, Huckabee's claim of black support questioned|url=http://archives.arkansasnews.com/2007/09/26/ahead-of-debate-huckabees-claim-of-black-support-questioned/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194725/http://archives.arkansasnews.com/2007/09/26/ahead-of-debate-huckabees-claim-of-black-support-questioned/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 23, 2015|newspaper=[[Arkansas News]]|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer [[Jimmie Lou Fisher]], garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Tim Hutchinson]].

Huckabee received widespread praise for his state's rapid response to Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him one of the five best governors in the U.S., writing "Huckabee has approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation" and referred to him as "a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news |title=America's 5 Best Governors |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1129494,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governing (magazine)|''Governing'' magazine]] likewise honored Huckabee as one of its 2005 Public Officials of the Year.&lt;ref name=governing /&gt;

By the end of his term, Huckabee held the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas governor. Only Democrats [[Orval Faubus]], who served six consecutive two-year terms (1955–1967), and [[Bill Clinton]], who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.

During his time as a governor Huckabee supported a net tax increase of $505 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/huckabee-in-tax-war-as-ex-governor-launches-white-house-bid-2015-05-05 |title= Huckabee in tax war as ex-governor launches White House bid |last1=Schroeder |first1=Robert |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to columnist [[Margaret Carlson]], that money was used to improve roads, health care, and schools in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Margaret.

Huckabee's handling of clemency petitions received national attention in November 2009 with the case of [[Maurice Clemmons]], who had committed burglary without a weapon at age 16. The Prison Transfer Board unanimously requested a sentence commutation for Clemmons as did the trial judge.&lt;ref name=responsibility/&gt; Clemmons's 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. After parole in 2000, Clemmons was arrested for multiple offenses including [[child molestation]] and [[aggravated assault]] but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges. After Clemmons murdered four police officers in [[Lakewood, Washington]], a two-day manhunt ensued, and Clemmons was shot and killed by a [[Seattle Police Department]] officer after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes01Dec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html |title=Lakewood police shooting suspect killed by Seattle police officer in South Seattle early this morning |last=Sullivan |first=Jennifer |author2=Mark Rahner |author3=Jack Broom |date=December 1, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204124651/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book about the shooting, ''The Other Side of Mercy'', Jonathan Martin of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons's prison file, which was "thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/opinionnw/2013/12/18/mike-huckabees-maurice-clemmons-problem/|title=Mike Huckabee's Maurice Clemmons problem|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee defended his actions, stating that the recommendation to reduce the sentence was unanimous and supported by the trial judge, that the decision to parole him was made by the parole board, not him, and that Clemmons had been re-arrested and the decision not to file charges then had nothing to do with him.&lt;ref&gt;Huckabee, M.

In 2003, Eugene Fields received a six-year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)|Mothers Against Drunk Driving]]. A spokeswoman for Huckabee, [[Charmaine Yoest]], said that Fields's political donations [to the Arkansas Republican Party] and connections played no role in his clemency. About two years after Fields's sentence was cut to 11 months, he was arrested again for driving while intoxicated as his truck crossed the center line directly into the path of an oncoming police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Long Run: Charming and Aloof, Huckabee Changed State |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[Little Rock, AR]]|date=December 22, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/us/politics/22commute.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1198343576-wqXZD02A72A4LL3ZAHATxw |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |first=David |last=Barstow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2008, Huckabee finished in second place in the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2008]], behind [[John McCain]], who finished first and ahead of [[Fred Thompson]], who finished third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#SC | publisher=[[CNN]] | title=Election Center 2008: Primary Results – Elections &amp; Politics news from CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2008, Huckabee finished in fourth place in the Florida primary, behind [[Rudy Giuliani]] in third, [[Mitt Romney]] in second, and [[John McCain]] in first place.

On January 21, 2008, Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African American leaders in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The endorsers cited Huckabee's record on life, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/01/21/politics/fromtheroad/entry3735143.shtml |title=Huckabee Courts Black Vote |last=Lin |first=Joy |date=January 21, 2008 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bu, NBC claimed that the endorsement of African American leaders at the Atlanta event was 36, and "most of them connected to conservative religious organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conservative black leaders endorse Huckabee|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22771493/ns/politics-decision_08/t/conservative-black-leaders-endorse-huckabee/|agency=NBC News|date=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2008, Huckabee won the first contest of "[[Super Tuesday]]", the [[West Virginia]] GOP state [[Political convention|convention]], but only after the McCain campaign provided their delegates, thereby giving Huckabee 52% of the electorate to [[Mitt Romney]]'s 47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0208/Romney_loses_West_Virginia_.html |title=Romney Loses West Virginia! |publisher=[[Politico]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backers of rival [[John McCain]] said they threw Huckabee their support to prevent Mitt Romney from capturing the winner-take-all GOP state convention vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 5, 2008 |title=Huckabee wins 18 W.Va.

Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of state party rules that stated a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state's pledged delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#val=LA |title=Huckabee wins Louisiana |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2008, Huckabee withdrew from seeking the candidacy as it became apparent he would lose in Texas, where he had hoped to win, and that [[John McCain]] would get the 1,191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination. Huckabee finished the race with 240 pledged delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=December 6, 2016 |title=Results: Republican Delegate Count |url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/primaries/results/gopdelegates/index.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |accessdate=March 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vice Presidential Candidate speculation====

Even though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]]'s short list for his vice presidential [[running mate]]. The late pundit [[Tim Russert]] even referred to Huckabee as "Vice President Huckabee" several times when he appeared on ''[[Meet The Press]]'' on May 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24693653/page/7/ |title=Russert: Vice President Huckabee |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=May 18, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee was eventually passed over for [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25970882/ns/politics-decision_08/t/vp-pick-palin-makes-appeal-women-voters |title=VP Pick Palin Makes Appeal to Women Voters |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former president [[Bill Clinton]] has praised Huckabee and stated that he is a rising star in the Republican Party.

===Speculated 2012 presidential campaign===
[[File:Former Governor Mike Huckabee speaking at the 2011 Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana.jpg|thumb|Former Governor Huckabee speaking at the 2011 [[Republican Leadership Conference]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]]]
{{See also|United States presidential election, 2012}}
In a November 19, 2008, article by the [[Associated Press]], Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for president in 2012. He said, "I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Nov19/0,4675,HuckabeeBook,00.html |title=Huckabee won't rule out 2012 run for President |last=Ohlemacher |first=Stephen |agency=Associated Press |date=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid speculation about a future run for the Presidency, a [[CNN]] poll in December 2008 found Huckabee at the top of the list of 2012 GOP contenders, along with former [[Alaska]]n [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] [[Sarah Palin]], fellow 2008 presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/12/05/huckabee-and-palin-top-early-2012-list/ |first=Paul |last=Steinhauser |title=Huckabee and Palin top early 2012 list |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |date=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based [[NBC]] affiliate WLWT asked Huckabee about the prospect of running, to which he said, "I'm pretty sure I'll be out there. Whether it's for myself or somebody else I may decide will be a better standard bearer, that remains to be seen."&lt;ref&gt;WLWT website http://www.wlwt.com/politics/18192964/detail.html (retrieved on April 2, 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511012441/http://www.wlwt.com/politics/18192964/detail.html |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2009 [[CNN]]/[[Opinion Research Corporation]] national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/02/cnn-poll-no-frontrunner-in-gop-2012-presidential-race/ | title=CNN Poll: No frontrunner in GOP 2012 presidential race | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2009 poll of Republicans by [[Rasmussen Reports]] put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2012/gop_2012_huckabee_29_romney_24_palin_18 |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |title=GOP 2012: Huckabee 29% Romney 24% Palin 18%}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2009 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll, Huckabee was shown as the leading Republican contender for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/124097/huckabee-romney-palin-see-most-republican-support-12.aspx|title= Huckabee, Romney, Palin See Most Republican Support for '12|date= November 5, 2009|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 [[CNN]] projected in a poll that Huckabee would defeat Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/pollcenter/individual/index.html#1823 |title= Huckabee would defeat Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest|date= November 7, 2010|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Rasmussen poll taken January 11–14, 2011, Huckabee was even with Obama at 43% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/romney_huckabee_even_with_obama_other_gop_hopefuls_trail |title= Romney, Huckabee Even With Obama, Other GOP Hopefuls Trail|date= February 6, 2011|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee took stances opposed to the nature of the incumbent president, [[Barack Obama]]. In comments made March 1, 2011, on ''[[The Steve Malzberg Show]]'', Huckabee said of Obama, "I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emi |last=Kolawole |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/03/huckabee-asserts-hes-not-a-bir.html |title=Huckabee claims inaccurately that Obama was raised in Kenya |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Mooney |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/01/oops-huckabee-says-obama-grew-up-in-kenya/ |title=Oops!

On May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his [[Fox News Channel|FNC]] show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, "All the factors say 'go,' but my heart says 'no.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Cillizza |authorlink= |title=Mike Huckabee won't run for president in 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mike-huckabee-wont-run-for-president-in-2012/2011/05/14/AFGcpk3G_blog.html |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mike Huckabee by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|left|thumb|Huckabee speaking at 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland]]
Political commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016. He was limited by a lack of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing [[SuperPAC]]s to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 13, 2013 |last=Grier |first=Peter |title=Mike Huckabee 2016: New wildcard in the GOP race? |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2013/1213/Mike-Huckabee-2016-New-wildcard-in-the-GOP-race |newspaper= [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows.

Huckabee indicated in September 2014 that he would make the decision on whether to run early in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Jaffe (September 15, 2014) [http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/217759-huckabee-inching-closer-to-2016-run Huckabee inching closer to 2016 run] The Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Huckabee ended his show on FNC to prepare for his possible run in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name="stelter"/&gt; On March 30, 2015, Huckabee supporters launched a Super PAC to make preparations for his run for the Presidential ticket in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iowa Operative Will Run Mike Huckabee Super PAC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/02/iowa-operative-will-run-mike-huckabee-super-pac/?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2015, Huckabee announced a campaign to seek the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican nomination]] for [[president of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name=Gabriel&gt;Gabriel, Trip.

On October 13, 2015, making reference to the ongoing Democratic Party primary competition, he posted a comment on [[Twitter]] saying, "I trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador! #DemDebate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/654114071336189952 |title=I trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador! |publisher=Twitter |date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2016, after a disappointing showing in the [[Iowa]] caucus Huckabee decided that he was going to suspend his campaign.

===2018 Florida gubernatorial elections===
Reports emerged in the summer of 2016 that Huckabee, who currently lives in Florida, was considering  [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2018|running for governor of Florida in 2018]] to succeed [[term limit]]ed Republican [[incumbent]] [[Rick Scott]].

Following the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Huckabee met with [[president-elect of the United States]] [[Donald Trump]], whom he had supported for the Republican nomination after ending his own campaign in February.

==Political positions==
{{Main|Political positions of Mike Huckabee}}

===Abortion===

Huckabee opposes any public funding for abortion, and believes that abortion should be legal only when the life of the mother is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=1657 Ark. Gubernatorial Election 2002 National Political Awareness Test] VoteSmart.org&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that it would "most certainly" be a good day for America if ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Yzc0ODM5YjU0ZjI3ZWJmOWRkNGI1NjljMmY2MmI2NDY Bench Memos: The Republican Debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111142224/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Yzc0ODM5YjU0ZjI3ZWJmOWRkNGI1NjljMmY2MmI2NDY |date=January 11, 2008 }} NationalReview.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===

Huckabee opposed Obama's health care plan, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. He stated that he wants to "give citizens more control over their own health care choices".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikehuckabee.com/?FuseAction=Issues.View&amp;Issue_id=8 Mike Huckabee for President – Health Care] MikeHuckabee.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Trade===

In his book ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee expressed support for free trade, but only if it is "fair trade." He identified excess litigation, excess taxation, and excess regulation as three factors contributing to the loss of American jobs, and has proposed economic sanctions on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mike Huckabee on Free Trade |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Mike_Huckabee_Free_Trade.htm |publisher=[[On the Issues]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race relations===

According to a [[CNN]] exit poll, Huckabee won 48% of African American votes in his successful 1998 gubernatorial race in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/1998/states/AR/G/exit.poll.html "Arkansas Governor: 844 respondents"], CNN (November 4, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The 48% figure is often disputed due to the exit poll's small sample size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/2016/8/1/12338538/gop-attract-black-voters "Can the GOP attrack black voters?"], Vox (August 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  Huckabee says that it is important for Republicans such as himself to reach out to black voters, and in 2015 he has ramped up efforts to win those votes.&lt;ref name=Ashley&gt;Killough, Ashley. [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/16/politics/mike-huckabee-african-americans-voters-elections/ "Mike Huckabee ramps up push for African-American voters"], CNN (July 16, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Huckabee stated on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' that the confederate flag issue was for South Carolinians to decide, "not an issue for a person running for president", and days later he congratulated Gov. [[Nikki Haley]] on her decision supporting removal of the flag from the state capitol.&lt;ref name=Ashley /&gt; Huckabee gave a speech at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] that included this: "I say with sincerity that I have great respect for Senator Obama's historic achievement to become his party's nominee—not because of his color, but with indifference to it. Party or politics aside, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country."&lt;ref&gt;"Huckabee assails media coverage of GOP", [[NBC News]] (September 4, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT===

Huckabee believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he opposes [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]]. He outlawed gay marriage in Arkansas{{Citation needed|reason=Same Sex marriage was outlawed by Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 3 in 2004, a voter referendum|date=April 2017}}, but in 2007 he stated that Americans should "respect" gay couples. He says that adoptions should be child focused and opposes [[LGBT adoption|gay adoptions]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm |title=Mike Huckabee on the Issues |accessdate=July 29, 2007 |publisher=[[On the Issues]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, he was quoted comparing homosexuality to "drinking and swearing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/01/politics/huckabee-gay-marriage/|title=Huckabee compares gay marriage to drinking, swearing – CNNPolitics.com|author=Eric Bradner, CNN|date=February 1, 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social mores===

In comments made March 4, 2011, on the ''[[Michael Medved Show]]'', Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress [[Natalie Portman]], saying "it's unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out of wedlock children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[AOL News]] |date=March 4, 2011 |title=Mike Huckabee Disses Natalie Portman; Over Out of Wedlock Pregnancy Why Not Bristol Palin? |first=Steven |last=Hoffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, in a luncheon speech at the [[Republican National Committee]]'s winter meeting, in response to a federal mandate on [[contraception]], Huckabee stated that "Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without [[Uncle Sugar]] coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/mike-huckabees-war-for-women |title=Mike Huckabee's War for Women |last=Lapidos |first=Juliet |date=January 24, 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/23/mike-huckabee-s-controversial-remarks-at-rnc.html |title=Huckabee: Dems Tell Women They Can't Control Libido Without Government |last=Jacobs |first=Ben |date=January 23, 2014 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/huckabee-vs-huckabee |title=Huckabee vs. Huckabee |last1=Benen |first1=Steve |date=January 24, 2014 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of religion in public life===

Huckabee has voiced his support of [[intelligent design]] and he has stated that he does not accept the validity of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[natural selection|theory of evolution]]. He was quoted in July 2004 on ''Arkansans Ask'', his regular show on the Arkansas Educational Television Network: "I think that students also should be given exposure to the theories not only of evolution but to the basis of those who believe in creationism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005 |last=Wiles |first=Jason |title=Is Evolution Arkansas's Hidden Curriculum? |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/25/1-2/is-evolution-arkansass-hidden-curriculum |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Huckabee said, "I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message," in praise of the  Christian revisionist historian [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]].&lt;ref name="barton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/mike-huckabee-americans-to-be-indoctrinated-at-gunpoint/|title=Mike Huckabee: Americans to be indoctrinated at gunpoint|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406124057/http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/mike-huckabee-americans-to-be-indoctrinated-at-gunpoint/|archivedate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], Huckabee made headlines in the U.S. and abroad for stating on [[Fox News]]: "We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools," and further asked, "Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 14, 2012 |last=Collins |first=Gail |title=Looking For America |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/opinion/collins-looking-for-america.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Huckabee said, "Fire the ones who refuse to hear not only our hearts, but God's heart" (for which he was criticized by [[Richard Dawkins]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 30, 2014 |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |last2=Blumner |first2=Robyn |authorlink2=Robyn Blumner|title=Atheists Aren't the Problem, Christian Intolerance Is the Problem |url=https://time.com/3450525/atheists-arent-the-problem-christian-intolerance-is-the-problem |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, speaking about his support on religious freedom grounds of Kentucky county clerk [[Kim Davis]] to radio host [[Michael Medved]], Huckabee said, "Michael, [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision of 1857]] still remains to this day the law of the land which says that black people aren't fully human. Does anybody still follow the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/253292-huckabee-says-dred-scott-still-law-of-land|title=Huckabee says Dred Scott still 'law of land'|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/11/mike-huckabee-dred-scott-decision-still-law-land/|title=Mike Huckabee: Dred Scott decision still 'the law of the land'|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' had been superseded by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] and nullified by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].)

In June 2016, Huckabee, along with actor [[Pat Boone]] and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', sent a letter to California governor [[Jerry Brown]] opposing Senate Bill 1146, which "prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination" at California colleges. Other than religious schools—those that train pastors and theology teachers—schools "might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=June 30, 2016|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gods-not-dead-2-filmmakers-907838|title=''God's Not Dead 2'' Filmmakers Wade Into California Politics|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===

In 2007, Huckabee argued for a larger military and an increase in defense spending, writing, "Right now, we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense, compared with about six percent in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan. We need to return to that six percent level."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.org"&gt;{{cite web |date=2008 |last=Huckabee |first=Michael D. |title=America's Priorities in the War on Terror |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63059/michael-d-huckabee/americas-priorities-in-the-war-on-terror |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===

During his bid for president, Huckabee released a comprehensive nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. His plan includes building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increases in visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. He has previously stated he is opposed to using military resources for border patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201237.html| title=Interview with Arkansas Gov.

===Gun control===

Huckabee has voiced his support for [[self-defense]] and the [[Castle Doctrine]], and has generally taken an anti-[[gun control]] stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed.&lt;ref name="issues"/&gt; He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], he realizes they do not know what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikehuckabee.com/?FuseAction=Issues.View&amp;Issue_id=18|title=Pledge to the People |publisher=Mike Huckabee for President}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight loss and health advocacy===
When elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was [[obesity|obese]]. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with [[type 2 diabetes]], and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135&amp;nbsp;kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor [[Frank D. White]] (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;

Although Huckabee has stated that he never smoked nor drank,&lt;ref name="brianlamb"/&gt; he declared himself a "recovering foodaholic". Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Dean Karnazes]] |author2=Matt Fitzgerald |date=2008 |title=50/50: Secrets I Learned Running 50 Marathons in 50 Days – and How You Too Can Achieve Super Endurance! |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4P_t_T2DAC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA]] |page=33 |isbn=978-0-446-53789-6 |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee has discussed his weight loss and used health care reform as a major focus of his governorship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Wansink]] and Mike Huckabee (2005), "De-Marketing Obesity", ''California Management Review'', 47:4 (Summer), 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an August 2007 forum on cancer hosted by [[Lance Armstrong]], Huckabee said he would support a federal [[smoking ban]], but has stated that he believes the issue is best addressed by state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/huckabee-about-face-on-smoking-2008-01-16.html |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 16, 2008|author=Jeffrey Young|title=Huckabee about-face on smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee completed the marathon in 4:38:31, defeating Vilsack by 50 minutes. He wrote a book chronicling his weight-loss experience, ''[[Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork]]''. Huckabee was one of 10 recipients of a 2006 [[AARP]] Impact Award acknowledging his work as a "health crusader".

In 2009, Huckabee acknowledged that he had gained back a fourth of his weight due to a foot condition that prevented him from running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily|last=Miller|year=2009|title=Weighty Matters: Mike Huckabee Gains 25 Lbs., 'Biggest Loser' Comes to D.C.|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/11/05/injured-mike-huckabee-regains-25-pounds-the-biggest-loser-com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natan Sharansky''' ({{lang-he-n|נתן שרנסקי}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Ната́н Щара́нский}}, {{lang-uk|Натан Щаранський}}; born '''Anatoly Borisovich Shcharansky''' ({{lang-ru|Анато́лий Бори́сович Щара́нский}}, {{lang-uk|Анатолій Борисович Щаранський}}) on 20 January 1948) is an Israeli politician, [[human rights]] activist and author who, as a [[refusenik]] in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s, spent nine years in Soviet prisons. He has served as Chairman of the Executive of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] since June 2009, to be replaced in August 2018 by [[Isaac Herzog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/leadership |title=Leadership, Board &amp; Staff &amp;#124; The jewish agency for Israel |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sharansky was born in [[Donetsk]] (then called [[Stalino]]), [[Soviet Union]] on 20 January 1948 to a Jewish family. He graduated with a degree in [[applied mathematics]] from [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. As a child, he was a [[chess]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]]. He performed in [[simultaneous display|simultaneous]] and [[blindfold chess|blindfold]] displays, usually against adults. At the age of 15, he won the championship in his native Donetsk.&lt;ref name=Schmemann&gt;{{cite news|author=Schmemann, Serge|title=Kasparov beaten in Israel, by Russians|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/16/world/kasparov-beaten-in-israel-by-russians.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=16 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When incarcerated in [[solitary confinement]], he claims to have maintained his sanity by playing chess against himself in his mind. Sharansky beat the world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]] in a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in Israel in 1996.&lt;ref name=Schmemann/&gt;

He took his current Hebrew name in 1986, when he was freed from Soviet incarceration as part of a prisoner exchange and received an Israeli passport with his new name.&lt;ref name =mcd/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Natan Sharansky is married to [[Avital Sharansky]] and has two daughters, Rachel and Hannah.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/sharansky.html |title=Natan (Anatoly) Sharansky |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet Union, his application to marry Avital was denied by the authorities. They were married in a friend's apartment, in a ceremony not recognized by the government, as the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] only recognized [[civil marriage]] and not religious marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man in the news: Anatoly Borisovich Shcharansky; a free man at last|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/world/man-in-the-news-anatoly-borisovich-shcharansky-a-free-man-at-last.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=12 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Sharansky was denied an exit visa to Israel in 1973. The reason given for denial of the visa was that he had been given access, at some point in his career, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave. After becoming a [[refusenik]], Sharansky became a human rights activist, working as a translator for [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]] and [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] [[Andrei Sakharov]], and spokesman for the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] and a leader for the rights of refuseniks.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
On 15 March 1977 Sharansky was arrested on multiple charges including [[high treason]] and spying for Americans. The accusation stipulated that he passed to the West lists of over 1,300 ''refuseniks'', many of whom were denied exit visas because of their knowledge of state secrets, which resulted in a publication by Robert C. Toth, "Russ Indirectly Reveal 'State Secrets': Clues in Denials of Jewish Visas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Toth, Robert|title=Russ indirectly reveal 'state secrets': clues in denials of Jewish visas|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=22 November 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US reporter got secrets, Russians say|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19780712&amp;id=7HBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7xEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4166,2011348|work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|date=12 July 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; High treason carried the [[Capital punishment in the Soviet Union|death penalty]]. The following year, in 1978, he was sentenced to 13 years of [[forced labor]].

Sharansky spent time in the [[Lefortovo Prison]] in Moscow, followed by [[Vladimir Central Prison|Vladimir]] and [[Chistopol]] prisons, where for part of the time he was placed in solitary confinement. His health deteriorated, to the point of endangering his life. Later he was detained in Perm 35, a post-[[Stalin]]-[[Gulag]]-type so-called "[[strict regimen colony]]" in [[Perm Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berman, Daphna|title=Natan Sharansky: act III, scene I|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|date=July–August 2012|url=http://www.momentmag.com/natan-sharansky-act-iii-scene-i-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept himself sane during solitary confinement by playing [[chess]] with himself, in his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25560162|title=Natan Sharansky: how chess kept one man sane |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharansky appeared in a March 1990 edition of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. The article, "Last Days of the Gulag" by Mike Edwards, profiles through photographs and text one of the few remaining Soviet prison labor camps. The article featured a photo of Natan Sharansky and his wife Avital in their home in Israel viewing photos of the same Gulag where he had been imprisoned, but as it appeared in 1990. Sharansky remarked in the article that after viewing images of the prisoner's faces he could discern that the protocol of oppression was still at work. The author also showed Sharansky a photo of the cold isolation cell where he had himself been confined. Sharansky commented with irony that conditions had improved slightly—the stark cell now featured a thin bench bolted to the middle of the floor. He said that if that bench had existed when he was there he could have utilized it to sleep, albeit uncomfortably.

==Release from detention==
[[File:Mevrouw Sharansky (1980).jpg|thumb|Sharansky's wife [[Avital Sharansky|Avital]] at the Sharansky tribunal in Amsterdam, 12 May 1980]]
As a result of an international campaign led by his wife, Avital Sharansky (including assistance from [[East Germany|East German]] lawyer [[Wolfgang Vogel]], New York Congressman [[Benjamin Gilman]] and Rabbi [[Ronald Greenwald]]), Sharansky was released on 11 February 1986 as part of a larger exchange of detainees. He was the first [[political prisoner]] released by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] due to intense political pressure from [[Ronald Reagan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Sharansky and three low-level Western spies (Czech citizen [[Jaroslav Javorský]] and West German citizens [[Wolf-Georg Frohn]] and [[Dietrich Nistroy]]) were exchanged for Czech spies [[Karl Koecher]] and [[Hana Koecher]] held in the United States, Soviet spy [[Yevgeni Zemlyakov]], Polish spy [[Marian Zacharski]] and [[East Germany|East German]] spy [[Detlef Scharfenorth]] (the latter three held in West Germany). The exchange took place on the [[Glienicke Bridge]] between East and West Berlin, which had been used before for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Broder, Jonathan|title=Hero is home: Israel cheers Sharansky|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-12/news/8601110453_1_anatoly-shcharansky-years-in-soviet-prisons-peres|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=12 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moseley, Ray|title=Shcharansky swap confirmed|journal=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=11 February 1986|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-11/news/8601110144_1_anatoly-shcharansky-prisoner-exchange-spy-plane-pilot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Sharansky immediately immigrated to Israel, adopting the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name ''Natan'' and eventually simplifying his surname to Sharansky. His wife had become religiously observant during his detention, but he did not follow her on this path.

Due to his age and poor health, he was exempted from the standard mandatory three years' military service, but had to undergo three weeks of military training and do a stint in the [[Civil Guard (Israel)|Civil Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharansky begins military training|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19880301&amp;id=SqgpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jO8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3932,273427|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=1 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he wrote ''[[Fear No Evil (book)|Fear No Evil]]'', his memoirs of his time as a prisoner, and founded the [[Zionist Forum]], an organization of Soviet immigrant Jewish activists dedicated to helping new Israelis and educating the public about integration issues, known in Israel as ''klita'' (lit. "absorption"). Sharansky also served as a contributing editor to ''[[The Jerusalem Report]]'' and as a Board member of [[Peace Watch]].

===Freedom fighter awards===
In 1986, the [[United States Congress]] granted him the [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/histHigh/Congressional_History/goldMedal.html Congressional Gold Medal recipients]. Clerk.house.gov. Retrieved on 9 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]] granted Sharansky the ''Henrietta Szold Award'', given by [[Ruth Popkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digifindingaids.cjh.org/?pID=2916671 Guide to the Operations and Functions Records in the Hadassah Archives, RG 15, Box 45, Folder 25, [[American Jewish Historical Society]], Boston, MA and New York, NY]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, US President [[George W.

==Israeli political career==
[[File:Ronald Reagan with Natan Sharansky.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sharansky and [[Ronald Reagan]], December 1986]]

In 1995, Sharansky and [[Yoel Edelstein]] founded the [[Yisrael BaAliyah]] party (a play of words, since "aliya" means both Jewish emigration to Israel, and "rise", thus the party name means "(People of) Israel immigrating (to the State of Israel)", as well as "Israel on the rise"), promoting the absorption of the Soviet Jews into Israeli society. The party won seven [[Knesset]] seats in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Natan Ščaranskij|author2=Anatoly Sharansky|title=The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny And Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJaqxyY4kusC|year=2006|publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89221-644-4|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won 6 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999]], gaining two ministerial posts, but left the government on 11 July 2000 in response to suggestions that Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s negotiations with the Palestinians would result in a division of [[Jerusalem]]. After [[Ariel Sharon]] won a [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001|special election for Prime Minister]] in 2001, the party joined his new government, and was again given two ministerial posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/govt/eng/GovtByNumber_eng.asp?govt=29 |title=Governments of Israel |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|January 2003 elections]], the party was reduced to just two seats. Sharansky resigned from the Knesset, and was replaced by Edelstein. However, he remained party chairman, and decided to merge it into Likud (which had won the election with 38 seats). The merger went through on 10 March 2003,&lt;ref name=PGs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp |title=Parliamentary Groups in the Knesset |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sharansky was appointed Minister of Jerusalem Affairs.

From March 2003 – May 2005, he was Israel's [[Minister without Portfolio]], responsible for Jerusalem, social and [[Jewish diaspora]] affairs. Under this position Sharansky chaired a secret committee that approved the confiscation of [[East Jerusalem]] property of [[West Bank]] Palestinians. This decision was reversed after an outcry from the Israeli left and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nonna Gorilovskaya |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/03/dissident-interview-natan-sharansky |title=The Dissident: An Interview With Natan Sharansky |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously he served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, Minister of Housing and Construction since March 2001, [[Interior Minister of Israel]] (July 1999 – resigned in July 2000), [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Minister of Industry and Trade]] (1996–1999).

He resigned from the cabinet in April 2005 to protest plans to [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|withdraw]] [[Israeli settlement]]s from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank.

He was re-elected to the Knesset in March 2006 as a member of the Likud Party. On 20 November 2006, he resigned from the [[Knesset]].

===NGO work and other activities===
His resignation was meant to allow him to form the right-leaning [[Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies]]. The funding came from American billionaire [[Sheldon Adelson]].

Since 2007, Sharansky has been Chairman of the Board of [[Beit Hatefutsot]], the Jewish diaspora museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3414395,00.html Sharansky new Beth Hatefutsoth head – Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews].

In June 2009, Sharansky was elected to the Chair of the Executive of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] by the Jewish Agency Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/About/Updates/Chairman/Archive/2009/jul02.htm |accessdate=3 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 Sharansky secured $6&amp;nbsp;million from the [[Genesis Philanthropy Group]] for educational activities in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berkman |first=Jacob |url=http://blogs.jta.org/philanthropy/article/2009/09/02/1007603/genesis-group-gives-jewish-agency-6-million-for-education-projects-in-fsu |title=Genesis group gives Jewish Agency $6 million for education projects in FSU &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Blogs.jta.org |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227184115/http://blogs.jta.org/philanthropy/article/2009/09/02/1007603/genesis-group-gives-jewish-agency-6-million-for-education-projects-in-fsu |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a Founding Member of [[One Jerusalem]].

==Media recognition and awards==
In 1997, Sharansky was the focus of a 2.5-hour-long episode of ''Chaim SheKa'ele'' ("What A Life"), the Israeli version of ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. The episode focused mainly on his experiences as a Soviet dissident, and featured many of his family and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chaim SheKa'ele - Natan Sharansky |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQCO4UCJtJ4 |publisher=YouTube |date=1997 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Sharansky participated in ''[[They Chose Freedom]]'', a four-part television documentary on the history of the [[Soviet dissident movement]], and in 2008 he was featured in [[Laura Bialis]]' documentary ''[[Refusenik (film)|Refusenik]]''. In 2014, he took part in [[Natella Boltyanskaya]]'s documentary ''[[Parallels, Events, People]]''. He was number eleven on the list of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 100 most influential people of 2005 in the "Scientists and thinkers" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chafets, Zev|title=Natan Sharansky: Bush's favorite author|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=10 April 2005|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1047430,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
Sharansky is the author of three books. The first is the autobiographical ''[[Fear No Evil (book)|Fear No Evil]]'', which dealt with his trial and imprisonment.

His second book, ''[[The Case for Democracy|The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror]]'' was co-written with [[Ron Dermer]]. [[George W. Bush]] offered praise for the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you want a glimpse of how I think about foreign policy, read Natan Sharansky's book, ''The Case for Democracy''. ... For government, particularly – for opinion makers, I would put it on your recommended reading list. It's short and it's good. This guy is a heroic figure, as you know.

==Political views==
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Natan Sharansky-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Sharansky and [[Vladimir Putin]] in the Kremlin, 19 September 2000]]
Sharansky has argued that there can never be peace between Israel and the Palestinians until there is "the building of real democratic institutions in the fledgling Palestinian society, no matter how tempting a 'solution' without them may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Natan Ščaranskij|author2=Anatoly Sharansky|title=The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny And Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJaqxyY4kusC|year=2006|publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-89221-644-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Haaretz]]'' interview, he maintained the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jews came here 3,000 years ago and this is the cradle of Jewish civilization. Jews are the only people in history who kept their loyalty to their identity and their land throughout the 2,000 years of exile, and no doubt that they have the right to have their place among nations—not only historically but also geographically. As to the Palestinians, who are the descendants of those Arabs who migrated in the last 200 years, they have the right, if they want, to have their own state ... but not at the expense of the state of Israel.&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;{{cite journal|author=Desch, Michael|title=Sharansky’s double standard|journal=[[The American Conservative]]|date=28 March 2005|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/sharanskys-double-standard/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the wake of the [[Arab uprisings of 2011]], he told ''[[Moment Magazine]]'', "To sign an agreement you must have a partner who is dependent on the well-being of his people, which is what democracy means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natan Sharansky |title=What Is Israel's Next Move In The New Middle East? |url=http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/06/IsraelsNextMove.html |work=Moment Magazine |date=May–June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506055639/http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/06/IsraelsNextMove.html |archivedate=6 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Gregory I'''  ({{lang-la|Gregorius I}}; {{circa|540}} – 12 March 604), commonly known as '''Saint Gregory the Great''',&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Gregory I ("the Great")|volume=6|author=Huddleston, Gilbert}}
Gregory had come to be known as 'the Great' by the late ninth century, a title which is still applied to him. See John Moorhead, ''Gregory the Great'', (Routledge, 2005), p1
&lt;/ref&gt; was Pope of the [[Catholic Church]] from 3 September 590 to 12 March 604 AD. He is famous for instigating the first recorded large-scale mission from Rome, the [[Gregorian Mission]], to convert the then-[[pagan]] Anglo-Saxons in England to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Flechner, "Pope Gregory and the British" ''Histoires de Bretagnes'' 5, p. 47 [http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/7383/Flechner_Gregory_and_the_British_Mission_Canon_Law.pdf?sequence=1 On UCD Research Repository]&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory is also well known for his writings, which were more prolific than those of any of his predecessors as Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet '''Saint Gregory the Dialogist''' has been attached to him in [[Eastern Christianity]] because of his ''Dialogues''. English translations of Eastern texts sometimes list him as Gregory "Dialogos", or the Anglo-Latinate equivalent "Dialogus".&lt;ref name="OCA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/0216/03/12/100789-st-gregory-dialogus-the-pope-of-rome|title=St. Gregory Dialogus, the Pope of Rome|website=oca.org, [[Orthodox Church in America]]|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman senator]]'s son and himself the [[Prefect of Rome]] at 30, Gregory tried the [[monastery]] but soon returned to active public life, ending his life and the century as pope. Although he was the first pope from a [[monasticism|monastic]] background, his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator, who successfully established [[papal supremacy]]. During his papacy, he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of Rome, and he successfully challenged the theological views of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]] before the emperor [[Tiberius II]]. Gregory regained papal authority in [[Catholic Church in Spain|Spain]] and [[Catholic Church in France|France]] and sent missionaries to [[Catholic Church in England|England]]. The realignment of barbarian allegiance to Rome from their [[Arianism|Arian]] Christian alliances shaped medieval Europe. Gregory saw [[Franks]], [[Lombards]], and [[Visigoths]] align with Rome in religion. He also combated against the [[Donatism|Donatist]] heresy, popular particularly in North Africa at the time.&lt;ref name=OCA /&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages, he was known as "the Father of Christian Worship" because of his exceptional efforts in revising the Roman worship of his day.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Life and Worship (Dissertations in European Economic History)'', 1948, 1979, Gerald Ellard (1894–1963), Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-10819-2}} {{ISBN|9780405108198}}, p. 125.

Gregory is a [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the [[Latin Fathers]]. He is considered a [[saint]] in the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Anglican Communion]], and some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran denominations]]. Immediately after his death, Gregory was canonized by popular acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=F.L. Cross|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|title=Gregory I}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protestant]] reformer [[John Calvin]] admired Gregory greatly, and declared in his [[Institutes of the Christian Religion|''Institutes'']] that Gregory was the last good Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=F.L. Cross|encyclopedia=Institutes of the Christian Religion Book IV|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1515|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion Book IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the [[patron saint]] of musicians, singers, students, and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scborromeo.org/saints/gregory.htm|title=St. Gregory the Great|publisher=Web site of Saint Charles Borromeo Catholic Church|accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Catholic philosophy}}
The exact date of Gregory's birth is uncertain, but is usually estimated to be around the year 540,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory mentions in Dialogue 3.2 that he was alive when [[Totila]] attempted to murder Carbonius, Bishop of [[Populonia]], probably in 546. In a letter of 598 (''Register'', Book 9, Letter 1) he rebukes Bishop Januarius of [[Cagliari]], Sardinia, excusing himself for not observing 1 Timothy 5.1, which cautions against rebuking elders. Timothy 5.9 defines elderly women to be 60 and over, which would probably apply to all. Gregory appears not to consider himself an elder, limiting his birth to no earlier than 539, but 540 is the typical selection. Dudden (1905), page 3, notes 1–3. The presumption of 540 has continued in modern times – see for example Richards, Jeffrey (1980). ''Consul of God. ''London: Routledge &amp; Keatland Paul.
&lt;/ref&gt; in the city of Rome. His parents named him ''Gregorius'', which according to [[Ælfric of Abingdon]] in ''An Homily on the Birth-Day of S. Gregory,'' "... is a Greek Name [sic], which signifies in the Latin Tongue, ''Vigilantius'', that is in English, Watchful...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ælfric|first=|author-link=Ælfric of Abingdon |translator-last=Elstob |translator-first=Elizabeth |translator-link=Elizabeth Elstob |title=An English-Saxon Homily on the Birth-day of St. Gregory: Anciently Used in the English-Saxon Church, Giving an Account of the Conversion of the English from Paganism to Christianity|date=1709
|publisher=W. Bowyer|location=London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval writer who provided this etymology&lt;ref&gt;The translator goes on to state that "[[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]], who first writ the life of St. Gregory, and is followed by all the after Writers on that subject, observes that 'ex Greco eloquio in nostra lingua ... vigilator, seu vigilans sonat." However, Paul the deacon is too late for the first ''vita'', or life.&lt;/ref&gt; did not hesitate to apply it to the life of Gregory. Aelfric states, "He was very diligent in God's Commandments."&lt;ref&gt;The name is Biblical, derived from [[New Testament]] contexts: grēgorein is a present, continuous aspect, meaning to be watchful of forsaking Christ. It is derived from a more ancient perfect, egrēgora, "roused from sleep", of egeirein, "to awaken someone." {{cite book |first=Joseph Henry|last=Thayer|title=Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament being Grimm's Wilke's Clavis Novi Testamenti Translated Revised and Enlarged|date=1962 |publisher=Zondervan Publishing House |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was born into a wealthy [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] Roman family with close connections to the church. His father, Gordianus, who served as a senator and for a time was the Prefect of the City of Rome,&lt;ref name=Thornton&gt;Thornton, pp 163–8&lt;/ref&gt; also held the position of [[Regionarius]] in the church, though nothing further is known about that position. Gregory's mother, [[Saint Silvia|Silvia]], was well-born, and had a married sister, Pateria, in [[Sicily]]. His mother and two paternal aunts are honored by Catholic and Orthodox churches as saints.&lt;ref name=Thornton /&gt;&lt;ref name=OCA /&gt; Gregory's great-great-grandfather had been [[Pope Felix III]],&lt;ref&gt;Whether III or IV depends on whether [[Antipope Felix II]] is to be considered pope.&lt;/ref&gt; the nominee of the Gothic king, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]].&lt;ref name="Dud4"&gt;Dudden (1905), page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's election to the throne of St Peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Richards&lt;/ref&gt;

The family owned and resided in a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' on the [[Caelian Hill]], fronting the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) as the former palaces of the Roman emperors on the [[Palatine Hill]] opposite. The north of the street runs into the [[Colosseum]]; the south, the [[Circus Maximus]]. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in [[Sicily]]&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; and around Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1980), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by [[John, deacon of Rome|John the Deacon]]. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. [[Saint Silvia|Silvia]] was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look. They had another son whose name and fate are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy. From 542 the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over 1/3 of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Markus pg 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, although the [[Western Roman Empire]] had long since vanished in favour of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] was gradually retaken from the [[Goths]] by [[Justinian I]], emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] ruling from [[Constantinople]]. As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it. [[Totila]] [[Sack of Rome (546)|sacked and vacated Rome]] in 546, destroying most of its population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets. It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905), pages 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gothic War (535–554)|war]] was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the [[Franks]] was defeated in 554. After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople.

Like most young men of his position in Roman society, Saint Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law, and excelling in all.&lt;ref name=Thornton /&gt; [[Gregory of Tours]] reported that "in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric ... he was second to none...."&lt;ref name=rich26&gt;Richards (1980), page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek. He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a "fluency with imperial law" that he may have trained in it "as a preparation for a career in public life."&lt;ref name=rich26/&gt; Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old.&lt;ref name=Thornton /&gt;

The monks of the Monastery of St. Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century. He reports the picture of a man who was "rather bald" and had a "tawny" beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's. The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled. His nose was "thin and straight" and "slightly aquiline." "His forehead was high." He had thick, "subdivided" lips and a chin "of a comely prominence" and "beautiful hands."&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1980), page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs.&lt;ref&gt;Leyser pg 132&lt;/ref&gt;

On his father's death, Gregory converted his family ''villa'' into a [[monastery]] dedicated to the [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] [[Saint Andrew]] (after his death it was rededicated as [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio]]). In his life of contemplation, Gregory concluded that "in that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without.".&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini pg 155&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems to some that Gregory was not always forgiving, or pleasant for that matter, even in his monastic years. For example, a monk lying on his death bed confessed to stealing three gold pieces. Gregory forced the monk to die friendless and alone, then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a curse, "Take your money with you to perdition". Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even on one's deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Straw pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the monk's death Gregory offered 30 Masses in his remembrance to [[Prayer for the dead|assist his soul]] before the [[final judgment]]. Eventually, [[Pope Pelagius II]] ordained Gregory a [[deacon]] and solicited his help in trying to heal the [[schism of the Three Chapters]] in [[northern Italy]]. However, this schism was not healed until well after Gregory was gone.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory the great and his world pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life. He viewed being a monk as the 'ardent quest for the vision of our Creator.'&lt;ref&gt;Markus- pg 69&lt;/ref&gt; His three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity. However, after the [[Trasilla and Emiliana|two eldest]] died after seeing a vision of their ancestor [[Pope Felix III]], the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate. Gregory's response to this family scandal was "many are called but few are chosen."&lt;ref&gt;Consul of God, Richards. Pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's mother [[Saint Silvia|Silvia]] herself is a [[saint]].

==Apocrisiariate (579–585)==
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|Illumination in a 12th-century [[manuscript]] of a letter of Gregory's to [[Saint Leander]], [[Seville|bishop of Seville]] (Bibl. Municipale, MS 2, [[Dijon]])]]

In 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his ''[[apocrisiarius]]'' (ambassador to the imperial court in [[Constantinople]]), a post Gregory would hold until 586.&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was part of the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the [[Lombards]].&lt;ref name="e9"&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Byzantine military [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591|focused on the East]], these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as ''apocrisiarius'', detailing the hardships that Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking him to ask [[Emperor Maurice]] to send a relief force.&lt;ref name="e9"/&gt; Maurice, however, had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the [[Franks]] against them.&lt;ref name="e9"/&gt; It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] to the North.&lt;ref name="e10"&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ekonomou, "if Gregory's principal task was to plead Rome's cause before the emperor, there seems to have been little left for him to do once imperial policy toward Italy became evident. Papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether".&lt;ref name="e10"/&gt; Gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of [[John III Scholasticus]], who had occupied the Patriarchate of Constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople|Eutychius]] (who had been driven out by Justinian).&lt;ref name="e10"/&gt; Gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the Byzantine elite of the city, where he became extremely popular with the city's upper class, "especially aristocratic women".&lt;ref name="e10"/&gt; Ekonomou surmises that "while Gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of Constantinople's aristocracy, this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of Rome before the emperor".&lt;ref name="e10"/&gt; Although the writings of John the Deacon claim that Gregory "labored diligently for the relief of Italy", there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of Pelagius II.&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory's theological disputes with Patriarch Eutychius would leave a "bitter taste for the theological speculation of the East" with Gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy.&lt;ref name="e11"&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Western sources, Gregory's very public debate with Eutychius culminated in an exchange before [[Tiberius II]] where Gregory cited a biblical passage ("''Palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non-habet, sicut me videtis habere'', or "touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk024.htm Luke 24:39] – "touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have."&lt;/ref&gt;) in support of the view that Christ was corporeal and palpable after his Resurrection; allegedly as a result of this exchange, Tiberius II ordered Eutychius's writings burned.&lt;ref name="e11"/&gt; Ekonomou views this argument, though exaggerated in Western sources, as Gregory's "one achievement of an otherwise fruitless ''apokrisiariat''".&lt;ref name="e12"&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gregory was forced to rely on Scripture because he could not read the untranslated Greek authoritative works.&lt;ref name="e12"/&gt; 
Gregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585, returning to his monastery on the [[Caelian Hill]].&lt;ref name="e13"&gt;Ekonomou, 2007, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was elected by [[acclamation]] to succeed Pelagius II in 590, when the latter died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spreading through the city.&lt;ref name="e13"/&gt; Gregory was approved by an Imperial ''[[iussio]]'' from Constantinople the following September (as was the norm during the [[Byzantine Papacy]]).&lt;ref name="e13"/&gt;

===Controversy with Eutychius===
In Constantinople, Gregory took issue with the aged [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]], who had recently published a treatise, now lost, on the [[Resurrection of the dead|General Resurrection]]. Eutychius maintained that the resurrected body "will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines: Being a Continuation of 'The Dictionary of the Bible': VolumeII Eaba – Hermocrates|first=William|last=Smith|author2=Henry Wace|year=1880|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|pages=415}} The dictionary account is apparently based on [[Bede]], Book II, Chapter 1, who used the expression "...impalpable, of finer texture than wind and air."&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen Christ in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:39|KJV}}. As the dispute could not be settled, the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Tiberius II Constantine]], undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be [[book burning|burned]]. Shortly after both Gregory and Eutychius became ill; Gregory recovered, but Eutychius died on 5 April 582, at age 70. On his deathbed Eutychius recanted impalpability and Gregory dropped the matter. Tiberius also died a few months after Eutychius.

Although Gregory was resolved to retire into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation, he was unwillingly forced back into a world that, although he loved, he no longer wanted to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;Straw pg 25&lt;/ref&gt; In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of
prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini pg 39&lt;/ref&gt;
When he became pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks. At that time, for various reasons, the [[Holy See]] had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of [[Pope Gelasius I|Gelasius I]]. The episcopacy in [[Gaul]] was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, [[Gregory of Tours]], may be considered typical; in [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain the bishops had little contact with Rome; in Italy the territories which had ''de facto'' fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent [[Lombards|Lombard]] dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and in the south.

Pope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: "Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also."&lt;ref&gt;Dudden pg 124&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with re-energizing the Church's missionary work among the non-Christian peoples of northern Europe. He is most famous for sending a mission, often called the [[Gregorian mission]], under [[Augustine of Canterbury]], prior of Saint Andrew's, where he had perhaps succeeded Gregory, to evangelize the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]] of England. It seems that the pope had never forgotten the English slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany. The preaching of non-heretical Christian faith and the
elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate.&lt;ref name="Richards pg 228"&gt;Richards pg 228&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Gilbert Huddleston, he was [[canonization|declared a saint]] immediately after his death by "popular acclamation".&lt;ref name="ce"/&gt;

In his official documents, Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term "[[Servant of the Servants of God]]" (''servus servorum Dei'') as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Servus servorum Dei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alms===
[[Alms]] in Christianity is defined by passages of the [[New Testament]] such as [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:21, which commands "...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor ... and come and follow me." A [[donation]] on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise, profit or non-profit.

On the one hand the alms of Saint Gregory are to be distinguished from his donations, but on the other he himself probably saw no such distinction. The church had no interest in secular profit and as pope Gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel. Apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms.

Gregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. They were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the [[Lombards]]. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward. He received lavish donations from the wealthy families of Rome, who, following his own example, were eager, by doing so, to expiate their sins. He gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse. He wrote in letters:&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (1905) page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I have frequently charged you ... to act as my representative ... to relieve the poor in their distress ...."
:"... I hold the office of steward to the property of the poor ...."

The church received donations of many different kinds of [[property]]: [[consumables]] such as food and clothing; investment property: real estate and works of art; and [[capital goods]], or [[revenue]]-generating property, such as the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[latifundia]], or agricultural estates, staffed and operated by [[slave]]s, donated by Gregory and his family. The church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]]. He was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Later these deacons became cardinals and from the oratories attached to the buildings grew churches.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=549 under diaconia|title=A dictionary of Christian antiquities: Comprising the History, Institutions, and Antiquities of the Christian Church, from the Time of the Apostles to the Age of Charlemagne|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|author2=Samuel Cheetham |authorlink2=Samuel Cheetham (priest) |publisher=J. Murray|year=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state in which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held the better part of Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city was packed with refugees from all walks of life, who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in [[Constantinople]], which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.

In 590, Gregory could wait for Constantinople no longer. He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. The church already had basic accounting documents: every [[expense]] was recorded in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|journals]] called ''regesta'', "lists" of amounts, recipients and circumstances. Revenue was recorded in ''polyptici'', "[[Bookkeeping|books]]". Many of these polyptici were [[ledger]]s recording the operating expenses of the church and the [[asset]]s, the ''patrimonia''. A central papal administration, the ''notarii'', under a chief, the ''primicerius notariorum'', kept the ledgers and issued ''brevia patrimonii'', or lists of property for which each ''[[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]'' was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=322|title=The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages: Volume X|first=Horace Kinder|last=Mann|author2=Johannes Hollnsteiner|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., Ltd.|location=London|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In a letter to a subordinate in [[Sicily]] he wrote: "I asked you most of all to take care of the poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that you give the woman, Pateria, forty [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ...."&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosini &amp; Willis (1996) pages 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.&lt;ref name=dud248&gt;Dudden (1905) pages 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine. Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas. The church now owned between {{convert|1300|and|1800|sqmi|km2}} of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called ''patrimonia.'' It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the ''diaconia''. He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out. At the bottom was the ''rusticus'' who produced the goods. Some rustici were or owned slaves. He turned over part of his produce to a ''conductor'' from whom he leased the land. The latter reported to an ''actionarius'', the latter to a ''defensor'' and the latter to a ''rector''. Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Medieval Church, 590–1500|first=Margaret|last=Deanesly|publisher=Routledge|year=1969|location=London, New York|isbn=9780415039598|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributions to qualified persons were monthly. However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.&lt;ref name=dud248/&gt;

These and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the rump state at Constantinople, which had only disrespect for Gregory,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the Lombards. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] the papacy was most influential presence in Italy.

==Works==
===Liturgical reforms===
{{unref|section|date=September 2018}}
[[John, deacon of Rome|John the Deacon]] wrote that Pope Gregory I made a general revision of the liturgy of the [[Pre-Tridentine Mass]], "removing many things, changing a few, adding some". In letters, Gregory remarks that he moved the ''[[Pater Noster]]'' (Our Father) to immediately after the [[Roman Canon]] and immediately before the [[Fraction (religion)|Fraction]]. This position is still maintained today in the Roman Liturgy. The pre-Gregorian position is evident in the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Gregory added material to the ''[[Roman Canon#Hanc Igitur|Hanc Igitur]]'' of the Roman Canon and established the nine ''[[Kyrie]]s'' (a vestigial remnant of the [[litany]] which was originally at that place) at the beginning of [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. He also reduced the role of deacons in the Roman Liturgy.

[[Sacramentary|Sacramentaries]] directly influenced by Gregorian reforms are referred to as ''Sacrementaria Gregoriana''. Roman and other [[Latin liturgical rites|Western liturgies]] since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season; these variations are visible in the [[collect]]s and [[preface]]s as well as in the Roman Canon itself.

====Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], Gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], a fully separate form of the [[Divine Liturgy]] in the [[Byzantine Rite]] adapted to the needs of the season of [[Great Lent]]. Its [[Roman Rite]] equivalent is the [[Mass of the Presanctified]] used only on [[Good Friday]]. The [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts continues to be used in the [[Malankara Rite]], a variant of the [[West Syrian Rite]] historically practiced in the [[Malankara Church]] of [[India]], and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;Chupungco, Anscar J.

====Gregorian chant====

{{main article|Gregorian chant}}
The mainstream form of Western [[plainchant]], standardized in the late 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dlhhy74e6ugC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=suppression+of+regional+musical+dialects&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j_K2ufWC-i&amp;sig=DT_SWD3kghOrj2i5gFPPIGWUbwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NBlHUI6dEsS5hAfGjIDoCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=suppression%20of%20regional%20musical%20dialects&amp;f=false Kenneth Levy, ''Gregorian Chant and the Carolingians''(Princeton University Press 1998] {{ISBN|9780691017334}}), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; was attributed to Pope Gregory I and so took the name of Gregorian chant. The earliest such attribution is in John the Deacon's 873 biography of Gregory, almost three centuries after the pope's death, and the chant that bears his name "is the result of the fusion of Roman and Frankish elements which took place in the Franco-German empire under [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]], [[Charlemagne]] and their successors".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wpIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Deacon+supplies+in+873&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dwnDhXcEAH&amp;sig=7Dts8bAbM_1pZMrMN06i2U3vOwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RB5HUJWRDI6IhQf5iYCYAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Deacon%20supplies%20in%20873&amp;f=false Gregory Murray, ''Gregorian Chant According to the Manuscripts'' (L.

===Writings===
Gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him.&lt;ref&gt;Straw pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Gregory is the only pope between the fifth and the eleventh centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive ''corpus''. Some of his writings are:
*''[[Commentary on Job]]'', frequently known in English-language histories by its Latin title, ''Magna Moralia, ''or as ''Moralia on Job. ''This is one of the longest patristic works. It was possibly finished as early as 591. It is based on talks Gregory gave on the Book of Job to his 'brethren' who accompanied him to Constantinople. The work as we have it is the result of Gregory's revision and completion of it soon after his accession to the papal office.&lt;ref name="RA Markus, 1997 p15"&gt;RA Markus, ''Gregory the Great and his World'', (Cambridge: CUP, 1997), p15&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Liber regulae pastoralis ''(''Book of Pastoral Rule / [[Pastoral Care|The Rule for Pastors]])'', in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church: the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office. This was probably begun before his election as pope and finished in 591.
* ''Dialogues'', a collection of four books of miracles, signs, wonders, and healings done by the holy men, mostly monastic, of sixth-century Italy, with the second book entirely devoted to a popular life of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |last=Gardner|first=Edmund G. (editor)|title=The Dialogues of Saint Gregory the Great|publisher=Evolution Publishing|location=Merchantville, NJ|year=2010 |orig-year=1911|ISBN=978-1-889758-94-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sermons]], including:
** The sermons include the 22 ''Homilae in Hiezechielem ''(''Homilies on Ezekiel''), dealing with Ezekiel 1.1–4.3 in Book One, and Ezekiel 40 in Book 2. These were preached during 592–3, the years that the Lombards besieged Rome, and contain some of Gregory's most profound mystical teachings. They were revised eight years later.
** The ''Homilae xl in Evangelia ''(''Forty Homilies on the Gospels'') for the liturgical year, delivered during 591 and 592, which were seemingly finished by 593. A papyrus fragment from this codex survives in the [[British Museum]], London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2014/02/a-papyrus-puzzle-and-some-purple-parchment.html | title = A Papyrus Puzzle and Some Purple Parchment | date = 12 February 2014 | publisher = [[British Museum]] | accessdate = 24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Expositio in Canticis Canticorum. ''Only 2 of these sermons on the Song of Songs survive, discussing the text up to Song 1.9.
* ''In Librum primum regum expositio ''(''Commentary on 1 Kings'')
*Copies of some 854 letters have survived. During Gregory's time, copies of papal letters were made by scribes into a ''Registrum ''(''Register''), which was then kept in the ''scrinium''. It is known that in the 9th century, when John the Deacon composed his ''Life'' of Gregory, the ''Registrum'' of Gregory's letters was formed of 14 papyrus rolls (though it is difficult to estimate how many letters this may have represented). Though these original rolls are now lost, the 854 letters have survived in copies made at various later times, the largest single batch of 686 letters being made by order of [[Adrian I]] (772–95).&lt;ref name="RA Markus, 1997 p15"/&gt; The majority of the copies, dating from the 10th to the 15th century, are stored in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=63–64|title=The [[Vatican Secret Archives|Secret Archives of the Vatican]]|first=Maria Luisa|last=Ambrosini|author2=Mary Willis|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|year=1996|isbn=9780760701256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory wrote over 850 letters in the last 13 years of his life (590–604) that give us an accurate picture of his work.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Markus "Gregory the Great and his world" pg I&lt;/ref&gt; A truly autobiographical presentation is nearly impossible for Gregory. The development of his mind and personality remains purely speculative in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory the great and his world. pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions of the writings of Gregory vary. "His character strikes us as an ambiguous and enigmatic one," the Jewish Canadian-American popularist [[Norman F. Cantor|Cantor]] observed. "On the one hand he was an able and determined administrator, a skilled and clever diplomat, a leader of the greatest sophistication and vision; but on the other hand, he appears in his writings as a superstitious and credulous [[monk]], hostile to learning, crudely limited as a theologian, and excessively devoted to saints, [[miracle]]s, and [[relic]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Cantor (1993) page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of three figures in the Gospels===
Gregory was among those who identified [[Mary Magdalene]] with [[Mary of Bethany]], whom {{bibleverse||John|12:1–8|ESV}} recounts as having [[anointing of Jesus|anointed]] Jesus with precious ointment, an event that some interpret as being the same as the [[Parable of the Two Debtors|anointing of Jesus]] performed by a woman that Luke (alone among the [[synoptic Gospels]]) recounts as sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:36–50|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:6–13|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|14:3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preaching on the passage in the [[Gospel of Luke]], Gregory remarked: "This woman, whom Luke calls a sinner&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:37|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John calls Mary,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|12:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; I think is the Mary from whom Mark reports&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|16:9|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seven demons were cast out."&lt;ref&gt;"Hanc vero quam Lucas peccatricem mulierem, Ioannes Mariam nominat, illam esse Mariam credimus de qua Marcus septem daemonia eiecta fuisse testatur" (''Patrologia Latina'' 76:1239)&lt;/ref&gt; Today Biblical scholars distinguish the three figures, but they are all still popularly identified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Co8R1h7Te-cC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22sinful+magdalene+of+bethany%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CU_ulaL341&amp;sig=e5ELKDyhjbqkuyKQqvdamGKQ-so&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SdA1UNrfBcmphAej8ICoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sinful%20magdalene%20of%20bethany%22&amp;f=false Ingrid Maisch, ''Mary Magdalene: The Image of a Woman through the Centuries'' (Liturgical Press 1988] {{ISBN|9780814624715}}), chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man writing Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS. 389.jpg|thumb|left|Gregory and his Dove, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] Ms 389]]

In art Gregory is usually shown in full pontifical robes with the [[papal tiara|tiara]] and [[patriarchal cross|double cross]], despite his actual habit of dress. Earlier depictions are more likely to show a monastic [[tonsure]] and plainer dress. Orthodox [[icons]] traditionally show St. Gregory vested as a bishop holding a [[Gospel Book]] and blessing with his right hand. It is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a [[square halo]], then used for the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Gietmann| first =G.| title =Nimbus|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Nimbus|year =1911
| publisher=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]], Robert Appleton Company| volume =XI| pages =| place=New York| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dove is his [[emblem|attribute]], from the well-known story attributed to his friend Peter the Deacon,&lt;ref&gt;For the various literary accounts, see B. Colgrave (ed), ''The Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'', 1985, Cambridge, 157, n.110&lt;/ref&gt; who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on [[Ezechiel]] a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself. As, however, the pope remained silent for long periods at a time, the servant made a hole in the curtain and, looking through, beheld a dove seated upon Gregory's head with its beak between his lips. When the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words; but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak between his lips.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article – see links, below.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|upright|thumb|''Saint Gregory the Great'' by [[José de Ribera]]]]
Ribera's oil painting of ''Saint Gregory the Great'' (c.1614) is from the Giustiniani collection. The painting is conserved in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/s/saraceni/gregory.html|title=St. Gregory the Great|first=Carlo|last=Saraceni|authorlink=Carlo Saraceni|author2=Emil Kren |author3=Daniel Marx |year=1996|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face of Gregory is a caricature of the features described by John the Deacon: total baldness, outthrust chin, beak-like nose, whereas John had described partial baldness, a mildly protruding chin, slightly aquiline nose and strikingly good looks. In this picture also Gregory has his monastic back on the world, which the real Gregory, despite his reclusive intent, was seldom allowed to have.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

This scene is shown as a version of the traditional [[Evangelist portrait]] (where the [[Evangelist symbols|Evangelists' symbols]] are also sometimes shown dictating) from the tenth century onwards. An early example is the [[dedication miniature]] from an eleventh-century manuscript of Saint Gregory's ''Moralia in Job''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bamberg State Library]], Msc.Bibl.84&lt;/ref&gt; The miniature shows the scribe, Bebo of [[Seeon Abbey]], presenting the manuscript to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]]. In the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration. Usually the dove is shown whispering in Gregory's ear for a clearer composition.

[[File:Campin-mass-of-saint-gregory-1440.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Mass of St Gregory]]'', by [[Robert Campin]], 15th century]]

The late medieval subject of the [[Mass of St Gregory]] shows a version of a 7th-century story that was elaborated in later [[hagiography]]. Gregory is shown saying Mass when Christ as the [[Man of Sorrows]] appears on the altar.  The subject was most common in the 15th and 16th centuries, and reflected growing emphasis on the [[Real Presence]], and after the [[Protestant Reformation]] was an assertion of the doctrine against Protestant theology.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Miri, ''Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture'', pp. 120–122, 308–310,  Cambridge University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-521-43805-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-43805-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MysXfB2ZdCAC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=Mass+of+st+Gregory&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=ibc_Stz7FYiENvql9ZUF Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous quotes and anecdotes==
[[File:Westminster Cathedral Non Angli sed Angeli si Christiani.jpg|thumb|right|19th century [[mosaic]] in [[Westminster Cathedral]], ''Non Angli sed Angeli'']]
* ''Non Angli, sed angeli'' – "They are not [[Angles]], but [[angel]]s". [[Aphorism]], summarizing words reported to have been spoken by Gregory when he first encountered pale-skinned English boys at a [[slave market]], sparking his dispatch of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine of Canterbury]] to England to convert the English, according to [[Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', II.i. http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "Well named, for they have angelic faces and ought to be co-heirs with the angels in heaven."&lt;ref name=hunt115&gt;{{cite book |pages=115|title=The Political History of England|first=William|last=Hunt|publisher=Longmans, Green|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovering that their province was [[Deira]], he went on to add that they would be rescued ''de ira'', "from the wrath", and that their king was named [[Ælla of Deira|Aella]], ''Alleluia'', he said.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest life written a generation earlier than Bede at Whitby relates the same story but in it the English are merely visitors to Rome questioned by Gregory (see Holloway, who translates from the manuscript kept at [[Abbey library of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]]). The earlier story is not necessarily the more accurate, as Gregory is known to have instructed presbyter Candidus in [[Gaul]] by letter to buy young English slaves for placement in monasteries. These were intended for missionary work in England: Ambrosini &amp; Willis (1996) page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Locusta'', literally, "[[locust]]". However, the word sounds very much like "''loco sta''" as meaning, "Stay in place!"  Gregory himself wanted to go to England as a missionary and started out for there. On the fourth day of the journey, as they stopped for lunch, a locust landed on the edge of the Bible which Gregory was reading. He exclaimed, ''locusta!'' (locust). Reflecting on it, he understood it as a sign from Heaven whereby God wanted him to ''loco sta'', that is, remain in his own place.  Within the hour an emissary of the Pope&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict I|Benedict I]] or [[Pelagius II]].&lt;/ref&gt; arrived to recall him.&lt;ref name=hunt115/&gt;
* "I beg that you will not take the present amiss. For anything, however trifling, which is offered from the prosperity of St. Peter should be regarded as a great blessing, seeing that he will have power both to bestow on you greater things, and to hold out to you eternal benefits with Almighty God."
* ''Pro cuius amore in eius eloquio nec mihi parco'' – "For the love of whom (God) I do not spare myself from His Word."&lt;ref&gt;Dudden pg 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Homilies on Ezekiel'' Book 1.11.6. For the text in manuscript, see ''Codices Electronici Sangalienses:'' Codex 211, page 193 column 1, line 5 (external links below.)&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is that since the creator of the human race and redeemer of him unworthy gave him the power of the tongue so that he could witness, what kind of a witness would he be if he did not use it but preferred to speak infirmly?
* "For the place of heretics is very pride itself...for the place of the wicked is pride just as conversely humility is the place of the good."&lt;ref name="Richards pg 228"/&gt;
* "Whoever calls himself universal bishop, or desires this title, is, by his pride, the precursor to the Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Pope Gregory I to John the Faster.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Non enim pro locis res, sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt'' – "Things are not to be loved for the sake of a place, but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things." When Augustine asked whether to use Roman or Gallican customs in the mass in England, Gregory said, in paraphrase, that it was not the place that imparted goodness but good things that graced the place, and it was more important to be pleasing to the Almighty. They should pick out what was "pia", "religiosa" and "recta" from any church whatever and set that down before the English minds as practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', Book I section 27 part II. Bede is translated in {{cite book |title=The Ecclesiastical History of the English People: The Greater Chronicle ; Bede's Letter to Egbert|author=Bede|editor-first1=Judith |editor-last1=McClure|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780192838667}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rule of justice and reason suggests that one who desires his own orders to be observed by his successors should undoubtedly keep the will and ordinances of his predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory the Great. ''The Letters of Gregory the Great''. Trans. John R. C. Martyn. 3 vols. (2004). Book VI, Epistle XII.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters, Gregory often emphasized the importance of giving proper deference to last wills and testaments, and of respecting property rights.
* "Compassion should be shown first to the faithful and afterwards to the enemies of the church."&lt;ref&gt;Richards pg 232&lt;/ref&gt;
* "At length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences, I sought the haven of the monastery… For as the vessel that is negligently moored, is very often (when the storm waxes violent) tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore, so under the cloak of the Ecclesiastical office, I found myself plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters, and because I had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession, I learnt by losing it, how closely it should have been held."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Gregory I, ''Moralia, sive Expositio in Job'', published by Nicolaus Kessler Basel, 1496.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Moralia, sive Expositio in Job'' ("Commentary on Job," also known as ''Magna Moralia''), Gregory describes to the Bishop Leander the circumstances under which he became a monk.
* "Illiterate men can contemplate in the lines of a picture what they cannot learn by means of the written word."&lt;ref&gt;Theories of Art: From Plato to Winckelmann&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Age quod agis'' (Do what you are doing).&lt;ref&gt;H. Ev. 2.37.9; Dial. 4.58.1&lt;/ref&gt; Through the centuries, this would become a repeated maxim of Catholic mystics and spiritual directors encouraging one to keep focus on what one is doing in trying to serve the Lord.
*"Repentance is weeping for what one has done and not doing what one weeps for."&lt;ref&gt;H. Ev. 2.34.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==

===Relics===
The relics of Saint Gregory are enshrined in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

===Lives===
In Britain, appreciation for Gregory remained strong even after his death, with him being called ''Gregorius noster'' ("our Gregory") by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The English Pilgrimage to Rome: A Dwelling for the Soul|first=Judith|last=Champ|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|year=2000|isbn=9780852443736|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Britain, at a monastery in [[Whitby Abbey|Whitby]], that the first full length [[hagiography|life]] of Gregory was written, in c. 713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umilta.net/gregory.html|author=A monk or nun at Whitby A.D. 713|editor-first=Julia Bolton |editor-last=Holloway|title=The Earliest Life of St. Gregory the great|date=1997–2008|publisher=Julia Bolton Holloway|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciation of Gregory in Rome and Italy itself, however, did not come until later. The first ''vita'' of Gregory written in Italy was not produced until [[John, deacon of Rome|John the Deacon]] in the 9th century.

===Monuments===
[[File:Tomb of pope Gregorius I.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Saint Gregory at St. Peter's, Rome]]
The namesake church of [[San Gregorio al Celio]] (largely rebuilt from the original edifices during the 17th and
18th centuries) remembers his work. One of the three oratories annexed, the oratory of Saint Silvia, is said to lie over the tomb of Gregory's mother.

In England, Gregory, along with [[Augustine of Canterbury]], is revered as the apostle of the land and the source of the nation's conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Richards pg 260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Italian composer [[Ottorino Respighi]] composed a piece named ''St. Gregory the Great'' ''(San Gregorio Magno)'' that features as the fourth and final part of his '''''Church Windows''''' (''Vetrate di Chiesa'') works, written in 1925.

===Feast day===
The current [[General Roman Calendar]], revised in 1969 as instructed by the [[Second Vatican Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|title=Sacrosanctum concilium|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrates Saint Gregory the Great on 3 September. Before that, it assigned his feast day to 12 March, the day of his death in 604. Following the imposition of [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Code of Rubrics]] in 1961, celebration of Saint Gregory's feast day was made practically impossible, as John XXIII's reforms forbade the full observance of most feasts during Lent, during which 12 March invariably falls. For this reason, Saint Gregory's feast day was moved to 3 September, the day of his episcopal [[consecration]] in 590,&lt;ref&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), pp. 100 and 118&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the liturgical reforms of [[Pope Paul VI]].

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]] continue to commemorate Saint Gregory on 12 March which is during [[Great Lent]], the only time when the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], which names Saint Gregory as its author, is used.

Other churches also honour Saint Gregory: the [[Church of England]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] on 3 September, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] on 12 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/|title=The Calendar|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional [[procession]] is held in [[Żejtun]], [[Malta]], in honour of Saint Gregory (San Girgor) on Easter Wednesday, which most often falls in April, the range of possible dates being 25 March to 28 April.
The feast day of Saint Gregory also serves as a commemorative day for the former pupils of [[Downside School]], called Old Gregorians. Traditionally, OG ties are worn by all of the society's members on this day.

'''Richard Murphy''' [[OBE]] (born 24 April 1955) is an [[architect]] and [[businessman]]. He is the founder and principal architect of Richard Murphy Architects, an [[architectural firm]] operating in [[Edinburgh]]. He is winner of the 2016 RIBA House of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murphy House wins RIBA House of the Year 2016|url=https://www.architecture.com/Awards/Awards2016/HouseoftheYear/RIBAHouseoftheYear2016.aspx|website=www.architecture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wainwright|first1=Oliver|title=House of the Year: a cave of wonders worthy of Wallace and Gromit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/16/house-year-richard-murphy-edinburgh-townhouse-riba-wallace-and-gromit|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Murphy was educated at [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] Universities, and has taught at the latter.&lt;ref name=ArtDaily&gt;Art Daily 31 July 2013
[http://artdaily.com/news/64093/Royal-Scottish-Academy-of-Art---Architecture-celebrates-21-years-of-Richard-Murphy-Architects Press Release: Royal Scottish Academy of Art &amp; Architecture celebrates 21 years of Richard Murphy Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 he formed Edinburgh architectural firm, Richard Murphy Architects, and it has since grown to over twenty architects. In the early years his firm focused on designing extensions to houses and mews conversions however have subsequently diversified onto education, healthcare, the arts and commercial work. They have worked on several [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|UK National Lottery]]-funded buildings.

In 1995 Murphy designed the first of the UK's [[Maggie's centres|Maggie's Centres]], in Edinburgh, which now acts as the administrative headquarters for Maggie's. Designed to aid cancer treatment, the building was designed without any corridors, to avoid an institutional feel.&lt;ref name=healthcaremaggies&gt;{{cite news|title=Maggie's Edinburgh |url=http://www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com/article/maggies-edinburgh |work=Healthcare Design |date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=24 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching at Edinburgh University, he researched the work of the Venetian architect [[Carlo Scarpa]], and later published a book on Scarpa, and later yet presented a [[Channel 4]] documentary on  him.&lt;ref name=ArtDaily/&gt; He also co-wrote "An Architect's Appreciation of Charles Rennie Mackintosh". In 2004 Murphy exhibited at the [[Venice Biennale]]. In 2012, Richard Murphy Architects published a book titled "Of Its Time and of Its Place: The Work of Richard Murphy Architects."

Murphy is a Member of the RIBA, a Fellow of the RIAS, an Academician of the Royal Scottish Academy, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an Honorary Fellow of Napier University. Richard Murphy Architects has also won a total of 20 RIBA Awards.

He was appointed an [[OBE]] in the New Year's Honours January 2007 for services to architecture, the only practising architect on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Murphy receives OBE in New Year's list |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/richard-murphy-receives-obe-in-new-year%E2%80%99s-list/3079330.article |work=[[Building Design]]|date=5 January 2007 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy has held lectures in places such as Scotland, at Edinburgh University, the Student-led 5710 lecture society of [[The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and The Built Environment]], [[Aberdeen]] and Strathclyde University in Glasgow. In 2006 he completed a lecture tour in South Africa, and on 13 March 2012 he gave a conference titled "Architecture of its time and its place" to students at Barcelona Institute of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coollective.org/barcelona/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=April 2015}} Most recently Murphy lectured at the Association of Icelandic Architects in 2015.

He previously completed a modern [[mews]]-style house at Calton Hill near Edinburgh Castle, for his own use, and says he lives "pretty simply".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Home: Richard Murphy, architect |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/property/house-and-home/my-home-richard-murphy-architect-406627.html |work=The Independent |place=London|date=5 July 2006 |accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Richard Murphy completed his own house on Hart Street in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Richard Murphy completes Hart Street [http://www.urbanrealm.com/buildings/998/Murphy_House.html "Murphy House"] [[Urban Realm]]&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Saltire Society Award for Best Single Dwelling New Build &lt;ref&gt;Saltire Society 2015 Award Winners [http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/awards/architecture/2015-awards/ "2015 Awards Announced"] [[The Saltire Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18945">'''Richard Plunkett''' (1788-1832) was a Parish Officer of the Law, variously described as a [[headborough]], [[Beadle#Other uses|beadle]] or night-[[constable]], in [[Whitechapel]], in the [[East End of London]], between 1817 and 1826. His duties were centred upon the Whitechapel watch-house, from which he and his [[Watchman (law enforcement)#Watchmen in England|watchmen]] had to deal with nocturnal criminality in an area of rapidly increasing population, crowded conditions with poor sanitation, and much urban poverty and squalor. Plunkett's term of office just preceded the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]], by which a new system of policing was introduced. Plunkett was often called upon to give evidence at the [[Old Bailey]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Proceedings of the Old Bailey 1674-1913'', [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org Old Bailey online].&lt;/ref&gt; the cases being scheduled for hearings two or three times a year. His testimony and that of his officers in these more serious cases show his relations with the population at large, his investigations, pursuits and arrests, often based on personal knowledge of the offenders. The majority of these cases resulted in convictions leading to [[penal transportation]]. His work illustrates the real activities of the parish police of Whitechapel just over a decade before the writing of ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, ''Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress'' (first book edition, Richard Bentley, London 1838): the arrest in Clerkenwell (Chapters X-XI); Whitechapel and Bethnal Green (Chapters XVIII-XIX, XXI).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background and family==
Richard Plunkett was born, lived and died in Whitechapel. He was a son of Luke Plunkett and Margaret Read, who were married at [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] in January 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of Marriages, P93/CTC1/014 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; From various different homes in the neighbourhood, Luke and Margaret christened their children at [[St Mary Matfelon]], Whitechapel between 1776 (as of Bell Yard) and 1790 (as of Rosemary Lane, now Royal Mint Street).&lt;ref&gt;See an 1860 photograph of the old St Mary Matfelon at [http://www.middlesex-heraldry.org.uk/publications/monographs/mdxchurches/mdxchurches-whitechapelstmary.htm Middlesex Heraldry site].&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was christened in April 1788 as of George Yard in Gunthorpe Street.&lt;ref&gt;St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, Oct 1774-May 1792, P93/MRY1/011 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not much is known about Richard's childhood, but in February 1808, at Christchurch Spitalfields, he married Ann Haffner,&lt;ref&gt;Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of Marriages, P93/CTC1/017 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; the middle of three daughters of Thomas Haffner and his wife Elizabeth Hunt.&lt;ref&gt;Married 10 April 1777: St Dunstan And All Saints, Register of Marriages, P93/DUN/044 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; Haffner lived at No. 2 Union Court, Fashion Street, and Richard Plunkett and his wife lived at No. 3 soon after their marriage. Fashion Street was just north of Keate Street and Thrawl Street, between [[Brick Lane]] and [[Commercial Street, London|Commercial Street]]. Plunkett was at that time clerk of a benefit society based at the Black Dog Inn in Church Street, [[Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green|Bethnal Green]],&lt;ref&gt;See 'Black Dog, Church Street, 101 Bethnal Green Road' [https://pubshistory.com/LondonPubs/BethnalGreen/BlackDog.shtml pubshistory.com].&lt;/ref&gt; under management of Mr Stokes: Haffner, a member of the society, made Plunkett sole executor of his will (dividing his property between his three daughters), proved in June 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Will of Thomas Haffner of Spitalfield, Middlesex (P.C.C. 1811).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and Ann had four children, Richard James (1810), William (1812), Ann (1815) and Caroline (1817), all of whom were christened at St Mary's and survived infancy. Between 1812 and 1817 they were resident in Fieldgate Street, south of the [[Whitechapel Road]].&lt;ref&gt;St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, Jun 1792-Dec 1812, P93/MRY1/012 and (1813-), P93/MRY1/013 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period his sister Mary had her own family. She married William Crowder, a stationer-bookbinder of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], at Christ Church Spitalfields in May 1810,&lt;ref&gt;Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of banns of marriage, P93/CTC1/041 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; and their first two daughters were christened from an address on [[London Wall]]. The next two, Elizabeth (1815) and Sarah (1817), were christened at St Mary Whitechapel as from Fieldgate Street;&lt;ref&gt;St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, P93/MRY1/013 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; later children were christened at the newly-rebuilt [[St Dunstan-in-the-East]], as from [[Mile End Old Town#Governance|Mile End Old Town]], or from [[Ratcliff]].&lt;ref&gt;St Dunstan and All Saints Stepney, Register of Baptisms (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; All lived to be married.

==Plunkett's early cases==
1817 seems to mark the completion of Richard's family-making intentions for the time being, and his first appearance as 'constable of the night' at the [[Old Bailey]] relates to an incident just a month before his youngest daughter's christening. As he stood at the corner of Whitechapel church a 19-year-old man ran past an unemployed servant-girl and snatched the shawl (value 2 shillings) from her shoulders. Plunkett took him in charge, and the miscreant got 7 years' transportation.&lt;ref&gt; Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18170917-168&amp;div=t18170917-168 Soloman Simpson, 17 September 1817].&lt;/ref&gt;

As keeper of the watch-house Plunkett received whatever prisoners the watchmen brought in, and a charge of [[grand larceny]], with the same sentence, was successfully laid against Robert Miles the following April, when apprehended by two watchmen with a quantity of linen stolen from a carrier's wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18180506-87&amp;div=t18180506-87 Robert Miles, 6 May 1818].&lt;/ref&gt; A month later Plunkett made his own arrest of a carpenter's lad carrying home a plank of wood from his workplace at 3.30 a.m. Searching the house, Plunkett found two doors which he had also taken. Here a verdict of Not Guilty was returned, the master having made no complaint.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18180617-141&amp;div=t18180617-141 Daniel Hurley, 17 June 1818].&lt;/ref&gt;

But in September 1818, following the wholesale theft of provisions (casks of butter and honey and a sackful of hams) from a warehouse in Goodman's Fields (an area around Leman Street and Alie Street), Plunkett, having taken one of the thieves prisoner, got information and went to his residence, where he recovered the goods from the man's wife and mother.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18180909-256&amp;div=t18180909-256 Robert Wheelhouse, 9 September 1818].&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time a 15-year-old boy who had stolen a tablecloth and 11 shillings in copper coins from his master, proprietor of an eating-house in Wentworth Street, was made by his father to give himself up to Plunkett. Both criminals were transported for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18180909-285&amp;div=t18180909-285 Alexander Flemming, 9 September 1818].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a classic sting two years later, a young woman invited a printer of [[Coleman Street]], who frequented Whitechapel, back to her house. When he had got into bed and put his [[pocket watch]] under the pillow, she extinguished the light and ran off, and two people came in and ordered him out of the house. Missing his watch the man made Plunkett arrest the girl, but nothing was found. In court Plunkett said he thought the [[Plaintiff|complainant]] was drunk, and remarked that the man had accused him of stealing a [[Pound sterling|pound]] from him when held in charge two nights previously for drunkenness. The girl was found Not Guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18200918-322&amp;div=t18200918-322 Margaret Wall, 18 September 1820].&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in November 1820, a man was invited in by a girl in George Yard, Wentworth Street: once he had paid her something to fetch gin, first the women and then the men of the house robbed his money and possessions and forcibly ejected him, padlocking the door. The man called an officer, who arrested one of the girls (aged 17). Further complaint was made to Plunkett, who (having been born in George Yard) knew the man responsible and arrested him. Both were transported for life.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18201206-141&amp;div=t18201206-141 Sarah Meyers and Emanuel Lyons, 6/15 December 1820].&lt;/ref&gt;

==A dangerous occupation==
Soon afterwards, on 16 January 1821, Plunkett faced a personal challenge. Now living at No. 5 Baker's Row (on the north side of Whitechapel High Street, just east of the [[Workhouse]]: now Vallance Road&lt;ref&gt;See map detail, Whitechapel, in [http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Whitechapel/ The Workhouse, the story of an institution] website.&lt;/ref&gt;), his two sons usually closed the outer shutters of the windows on their return from school, but were delayed. Soon after 5 pm, while taking tea in his back room, he heard a noise and found that two men had broken into his house via the front window, and were moving about in the dark. Discovered, one jumped onto a table and out through the upper part of the sash. The other followed, his [[Gaiters|gaiter]] slipping from Plunkett's grasp. But Plunkett jumped after him, caught him, and gave him into charge of George Brock, who was standing by.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18210214-57&amp;div=t18210214-57 William Haynes and William Harrison, 14 February 1821].&lt;/ref&gt; 

He then chased the other, whom he recognised, up Baker's Row and round the corner into Church Street, where the man appeared nonchalantly in the doorway of a public house. A fight ensued, and Plunkett took him. The two were found guilty of [[Burglary in English law|burglary]] and sentenced to death, but a [[Verdict#Special verdict|special verdict]] was returned pending a decision as to whether the window had been secured.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=o18210912-1-defend2124&amp;div=o18210912-1 Supplementary material: Haynes &amp; Harrison, 12 September 1821].&lt;/ref&gt; (This case established that the pulling down of the sash of a window, though unfastened, constituted a [[Burglary#Common law definition|breaking]] within the definition of "breaking and entering".&lt;ref&gt;'Rex v. William Haines and William Harrison', W.O. Russell and E. Ryan, ''Crown Cases Reserved for Consideration: and Decided by the Twelve Judges of England from the Year 1799 to the Year 1824'' (Joseph Butterworth and Son, London 1825), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BEhfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA451#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 451-52]. (Google)&lt;/ref&gt;) William Haynes and William Harrison were transported for life on the second [[Convict ship|convict voyage]] of the ''[[Asia (1818 ship)|Asia]]'' on 1 April 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Transported convicts - 258, [http://oldbritishnews.com/convicts/index.php/transported_convicts-258/ Old British News website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Crowder, Plunkett's sister, also found herself in the Old Bailey in the winter of 1820-21. She was still living at Greenfield Street, and in mid-February her lodger, who had been with her since mid-December, disappeared owing her 24 shillings.

In June 1821 Plunkett testified in two cases of pocket-picking, one of which had taken him back to George Yard.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, 6 June 1821: [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18210606-166&amp;div=t18210606-166 Robert Lloyd]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18210606-167&amp;div=t18210606-167 Henry Copas].&lt;/ref&gt; In September two women who had accosted a man walking home at 2 a.m. and had taken 27 shillings from him were sentenced to transportation for life.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18210912-159&amp;div=t18210912-159 Catherine Sullivan and Catherine Bryan, 12 September 1821].&lt;/ref&gt; A year later Plunkett and his colleague John Clark went after two women known to them who were accused of stealing a coat and 35 [[Sovereign (English coin)|sovereigns]] from a retired excise-officer in the street, but although the coat was found the court had doubt of their guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18220911-24&amp;div=t18220911-24 Hannah Stanton and Esther Cummins, 11 September 1822].&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day he gave evidence in a case of street robbery (classed as [[highway robbery]] with violence, though the work of a [[footpad]]) which led to a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online,  [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18220911-229&amp;div=t18220911-229 Samuel Greenwood, 11 September 1822].&lt;/ref&gt; Between December 1822 (when on one occasion he held an [[identification parade]]&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18230115-97&amp;div=t18230115-97 Edmund Law and Thomas Webb, 15 January 1823].&lt;/ref&gt;) and February 1825 Plunkett testified in nine other serious cases, mostly resulting in transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online, [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18221204-155&amp;div=t18221204-155 Philip Redman, 4 December 1822]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18221204-173&amp;div=t18221204-173 John Archer and Ann Bradshaw, 4 December 1822]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18230219-137&amp;div=t18230219-137 Daniel Griffiths, 19 February 1823]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18230409-2&amp;div=t18230409-2 Mary Smith, 9 April 1823]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18230409-88&amp;div=t18230409-88 Charles Wasen, 9 April 1823] (see also [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18210912-155&amp;div=t18210912-155 12 September 1821]); [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18240715-92&amp;div=t18240715-92 John Andrews, 15 July 1824]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18240916-137&amp;div=t18240916-137 William Sparks, 16 September 1824]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18250217-100&amp;div=t18250217-100 Thomas Scott, 17 February 1825].&lt;/ref&gt;

==His last cases, and retirement==
It happened that near to his house in Baker's Row stood the premises of Messrs. [[Brocks Fireworks]] factory. On 4 September 1825 two boys were engaged in ramming gunpowder into [[Firecracker|squibs]] when a spark ignited and the boys ran out in fright, throwing the firework aside. Fifty pounds of gunpowder and a large amount of [[saltpetre]] suddenly exploded, blowing the roof off, setting fire to the building, and smashing every pane of glass in most of the adjoining streets. "Females were frightened into [[Hysteria|hysterics]]" (runs the report), but the only serious injury was to Richard Plunkett's sister.&lt;ref&gt;'Dreadful Explosion', [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] (ed.), ''The Examiner'' 1825 (John Hunt, London), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8nMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA566&amp;lpg=PA566 p. 566]. (Google)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1825 a respectable lady, Mrs Byrne, stopped at a house in Leman Street and remonstrated with the owner, an undertaker, who was beating his wife. The man then produced a constable's [[Baton (law enforcement)#History|baton]] and had Mrs Byrne sent to the watch-house as a [[common prostitute]]. Plunkett kept her there for two hours among some rough company, and was about to lock her in a cell when her husband and brother arrived to rescue her. She was vindicated in court, severe criticism was levelled against the watch-houses, and the wife-beating constable was arrested and charged.&lt;ref&gt;'Police - Lambeth Street', ''The Examiner'' 1825 (John Hunt, London), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8nMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA747#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 747]. (Google)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same week a respectable-looking young man was found lying drunk on Whitechapel Road. The watchman took him to the watch-house to sleep it off, but when Plunkett looked in on him at about 4 a.m. he found him weltering in blood, having stabbed himself in the neck with a penknife. With immediate attention he was able to explain that he wished to end his life, and when further recovered was sent home in a [[Cabriolet (carriage)|cab]] under medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;'Accidents, Offences, &amp;c. - Attempted Suicide', ''The Examiner'' 1825 (John Hunt, London), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8nMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA748#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 748]. (Google)&lt;/ref&gt;

These events doubtless contributed to Plunkett's retirement as beadle, and the evidence he gave leading to two further convictions in 1826 are his last recorded in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bailey Online,  [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18260406-85&amp;div=t18260406-85 William Weir, 6 April 1826]; [https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18260622-102&amp;div=t18260622-102 John Peachey, 22 June 1826].&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the firework explosion his occupation is given as "writing ink maker", and in that capacity he took out insurance in December 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. MS 11986/506/1039789 (Guildhall Library/LMA).&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1827 he had become the publican of the Green Man in Castle Street, Whitechapel.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. MS 11936/506/1057848-849 (Guildhall Library/LMA).&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried as from Castle Street at St Mary's Whitechapel on 10 June 1832, aged 44,&lt;ref&gt;St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Burials, 12 June 1832 (London Metropolitan Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps a victim of the [[1829-51 cholera pandemic|cholera epidemic]].&lt;ref&gt;R. McR. Higgins, 'The 1832 cholera epidemic in East London', "East London Record" 2 (1979), [http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/1832chol.html (mernick.org)].&lt;/ref&gt; At her marriage in 1838 his daughter Ann recorded her late father's occupation as "publican".&lt;ref&gt;28 April 1838: Holy Trinity Minories, Register of Marriages, 1837 - 1860, P69/TRI2/A/01/Ms 9246/4 (Guildhall/LMA).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolando V. de la Rosa''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], is the ''Rector Magnificus'' (president) of the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]] in Rome, as of 1 September 2016. 

Formerly, he served as the [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas]] (UST), the oldest and the largest [[Catholic]] university in Asia. A religious leader and a seasoned educator, he was appointed by ''then'' [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] as the Chairman of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=599&amp;Itemid=108 UST Installs Fr.

==Early years and education==
de la Rosa was born on June 27, 1953, in [[Manila]] where he spent his childhood. He completed his basic education courses at the [[Aquinas University]] in Rawis, Legazpi City, studied AB Philosophy and graduated Magna cum Laude from the [[Dominican House of Studies]].&lt;ref name="rosa"/&gt; He also graduated Magna cum Laude from the University of Santo Tomas with a degree in Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1980. He was ordained priest in the [[Dominican Order]] on April 3, 1982.&lt;ref name="rosa"/&gt;

In 1984, Fr. de la Rosa earned his Licentiate in Sacred Theology degree, Magna cum Laude and Master of Arts in Higher Religious Studies, Summa cum Laude, both from UST. In the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in [[Belgium]], he completed the Doctoral degrees graduating Magna cum Laude in two programs: Higher Religious Studies and Sacred Theology in 1988.&lt;ref name="rosa"/&gt;

==Career==
He served his first two terms as Rector of the University of Santo Tomas for eight years, from 1990 to 1998. His aims as rector and president were to develop the university's research capabilities, and expand their outreach programs for community service. He established the Research and Endowment Foundation Incorporated to generate funds to finance continuing research activities in the university. Through this foundation, he was able to generate enough funds to establish the Thomas Aquinas Research Complex that houses today the various research centers in the university as well as the Graduate School. To strengthen and expand the community outreach programs of the university, he established the Office for Community Development which later evolved into the UST SIMBAHAYAN, the umbrella project for all university outreach programs focused on five K's: Karunungan (Knowledge transfer), Kalusugan (Medical missions), Kabuhayan (livelihood projects), Kanlungan (housing projects for the poor and those affected by natural disasters), and Kapayapaan (peace education for communities torn by religious and other conflicts.

As Rector, he became president of the Association of Catholic Universities of the Philippines and a two-time President of the ICUSTA [[International Council of Universities of Saint Thomas Aquinas]]. He was the founding president of the DOMNET (Network of Dominican Schools, Colleges and Universities in the Philippines) in 1995. He was chair of the Organizing Committee of the International Youth Forum for the [[World Youth Day 1995|World Youth Day in 1995]].&lt;ref name="varsi"&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/news/de_la_rosa_elected_rector De la Rosa elected Rector] ''The Varsitarian Website'' May 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He held various positions in the Dominican Province of the Philippines like Master of Novices, Diffinitor of the Provincial Chapter, Provincial Councilor, as well as Rector of the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran#Colegio de San Juan de Letran - Calamba|Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba]].&lt;ref name=mb/&gt;

In 2008, he was again appointed by the Master of the Dominican Order as Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas (2008–2012).&lt;ref name="varsi"/&gt;

He had received numerous awards for his professional and civic achievements, like the National Book Award in History, the Catholic Authors Award, the Outstanding Manilan Award (1995 and 2011), Kyung Hee University (Korea) Medal of Highest Honor, and the 2012 Outstanding CEO Award in Education.

Fr. de la Rosa has written hundreds of articles and scholarly treatises, some of which has been translated into German and French, or anthologized in international publications. His book "Beginnings of the Filipino Dominicans" won the National Book Award in History in 1991.

'''Helen Folasade Adu''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE}} ({{lang-yo|Fọláṣadé Adú}} {{IPA-yo|fɔ̄láʃādé ādú|}}; born 16 January 1959), known professionally as '''Sade Adu''' or simply '''Sade''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|d|eɪ}} {{respell|shah|DAY|'}}), is a British Nigerian singer, songwriter, and actress.

Born in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], Sade gained modest recognition as a fashion designer and part-time model, prior to joining the band Pride in the early 1980s. After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. The band then released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'' a year later, which became one of the best selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. It also gained widespread critical acclaim and is largely considered [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|one of the best albums of all-time]].

Soon after, they released ''[[Promise (Sade album)|Promise]]'' (1985), which was also a resounding critical and commercial success, becoming the band's first album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It later earned quadruple platinum certification in the U.S., and reached platinum across Europe. It also earned the group the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1986. Their following two releases, 1988's ''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'' and 1992's ''[[Love Deluxe]]'', were also critically and commercially successful; however, the band would go on hiatus after the birth of Sade's son, Andes the singer would experience widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of [[Major depressive disorder|mental health]] and [[addiction]] issues.

After a spell of eight years without an album, which came after Sade appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986), the band reunited in 1999, and released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'' in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring more mellow sounds and pop compositions, and was critically praised, earning the group the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. The band would then undergo another term of hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]''. The album was another commercial success, although critical reception remained divided, but won the group the [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].

Sade is widely considered a musical influence, and her contributions to music have made her a global figure in popular culture for over two decades.

==Career==

===1980–84: Beginnings and ''Diamond Life''===

After completing a three-year course work in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist [[Stuart Matthewman]]; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs.&lt;ref name=Background/&gt; Her solo performances of the song "[[Smooth Operator]]" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist [[Paul Denman]] and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times Jan 10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Background&gt;{{cite web|title=Sade|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/sade/biography|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she performed her first show at London's [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door.&lt;ref name="Heaven"/&gt; In May 1983, Sade performed their first US show at the [[Danceteria]] nightclub in New York City. On 18 October 1983, Sade Adu signed with Epic Records, while the rest of the band signed in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Sade/+wiki|title=Sade|work=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the record deal, the group began recording their debut album, ''[[Diamond Life]],'' which took six weeks to record and was recorded entirely at The Power Plant in London.&lt;ref name=Recording&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/key-tracks-sade-diamond-life|title=Recording|publisher=Red Bull Music Academy|date=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diamond Life'' was released on 16 July 1984, reached number two in the [[UK Album Chart]], sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK, and won the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Album in 1985.&lt;ref name="Brits"&gt;{{cite web|title=The BRITs 1985|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1985|website=BRIT Awards|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the US, where it has sold in excess of four million copies. ''Diamond Life'' had international sales of over six million copies, becoming one of the top-selling debut recordings of the '80s, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist.&lt;ref name="Background"/&gt;

"[[Your Love Is King]]" was released as the album's lead single on 25 February 1984 and was a success in European territories, charting at number seven in Ireland and number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=The Irish Charts |accessdate=2009-01-08 |work=[[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/21427/sade/|title=Official Charts – Sade – Your Love Is King|accessdate=2 September 2015|work=Official Charts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was less successful in the US, where it peaked at number 54 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hot 100 Singles – Your Love Is King|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=billboard+100+%22your+love+is+king%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kF_0QDg1KM&amp;sig=M8ffdUSZSC7m8IzuZCFmyyngABk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBWoVChMI75rdp-DXxwIVCpINCh1emw7Z#v=onepage&amp;q=billboard%20100%20%22your%20love%20is%20king%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 September 2015|work=Billboard|date=27 Jul 1985|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third single, "[[Smooth Operator]]", was released on 15 September 1984 and became the most successful song in the US from the album ''Diamond Life''.

===1985–2000: Continued success and first hiatus===

In 1986, Sade made her acting debut in ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'', a film adapted from the [[Colin MacInnes]] book of the [[Absolute Beginners (novel)|same name]] about life in late-1950s [[London]].

To promote the album, Sade and the band embarked on their fifth concert tour entitled [[Lovers Rock Tour]]. The tour was announced via the band's website in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |title=Sade Sets North American Tour Dates|last=Reimer|first=Courtney |date=18 April 2001 |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |accessdate=15 September 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1347773500UBKWBFLTNQ?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |archivedate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement stated the tour would begin in the summer of 2001 with 30 shows. Initial dates were rescheduled due to extended rehearsal time. The shows sold well, with many stops adding additional shows. In August 2001, the tour was extended by eight weeks due to ticket demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |title=Sade Adds More Dates to U.S. Tour |last=Zahlaway|first=Jon |date=7 August 2001 |work=LiveDaily |publisher=Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=15 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127043131/http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |archivedate=27 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deemed by many critics as a comeback tour, it marked the band's first performances since 1994 and took place in 2001. Although many believed the trek would expand to other countries, this did not occur. With over 40 shows, it became the 13th biggest tour in North America, earning over 26 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467839/sade-the-billboard-cover-story |title=Sade: The Billboard Cover Story |last=Peters|first=Mitchell |date=19 August 2011 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tour, the band released their first [[live album]], ''[[Lovers Live]]'' on 5 February 2002 by [[Epic Records]]. ''Lovers Live'' reached number ten on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 51 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], the band's first album to miss the top twenty in the UK.

Following the release of ''Lovers Rock'', Sade took a ten-year hiatus, during which she raised her son and moved to the Caribbean. During this time, she made a rare public appearance for an award ceremony that took place in 2002 to accept an [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) at [[Buckingham Palace]] for services to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masson|first1=Gordon|title=Queen Elizabeth Honors Bee Gees, Sade, Betancourt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=%22British+Phonographic%22+sade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q-7tt_jQ2Z&amp;sig=w1OS2PSHEXf5iWdMc7xToNTIvw0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwjuze_Y6-fHAhUMmYAKHVPHDSw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22British%20Phonographic%22%20sade&amp;f=false|work=Billboard|date=12 January 2002|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]] album, ''[[Red Hot + Riot]]'', a compilation CD in tribute to the music of fellow Nigerian musician, [[Fela Kuti]].

The band's sixth studio album, ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]'', was released worldwide on 8 February 2010 and was the most recent album in ten years to contain new material.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Upon release, the album received positive reviews and became a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/soldier-of-love/sade/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Soldier Of Love|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard''&amp;nbsp;200]] in the United States with first-week sales of 502,000 copies. ''Soldier of Love'' became the band's first album to debut at number-one and the band's second album to peak at number-one on the chart. The album also had the best sales week by a group since Australian band [[AC/DC]] released their album ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'' and entered the ''Billboard'' 200 at number-one in November 2008.&lt;ref name=Caulfield&gt;{{cite web |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959357/sades-soldier-sizzles-at-no-1-on-billboard-200 |title=Sade's 'Soldier' Sizzles At No. 1 On Billboard 200 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the band became the act with the longest hiatus between number-one albums, as the band's ''Promise'' (1985) and ''Soldier of Love'' were separated by 24 years, 10 months and 2 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Rauly|title=Toni Braxton &amp; Babyface’s Triumphant No. 1 Return to Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5908250/toni-braxton-babyfaces-triumphant-no-1-return-to-top-rbhip-hop-albums|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=Billboard|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, she (and the reunited [[Sade (band)|band that also bears her name]]) released the acoustic ballad "[[Flower of the Universe]]" for the soundtrack to the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle In Time]]''. About asking Sade to contribute to the album, director [[Ava DuVernay]] wrote "I never thought she'd say yes, but asked anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-w517506|title=Hear Sade's First New Song in Seven Years|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Sade released "The Big Unknown" for the soundtrack to the [[20th Century Fox]] film ''[[Widows (2018 film)|Widows]]''. That film's director, [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]] stated that Sade agreed to write the song for the film, because "the original series of ''Widows'' had deeply resonated with her."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sade-new-song-the-big-unknown-754481/ Hear Sade’s New ‘Widows’ Song ‘The Big Unknown’]&lt;/ref&gt; The successor to ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]'' is in the works.&lt;ref&gt;https://ratedrnb.com/2018/07/exclusive-sades-longtime-collaborator-says-shes-working-on-new-album/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and impact==
''[[The New Yorker]]'' described Sade's voice as a "grainy [[contralto]] full of air that betrays a slight ache but no agony, and values even imperfect dignity over a show of pain", a "deeply English" quality that makes categorizing the artist's voice difficult.&lt;ref name="Frere-Jones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|title=The Long War|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/the-long-war|accessdate=30 August 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice was described by the [[BBC]] as "husky and restrained" and compared to singer [[Billie Holiday]]. BBC called her songwriting "sufficiently soulful and jazzy yet poppy, funky yet easy listening, to appeal to fans of all those genres."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Paul|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/4qvh|date=2010|title=BBC – Music – Review of Sade – Diamond Life|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sade has been called a "pop star".&lt;ref name="Frere-Jones"/&gt; With the musicians in her band, Sade, ''The New Yorker'' wrote, "created one of the most profitable catalogues in pop"; the band's "easy" sound backing songs "exploring the heavier lifting inside love: commitment, consistency, friendship."&lt;ref name="Frere-Jones"/&gt; Her success has been attributed to a combination of her unique beauty, seemingly indefinable origins, and mysterious persona.&lt;ref name="Frere-Jones"/&gt;

Sade's work has influenced and been recognized by many singers and hip hop artists. Rapper [[Rakim]] of [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]] stated he grew up listening to Sade's music and was influenced by her voice and style. Rakim has also referenced Sade's song "Smooth Operator" in his rap song "[[Paid in Full (Eric B. &amp; Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]" (1987).&lt;ref name="vulture.com"/&gt; [[Talib Kweli]] stated he learned about precision from Sade due to her performance of ''Love Deluxe'' in its entirety at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="vulture.com"/&gt;  Rapper [[Missy Elliott]] cited Sade's performance of "Smooth Operator" as one of her favourites. Hip hop group [[Souls of Mischief]] stated they grew up listening to Sade's music.&lt;ref name="vulture.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/sade_memories_from_missy_ellio.html|title=Why Rappers Love Sade – Vulture|last=Barshad|first=Amos|work=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop group [[Tanya Morgan]] also described Sade as one of their favorite artists.&lt;ref name="vulture.com"/&gt; Other rappers to recognize Sade include the former rap-duo of [[Clipse]] – [[No Malice|Malice]] and [[Pusha T|Pusha]].&lt;ref name="vulture.com"/&gt; In reaction to the newly released album ''Soldier of Love'', rapper [[Kanye West]] wrote, "This is why i still have a blog. To be a part of moments like this ... new Sade ... How much better this ... than everything else?".&lt;ref name="vulture.com"/&gt; Rapper [[Rick Ross]] stated in an interview that "People may know my infatuation with Sade. There's never been a bad Sade track. I love all different sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Kyle|title=Rick Ross on Chanting 2 Live Crew on the Playground – And the First Time He Fell in Love With a Stripper|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/12/15/rick-ross-hood-billionaire-strippers|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American singer [[Beyoncé]] called Sade's music a "true friend" and an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kvil.cbslocal.com/2012/04/06/beyonc-shares-personal-family-photos-thanks-sade-on-new-website/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104852/http://kvil.cbslocal.com/2012/04/06/beyonc-shares-personal-family-photos-thanks-sade-on-new-website/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-22|title=Beyoncé Shares Personal Family Photos, Thanks Sade On New Website|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late singer [[Aaliyah]] said that she admired Sade because "she stays true to her style no matter what... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer... and I absolutely love her."&lt;ref name="Aaliyah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutherland|first1=William|title=Aaliyah Remembered|date=2005|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781412050623|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; American R&amp;B singer [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] has cited Sade as one of her major vocal influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Up Close &amp; Personal with Brandy 3/4|work=TrueExclusives at TrueExclusives.com|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCkxM5XDdM&amp;feature=related|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kelly Rowland]] stated she is inspired by Sade Adu and says that "she has a style that's totally her own."&lt;ref name="Inspirations"&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20044981,00.html|title=The Making of Kelly Rowland|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peake|first=Mike|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1201648/Kelly-Rowland-Michael-Jackson-Britney-Spears-comeback.html|title=Kelly Rowland on Michael Jackson and Britney Spears' comeback|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]]|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=10 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frank Cooper's.jpg|thumb|Oxford Marlamade, originally made by Sarah Cooper.]]

'''Sarah Jane Cooper''' (1848–1932) was an English [[marmalade]] maker and wife of [[Frank Cooper's#History|Frank Cooper]] (1844–1927).

Sarah Cooper was born Sarah Jane Gill in [[Beoley]], [[Worcestershire]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=Plaque&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/cooper.html|title=Sarah-Jane Cooper (1848–1932) |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board]] |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 she got married in [[Clifton, Bristol]] to Frank Cooper of [[Oxford]] and they made their home at 31 [[Kingston Road, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Plaque/&gt;

In 1867 Frank had inherited the family [[grocer]]y shop at 84 [[High Street, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Headington83&gt;{{cite web |last=Jenkins |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/high/tour/south/084.html |title=The High, Oxford: No 84 |work=Oxford History |publisher=Headington, Oxford |accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Frank expanded the business into 83 High Street next door, and the Coopers gave up their house in Kingston Road to live over the shop. Sarah, then aged 24, made {{convert|76|lb|kg}} of marmalade to her own recipe.&lt;ref name=Headington83/&gt; The marmalade became a regular product of Frank Cooper's business, being made behind the shop until 1903 when he moved production to a new purpose-built factory at 27 [[Park End Street]].&lt;ref name=Woolley91&gt;Woolley, 2010, page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Cooper's business was taken over in 1964 and production left Oxford in 1967.&lt;ref name=Woolley94&gt;Woolley, 2010, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; However, its marmalades and jams remain in production as a brand of [[Premier Foods]], which continues to call its leading Frank Cooper's product "Oxford" Marmalade. Since 2001, 84 High Street has been marked by an [[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board#Blue plaques in the City of Oxford|Oxfordshire Blue Plaque]] commemorating Sarah Cooper's achievement.&lt;ref name="Plaque"/&gt;

'''Sarumathi "Saru" Jayaraman''' (born April 3, 1975) is an [[United States|American]] attorney, author, and activist from [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. She is an advocate for restaurant workers in the (San Francisco) Bay Area and co-founder of the non-profit public service organization [[Restaurant Opportunities Centers United]].

== Early life ==
Born in 1975, Jayaraman was raised in a primarily Chicano neighborhood in [[Whittier, California]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jamesbeard.org/content/2015-leadership-award-honoree-saru-jayaraman|title=James Beard Foundation|website=James Beard Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents emigrated from India to the United States when her father was seeking work as a software engineer. They settled in the Los Angeles area, but Jayaraman's father lost his job when she was a teenager.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She was made aware of her class and race at a young age. Her family frequently endured racial slurs and insults. One incident from her childhood occurred when many mechanics refused to service her family's car when it broke down while they were road tripping across Utah.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Activist-at-vanguard-of-restaurant-workers-rights-5135081.php|title=Activist at vanguard of restaurant workers' rights|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher education ==
Jayaraman was accepted to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at the age of sixteen, but her parents wanted her to stay close to home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/business/an-outspoken-force-to-give-food-workers-a-seat-at-the-table.html|title=An Outspoken Force to Give Food Workers a Seat at the Table|last=Gelles|first=David|date=2016-02-20|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen-year-old Jayaraman attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] instead, where she earned her B.A. in International Development Studies and Political Science and graduated summa cum laude in 1995. She continued her education at [[Yale Law School]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School of Government]]. In 2000, Jayaraman was admitted to the State Bars in California and New York.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/cv/Saru_Jayaraman_CV.pdf|title=Saru Jayaraman|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at Yale, Jayaraman studied under [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]] Fellowship winner, [[Jennifer Gordon]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jayaraman was hired at Gordon's organization, the Workplace Project, where she dealt with training and organizing mistreated Latino immigrant workers to become their own advocates in instances of labor abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== ROC United ==

After [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], thousands of workers from the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] were left jobless.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Rinku with Mamdouh, Fekkak. The Accidental American: Immigration and Citizenship in the Age of Globalization. San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant at the top of the World Trade was named [[Windows on the World]]. Jayaraman worked in partnership with Fekkak Mamdouh, the former chief server of Windows, to represent the displaced workers. The organization Jayaraman and Mamdouh founded together was named the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York. Although it was originally established to help those affected by 9/11, the ROC evolved and became an organizing center for all immigrant restaurant workers in New York.

==Career==
Nader has conducted research in hormonal activity, neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology, on the medical role of the neurotransmitter and on the relationship between age, behavior, diet, seasonal influences and mood.&lt;ref name="Mentality"/&gt; Nader reports that his desire to have a complete understanding of the mind and body and its relationship to consciousness and the human physiology, led him to a "spiritual awakening" and the study of Vedic Science with the Maharishi.&lt;ref name = "India Post"/&gt; Nader said he learned about "the field of spiritual or non-physical, or non-material and how it expresses itself in the universe" from the Maharishi.&lt;ref name = "IndiaWest"/&gt; As a professor and director, Nader has conducted [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health]] programs and lectured in "more than 50 countries".&lt;ref name="Mentality"/&gt;

In 1986 Nader was criticized for overstating his post-graduate connections to MIT and implying that his research was sanctioned by his alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Susan (October 2, 1991) [https://archive.is/20120722112514/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/69030511.html?dids=69030511:69030511&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+02,+1991&amp;author=SUSAN+BRINK&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=Journal+charges+doc+with+interest+conflict&amp;pqatl=google] Journal charges doc with interest conflict. ''Boston Herald'', p. 9. "The journal also found that others connected with the business, including Dr. Tony Nader, overstated their ties to prestigious institutions, such as Harvard, MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital. Nader was asked in a 1986 letter by Dr. Richard Wurtman of MIT not to imply that Nader's 'low-grade kind of investigation' is sanctioned by MIT."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Nader worked at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Coffee, No Booze, No Smoking, No Steaks – But Lots Of Oil|first=Curtis|last=Wilkie|work=The Boston Globe|date=December 13, 1987|page=12}}"After morning treatment, have a final consultation with Chopra's associate, Dr. Nader."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 book ''Human Physiology: Expression of Veda and the Vedic Literature'', Nader postulated a one-to-one correlation of structure and function between 40 aspects of Vedic literature and 40 parts of human physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Raval, Indravan B. (2001) "Non-Traditional Interpretation of 'Anarthaka Hi Mantrah' ''Journal of the Oriental Institute'', Vol. 50, Nos. 1–4, Sept. – June 2001, pp. 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Vedas' influence on human anatomy proved|work=The Hindu |location=Chennai |date=January 30, 1997|page=1|first=Ian|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he discovered similarities between the astrological influence of the planets and parts of the human brain. This body of work is reported to have been "derived from" the Maharishi's ideas, and Nader's own training in brain physiology. In May 1995, Nader was a keynote speaker at [[Maharishi University of Management]] and presented his "recent discovery of how Natural Law manages the physiology, and the application of this knowledge to prevent and eliminate problems."&lt;ref&gt;(1995) ''The Economist'', Vol. 335, Issues 1713–7916, "Keynote speaker Tony Nader, MD, Ph.D., will present his recent discovery of how Natural Law manages the physiology, and the application of this knowledge to prevent and eliminate problems in all areas of management."&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been described as an attempt at documenting the scientific basis of the Maharishi's "interpretation of Advaita Vedanta and thus the Vedas … by relating neuroanatomy and neurophysiology to Vedic astrology and philosophy".&lt;ref name="Mentality"/&gt;

According to a press release, Nader was recognized for his "scientific discovery" in 1998, when he was awarded his weight in gold by Maharishi Vedic University of Holland, "with the support of the Maharishi Global Development Fund". The gold was reportedly given to Nader as a scientific award to support his continued research.&lt;ref name ="Endurance"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 9780262050791| last = Easterling| first = Keller| title = Enduring innocence| date = November 1, 2005|page= 82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQN2Fpyxku8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Enduring+innocence+%22tony+nader%22+gold&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Natural Law Party: Opening a new highway for perfection in life|publisher=M2 Presswire|location=Coventry|date=February 6, 1998|url=http://www.natural-law-party.org.uk/pressreleases/UK-19980206-Tony-Nader-receives-his-weight-in-gold.htm|archivedate=September 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5snPYyU2X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nader performed the first research on [[Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology]] (MVVT), which aims "to enliven the inner intelligence of the body and restore proper functioning" through the use of Vedic sounds.

During a four-day Vedic ceremony in October 2000, Nader was honored by Maharishi as [[Maharaja]] (great king) Adhiraj Rajaraam and given responsibility for the Global Country of World Peace and, in 2008, became the Maharishi's successor.&lt;ref name = "India Post"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mou.org/mou/overview/raja_nader_ram/index.html |title=Coronation of Vishwa Prashasak Raja Raam|accessdate=January 18, 2010|publisher=Maharishi Open University |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020705202507/http://www.mou.org/mou/overview/raja_nader_ram/index.html |archivedate = July 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these transitions, Nader was reportedly given various titles including "Vishwa Prashasak Raja Raam", "Adhi Raam", and "Raja Nader Raam".&lt;ref name="Rediff"&gt;Pradhan, Sharat (February 11, 2008) [http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/feb/11maha.htm Allahabad: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi cremated] Rediff India Abroad, retrieved April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reddy|first1=Kumuda|last2=Egenes|first2=Thomas|last3=Egenes|first3 = Linda | title = All Love Flows to the Self: Eternal Stories from the Upanishads | year =1999  | publisher = Samhita Productions | isbn = 978-1-929297-05-4 |page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "abley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(February 12, 2008) [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-02-11/india/27772046_1_maharishi-mahesh-yogi-tony-nader-maharajadhiraj-raja-ram Maharishi's ashes immersed in Sangam], ''Times of India'', New Delhi, "the disciples of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on Sunday formally 'crowned' Tony Nader of Lebanon as his successor.

'''Tracy Jordan''' is a [[fictional character]] in the American television series ''[[30 Rock]]'', played by the actor [[Tracy Morgan]]. The character is a [[movie star]] whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In the episode "Grandmentor", Jordan refers to himself as "Tracy Morgan". In 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list!|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012|author=Adam B. Vary|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his portrayal of Jordan, [[Tracy Morgan]] has received one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination, two [[Image Awards]] nominations, and seven [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations, winning one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracy Morgan Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0605079/awards?ref_=nm_awd|website=imdb.com|publisher=IMDb.com Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Tracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive [[Jack Donaghy]] forces writer [[Liz Lemon]] to hire Jordan as the new star of her [[sketch comedy]] program ''The Girlie Show'' in [[Pilot (30 Rock)|the pilot episode]] of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show ''TGS with Tracy Jordan,'' much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring ''TGS'' role and other performances and ventures.

==Character history==
Jordan is a descendant of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and slave [[Sally Hemings]].&lt;ref name="fireworks"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Fireworks|episodelink=Fireworks (30 Rock)|series=30 Rock|serieslink=30 Rock|credits=Writers: [[Brett Baer]] and [[Dave Finkel]]|network=[[NBC]]|location=[[New York City]]|airdate=2007-04-05|season=1|number=18|minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan was born in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with ''[[The Girlie Show (fictional show)|TGS]]'' Co-star [[Jenna Maroney]] in the March 5, 2009 episode "Goodbye, My Friend". Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in [[The Bronx]], though many of his claims about it sound fictitious.
As a child, Jordan was a cast member on the [[Nickelodeon (TV Channel)|Nickelodeon]] show ''Ray Ray's Mystery Garage''. He also claims to have attended middle school in an [[Exxon]] station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of [[Frank Lucas (drug lord)|Frank Lucas]] [[High school (North America)|High School]] over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time [[Street performance|busking]] as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing [[stand-up]] at the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Head and the Hair|episodelink=The Head and the Hair (30 Rock)|series=30 Rock|serieslink=30 Rock|credits=Writers: [[Tina Fey]] and [[John Riggi]]|network=[[NBC]]|location=[[New York City]]|airdate=2007-01-18|season=1|number=11|minutes=5:11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jordan did a [[Christmas]] [[album]] in 1998 and is a big fan of [[Pat Benatar]]. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in ''[[Ebony Magazine]]'' called "Musings". He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.

==Character traits==
Jordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in "[[Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning]]", Tracy says, "Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'." He aspires to own an island.
Jordan is treated for a mental health disorder by [[Dr. Leo Spaceman]], a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as "erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments." He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice ("[[Future Husband]]"), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]] who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires. 
Despite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in "[[The Aftermath (30 Rock)|The Aftermath]]" that "Superman does ''good'', you're doing ''well''") and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of [[African American]]s. Tracy has an interest in [[American Revolution]]ary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In "[[Corporate Crush]]", while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz "You're my [[Alexander Hamilton]]!" In "[[Winter Madness]]" he argues with several [[Freedom Trail]] historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of [[Crispus Attucks]]' death.

Jordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in "[[The Natural Order]]" to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.

Tracy and his wife [[List of 30 Rock characters#Angie Jordan|Angie]] have been married since 1991. They like to [[sexual roleplaying|roleplay]], including [[rape fantasy|'playing rape']], when he wears a [[ski mask]]. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child "who got the biggest [[penis|ding-dong]]".
With Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.

Although he "parties with women to keep up his rap credentials," Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to [[Jack Donaghy]] in "[[The Ones (30 Rock)|The Ones]]" that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in "[[Don Geiss, America and Hope|Don Geiss, America, and Hope]]" when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the [[Tiger Woods]] infidelity scandal of 2009.

Tracy spent most of his childhood in [[foster care]]. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in "[[The Moms]]" he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In "[[Nothing Left to Lose (30 Rock)|Nothing Left to Lose]]," Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.

===With Liz===
Tracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, "Too late, Liz Lemon!" Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her "LL", following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.

===With his entourage and friends===
Jordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate [[List of 30 Rock characters#Grizz|Grizz]] and professional entourage member [[List of 30 Rock characters#Dot Com|Dot Com]].  Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page [[Kenneth Parcell]], who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage.  Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan.  Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth.  He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are.  For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed ("[[The Bubble (30 Rock)|The Bubble]]").  Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).

===With Jenna===
Jordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America ("[[Believe in the Stars]]"). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both "special people".  There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.

==Jordan's life==

===Career===
Jordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.

===Politics===
Jordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing [[Barack Obama]] because, "...we support [Dennis] [[Dennis Kucinich|Kucinich]]." In the [[2008 US Presidential Election]], Jordan voted for [[Ralph Nader]].

===Religion===
Jordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In "[[The Ones (30 Rock)|The Ones]]," when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fiancée Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to "Jesus in the wilderness," before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and "the Wilderness" is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled "[[Werewolf]] [[Bar Mitzvah]]", which he recorded for [[Geffen Records]]. The lyrics include "Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!" He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, "Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuely (referring most likely to [[Shmuly Boteach]]) about this."

===Finances===
Despite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes $300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.

==Trivia==
In Tina Fey's original pilot script for ''30 Rock'', Jordan was called "Lawrence Jordan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/30_Rock/30_Rock_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030222006/http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/30_Rock/30_Rock_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf |date=October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deramas.
He had a cameo in the film ''[[Bromance: My Brother's Romance]]'' in 2013. He made another movie called ''[[Girl, Boy, Bakla, Tomboy]].'' In 2014, [[Star Cinema]] released a movie called ''[[The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin]]'' an official entry for the MMFF 2014.

'''Wilber Brotherton Huston''' (October 2, 1912 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] scientist and [[NASA]] mission director.  He was the Deputy Project Manager of the [[Nimbus program]] and served as mission director for seven satellite launches.  At the age of sixteen he had won the first [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] Scholarship Contest.

==Biography==
Huston was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the first child of the Reverend [[Simeon Arthur Huston|S. Arthur Huston]], [[curate]] at [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit|St. Paul's Cathedral]], and the former Dorothea J. Brotherton.  His parents named him for [[Wilber Brotherton]], his maternal grandfather, who was the manager of the Detroit operations of the [[Jerome B. Rice Seed Company]].  The ''Wilber'' spelling, instead of ''Wilbur'', derived from admiration for [[William Wilberforce]], the English [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]].  His maternal grandmother was [[Belle Brotherton]], a leader in the [[women's suffrage]] movement.

Between 1913 and 1925 Huston, as a minister's son, lived in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  In 1925, when his father was [[consecration|consecrated]] as [[Bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Olympia]], his family settled in [[Seattle, Washington]], and Huston enrolled at [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside School]] from which he graduated in 1929.

Early in 1929 [[Thomas Edison]] called a [[news conference]] to announce a national [[competition|contest]] with the winner to receive an all-expenses-paid [[scholarship]] to the [[university]] of his choice.  The [[Governor#United States|governor]] of each [[U.S. state|state]] and the commissioners of the [[District of Columbia]] were to select a [[high school]] [[Twelfth grade|senior]] to represent their jurisdiction that August at [[Edison National Historic Site|Edison Laboratories]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]].  Besides Edison, the judges would be [[Henry Ford]], [[Harvey Firestone]], [[George Eastman]], [[Abrahamn De Mallie]], [[Samuel Wesley Stratton|Samuel Stratton]], [[Lewis Perry]] (the [[Principal (school)|principal]] of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]), and [[Charles Lindbergh]].

Huston's maternal grandfather wrote to his father saying that the contest would be an excellent opportunity.  Huston submitted a letter of application, his [[high school]] transcript, and three letters of recommendation.  In due course [[Governor#United States|Governor]] [[Roland H. Hartley]] announced that he had selected Huston and four others to travel to the state capital at their own expense for further screening.  In [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] the candidates took a written examination and submitted to interviews.  After a [[caucus]] the examiners recommended that Huston represent [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

In August 1929 Huston was in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], to compete for the Edison scholarship.  He finished in a five-way tie for first place; the tie was broken by interviews with the judges.

Huston entered [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the fall of 1929 and graduated in June 1933
with an [[Bachelor of Science|S.B.]] degree in [[physics]].  
Following graduation he accepted a position at [[Calibron]], a small research company founded by [[Theodore Edison]], the inventor's youngest son.

In the late 1930s Huston became interested in the [[Moral Re-Armament]] movement and left Calibron to accept a full-time position under [[Frank N. D. Buchman|Frank Buchman]].

As a volunteer religious worker Huston was deferred from the draft until 1943.  From that year until late 1944 he served in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] training [[bomber]] crews in [[celestial navigation]] before they went overseas.

In November 1944 the Army transferred Huston to the [[Civilian Reserve Corps]] at the [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], where he worked as an aeronautical research scientist for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].  Following his discharge he accepted a [[Civil service#The United States civil service|civil service]] position with [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] at [[Langley Research Center|Langley]].

On July 29, 1958, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] became reconstituted as the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] with [[Project Mercury]] initially at [[Langley Research Center|Langley]].  Huston provided training for the Mercury [[astronauts]] in [[celestial navigation]].

In 1961 Huston accepted an invitation to transfer to the newly opened [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] to work on the [[Nimbus program]].  As deputy project manager he served as Mission Director for the successful launches of Nimbus 1, launched August 28,
1964, Nimbus 2 on May 15, 1966, Nimbus 3 on May 14, 1969, Nimbus 4 on April 8, 1970, Landsat 1 on 
July 23, 1972, and Nimbus 5 on December 11, 1972.  A Nimbus satellite launched in 1968 failed to reach orbit.

Huston retired from [[NASA]] in 1975 and immediately took a position with OAO Corporation, later part of 
[[Lockheed Martin Information Technology]].  In 1983 he retired from OAO and became [[Self-employment|self-employed]] until 
1988 when he retired for a third and final time.

On September 21, 1946, Huston had married Dorothy E. Beadle (1922 &amp;ndash; 1996), a [[mathematician]] 
at [[Langley Research Center]].  They were the parents of six children, five of whom survived them.

Huston died in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona]], and is buried at 
[[Holy Trinity Episcopal Church (Bowie, Maryland)|Holy Trinity Episcopal Church]] 
in [[Bowie, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilber Huston, 93, Dies; 'Brightest Boy' in 1929 |quote=Wilber B. Huston, whose selection by Thomas A.

'''William Brooke O'Shaughnessy''' (from 1861 as '''William O'Shaughnessy Brooke''') MD [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (October 1809, [[Limerick]], Ireland – 8 January 1889,&lt;ref name=ghose&gt;{{cite journal| title=William O'Shaughnessy - an innovator and entrepreneur| author=Ghose, Saroj| journal=Indian Journal of History of Science| volume=29| issue=1| year=1994| pages= 9–22|url=http://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_2_SGhose.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southsea, England) was an Irish physician famous for his wide-ranging scientific work in pharmacology, chemistry, and inventions related to [[telegraphy]] and its use in India.  His medical research led to the development of [[intravenous therapy]] and introduced the [[medical cannabis|therapeutic use]] of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' to Western medicine.

==Early life==
O'Shaughnessy was born at Limerick in 1809 to Daniel O'Shaughnessy and Sarah Boswell. Many in the family were clergymen, an uncle was the Dean of Ennis and a great uncle the Roman Catholic Bishop of Killaloe. William studied briefly at Trinity College, Dublin matriculating in 1825 but moved to Scotland before graduating. O'Shaughnessy studied [[forensic toxicology]] and [[chemistry]] in Scotland, and graduated in 1829 with an MD from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]]. In 1829 he was a clinical assistant of [[William Alison]]. In 1831, at the age of 22, as a result of his analysis of the blood of cholera victims, O'Shaughnessy laid the foundation, along with [[Thomas Latta|Thomas Aitchison Latta]], for what was to become [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid and electrolyte-replacement therapy]] in the treatment of cholera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moon, J. B. |year=1967|title=Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy: The foundations of fluid therapy and the Indian telegraph service| journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=276|issue=5|pages=283–284|doi=10.1056/NEJM196702022760509}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy analyzed the urine and blood of cholera patients and came to the conclusion that oxygen in the blood could reverse the actions. He found the blood deficient in water, salt, and "free alkali" and suggested that injecting salts would help. The method used by O'Shaughnessy on a dog and was developed further by Latta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rylah, Lindsey T.

Mikuriya|Mikuriya, Tod H., MD]], Marijuana Medical Papers, 1839-1972&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Shaughnessy failed to obtain a position Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of London and his first marriage forced him to join the service of the [[British East India Company]] on 8 August 1833 and he moved to [[Calcutta]], remaining in [[India]] and serving initially at Gyah and Cuttack before joining the 72nd Bengal Native Infantry. He joined the 10th Regiment Bengal Light Cavalry in 1835 and was an assistant to the Opium Agent in Bihar till 5 August 1835 when he became Professor of the [[Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata|medical college]] in Calcutta. He served on the committee of the Materia Medica until 1840 and later was Chemical Examiner to the government. As chemical examiner he developed methods for forensic studies for detecting arsenic poisoning as well as botanical toxins (such as from ''[[Plumbago]]'' used as an abortifacient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, F.R.S.

==Work in India==
[[File:W_B_OShaughnessy.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Colesworthey Grant]]]]
His first stint in India was marked by work in the subjects of botanical pharmacology, chemistry, [[galvanization|galvanic electricity]], and underwater [[electrical conduction|conduction]], among others. He worked on modifications to the Daniell cell and the use of tanned leather semi-permeable membranes in them. He identified the use of zinc to reduce the rusting of iron before the process of galvanizing had been established. O'Shaughnessy also analyzed the gun-cotton developed by [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] and recognized the role of nitrogen and correctly identified the role of sulphuric acid in removing water from the cotton. He also developed a silver chloride electrode&lt;ref name=gorman /&gt; and experimented on adding colour tones to the Daguerre photographic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=G.|date=1986-04-01|title=O'Shaughnessy's experiments in colour photography|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03087298.1986.10443104|journal=History of Photography|volume=10|issue=2|pages=169–170|doi=10.1080/03087298.1986.10443104|issn=0308-7298}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Calcutta]], he was a member of the [[Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta]], where he published one of his first papers on medical applications of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Shaughnessy, W.B. | title=Case of Tetanus, Cured by a Preparation of Hemp (the Cannabis indica.)| journal=Transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Bengal| volume= 8|year=1838–40|pages= 462–469}}&lt;/ref&gt; He validated folk uses of cannabis in India, discovered new applications, and ultimately recommended cannabis for a great variety of therapeutic purposes. O'Shaughnessy established his reputation by successfully relieving the pain of rheumatism and stilling the convulsions of an infant with cannabis. He eventually popularized its use back in England. His most famous success came when he quelled the wrenching muscle spasm of tetanus and rabies with resin. While he could not cure tetanus, he observed that the cannabis mixture reduced their symptoms of [[spasticity]] and their suffering. In 1837 he published his independent design of an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= O'Shaughnessy, W.B. |title=On the employment of the Electromagnet...| journal=Journal of the Calcutta Medical and Physical Society| volume=1| year=1837| pages=27–40, 108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gorman, Mel| journal= Technology and Culture| volume=9 | issue=2| year=1968| pages= 184–190| title= An Early Electric Motor in India| jstor=3102151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, O'Shaughnessy conducted experiments on an experimental telegraphy system that he set up in the Botanical Garden at Calcutta with the assistance of [[Nathaniel Wallich]]. A length of 22 miles of wire was laid by zigzagging them over bamboo posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic08asia#page/714/mode/2up/|pages=714–731| year= 1839| title=Memoranda relative to experiments on the communication of telegraphic signals by induced electricity| author=O'Shaughnessy, W.B.|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal| volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, he returned to England where he introduced ''[[Cannabis indica]]'' to Western medicine and continued his scientific writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2490264/pdf/provmedsurgj00865-0001.pdf| year =1843| title=On the preparations of the Indian hemp, or Gunjah, (Cannabis Indica) | author=O'Shaughness, W.B.| issue=123 |pages=1–7| pmc=2490264| volume=5| journal=Prov Med J Retrosp Med Sci}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[London Electrical Society]] and was elected a [[fellow of the Royal Society]] on 16 March 1843. The Candidature for Election to Fellow of the Royal Society stated that he was "distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Medicine and Chemistry, eminent as a Physician and as a promoter of education among the natives of Bengal". O'Shaughnessy was a supporter of the idea of education in native languages in medicine. He also wanted locally available sources of medicine to be utilized to provide inexpensive aid. As a teacher, he took students on field trips to the Botanical Garden to introduce them to the local medicinal plants. In 1837 he prepared a ''Manual of Chemistry'' of which a thousand copies were printed for use in Calcutta. A second edition was produced in 1842. Another major book was the ''Bengal Dispensatory and Pharmacopeia'' which included an appendix on the "improvement of Bengal pottery" (1840) since earthenware imports from Europe were proving to be expensive. The ''Bengal Dispensatory'' included descriptions of several plant species that were made or overseen by Wallich including those of ''Abelmoschus longifolius'', ''Pharbitis caerulea'', ''Hebradendron pictorium'' and ''Garcinia pictoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The contribution of Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy (1809–1889) to plant taxonomy| journal=Phytotaxa| volume=15| year=2011| pages=57–63| author=Turner, I.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions have often been overlooked by botanists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, M.D., F.R.S., F.R.C.S., F.S.A.: A Biographical Appreciation by an Electrical Engineer| author=Bridge, J.A.| journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London| volume=52| issue=1| year=1998| pages=103–120| jstor=532080| doi=10.1098/rsnr.1998.0038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Martin A.

==Return to India==
In 1844, O'Shaughnessy returned to India where he worked in various government positions in the fields of pharmacology and assay. [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] became interested in the establishment of a telegraphic network and he learnt of the work of O'Shaugnessy and found that he could work on the scheme. Dalhousie informed the Military Board that O'Shaugnessy was to work directly under Dalhousie's supervision and report directly without any other intermediary authorities. During this period he began work on various telegraph instruments and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0967772015596276 |title= Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy (1808–1889), MD, FRS, LRCS Ed: Chemical pathologist, pharmacologist and pioneer in electric telegraphy|author=MacGillivray, Neil| journal=Journal of Medical Biography |year=2015|volume=25|pages=186–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; After briefly returning to England in 1852, O'Shaughnessy was appointed Superintendent of Telegraphs in 1852. During the years 1853-5 3500 miles of telegraph were installed across India and he wrote numerous manuals and reports on his telegraph inventions. O'Shaughnessy was on leave in England during the mutiny year but in the same year Morse code was introduced into India and a message from Delhi to Punjab helped in moving troops in time. In 1858 a cable was laid in the Gulf of Mannar between India and Ceylon. O'Shaughnessy introduced a coil of fine wire in the circuit to protect the cables from lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Memoir of Surgeon-Major Sir W.

==Knighthood and return to England==
In 1856 he was [[knight]]ed by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] for his work on the telegraph in India. He was appointed Director-General of Telegraphs at this time. During the following years O'Shaughnessy wrote on telegraphy-related subjects, including a book of Private Codes for [[encrypted]] telegraphy. In 1860, O'Shaughnessy returned to Europe for sick leave where he remained in obscurity until his death from senile asthenia at Southsea on 8 January 1889. He was buried at Highland Road Cemetery, Portsmouth.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

'''William Justus Goebel''' (January 4, 1856 – February 3, 1900)&lt;!--Many sources incorrectly list his death as in 1899--&gt; was an American [[Politics of the United States|politician]] who served as the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|34th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]] for four days in 1900 after having been mortally wounded by an assassin the day before he was sworn in (though he was on his deathbed by that time). Goebel remains the only [[Governor#United States|state governor]] in the United States to be assassinated while in office.&lt;ref name=kye-assassination&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], [[Lowell H. Harrison]], and [[James C. Klotter]] |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1772-0 |chapter=Goebel Assassination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skilled politician, Goebel was well able to broker deals with fellow lawmakers, and equally able and willing to break the deals if a better deal came along. His tendency to use the state's [[political machine]]ry to advance his personal agenda earned him the nicknames "Boss Bill", "the [[Kenton County, Kentucky|Kenton]] King", "Kenton Czar", "King William I", and "William the Conqueror".&lt;ref name=klotter&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James C. Klotter |last=Klotter |first=James C. |title=''William Goebel: The Politics of Wrath'' |year=1977 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-0240-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cw-1wFeQoIgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goebel's abrasive personality made him many political enemies, but his championing of [[populism|populist]] causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many allies and supporters. This conflict of opinions came to a head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and [[William S. Taylor]]. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.

==Early life==
Wilhelm Justus Goebel was born January 4, 1856, in [[Albany Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;Heverly, Clement F., ''History and Geography of Bradford County Pennsylvania, 1615–1924''. Towanda, PA: Bradford County Historical Society. 1926. p 469&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Wilhelm and Augusta (Groenkle) Goebel, immigrants from [[Hanover]], Germany. The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the [[American Civil War]], and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their [[Germans|German]] heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the [[Anglicisation#Proper names|English spelling]] of his name.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

Discharged from the army in 1863, Goebel's father moved his family to [[Covington, Kentucky]]. William attended school in Covington and was then apprenticed to a jeweler in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. After a brief time at Hollingsworth Business College, he became an apprentice in the law firm of [[John W. Stevenson]], who had served as governor of Kentucky from 1871 to 1877. Goebel eventually became Stevenson's partner and executor of his estate.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; Goebel graduated from [[Cincinnati Law School]] in 1877, then enrolled at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]], but withdrew to support his family on the death of his father. Goebel was in private practice for several years, before partnering with Kentucky state representative [[John G. Carlisle]] for five years. He then rejoined Stevenson in Covington as a partner.&lt;ref name=powell /&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
Goebel was never known as a particularly genial person in public. He belonged to few social organizations, and greeted none but his closest friends with a smile or handshake.  He was rarely linked romantically with a woman,&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; and is the only governor of Kentucky who never married.&lt;ref name=powell /&gt; His physical features bespoke his taciturn nature. Journalist [[Irvin S. Cobb]] remarked that Goebel's appearance was "reptilian", while others commented on his contemptuous lips, sharp nose, and humorless eyes. Neither was Goebel a gifted public speaker, eschewing flowery imagery and relying on his deep, powerful voice and forceful delivery to drive home his points.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

While lacking in the social qualities common to politicians, one characteristic served Goebel well in the political arena{{spaced ndash}}his intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters and opponents both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive. Cobb concluded that he had never been more impressed with a man's intellect than he had been with Goebel's.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:William Goebel statue.png|thumb|left|200px|Statue of Goebel in front of the [[Old State Capitol (Kentucky)|Old State Capitol]] in Frankfort]]
In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated his seat in the [[Kentucky Senate]] to pursue the office of [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]]. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was not to be. A third political party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 19th century)|Union Labor party]], had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election close{{spaced ndash}}decided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

With only the two years remaining in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]]. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed and sent to the Senate. Senator [[Cassius Clay (1810–1903)|Cassius M. Clay]] responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby.&lt;ref name=hood&gt;{{cite book |last=Hood |first=Fred J. |title=''Kentucky: Its History and Heritage'' |chapter=Goebel's Campaign for Railroad Regulation, 1888–1900 |publisher=Forum Press |location=St. Louis, Missouri |year=1978 |isbn=0-88273-019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

In 1890, Goebel was a delegate to Kentucky's fourth [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]],&lt;ref name=kye&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], [[Lowell H. Harrison]], and [[James C. Klotter]] |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1772-0 |chapter=Goebel, William|chapter-url=http://www.kyenc.org/entry/g/GOEBE01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the current [[Kentucky Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kentucky Government: Informational Bulletin No. 137 (Revised) |chapter=Constitutional Background|publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission |location=Frankfort, Kentucky |date=February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high honor of being chosen as a delegate, Goebel showed little interest in participating in the process of creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]].&lt;ref name=hood /&gt;

===Duel with John Sanford===
[[File:Goebel William.jpg|thumb|Portrait by George Debereiner]]
In 1895, Goebel engaged in what many observers considered a [[duel]] with [[John Lawrence Sanford]]. Sanford, a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general staff officer turned banker, had clashed with Goebel before. Goebel's successful campaign to remove tolls from some of Kentucky's [[Toll road|turnpikes]] had cost Sanford a good deal of money. It was widely believed that Sanford later blocked Goebel's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the highest court in the state.&lt;ref name=woodson&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodson |first=Urey |authorlink=Urey Woodson |title=The First New Dealer, William Goebel: His origin, ambitions, achievements, his assassination, loss to the state and nation; the story of a great crime |publisher=The Standard Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Goebel had written an article in a local newspaper referring to Sanford as "[[Gonorrhea]] John."&lt;ref name=mcqueen&gt;{{cite book |last=McQueen |first=Keven |others=Ill. by Kyle McQueen |title=''Offbeat Kentuckians: Legends to Lunatics'' |chapter=William Goebel: Assassinated Governor |year=2001 |publisher=McClanahan Publishing House |location=Kuttawa, Kentucky |isbn=0-913383-80-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duel occurred as Goebel and two of his acquaintances went to Covington to cash a check. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could cross the street to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, clutched the revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, "I understand that you assume authorship of that article?" "I do," replied Goebel. Witnesses agreed that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers. Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later.&lt;ref name=woodson /&gt; Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the shooting would haunt his political career.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold public office.&lt;ref name=kyconst&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lrc.ky.gov/lrcpubs/IB59.pdf |title=The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Informational Bulletin No. 59 |publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission |date=October 2005 |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goebel Election Law===
Democrats, who controlled the General Assembly, felt that county election commissioners had been unjust in selecting local election officials, and that this injustice had contributed to the election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor [[William O. Bradley]] in 1895 and Republican president [[William McKinley]] in 1896. Goebel proposed a bill, known as the "Goebel Election Law", which passed along sharp party lines and over Governor Bradley's veto, created a three-member state election commission, appointed by the General Assembly, to select county election commissioners. This system proved to be just as manipulable as the one it replaced, allowing the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to appoint fellow Democrats to the election commission.&lt;ref name=hood /&gt;

Many voters decried the bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to increase his political power, and the election board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in a special session of the legislature in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], [[Lowell H. Harrison]], and [[James C. Klotter]] |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1772-0 |chapter=Goebel Election Law|chapter-url=http://www.kyenc.org/entry/g/GOEBE03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite rising to the office of [[President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate|President Pro Tempore]] in 1896, Goebel became the subject of much opposition from constituencies of both parties in Kentucky after the passage of the law.

===Gubernatorial election of 1899===
{{main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899}}
Three men sought the Democratic nomination for governor at the 1899 party convention in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]{{spaced ndash}}Goebel, [[Parker Watkins Hardin|Wat Hardin]], and [[William Johnson Stone|William J. Stone]]. When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

Goebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party.&lt;ref name=kye-musichall&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], [[Lowell H. Harrison]], and [[James C. Klotter]] |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1772-0 |chapter=Music Hall Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disgruntled faction calling themselves the "Honest Election Democrats" held a separate convention in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and nominated [[John Y. Brown (1835-1904)|John Y. Brown]] for governor.&lt;ref name=hood /&gt;

Republican [[William S. Taylor]] defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes.&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt; Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;&lt;ref name=hood /&gt;

==Assassination and aftermath==
[[File:HW Goebel Assassination.png|thumb|right|250px|Sketch of the assassination in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1900]]
While the election results remained in dispute, Goebel, despite being warned of a rumored assassination plot against him, walked flanked by two bodyguards to the [[Old State Capitol (Kentucky)|Old State Capitol]] on the morning of January 30, 1900. Reports conflict about what happened, but some five or six shots were fired from the nearby State Building, one striking Goebel in the chest and wounding him seriously. Taylor, serving as governor pending a final decision on the election, called out the [[militia]] and ordered the General Assembly into a special session, not in Frankfort, but in [[London, Kentucky]], a Republican area.&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt; The Republican minority obeyed the call and went to London. Democrats resisted the move, many going instead to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Both groups claimed authority, but the Republicans were too few to muster a [[quorum]].&lt;ref name=woodson /&gt;

[[File:Goebel fell plaque.png|thumb|left|A plaque in front of the [[Old State Capitol (Kentucky)|Old State Capitol]] marks where Goebel fell after being shot.]]
The day after being shot, the dying Goebel was sworn in as governor. In his only act, Goebel signed a proclamation to dissolve the militia called up by Taylor, which was ignored by the militia's Republican commander. Despite the care of 18 physicians, Goebel died the afternoon of February 3, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goebel Dies At 6:45 P. M. |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/548505622.html?dids=548505622:548505622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+04,+1900&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution&amp;desc=GOEBEL+DIES+AT+6:45+P.+M.;+BROTHER+ARIVES+TOO+LATE&amp;pqatl=google |quote=The bullet fired by an unknown assassin last Tuesday morning ended the life of Governor Goebel at 6:45 o'clock this evening.

He died at 6:45&amp;nbsp;... |newspaper=[[Atlanta Constitution]] |date=February 4, 1900 |accessdate=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists recalled his [[last words]] as "Tell my friends to be brave, fearless, and loyal to the common people." Skeptic [[Irvin S. Cobb]] uncovered another story from some in the room at the time. On having eaten his last meal, the governor supposedly remarked "Doc, that was a damned bad oyster." In respect of Goebel's displeasure with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the governor's body was transported not by the L&amp;N direct line, but circuitously from his hometown of Covington north across the [[Ohio River]] to Cincinnati, and then south to Frankfort on the [[Queen and Crescent Railroad]].&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt; His body lay in state in the [[Odd Fellows]] lodge.&lt;ref&gt; The Encyclopedia of Northern Kentucky, University Press of Kentucky, 2015, page 477&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution of the election===
With Goebel dead, tensions began to ease. The idea of Goebel's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[J. C. W. Beckham]], as governor was more palatable to much of the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;

Compromise having been exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter. The Kentucky Court of Appeals found that the General Assembly had acted legally in declaring Goebel the winner of the election. That decision was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Arguments were presented in the case (''[[Taylor v. Beckham]]'') on April 30, 1900, and on May 21, the justices decided 8–1 not to hear the case, allowing the Court of Appeals' decision to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.findlaw.com/us/178/548.html |title=Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900) |publisher=FindLaw.com |accessdate=March 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lone dissension was that of Associate Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]], a Kentucky native&lt;ref name=woodson /&gt; and a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

===Trials and investigations===
[[File:Gov William Goebel grave.jpg|thumb|Monument in Frankfort Cemetery]]
During the ensuing assassination investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana under the looming threat of indictment.&lt;ref name=kye /&gt; The governor of [[Indiana]] refused to extradite Taylor, and he was thus never questioned about his knowledge of the plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican [[Augustus E. Willson]].&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt;

Sixteen people, including Taylor, were eventually indicted in the assassination of Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted.&lt;ref name=kye-assassination /&gt; Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State [[Caleb Powers]], Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who was said to have been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud,&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt; was accused of being the actual assassin.&lt;ref name=kye-assassination /&gt;

The trials were fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats,&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt; and at one point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts overturned Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a [[hung jury]] and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.

Youtsey, who received a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]], did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned [[state's evidence]]. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions in the details of Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor [[James D. Black]].&lt;ref name=kye-assassination /&gt;&lt;ref name=klotter /&gt;&lt;ref name=mcqueen /&gt;

Most historians agree that the assassin of Governor Goebel will never be conclusively identified.&lt;ref name=kye-assassination /&gt;

==Legacy==
Goebel Avenue in [[Elkton, Kentucky]] and Goebel Park in [[Covington, Kentucky]] are named in honor of the late governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuGCoLRCN-kC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The WPA Guide to Kentucky | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | date=1996 | accessdate=November 24, 2013 | author=Federal Writers' Project | page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sings in both [[English language|English]] and [[Sanskrit]], and plays [[guitar]],&lt;ref name=times2003/&gt; [[sarod]] (a 26 stringed, [[sitar]]-like instrument from [[India]]),&lt;ref name=times2003/&gt; [[harmonium]], [[Bağlama|saz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wynne-paris-mn0000553753/credits AllMusic Artists Profile: Wynne Paris - Credits]&lt;/ref&gt; (a stringed instrument in the [[lute]] family) and [[percussion]].

Also in that year, he met the Indian "hugging saint" [[Mata Amritanandamayi]], known to her devotees as Ammachi or Amma, which inspired him to move to [[Marin County]] to study [[Indian music]], [[shamanism]], and yoga.&lt;ref name=pathway2010/&gt;

Since 1998, Paris has primarily performed and recorded New Age and World Beat music with an Indian influence, performing kirtan chanting and playing both Western and traditional Indian musical instruments.

'''Yucca Mountain Johnny''' is a [[cartoon]] [[miner]] created by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to present information to children on [[nuclear waste]] disposal and the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain Project]]. Serving as the virtual guide for the DOE's '''Youth Zone''' web site and appearing "[[live-action]]" in [[Nevada]] schools, Yucca Mountain Johnny has drawn harsh criticism as a [[propaganda]] tool.

Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Shelley Berkley]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-NV) called Yucca Mountain Johnny "the Department of Energy's [[Joe Camel]]",&lt;ref name=friess&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to a cartoon [[mascot]] for the tobacco industry which drew criticism for targeting children. Former Representative [[Jon Porter]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-NV) stated that "to sell the Yucca Mountain Project to our children through the use of a cartoon character is an irresponsible and desperate act."&lt;ref name=tetreault&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DOE spokesperson Craig Stevens, however, defended Yucca Mountain Johnny, arguing that it "teaches hydrology, geology, and earth science", and that it is "part of our duty to explain to the public what we're doing."&lt;ref name=friess /&gt; Support for Yucca Mountain Johnny was present in the House of Representatives, with Representative [[Joe Barton]] (R-[[Texas|TX]]) stating that "nobody questions the accuracy or truth of what's on the Web site", and Representative [[Dave Hobson|David Hobson]] (R-[[Ohio|OH]]) stating that it "may have a place in teaching kids."&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate = 2006-05-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkley, who is a vocal opponent of a Yucca Mountain waste repository, attempted to add an amendment to an energy spending bill that would have prevented the funds from being used for the DOE '''Youth Zone''' web site.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; The amendment was defeated, 271-147.

The Youth Zone now appears to have been removed from the DOE's website, although copies of the site can be found via the [[Wayback machine]]&lt;ref name=waybackm&gt;{{citation
