The year '''1993 in radio''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*January: The [[Media in the Quad Cities|Quad Cities]]' KSTT call letters are retired as 1170 AM is given the new call sign KJOC, reflecting that station's all-sports format. The station had been simulcasting [[WXLP]]'s FM signal for the past four years, although its sports programming had been steadily increasing during that time. Also that month, [[WPAT (AM)|WPAT]] and [[WPAT-FM]] [[Paterson, NJ]]/[[New York City]] quietly completed their evolution from [[Beautiful Music]] to down-tempo [[Adult Contemporary]], still known as Easy 93.
*4 January - [[WYCD|WOWF]]/Detroit officially completes their flip from Top 40/CHR to [[talk radio|talk]] as "Wow FM."
*6 January - After 5 days of [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with all-[[Garth Brooks]] music, Rhythmic CHR-formatted [[WBZZ|WMXP]]/Pittsburgh flips to country as "K-Bear", WKQB.
*10 January - [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] gets its second local country outlet when [[KKSE-FM|KDHT]] completed its move-in to the market and flipped to "Big Dog 92.5."
*15 January - KONC/Phoenix flips from classical to modern rock. A few weeks later, on 1 February, cross-town rival KFMA flips to beautiful music.
*25 January - After stunting with all-[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] music for 3 days, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KRVB|KFXD-FM]]/[[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] flips to adult contemporary.
*26 January - [[Toronto]] got its first country-formatted FM station when [[CKIS-FM|CISS-FM]] signed on the air.
*February - KZKZ/[[Ft. Smith, Arkansas|Ft. Smith]] flips from album rock to gospel, while KTEZ/[[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] flips from beautiful music to country.
*2 February - Pittsburgh picked up its third country outlet, as [[WPGB|WORD-FM]]'s former 104.7 frequency flips from religious programming and became "Rebel 104.7", WXRB.
*5 February - [[WLFP|WODZ]]/Memphis flips from oldies to country as "Froggy 94", WOGY. Also on this day, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KMJK|KXXR]]/Kansas City changes call letters and rebrands as KISF, "Kiss 107.3."
*7 February - [[KKSW|KLZR]]/[[Lawrence, Kansas]] flips from satellite-fed Hot AC to modern rock
*15 February - WXQL/Jacksonville flips to Urban AC
*19 February:  [[KBEQ]]/Kansas City drops its top-40 format of 20 years as "Q-104" to go country as "Young Country 104."  It would initially be simulcast on KBZR 1030, which had been airing [[Z-Rock]].  The "Q-104" handle would return a few years later, but the format would remain country.
*March: After 40-plus years in its hometown, [[KBEA-FM|KFMH]] (99.7 FM) moves its studios from [[Muscatine, Iowa]] to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. Also that month, Cleveland-based Malrite Communications announces it will merge with Shamrock Broadcasting. The merger would be completed in August.
*8 March - KKNB/[[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] signs on with a modern rock format.
*12 March: After 10 years in the Top 40/CHR format (with a few moniker and format modifications]], WEGX/[[Philadelphia]] becomes [[smooth jazz]]-formatted [[WISX|WJJZ]]. Three days later, struggling [[adult contemporary|AC]] [[WRNB|WKSZ]] fills the format void by flipping to "Z100." However, due to the presence of nearby [[WHTZ]] in New York (which is also located on 100.3 FM), the "Z100" moniker would be modified to "Y100".
*2 April: After 20 years as an influential [[Top 40]] station, [[WRBQ-FM]]/[[Tampa]] flipped to [[country music|country]], while keeping its heritage "Q105" moniker. Also on this day, [[KKLQ (FM)|KQLZ]]/[[Los Angeles]] (the former "[[KQLZ (defunct)|Pirate Radio]]") flipped from modern rock to [[Adult contemporary|Soft AC]] as "EZ 100.3" after [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] sold the station to [[Viacom, Inc.|Viacom]]. In addition, [[KCMQ]]/[[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] flips from Top 40/CHR to country.
*5 April - Two stations in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] would flip to country within two days of each other: [[Beautiful Music]]-formatted [[WWHT|WRHP]] flips on the 5th, while classic rock-formatted [[WBBS|WKFM]] flips the next day. In [[Akron, Ohio]], [[Hot AC]]-formatted [[WQMX]] would also flip to country on the 5th.
*19 April - WAQZ/Cincinnati flips from album rock to modern rock
*30 April: [[Virgin Radio]], originally called Virgin 1215, was launched nationally in the United Kingdom on 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz at 12.15pm by [[Richard Branson]]. It has since become the most listened to online radio station in the world.
*11 May: [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]]-formatted [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]]/[[Boston]] shifted to [[Rhythmic CHR]] as "JAM'N 94.5", WJMN.
*28 May: At 4 PM that day, [[WYCD|WOWF]]/Detroit dropped their 5-month old talk format and flipped to country, becoming one of the first "Young Country" stations.
*3 June: Atlantic Ventures, Stoner Broadcasting and Multi Market Communications all merge to form American Radio Systems, consisting of 16 stations in 7 markets.
*9 September:  Cox and CBS make a swap involving the Dallas and Tampa radio markets. Cox received AOR WYNF 94.9 "95 YNF" in Tampa from CBS to pair with its WWRM "Warm 107.3", while CBS received KLRX "Lite 97.9" in Dallas from Cox to pair with its KTXQ "Q-102."  KLRX flipped to classic rock as KRRW "Arrow 97.9" on 15 October (becoming the second station to use that branding), while Cox moved the "Warm" format from 107.3 to 94.9 and launches 1970s hits WCOF "107.3 The Coast."
*10 September - CBS installs the very first 70s-based [[classic hits]]-formatted "[[Arrow (radio format)|Arrow]]" station on [[KCBS-FM]]/Los Angeles, who dropped their 4-year old [[oldies]] format.
*22 September - [[WMVP|WLUP-AM]]/Chicago moves their comedy/talk programming over to [[WCKL-FM|their FM sister station]], and flips to [[sports talk]] as WMVP.
*October - Memphis got its sixth urban-formatted station when WOGY-AM dropped the simulcast with [[WLFP|its FM sister station]] and flipped to urban oldies as "The Juice", WJCE. Also this month, Carl Hirsch launches his new radio group venture, OmniAmerica Communications.
*11 October - Westwood One announced it would acquire Unistar Radio Networks for $101.3 million; in addition, Westwood One would sell a 25% equity stake to [[Infinity Broadcasting]] for $15 million. Also on this day, KPOI/Honolulu flips from album rock to modern rock.
*25 October - [[Smooth jazz]]-formatted [[KRKS-FM|KHIH]]/Denver flips to religious programming; the format void would be filled by AC-formatted [[KPTT|KHOW-FM]] a few days later.
*November - [[WXDX-FM|WWKS]]/Pittsburgh flips from classic rock to hard rock. Also during this month, Booth American Company and Broadcast Alchemy announced plans of a merger, with the newly combined company getting 11 stations in 7 markets and $160 million. In addition, Metroplex Communications would merge with Clear Channel, a deal worth $53 million.
*10 November - KQBR/Sacramento dropped country for [[smooth jazz]]
*12 November - After 23 years in the country format, [[KLAC]]/Los Angeles flips to Unistar's [[adult standards]] "AM Only" format.
*15 November - Top 40/CHR-formatted WYAV/Myrtle Beach flips to [[classic rock]], and became an affiliate of [[The Howard Stern Show]].
*19 November - The "Arrow" format is expanded to two adult contemporary-formatted stations in two markets; in Washington, D.C., [[WIAD|WLTT]] adopts the format, while in Houston, [[KQBT|KLTR]] flips to the format four days later.
*16 December - [[96WEFM]] begins broadcasting in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

'''''AION Linguistica''''' is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by the [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"|Università degli studi di Napoli “L'Orientale”]] and established in 1959. The current editor-in-chief is Alberto Manco.

== History and Scope ==

AION Linguistica was established in 1959 by [[:it:Walter Belardi|Walter Belardi]]. The second series was published from 1979 until 2011 in the former “Dipartimento di Studi del Mondo classico e del Mediterraneo antico” and it was edited by Domenico Silvestri, while Alberto Manco assumed the secretaryship in 2000. The current editor-in-chief is Alberto Manco. Since 2012, the broader breadth of the new “Dipartimento di Studi Letterari, Linguistici e Comparati” widened the journal scope and therefore it is actually concerned with larger areas of Linguistics.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.culturaeculture.it/2013/10/aion-linguistica-rivista-cultura/47662]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the authors contributing to the journal since its foundation there are Walter Belardi, Françoise Bader, [[Jürgen Untermann]], [[Michel Lejeune (linguist)|Michel Lejeune]], [[:es:Francisco Villar Liébana|Francisco Villar]], [[Giuliano Bonfante]], [[Helmut Rix]], Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi, José Luis García Ramón and many others.

According to the [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] of [[Geoffrey Leech]], the '''associative meaning''' of an expression has to do with individual mental understandings of the speaker. They, in turn, can be broken up into five sub-types: ''connotative, collocative, social, affective and reflected'' (Mwihaki 2004).

* The [[connotative meaning]]s of an expression are the thoughts provoked by a term when in reference to certain entities. Though these meanings may not be strictly implied by relevant definitions, they show up in common or preferred usage regardless. This is not to be confused with what is historically referred to as [[connotation]], which more closely describes rigid definitions of words.
* [[collocation|Collocative meaning]], or "collocation", describes words that regularly appear together in common use (within certain contexts).
* [[Social meaning]], where words are used to establish relationships between people and to delineate social roles. For example, in Japanese, the suffix "-san" when added to a proper name denotes respect, sometimes indicating that the speaker is subordinate to the listener; while the suffix "-chan" denotes that the speaker thinks the listener is a child or childlike (either for purposes of affection or derision).
* [[Affective meaning]] has to do with the personal feelings or attitudes of the speaker.
* [[Reflected meaning]] has to do with when one sense of a particular word affects the understanding and usage of all the other senses of the word.
* [[Thematic meaning]] concerns itself with how the order of words spoken affects the meaning that is entailed.

'''Chhau dance''', also spelled as '''Chau''' or '''Chhau''', is a semi classical [[India]]n dance with martial, tribal and folk traditions,{{Sfn|Williams|2004|pp=83-84, is a semi classical [[India]]n dance with martial, tribal and folk origins. The other major classical Indian dances are: Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Odissi, Manipuri, Satriya, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela}} with origins in the eastern [[India]]n states of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Odisha]]. It is found in three styles named after the location where they are performed, i.e. the Purulia Chau of [[Bengal]], the Seraikella Chau of [[Jharkhand]], and the Mayurbhanj Chau of [[Odisha]].

The dance ranges from celebrating [[martial arts]], [[acrobatics]] and athletics performed in festive themes of a folk dance, to a structured dance with religious themes found in [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]]. The costumes vary between the styles, with Purulia and Serakeilla using masks to identify the character.&lt;ref name=unescochhau/&gt; The stories enacted by Chhau dancers include those from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Puranas]] and other Indian literature.&lt;ref name=unescochhau/&gt;{{Sfn| Claus|2003|pp=109-110}}

The dance is traditionally an all males troupe, regionally celebrated particularly during spring every year, and may be a syncretic dance form that emerged from a fusion of classical Hindu dances and the traditions of ancient regional tribes.{{Sfn| Claus|2003|pp=109-110}} The dance is egalitarian and brings together people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds in a festive and religious spirit.&lt;ref name=unescochhau/&gt;{{Sfn| Claus|2003|pp=109-110}}

==Etymology==
Chhau is a folk dance of Rarh region. It may have been derived from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''Chāya'' (shadow, image or mask).{{Sfn| Claus|2003|pp=109-110}}&lt;ref name="Khokar1984p185"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Khokar|title=Traditions of Indian classical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prjnAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Clarion Books|pages=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link it to the Sanskrit root ''Chadma'' (disguise), yet others such as [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] suggest it is derived from ''Chhauni'' (military camp, armor, stealth) in Odia language.&lt;ref name=bt&gt;[[#Claus|Claus, p. 109]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seraikela.nic.in/chhau/chhau_hss.htm#SARAIKELACHHAU|title=The Chhau|publisher=Seraikela-Kharsawan district official website|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chhau dancer.jpg|thumb|A Chhau dancer in Bagmundi in role of goddess Durga.]]

== Features of Chhau ==

The Chhau dance is mainly performed during festivals in the region of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]], especially the spring festival of [[Chaitra]] Parva and in which the whole community participates.&lt;ref name="Khokar1984p185"/&gt; The Purulia Chhau dance is celebrated during the Sun festival.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;
[[File:Chhau dance.jpg|thumb|left|Artistes from Purulia district of West Bengal performs Chhau dance]]
Masks form an integral part of Chhau dance in Purulia and Seraikella styles.&lt;ref name=unescochhau/&gt; The knowledge of dance, music and mask-making is transmitted orally.&lt;ref&gt;From: NOMINATION FILE NO. 00337 FOR INSCRIPTION ON THE REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF THE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE IN 2010, UNESCO 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Chhau dance found in northern Odisha does not use mask during the dance, but they do when the artists first appear on the stage for introduction to the audience.{{Sfn| Claus|2003|p=110}}

The two styles of Chhau dance that use masks, blend within it forms of both dance and martial practices employing mock combat techniques (called ''khel''), stylized gaits of birds and animals (called ''chalis'' and ''topkas'') and movements based on the chores of village housewives (called ''uflis'').&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; This form of the Chhau dance, states Mohan Khokar, has no ritual or ceremonial meaning, it is a form of community celebration and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Khokar1984p185"/&gt;

The dance is performed by male dancers, at night in an open space, called ''akhada'' or ''asar''. The dance is rhythmic and set to traditional folk music, played on the reed pipes ''mohuri'' and [[shehnai]].&lt;ref name=unescochhau/&gt; A variety of drums accompany the music ensemble including the [[dhol]] (a cylindrical drum), ''dhumsa'' (a large kettle drum) and ''kharka'' or ''chad-chadi''. The themes for these dances include local legends, folklore and episodes from the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] and other abstract themes.&lt;ref name=unescochhau&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00337 Chhau dance] UNESCO, Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three styles of Chhau ==
[[File:Ileana Citaristi performing Mayurbhanj Chhau.gif|thumb|[[Ileana Citaristi]] performing Mayurbhanj Chhau (Shaivism theme).]]
The '''Seraikella Chhau''' developed in [[Seraikela]], the present day administrative headquarters of the [[Seraikela Kharsawan district]] of [[Jharkhand]], the '''Purulia Chhau''' in [[Purulia district]] of [[West Bengal]] and the '''Mayurbhanj Chhau'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHHAU DANCE OF MAYURBHANJ|url=http://mayurbhanj.nic.in/cult.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mayurbhanj district]] of [[Odisha]]. The most prominent difference among the three subgenres is regarding the use of masks. While, the Seraikela and Purulia subgenres of Chhau use masks during the dance, the Mayurbhanj Chhau uses none.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[[#Claus|Claus, p. 110]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purulia.nic.in/distAdmin/departments/dico/chau_dance.html |title=Famous Folk Dance: "Chau" |publisher=[[Purulia district]] official website |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602171304/http://www.purulia.nic.in/distAdmin/departments/dico/chau_dance.html |archivedate=2 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seraikella Chhau's technique and repertoire were developed by the erstwhile nobility of this region who were both its performers and choreographers, and in the modern era people from all backgrounds dance it.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; The Seraikella Chhau is performed with symbolic masks, and the acting establishes the role the actor is playing.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;&lt;ref name=khokar1984p187/&gt; The Purulia Chhau uses extensive masks shaped in the form of the character being played; for example, a lion character has a face mask of lion and body costumes too with the actor walking on all fours.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; These masks are crafted by potters who make clay images of Hindu gods and goddesses and is primarily sourced from the [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pani|first=Jiwan|title=World of Other Faces - Indian Masks|year=1986|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|location=New Delhi|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mayurbhanj Chhau is performed without masks and is technically similar to the Seraikella Chhau.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;&lt;ref name=khokar1984p187&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Khokar|title=Traditions of Indian classical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prjnAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Clarion Books|pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

In 2010 the Chhau dance was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011 |title=Intangible Heritage Lists&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Odisha]] established a Government Chhau Dance Centre in 1960 in Seraikella and the Mayurbhanj Chhau Nritya Pratisthan at [[Baripada]] in 1962. These institutions engage in training involving local gurus, artists, patrons and representatives of Chhau institutions and sponsor performances. The Chaitra Parva festival, significant to the Chhau Dance, is also sponsored by the state government. The [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] has established a National Centre for Chhau Dance at [[Baripada]], [[Odisha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chhau Centre, Baripada/Jamshedpur|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/chhau-centre.htm|publisher=Sangeet Natak Akademi|accessdate=26 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313004358/http://sangeetnatak.org/sna/chhau-centre.htm|archivedate=13 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chhau centre at Baripada finds favour with Union Ministry|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/article3642105.ece|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most interesting fact, Purulia Chhau Dance is listed on [[UNESCO|UNESCO’s]] world heritage list of dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utsavpedia.com/cultural-connections/indian-performing-arts/chhau-dance-of-purulia/|title=Chhau Dance: West Bengal's Performing Art Treasure {{!}} Utsavpedia|date=2015-07-30|work=Utsavpedia|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between the Purulia chhau and Odisha chhau is in the use of the mask. Purulia chhau used the mask in dance, but Odisha does not have the mask thereby adding facial expression with body movement and gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://purulia.gov.in/distAdmin/departments/dico/chau_dance.html|title=The Official Website of Purulia District|website=purulia.gov.in|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the chhau dance held in the mid march when one agricultural circle end and a new circle begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daricha.org/sub_genre.aspx?ID=85&amp;Name=Chho|title=:::::: Daricha Foundation ::::::|website=www.daricha.org|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purulia chhau dancer were the earthy and theatrical mask which represent the mythological characters. After making the shape of mask with clay, it is coloured and decorated with Shola and other things.

The '''Chhau mask''' of [[Purulia]] is registered under [[List of Geographical Indications in India|Geographical Indications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/Bengal-handicrafts-to-get-new-fillip-with-GI-tags/article14572749.ece|title=Bengal handicrafts to get new fillip with GI tags|date=2016-08-16|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-05-15|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the basic difference of Purulia Chhau the mask is very unique and traditional fact.

These chhau masks are made by the artists from the '''''Sutradhar community'''''. The making of a mask goes through various stages. 8-10 layers of soft paper, immersed in diluted glue, are pasted one after another on the mould before the mud mould is dusted with fine ash powder. The facial features are made of clay. A special layer of mud and cloth is applied and the mask is then sun-dried. After this, the mould is polished and the second round of sun drying is done before separating the layers of cloth and paper from the mould. After finishing and drilling of holes for the nose and eyes, the mask is colored and decorated.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5590e1c1e4b01cfd84ef7264/t/56bd94ae7da24fd5476fbc2e/1455264959070/Masks+of+Bengal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biswabangla.in/ldf-blog/2015/9/22/the-mask|title=The Mask|work=Biswa Bangla|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word was used to describe the ''[[souq]]'', which was similar to the ''souq'' in Ba.&lt;ref name=jundi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alkaabi |first=Alyazya |date=July 2011 |script-title=ar:مسميات مناطق دبي قديماً |trans-title=Old names areas of Dubai |language=Arabic |journal=Al Jundi |publisher=Ministry of Defense |volume=444|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An Arabic proverb says "''Daba Dubai''" ({{lang-ar|دبا دبي}}), meaning "They came with a lot of money."&lt;ref name=MBR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=13d94c8631cb4110VgnVCM100000b0140a0aRCRD |title=Old Dubai |accessdate=24 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203194320/http://www.sheikhmohammed.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=13d94c8631cb4110VgnVCM100000b0140a0aRCRD |archivedate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word ''daba'' ({{lang-ar|دبا}}) (a past tense derivative of ''yadub'' ({{lang-ar|يدب}}), which means "to creep"), referring to the slow flow of [[Dubai Creek]] inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby [[locust]]" ({{lang-ar|جراد}}) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement.&lt;ref name=UAEI&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/rss-news.asp?ID=24335 |title = How Did Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other Cities Get Their Names?

The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the ''Book of Geography'' by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab [[geographer]] [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[Venice|Venetian]] pearl merchant [[Gasparo Balbi]] visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (''Dibei'') for its [[pearl hunting|pearling]] industry.&lt;ref name=balbi/&gt;

==== Establishment of modern Dubai ====
In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the [[House of Al Falasi|Al Bu Falasah]] tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by [[Obeid bin Said bin Rashid|Obeid bin Saeed]] and [[Maktoum bin Butti bin Suhail|Maktoum bin Butti]], who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the [[Al Maktoum|Maktoum dynasty]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Dubai signed the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]] along with other [[Trucial States|Trucial State]]s, following the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|British punitive expedition]] against [[Ras Al Khaimah]] of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also – like its neighbours on the [[Trucial States|Trucial Coast]] – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the [[United Kingdom]] took responsibility for the emirate's security [[Trucial States#Treaty of 1892|in 1892]].

In 1841, a [[smallpox]] epidemic broke out in the [[Bur Dubai]] locality, forcing residents to relocate east to [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]].&lt;ref name="hist_karim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |title=Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture. Karim, Luiza |publisher=Alshindagah.com |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930191053/http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from ''barasti'' - palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free port ===
In 1901, [[Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum]] established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=2236}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also those who had settled in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qasimi]] tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=743}}&lt;/ref&gt; the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent',&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States.&lt;ref name="Lorimer 1915 454"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-oil Dubai===
[[File:Typical Bastakiya buildings - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Typical souk street in [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]], Dubai]] 
Dubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of [[Jumeirah]], a collection of some 45 ''areesh'', or palm leaf, huts housing settled [[Bedouin]] of the [[Bani Yas]] and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] tribes.&lt;ref name="Lorimer 1915 454"/&gt;

Dubai was known for its [[pearl]] exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 [[Great Depression]] and the innovation of [[cultured pearls]]. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="hist_trad"/&gt;

In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with [[Abu Dhabi]]. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war.&lt;ref name=dxbadconflict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=120 |title=The UAE: Internal Boundaries And The Boundary With Oman.

Despite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Longman|year=1996|isbn=978-0582277281|location=London|pages=260|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (international Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/152680|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley,|date=1970|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=|isbn=0049530054|location=London,|pages=245|oclc=152680}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water company (Sheikh Rashid was Chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based [[MV Dara]], a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between [[Basra]] (Iraq), [[Kuwait]] and [[Bombay]] (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors but in all 238 lives were lost in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/fifty-years-on-the-tragedy-of-vessel-mv-dara-lingers-1.789262|title=Fifty years on, the tragedy of vessel MV Dara lingers|last=Reporter|first=Mariam M.

Construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the Northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1962 the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] noted that "Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai's creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first [[duty-free shop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fly Buy Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 2008|isbn = 9789948859437|location = UAE|page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gold trading ===
Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively [[gold]] trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some £56 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/152680|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley,|date=1970|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=|isbn=0049530054|location=London,|pages=204|oclc=152680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil era===
[[File:Dubai Sunset from Burj Khalifa.jpg|thumb|View of Downtown Dubai from [[Burj Khalifa]]]]
After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.&lt;ref name="pop7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |title=Historic population statistics |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326030537/http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000 gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as 'Kazzans',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|title = How Chicago Beach got its name...then lost it!|accessdate = 20 August 2016|website = Dubai As It Used To Be|last = Chapman|first = Len|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160709050015/http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|archivedate = 9 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the [[Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company|Chicago Bridge and Iron Company]], which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the [[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]] in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant super-tankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/152680|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley,|date=1970|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=|isbn=0049530054|location=London,|pages=222|oclc=152680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===
[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]], and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]
Dubai and the other 'T[[trucial states|rucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'. This was to change with PM [[Harold Wilson]]'s announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Al Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 9781860633300|location = UAE|pages = 27–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 9781860633300|location = UAE|page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed -often stormy- as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy-handed British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and [[Ras Al Khaimah]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven 'trucial' emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=United Arab Emirates: A New Perspective|last=Al Abed|first=Ibrahim|publisher=Trident Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|location=https://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/06.pdf|pages=129–133|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, [[Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]] and [[Fujairah]] joined in the Act of Union to form the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following [[Iran]]'s annexation of the RAK-claimed [[Tunbs]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islands and International Politics in the Persian Gulf: The Abu Musa and Tunbs in Strategic Context|last=Ahmadi|first=Kourosh|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=96|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the [[United Arab Emirates dirham|UAE dirham]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; In that same year, the prior [[monetary union]] with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centralbank.ae/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148&amp;Itemid=106|title=Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates|website=|access-date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the [[Lebanese civil war]].&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;"Beirut Showing Signs of Recovery From Wounds of War".

Carter, T and Dunston, L. ''Lonely Planet Publications''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jebel Ali]] port was established in 1979.

The [[Gulf War]] of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently, the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived. Later in the 1990s, many foreign trading communities—first from [[Kuwait]], during the Gulf War, and later from [[Bahrain]], during the [[Shia]] unrest—moved their businesses to Dubai.&lt;ref name="asianaffairs"&gt;Davidson, Christopher, ''The Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai: Contrasting Roles in the International System''. March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War, and again during the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sand to Silicon: Going Global|last = Sampler &amp; Eigner|publisher = Motivate|year = 2008|isbn = 9781860632549|location = UAE|page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubai is situated on the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ({{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] in the northeast, and the [[Sultanate of Oman]] in the southeast. [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]], a minor [[exclave]] of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at {{Coord|25.2697|N|55.3095|E}} and covers an area of {{convert|1588|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} designation due to [[Land reclamation#Land amounts added|land reclamation from the sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Dubai lies directly within the [[Arabian Desert]]. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country.&lt;ref name=geo1&gt;[http://uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf Environmental Development and Protection in the UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172707/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }}. Aspinall, Simon&lt;/ref&gt; The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as ''sabkha'', give way to a north-south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.&lt;ref name=pop7/&gt;

The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western [[Hajar Mountains]], which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about {{convert|1300|m|0|abbr=off}} in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, [[Dubai Creek]], which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as [[The Empty Quarter]]. [[Seismic]]ally, Dubai is in a very stable zone—the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=off}} from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai.&lt;ref name=seismic&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster Far enough from the fault lines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727103103/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster |date=27 July 2012 }} The National, 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Experts also predict that the possibility of a [[tsunami]] in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.&lt;ref name=seismic/&gt;

[[File:Dubai Creek, UAE (4325886562).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Abra (boat)|Abras]]'' on the [[Dubai Creek]]]]The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees such as the [[eucalypts]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[houbara bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[fennec fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the [[hammour]]. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, [[dugong]], dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the [[hawksbill|hawksbill turtle]] and [[green turtle]], which are listed as endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html Flora and fauna of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html |date=2 July 2009 }} gowealthy.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp Natural UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010401/http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp |date=26 January 2010 }} UAE Interact.

Dubai Creek runs northeast-southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] and is flanked by the emirate of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the east and the town of [[Al Aweer]] in the south. The [[Dubai International Airport]] is located south of Deira, while the [[Palm Deira#The Palm, Deira|Palm Deira]] is located north of Deira in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek, on the [[Jumeirah]] coastal belt. [[Port Rashid]], [[Jebel Ali]], [[Burj Al Arab]], the [[Palm Jumeirah]] and theme-based free-zone clusters such as [[Business Bay]] are all located in this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justproperty.com/en/floorplans/ |title=Dubai Floor Plan &amp; Area Map |accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the [[Palm Islands]] and [[The World (archipelago)|The World]] archipelago.

[[File:Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum at the World Economic Forum Summit on the Global Agenda 2008 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], the [[Emir]] of Dubai]]
Dubai has been ruled by the [[Al Maktoum]] family since 1833; the emirate is a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the [[Federal National Council]] of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], is also the Vice President and [[Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates]] and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.&lt;ref name=uaegovt&gt;US Library of Congress – Legislative Branches&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dubai Municipality]] (DM) was established by the then-ruler of Dubai, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities.&lt;ref name=dmhistory&gt;Organizational Chart. Dubai Municipality&lt;/ref&gt; DM is chaired by [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], deputy ruler of Dubai, and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an [[e-Government]] project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dubai Municipality's e-government initiative. Powerpoint. 2 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Julia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |title=Raw sewage threat to booming Dubai |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172040/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7663883.stm |archivedate=3 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
The [[Dubai Police Force]], founded in 1956 in the locality of [[Naif]], has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Gulf-Law.com&lt;/ref&gt; The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and [[Sharia law|Sharia Court]], which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.&lt;ref name="judicial"&gt;UAE Consulate of the United States&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights organisations have heavily criticised violations of human rights in Dubai.

Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by [[Human Rights Watch]] as "less than humane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/uae1106/|title=Human Rights Watch – Building Towers, Cheating Workers: Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in the United Arab Emirates|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124105/http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/uae1106/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/uae1106/uae1106web.pdf|author=Human Rights Watch|title=Building Towers, Cheating Workers: Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in the United Arab Emirates|edition=PDF|access-date=12 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144614/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/uae1106/uae1106web.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=UAE to allow construction unions |date=30 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423122628/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |archivedate=23 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dubaifire"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6277613.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Dubai fire investigation launched |date=19 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929224627/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6277613.stm |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult-to-make documentary, ''Slaves in Dubai'' (2009).&lt;ref name="Slaves in Dubai documentary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/video/the-slaves-of-dubai |title=Slaves in Dubai documentary |publisher=VICE |year=2009 |access-date=18 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116012730/http://www.vice.com/video/the-slaves-of-dubai |archivedate=16 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were 'misguided'. The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities, who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses, including the conditions of construction workers. Towards the end of March 2006, the government had announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: "Labourers will be allowed to form unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |accessdate = 24 April 2006 |publisher = BBC News |title = UAE to allow construction unions |date = 30 March 2006 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060423122628/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |archivedate = 23 April 2006 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various [[architectural styles]]. Many modern interpretations of [[Islamic architecture]] can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as [[Al Hashemi]] and [[Aedas]], but also by top firms of New York and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Karim, Luiza [http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930191053/http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm |date=30 September 2009 }}. AlShindagah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent addition to the magnificent skyline of Dubai is the 150 meter high [[Dubai Frame]] (Arabic: برواز دبي) located in Zabeel Park, Dubai. It has been described by ''The Guardian'' as "the biggest picture frame on the planet", however is also controversial as the "biggest stolen building of all time". It is alleged that the designer Fernando Donis had his intellectual property stolen and was denied credit for the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/dubai-frame-uaes-latest-surreal-landmark-frames-a-controversy|title=Dubai Frame: UAE's latest surreal landmark frames a controversy |website=The Guardian|date=1 Jan 2018|accessdate=1 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result of this boom, modern Islamic – and world – architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than {{convert|2/3|km|ft|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1/3|km|ft|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|1/4|km|ft|abbr=on}} [[List of cities with most skyscrapers|than any other city]]. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the [[Burj Khalifa]] (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world's tallest building at {{convert|829.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower [[hymenocallis]] which is native to the Dubai region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/language/en-us/the-tower/design.aspx |title=Design of Burj Khalifa |publisher=Burjkhalifa.ae |accessdate=20 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228235427/http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/language/en-us/the-tower/design.aspx |archivedate= 28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s, and took on a rapid pace of construction unparalleled in modern human history during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world's tallest skyline {{as of|2010|January|4|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Ten Tallest Cities In 2012, the JW Marriott Marquis Dubai opened and is the World's tallest hotel, standing at 72 stories (1,165&amp;nbsp;ft).|work=Ultrapolis Project|accessdate=3 November 2010|url=http://www.ultrapolisproject.com/ultrapolis_world_tallest_skylines_cities.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609163127/http://www.ultrapolisproject.com/ultrapolis_world_tallest_skylines_cities.htm|archivedate=9 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ultrapolisproject.com/Tallest_25_Skylines_Cities.htm |title=Calculated Average Height of the Twenty-five Tallest (CAHTT) |publisher=Ultrapolisproject.com |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502130623/http://ultrapolisproject.com/Tallest_25_Skylines_Cities.htm |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Top, Burj Khalifa, the world's highest observatory deck with an outdoor terrace is one of Dubai's most popular tourist attractions, with over 1.87 million visitors in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burj Khalifa records over 1.87 million visitors in 2013 |url=http://khaleejtimes.com/business/local/burj-khalifa-records-over-1.87-million-visitors-in-2013 |publisher=khaleejtimes.com |accessdate=23 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224053154/http://khaleejtimes.com/business/local/burj-khalifa-records-over-1.87-million-visitors-in-2013 |archivedate=24 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many international news agencies such as [[Reuters]], [[Associated Press Television News|APTN]], [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]] (MBC) operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as [[Dubai One]] (formerly Channel 33), and [[Dubai TV]] (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. ''[[Dar Al Khaleej]]'', ''[[Al Bayan (newspaper)|Al Bayan]]'' and ''[[Al-Ittihad (Emirati newspaper)|Al Ittihad]]'' are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers,&lt;ref name=alkhaleej&gt;[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/New_Chart.pdf Largest-Circulation Arabic Newspapers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614232009/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/New_Chart.pdf |date=14 June 2011 }}.

[[Etisalat]], the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC—better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/etisalat-ramps-up-uae-bandwidth-62960.html|title=Etisalat ramps up UAE bandwidth|date=11 June 2006|publisher=arabianbusiness.com|accessdate=3 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812064751/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/etisalat-ramps-up-uae-bandwidth-62960.html|archivedate=12 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2).&lt;ref name="dxbittopology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isoc.org/isoc/conferences/inet/05/hashim.pdf|title=UAEnicat a Glance|last=Hashim|first=Abdulla|date=5 May 2005|publisher=isoc.org|accessdate=21 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311050524/https://www.isoc.org/isoc/conferences/inet/05/hashim.pdf|archivedate=11 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates.&lt;ref name=etisalatmon&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/united_arab_emirates.pdf United Arab Emirates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909194905/http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/united_arab_emirates.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}.

Internet content is regulated in Dubai.

[[Association football|Football]] and [[cricket]] are the most popular sports in Dubai. Three teams ([[Al Wasl FC]], [[Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC]] and [[Al Nasr SC (Dubai)|Al Nasr SC]]) represent Dubai in [[UAE Pro-League]].&lt;ref name="Dubai Culture"/&gt; Al-Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League, after [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]]. Dubai also hosts both the annual [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and [[The Legends Rock Dubai]] tennis tournaments, as well as the [[Dubai Desert Classic]] golf tournament and the [[DP World Tour Championship, Dubai|DP World Tour Championship]], all of which attract sports stars from around the world.

It also features a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor [http://www.dubaiautodrome.com/kartdrome-main/racing/ Kartdrome], popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders.

====Cricket====
[[File:Dubai Sports City Pak vs Aussies.jpg|thumb|Australia vs. Pakistan at Dubai Sports City Cricket Ground]]
Cricket is followed by Dubai's large community of Indians and Pakistanis alongside the residents from other cricket playing nations (Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, England, Australia, South Africa and Nepal). In 2005, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) moved its headquarters from London to Dubai. The city has hosted several Pakistan matches and two new grass grounds are being developed in [[Dubai Sports City]]. Numerous tournaments also take place in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/icc-moves-to-new-headquarters-in-sports-city-1.64511 |title=ICC moves to new headquarters in Sports City |work=Gulf News |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516021752/http://gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/icc-moves-to-new-headquarters-in-sports-city-1.64511 |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Pakistan played Australia in a One-Day International in Dubai in 2009, not only have top international teams competed in the city, but the emirate is helping to improve the standard of cricket around the world with the ICC Cricket Academy, a training and coaching facility which is used by the world's leading nations. [[Pakistan Super League]] was also played here.

===Dress code===

The Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the "[[abaya]]", a long black robe with a [[hijab]] (the head-scarf which covers the neck and part of the head). Some women may add a [[niqāb|niqab]] which cover the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the "[[thawb|kandurah]]" also referred to as "dishdasha" or even "thawb" (long white robe) and the headscarf ([[keffiyeh|ghotrah]]). The UAE traditional ghotrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called "[[Agal (accessory)|egal]]", which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghotras and tie it round their head like a turban.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The above dress code is never compulsory and many people wear western or other eastern clothing without any problems; but prohibitions on wearing "indecent clothing" or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai's visitors are expected to conform, and are encoded in Dubai's criminal law.&lt;ref name="Criminal Law of Dubai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyersuae.com/court-cases/criminal-law-of-dubai|title=Criminal Law of Dubai|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095228/http://www.lawyersuae.com/court-cases/criminal-law-of-dubai|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE has enforced decency regulations in most public places, aside from waterparks, beaches, clubs, and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-laws-you-must-know-to-stay-out-of-trouble-2012-02-28-1.445519|title=UAE laws you must know to stay out of trouble|last=Leijen|first=Majorie van|newspaper=Emirates 24{{!}}7|access-date=2 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228163649/http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-laws-you-must-know-to-stay-out-of-trouble-2012-02-28-1.445519|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

The school system in Dubai follows that of the United Arab Emirates. {{As of|2009}}, there are 79 public schools run by the Ministry of Education that serve Emiratis and expatriate Arab people as well as 145 private schools.&lt;ref name=pop1/&gt; The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, while most of the private schools use English as their medium of instruction. Most private schools cater to one or more expatriate communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mansell |first=Warwick |title=Expat guide to the UAE: schools |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/7635831/Expat-guide-to-the-UAE-schools.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cV8vxMGV?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/7635831/Expat-guide-to-the-UAE-schools.html |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally a number of schools offer either a CBSE or an Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Indian syllabus. [[The Indian High School, Dubai|The Indian High School]], [[Delhi Private School, Dubai|DPS]], [[Dubai Modern High School, Dubai|DMHS]] are some examples. Similarly, there are also several reputable Pakistani schools offering FBISE curriculum for expatriate children in Dubai.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A number of schools also offer British primary education up to the age of eleven. British style eleven-to-eighteen secondary schools offering General Certificate of Secondary Education and A-Levels include [[Dubai Gem Private School]], [[Dubai British School]], [[English Language School, Dubai|English Language School Pvt.]] Some schools, such as The [[American School of Dubai]], also offer the curriculum of the United States.&lt;ref name=schlist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/schools-dubai.php |title=List of schools in Dubai, Dubai school finder |publisher=Dubaifaqs.com |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428081000/http://www.dubaifaqs.com/schools-dubai.php |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==

[[File:Dubai Al Wasl Rd.jpg|thumb|Dubai's Iranian Hospital]]

Healthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |title=UAE Expo 2020 bid in good health: Dubai gets new hospitals |date=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003659/http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2012, there were also a total of 1,348 medical clinics, 97% of which are operated privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Healthcare Overview|url=http://www.colliers.com/-/media/83E76364901E465986CBF44594578C2A.ashx?la=en-GB|work=Colliers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Dubai phased in mandatory health insurance for all inhabitants, thereby leading to increased demand for medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dubai's mandatory health insurance law comes into force|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/dubais-mandatory-health-insurance-law-comes-into-force|work=The National|date=15 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623010249/http://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/dubais-mandatory-health-insurance-law-comes-into-force|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethnological Museum of Berlin''' ({{lang-de| [[Ethnologisches Museum]] [[Berlin]]}}) is one of the [[Berlin State Museums]] ({{lang-de| [[Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]}}), the de facto national collection of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is presently located in the museum complex in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], along with the [[Museum of Asian Art]] ({{lang-de| [[Museum für Asiatische Kunst]]}}) and the Museum of European Cultures ({{lang-de| [[Museum Europäischer Kulturen]]}}). The museum holds more than 500,000 objects and is one of the largest and most important collections of works of art and culture from outside Europe in the world.&lt;ref name="bedeutung"&gt;Viola König (Hrsg.): ''Ethnologisches Museum Berlin''. Prestel, München 2003. Seite 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Its highlights include important objects from the [[Sepik River]], [[Hawaii]], the [[Kingdom of Benin]], [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Tanzania]], [[China]], the [[Pacific Coast]] of North America, [[Mesoamerica]], the Andes, as well as one of the first [[ethnomusicology]] collections of sound recordings (the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]])

The Ethnological Museum was founded in 1873 and opened its doors in 1886 as the Royal Museum for Ethnology ({{lang-de| Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde}}), but its roots go back to the 17th century [[Kunstkammer]] of the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia.&lt;ref name="vorgeschichte"&gt;Viola König (Hrsg.): ''Ethnologisches Museum Berlin''. Prestel, München 2003, S.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the museum’s collections expanded in the early twentieth century, the museum quickly outgrew its facility in the center of Berlin on Königgrätzer Straße (today named Stresemannstraße).&lt;ref name="gründung"&gt;Viola König (Hrsg.): ''Ethnologisches Museum Berlin''. Prestel, München 2003, S. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; A new building was erected in Dahlem to house the museum’s store rooms and study collections. In the Second World War, the main building of the museum was heavily damaged. It was demolished in 1961, and the buildings in Dahlem (in what was then [[West Berlin]]) were reconfigured to serve as the museum’s exhibition spaces. 
 
Following German reunification, although many of the Berlin museum collections were relocated, the collections of the Ethnological Museum remained in Dahlem. Starting in 2000, concrete plans were developed to relocate the collections back to the center of the city. As a result, in 2019, the Ethnological Museum and Museum of Asian Art are scheduled to reopen in the [[Humboldt Forum]] in the reconstructed [[Berlin City Palace]] ({{lang-de| [[Berliner Stadtschloss]]}})  immediately south of the main [[Museum Island]] complex.

==Collections==
Beginning in January 2016, the Ethnological Museum began the process of dismantling its exhibitions in preparation for its move to the [[Humboldt Forum]].  Until January 2017, the museum will remain open to the public, and its permanent exhibitions of works from Africa, Mesoamerican archaeology, and South Asia can still be viewed.  Highlights include the collections of painted [[Maya people|Maya]] vases and drinking cups, [[Benin bronzes]], sculpture from [[Cameroon]], and power figures from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

The collections themselves encompass more than 500,000 from around the world. In addition, the museum holds more than 280,000 historical photographs, a substantial archive, more than 125,000 sound recordings, and 20,000 ethnographic films. The collection is organized according to geography as well as methodological approaches. The main divisions are Africa, Oceania, East-and North-Asia, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia, American ethnology, American archaeology, and ethnomusicology.  The museum also houses a specialized reference library of more than 140,000 volumes relating to ethnology, non-European art, and global art.

These collections are all housed in the museum complex in Dahlem. Long-term plans are being made to relocate the collections not on display to [[Friedrichshagen]], an eastern suburb of Berlin, where the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] ({{lang-de|  [[Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz]]}}) has already constructed storage facilities for the [[Berlin State Library]] ({{lang-de|  [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]]}}).

== Architecture ==
[[File:Berlin-Kreuzberg Postkarte 058.jpg|thumb|First museum building on [[Niederkirchnerstraße|Prinz-Albrecht-Straße]] (l.) and Königgrätzer Straße (r.)]]
The museum's first building in the center of Berlin on Königgrätzer Straße (now Stresemannstraße at the corner with [[Niederkirchnerstraße]]) was already too small to accommodate the collections when it opened in 1886.&lt;ref name="gründung"/&gt; The situation deteriorated further in the last years of the nineteenth century, as the collections expanded rapidly because of increased institutional support for ethnology and the growth of the German overseas colonial empire after the [[Berlin Conference]].

[[Image:Arminallee 23-27 Berlin-Dahlem.JPG|thumb|Entrance of the Bruno Paul building on Arnimallee]]
By 1906, the first construction began on a second facility for the museum in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]]. The museum intended to use space in Dahlem to store and conduct research on the large collections, but to continue to exhibit portions of the collection in the building in the city center. Plans were developed for a large complex in Dahlem, consisting of four large buildings, one for each of the non-European geographical regions of the globe: Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, the latter department directed by [[Konrad Theodor Preuss]]. Construction began in 1914, the architect [[Bruno Paul]] was commissioned to build the structure to house the Asian collections on Arnimallee, Dahlem. The work was stopped, however, because of the First World War and was only completed in 1921. However, the museum lacked the resources to erect the other three planned buildings. The museum continued to function with two separate facilities housing its collections until the Second World War.

Following the Second World War, as a result of the division of Berlin, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation decided to house the portions of the [[Gemäldegalerie]] (Picture Gallery) that were returned to West Berlin in the Bruno Paul building. This decision required moving the collections of the Ethnological Museum to a new facility. The architect [[Fritz Bornemann]] developed plans for an extension to the Bruno Paul building, which was erected from 1966 to 1970. The Bornemann building faced onto Lansstraße with an uncompromisingly [[modernist]] pavilion and contrasted sharply with the older [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] Bruno Paul structure, with its main entrance on Arnimallee.

'''''Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States''''', by [[Min Zhou]] and [[Carl L. Bankston]] III is one of the most influential books on the [[Vietnamese American]] experience. Published in 1998 by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], it is widely used in college classes on international migration, contemporary American history, and Asian Studies. The book emphasizes the role of Vietnamese communities in promoting the adaptation of Vietnamese American young people. 

One of the unique characteristics of the book is its combination of a general history of the growth and nature of Vietnamese American communities around the United States with an in-depth study of one specific Vietnamese community, on the eastern edge of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. 

==Organization of the book==
Chapter 1 traces the history of Vietnamese settlement in the United States, giving special attention to how the process of refugee resettlement and popular opinions of the American public have influenced Vietnamese American children. Chapter 2 gives a description of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the U.S. Vietnamese population and describes the social and economic challenges facing the Vietnamese. Chapter 3 offers examples of how families and surrounding ethnic communities can serve as sources of [[social capital]] for young people. Chapter 4 discusses the patterns of social and kinship relations in Vietnamese ethnic communities. Here, Zhou and Bankston develop their theory that ethnic social relations can serve as a form of social capital for young people growing up in immigrant communities. Chapter 5 examines how Vietnamese language abilities promote the adaptation of young Vietnamese to American society by connecting them to the supports of their families and communities. Chapter 6 considers Vietnamese American adaptation to American schools and argues that generally high levels of school performance are products of tightly integrated ethnic communities. Chapter 7 examines bicultural conflict and gender role issues faced by Vietnamese growing up in the United States. Chapter 8 discusses peer group associations and problems of [[juvenile delinquency]]. It provides evidence that young people who follow delinquent patterns tend to be those who assimilate to the youth culture of Vietnamese and other subgroups, rather than remain bound within their ethnic communities. Chapter 9 gives a general summary and offers conclusions of relevance to the study of immigrant and minority groups in the United States.

==Critical reception==
''Growing Up American'' has received widespread critical praise. Writing in the journal ''Social Forces'', reviewer Jiannbin Shiao described the analysis of delinquency in the Vietnamese community as “contestable but refreshingly bold” and described it as “a fine contribution to the sociology of education, social stratification, social demography, Asian American Studies, and, one hopes, also U.S. urban policy.” In the ''[[International Migration Review]]'', Kimberly Goyette praised the book for “…elaborat[ing] a detailed and elegant framework for conceptualizing the relationship between children and their various environments and also the relationship between these environments.” Kelly Chong, reviewing the book for the ''American Journal of Sociology'', observed “this comprehensive investigation of the adaptation process of second generation Vietnamese in the United States fills an important gap in the study of contemporary “new” immigrants and the second generation assimilation experience.”

In addition to the praise, though, reviewers have also had some reservations. In particular, critics have questioned the generalizability of the books findings to other ethnic groups and they have suggested the book may be too optimistic in its account of the future of young Vietnamese Americans. Critics of more radical orientations have often objected the authors’ acceptance of American society and the focus on adapting to that society. For example, Karin Aguilar-San Juan, in the book ''Little Saigons: Staying Vietnamese in America'', accuses Zhou and Bankston of ignoring the processes of racialization and systemic racism in encouraging Asian immigrant achievement while frustrating black American achievement.

'''''Herman Hedning''''' (lit. Herman the Heathen, known as '''''Marwin Meathead''''' in English editions) is a humorous [[comic strip]] from [[Sweden]] drawn and written by [[Jonas Darnell]].

==The story==
The comic has three main protagonists, Herman Hedning (Marwin Meathead), Gammelman (Oldhead) and Lilleman (Shorthead).

'''Marwin Meathead''' is fat, sadistic, greedy, lazy and self-important; he possesses all the bad qualities one can possibly find in a thinking human being. Always wearing his helmet and carrying a weapon, a wooden club with a huge nail right through it. It is revealed to be made of the corewood of an Arch-oak. He is unstoppable in plotting against his two buddies - Oldhead and Shorthead. Despite his sadism, brute nature and professed lack of any kind of intelligence, he's shown to be quite intelligent when it comes to certain subjects, as well as being shown at times to be extremely cunning when it comes to finding ways to make money, often taking advantage of the trusting nature of others.

'''Shorthead''' is often the target for Marwin’s evil plans - he is a kind, naive, nature-loving soul who wants to be everybody’s friend. At times, however, he's been shown to be just as malicious towards Marwin, switching from pitying him and outright despising him, being perfectly willing to let him suffer from the consequences of his own actions.

'''Oldhead''' with his glasses and beard, grumpy and blasé, is quite happy to simply sit back and watch Marwin and Shorthead beating the living daylights out of each other. He often does this from his laboratory, where he invents various dooms-day machines and more or less necessary gadgets to reform the world. Like the others, he has been shown to be able of extreme greed, malice and violent outbursts, putting others on the line if it benefits his research. Much like Shorthead, however, he's been shown to be very compassionate and kind, even towards meathead. These instances are few and far between, though.

==History==
Herman Hedning first appeared in 1988 in "[[Fantomen]]" (the Swedish edition of [[The Phantom]]).
Since then [[Jonas Darnell]] has written over 700 strips, and a number of lengthier stories, typically 8-10 pages. About 680 have been translated into English. The first of twenty albums was released in 1990, and the first magazine in 1998. Since 1998 there have been 130 issues, or eight per year, except for 1998 and 1999, with two and six issues respectively, and a few years where nine issues were published.

==Popularity==
Herman Hedning is published in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]], and is a steady seller, outlasting many of its contemporaries.

==Recurring characters==
'''Supporting protagonists'''

'''The Creator''' - A parody of the Christian god. Posing a large beard and an anonymous black line over his eyes, he is the one who is "Incredibly responsible of precisely everything on Earth". Sometime after creating the world, he starts using a device called "The Holy Laptop", a computer capable of instantly creating pretty much anything. This device is sometimes the target of interest for some, including Marwin, Oldhead, The Devil and The Prime Computer. He is very keen on experimenting, such as replacing all organic life forms and vegetables on earth with robots and plastic. It is revealed that he created Marwin, Shorthead and Oldhead in his own image, but found the result to be "So damned ugly" that he had to start again with Adam and Eve.

'''Ragnar''' - a Big, Purple dinosaur of unknown species. He is the closest Marwin have to a friend, often partaking in his schemes to mess with everyone and everything. Just like Marwin, he enjoys drinking and fighting.

'''Adam and Eve ''' - Two humans, that were created after Marwin and co. Their two sons, Kain and Abel look just like Marwin, or as their loving father, compassionately put it, "Became disgusting, empty-headed freaks", because of Marwin's mere presence and incredibly bad influence during Eve's pregnancy. Not quite allies, but neither evil, they show a uninterest in Oldhead and Shorthead, and contempt for Marwin

'''Antagonists'''

'''The devil''' - or the red Airhead as Marwin calls him, is a parody of [[Satan]]. He is red, has horns, a long tail, and, from time to time, big wings and a moustache. He is evil and loves everything evil. He is by far the most recurring villain in the comics. Always trying to make people suffer, in one way or another, always failing miserably. These attempts involves trying to pollute the world on a massive scale, trying to heat the world up to an incredible level, giving the Holy Laptop a Panic-anxiety-virus, among other schemes. He was originally an Angel who was testing a "Flaming Sword", When Marwin arrived. He stole the sword, and accidentally torched the Angel's wings, thus making it impossible for him to get home. He was then ordered to "Create a subterranean Sister-corporation", which he dug out himself and called Hell, because it was "Hot as Hell".
He is shown to have a vast storage of "spareparts", such as heads, and gallbladders. One of the latter is currently worn by Marwin as pants. It is shown in the episode "Fan i Helvete" that the devil created the tick to pest Marwin. The tick almost instantly died from drinking Marwin's blood.

'''The Pandora-Department''' - Bureaucrats. The ultimate Doomsday-device. A gigantic temple, filled with mummified bureaucrats. It was created by the devil in an earlier version of the creation. It managed to create global collapse and world war simultaneously, forcing god to start over, and the Devil hid it as a virus on the Holy Laptop, recreating it once it upon restart. Outwards, it resembles, and works, like a multi adapter for electricity, making it capable of connecting to any group, like a corporation, bank or Soccer-club, and through the use of incredibly complicated bureaucracy, turn it into a babbling looneybin in an instant. The Devil created it to connect it to the Creators office, and get revenge for being kicked out of Heaven. This plan was foiled by Marwin. It later returns as P.U.R.G.A.T.O.R.Y (Special Unit For Soul Evaluation and Failed Abbreviations). The bureaucrats reappear from time to time as Lawyers, Court Notaries and the like.

'''The Prime computer ''' - A computer originally built by Oldhead. He strikes a deal with Shorthead to get rid of Marwin and after a gruesome fight chases Marwin to the edge of a cliff. Marwin then tricks him to not kill him by illuminating the paradox of The Prime Computer, A wonder of Artificial Intelligence, the complete opposite of Marwin, a not-so-great wonder of Unartificial Unintelligence, being unable to use brute force since he is obviously above that. While debating on this, Marwin kicks The Prime Computer off the cliff and destroying him. He appears again in a later episode in a more robotic form, this time attempting to steal the Holy Laptop. This plan was foiled and the prime computer was seemingly destroyed. He reappears in a later episode, however, having teamed up with the villain Klustero. How he managed to do so is never specified. Their plan foiled, they return in the following episode which has the theme Online games such as WoW and Runescape. He is again beaten and, in true Supervillain-fashion, vows revenge on the world.

'''The Apocalypse''' - the master of Chaos, the real-estate manager of destruction, crusher of mountains, swallower of oceans and kicker of small white dogs. He is skinny, dry and wears a horned helmet. He resides on the moon, which is made completely of lard, with four centaurs known as the four roadies of the apocalypse. They work backstage to him and other musicians. In his first appearance, the apocalypse creates a lard-powered chaos-generator (this does not impress Marwin since he has been that his whole life) Marwin destroys it though. He participates in Marwins Roleplaying games as well as Hunting competition. Later he receives the chessboard of war. A recurring joke is Marwin being unable of pronouncing his name correctly. To date Marwin has only called The apocalypse by his true name a few times, and that by accident. It is unknown if this inability is stupidity or arrogance from Marwin.

'''''Historische Sprachforschung''''' is an annual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] [[historical linguistics]]. It was established by [[Adalbert Kuhn]] in 1852 as the ''Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung'' (''Journal of Comparative Linguistics''; colloquially referred to as ''Kuhns Zeitschrift'') and obtained its present title in 1988. It is the second oldest linguistics journal still in publication{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and subsumes the former ''Beiträge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung'' or ''Kuhn-Schleichlers Beiträge'' (1852-1874) and the ''Beiträge zur Kunde der indogermanischen Sprachen'' or ''Bezzenbergers Beiträge'' (1877-1906).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Martin Kümmel (University of Jena), Olav Hackstein, and Sabine Ziegler. The journal is published by Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.

In [[Canada]], [[statute]]s are one of the primary sources of [[law]]. A statute ends with housekeeping provisions, which are sections covering the details of the statute, such as the date of coming into force and the right of officials who administer the statute to make [[regulations]] under the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Kerr, JoAnn Kurtz, and Arlene Blatt, ''Legal Research: Step by Step'', 3rd Ed.

{{Intellectual property}}

The '''idea–expression divide''' or '''idea–expression dichotomy''' limits the scope of [[copyright]] protection by differentiating an [[idea]] from the expression or manifestation of that idea.

The [[Computer Programs Directive|European Union Software Directive]], Article 1.2, for example, expressly excludes from copyright ideas and principles that underlie any element of a computer program, including those that underlie its interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite web|author=Mylly, Ulla=Maija|title=Harmonizing Copyright Rules for Computer Program Interface Protection|publisher=University of Louisville Louis D. Brandeis School of Law|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=14|url=http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605051113/http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:111:0016:0022:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by the European Court of Justice in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1446134154470&amp;uri=CELEX:62010CJ0406 SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd.], "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."

In the United States the 1879 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Baker v. Selden]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|101|99|1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated this doctrine, holding that, while exclusive rights to the "[[useful arts]]" (in this case [[bookkeeping]]) described in a book might be available by patent, only the description itself was protectable by copyright. In ''[[Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]]'', 471 U.S. 539, 556 (1985), the Supreme Court stated that "copyright's idea/expression dichotomy 'strike[s] a definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author's expression.'" (internal citation omitted). Additionally, in ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'', 347 U.S. 201, 217 (1954), the Supreme Court stated "Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea—not the idea itself."

Some of the [[criticism of intellectual property|criticism directed at "intellectual property"]] is based on the confusion between [[patent]]s, which may confer [[Property|proprietary]] rights in relation to general ideas and concepts ''per se'' when construed as methods, and copyrights, which cannot confer such rights.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
An [[adventure novel]] provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any [[art]]work contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or [[genre]] of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a [[quest]], but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are [[patentability|patentable]], they may be the subject of various [[claim (patent)|patent claims]], which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. [[Arthur C. Clarke]], for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a [[geostationary satellite]] used as a [[telecommunications]] relay) in a 1945 paper that it was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed (independently{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}) at [[Bell Labs]].

In the English decision of ''[[Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers Limited]]'' (1938) Ch 106, the court illustrated the concept by stating that "the person who has clothed the idea in form, whether by means of a picture, a play or a book" owns the copyright. In the Australian decision of ''[[Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co. Ltd v. Taylor]]'' (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 498, Latham CJ used the analogy of reporting a person's fall from a bus: the first person to do so could not use the law of copyright to stop other people from announcing this fact.

==Scènes à faire==
Some courts have recognized that particular ideas can be expressed effectively only by using certain elements or background. The [[French language|French]] name for this doctrine is ''[[Scènes à faire]]''. Therefore, even the expression in these circumstances is unprotected, or extremely limited to verbatim copying only. This is true in the United Kingdom and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lai, Stanley|year=1999|chapter=Chapter V: The Position of ''Scenes a Faire'' in English Law|title=The Copyright Protection of Computer Software in the United Kingdom|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Hart Publishing|pages=54–56|isbn=978-1-84113-087-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] it is recognized that certain background elements are universal or at least commonplace in some types of work. For example, in ''Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.'', 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986), the [[Second Circuit]] said that in a film about cops in the South Bronx it was inevitable that the scenery would include drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes, and rats. In ''Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.'', 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993), the Tenth Circuit held that hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices were unprotectable scenes a faire for computer programs. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx ''scène à faire'', but further similarity such as the film having as characters "a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage surely goes beyond the South Bronx ''scène à faire''. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre."

==Merger==
A broader but related concept is the merger doctrine. Some ideas can be expressed intelligibly only in one or a limited number of ways. The rules of a game provide an example.&lt;ref&gt;''Morrissey v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.'', 379 F.2d 675 (1st Cir. 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the expression merges with the idea and is therefore not protected.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.'', 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States federal courts|United States courts]] are divided on whether merger constitutes a defense to infringement or prevents copyrightability in the first place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F.3d 1339, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2014)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15197092051369647665&amp;q=oracle+v.+google&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often pleaded as an [[affirmative defense]] to [[copyright infringement]].

==Look and feel==
In August 2013, [[Robin Thicke]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and [[T.I.]] had a [[lawsuit]] filed against them by the [[Personal_life_of_Marvin_Gaye|family]] and [[estate (law)|estate]] of [[Marvin Gaye]] regarding their song "[[Blurred Lines]]"; the family had argued that "Blurred Lines" had copied the "feel" and "sound" of the Marvin Gaye song "[[Got to Give It Up]]" (which Thicke cited as an influence on the song), contradicting the [[idea-expression]] divide.&lt;ref name=thr-blurredripoff&gt;{{cite news|title=Robin Thicke Sues to Protect 'Blurred Lines' from Marvin Gaye's Family (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/robin-thicke-sues-protect-blurred-607492|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=18 August 2013|first=Eriq|last=Gardner|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-blurred-lines-reaction-brian-wilson-bonnie-mckee-20150314-story.html#page=1 |title=Brian Wilson, Bonnie McKee and others react to 'Blurred Lines' verdict – LA Times |first= Randy|last= Lewis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 2015-03-14|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, a court ruled that, despite not sharing the same chords, lyrics, or other copyrightable elements, "Blurred Lines" had infringed on the copyrights of "Got to Give It Up" by copying its feel and sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020151203A30/Williams%20v.%20Bridgeport%20Music,%20Inc.

[[File:James L. Swauger.jpg|thumb|right|Swauger during his career]]

'''James L. Swauger''' (November 1, 1913 – December 18, 2005) was an American [[archaeologist]] known for his work on the [[petroglyph]]s of the [[Ohio River]] valley of the [[United States]].  A native of [[West Newton, Pennsylvania|West Newton]] in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;Murphy, James L. "In Memoriam: James L. Swauger (1913-2005)," ''Ohio Archaeologist'', v. 57 no. 1 (Winter 2007), 41&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Edgewood, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Edgewood]] in his youth; there he lived for most of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=pg&gt;Pitz, Marylynne.  [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05358/627448-122.stm Obituary: James L. Swauger/Associate director of Carnegie Museum of Natural History].  ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', December 24, 2005.  Accessed 2010-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 22, Swauger began working for Pittsburgh's [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]; he started as an archaeology and ethnology assistant.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  Swauger was awarded a bachelor's degree in [[zoology]] in 1941 from the [[University of Pittsburgh]].  During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] with the rank of [[First Lieutenant]]; after his 1946 discharge,&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; he resumed his position at the Carnegie Museum,&lt;ref name=pg /&gt; and he returned to the University of Pittsburgh to earn an [[Master of Letters|M. Litt]] in history.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;  Swauger was promoted to the position of archaeology and ethnology [[curator]] in 1949; as his career progressed, he became an associate director of the museum in 1955, received the title of "Senior Scientist" in 1976, and was made a curator [[emeritus]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;

Swauger was largely responsible for the modern [[anthropology]] program at the Carnegie Museum, which had fallen into abeyance in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  After conducting research in locations as varied as [[Nebraska]] and southern [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; he received significant grants in the 1950s to begin the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] and [[Fort Duquesne]] at the present site of [[Point State Park]] in downtown Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  In connection with these excavations, Swauger helped to found the Upper Ohio Valley Archaeology Survey.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;

During the 1950s, Swauger began to be professionally interested in the study of Native American [[rock art]]; he concentrated on the upper Ohio River valley region,&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; although his studies also encompassed some of the petroglyphs of the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;  As a part of this specialty, he aided in founding multiple [[academic conference]]s on the subject of rock art, including a 1970 conference in [[Virginia]] that was the first of its kind anywhere in the eastern part of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrara.org/about.html A Short History of the Eastern States Rock Art Research Association], Eastern States Rock Art Research Association, 2007.  Accessed September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his writings was a book known as ''Rock Art of the Upper Ohio Valley'', which has been regarded as a leading work in the archaeology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Schaafsma, Polly.  ''Indian Rock Art of the Southwest''.  [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]: [[University of New Mexico Press|U of New Mexico P]], 1986, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  This book was one of nearly three hundred works on anthropology and [[museology]] that Swauger published; additionally, he produced extensive notes, amounting to at least nineteen volumes by 1979.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;  Although he retired in 1981,&lt;ref name=pg /&gt; he continued to work actively as late as 1996, both visiting petroglyph sites and publishing new writings.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;  Besides his work in archaeology, he was known as a master organizer; soon after taking the assistant director position at the Carnegie Museum, he personally reorganized a massive collection of [[entomology|entomological]] information that had previously been in disarray, and this pattern he continued throughout the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;

In late 2005, Swauger died of [[pneumonia]] at a nursing home in [[Johnston, Rhode Island]], aged ninety-two.  He was survived by his son and two daughters, along with multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  In the aftermath of his death, he was recalled as an "ageless" figure who had created a benchmark for every other archaeologist working in western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=pg /&gt;

==Life==
Allen was the son of [[George Baugh Allen]].  He was educated at [[King's College School]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]] and [[King's College London]].  In 1867 he was articled to [[George Fosbery Lyster]], engineer in chief to the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]], with whom he remained until 1870. He was next employed as resident engineer to the Persian railways of [[Paul Reuter|Baron de Reuter]] and afterwards in supervising the construction of docks at [[Leith]] and at [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Allen, John Romilly|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Allen was interested in archaeology; and he spent the rest of his life on it, and particularly on the study of prehistoric antiquities and of pre-Norman art in [[Great Britain]]. His earliest contribution was to ''Archæologia Cambrensis'' ("A description of some cairns on Barry Island"), appearing in April 1873; he joined the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]] in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became one of two editors of its ''Journal'' in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death. Having begun with the antiquities of [[Wales]], Allen from 1880 gave attention to those of [[Scotland]] also; in 1883 he was elected fellow of the [[Scottish Society of Antiquaries]], and in 1885 was [[Rhind Lecture]]r in archaeology in the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In [[England]], he became fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1896, editor of the ''Reliquary and Illustrated Archæologist'' in 1893; and [[Yates Lecture]]r in archæology in [[University College, London]], for 1898.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Allen was unmarried, and during his later years made his home in London, where he died on 5 July 1907.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
In addition to contributions to archaeological journals, Allen published:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

# ''Theory and Practice in the Designs and Construction of Dock Walls'', 1876. 
# ''Early Christian Symbolism in Great Britain and Ireland'' ([[Rhind Lectures]]), 1887.

'''Jules Feller''' (4 November 1859, [[Roubaix]] &amp;ndash; 29 April 1940, [[Verviers]]) was a  [[Belgian]] academician and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] militant.

==Biography==
Jules Feller created the 'Feller system' ('[[:fr:Système Feller]]') of spelling for the Walloon language. This is also used for writing the [[Picard language]] since a consensus arose between universities in favour of the written form known as 'Feller-Carton' (based on the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] spelling system &amp;ndash; which was developed by Feller and adapted for Picard by Prof. [[Fernand Carton]]).

He represented [[Verviers]] in the [[:fr:Assemblée wallonne|Walloon Assembly]] from 1919 until his death. He was a member of the  [[Académie royale de langue et de littérature françaises de Belgique|Royal Academy of French Language and Literature]] in Belgium.

The [[Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction]] (previously called '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' (2013), '''Orange Prize for Fiction''' (1996–2006 &amp; 2009–12) and '''Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction''' (2007–2008) and to be presented as the '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' once again from 2018) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7137156.stm|title = Life after Orange Prize success|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=28 December 2007|last=Pryor|first=Fiona|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallisland&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1499760/Small-Island-voted-best-Orange-prize-winner-of-past-decade.html |title = Small Island voted best Orange prize winner of past decade|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=12 April 2008|last=Reynolds|first=Nigel|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/orangeprizeforfiction2005.orangeprizeforfiction|title = Stranger than fiction|accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=11 June 2005|last=Forna|first=Aminatta|work=The Guardian  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |title=Entry rules and regulations |accessdate=7 June 2009 |publisher=Orange |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427160248/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |archivedate=27 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of [[Mitsubishi]] but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name=womenstudies/&gt;  Funding from [[Orange (UK)|Orange]], a UK [[mobile network operator]] and [[Internet service provider]], allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female "journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers", including current Honorary Director [[Kate Mosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |publisher=Orange |accessdate=17 June 2009 |title=Prize history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425143335/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |archivedate=25 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article4263530.ece | title = The Times Summer Books: Stories by Kate Mosse| accessdate =7 June 2009 |work=The Times |date=3 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |title=Why are the Orange Prize for Fiction and Award for New Writers only open to women? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106132247/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/28/fiction.stephaniemerritt|work=The Guardian |title = The model of a modern writer|first=Stephanie|last=Merritt|accessdate=10 June 2009|date=28 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 [[Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/20/news|title = Orange Prize longlist announced|work=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2009|date=20 March 2000 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winner of the prize receives [[Pound sterling|£]]30,000, along with a [[bronze sculpture]] called the ''Bessie'' created by artist [[Grizel Niven]], the sister of actor and writer [[David Niven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |title=What do winners win? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=7 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321050619/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |archivedate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June;  within days the winner is announced.

The [[BBC]] suggests that the prize forms part of the "trinity" of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the [[Costa Book Awards]];  the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7046677.stm| title = 10 ways to get you to read a book |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2009|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levy's 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4985892.stm| title = Science prize seeks new sponsor |accessdate=11 June 2009| date=16 May 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while sales of [[Helen Dunmore]]'s ''[[A Spell of Winter]]'' quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize.&lt;ref name=womenstudies&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women as Readers, Writers, and Judges The Controversy about the Orange Prize for Fiction| first=Britta|last=Zangen|pages=281–299|issn=0049-7878 |journal=Women's Studies |date=April–May 2003 |volume=32 |issue=3|doi = 10.1080/00497870310066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Valerie Martin]]'s 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=Bookseller|page=17|date=7 May 2004|title = Orange authors eye bright futures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: "48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Library triumph for Orange| page=31|date=1 February 2002|work=Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aR6wT5dJd5i4&amp;refer=muse |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=21 April 2009 |title=Robinson, Feldman Make Final Round in Orange Prize for Fiction |first=James |last=Pressley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019212913/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088 |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the prize was founded, [[Auberon Waugh]] nicknamed it the "[[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon]] Prize" while [[Germaine Greer]] claimed there would soon be a prize for "writers with red hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/orangeprizeforfiction2004.orangeprizeforfiction|work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 June 2009|date=6 March 2005|first=Geradline|last=Bedell|title = Textual politics | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, [[A.

No woman has won the award more than once but [[Margaret Atwood]] has been nominated three times without a win.  Since the inaugural award to [[Helen Dunmore]], British writers have won five times, while North American authors have secured the prize nine times.

She completed her master's degree at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts|Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] in [[New York City]] and her PhD at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Martha Leeb is Bride; Fulbright Scholar Married to Dimitri Hadzi in Rome | date=April 7, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her master's studies, Hadzi completed a [[Fulbright]] fellowship, and participated in an [[excavation (archeology)|archeological excavation]] at [[Samothrace]], a Greek island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In 1955, the [[American Academy in Rome]] awarded her their [[Rome Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aarome.org/fellows-affiliated-fellows-residents-1950-1969 | title=Fellows - Affiliated Fellows - Residents 1950-1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fellowship for resident scholarship at the academy. She completed her PhD dissertation on sculptural portraits of [[Gallenius]], a Third Century [[Roman Emperor]], during the fellowship.&lt;ref name=cape&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Cape Cod Times | date=April 1, 2003 | title=Dr. Martha 'Molly' Leeb Hadzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in art history and archeology==

Hadzi served as the corresponding Italy editor for ''[[Art in America]]'', an international magazine for [[contemporary art]], and as a writer for ''[[College Art Association|Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Renaissance Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Arts Magazine | title=Contributors | page=5 | volume=37 | year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working as a professor of art history, she taught classes at [[Bennett College (New York)|Bennett College]]. She also taught at four of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]]: Vassar, [[Smith College]], [[Wellesley College]], and [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref name=cape/&gt; Hadzi achieved notoriety as an authority on [[ancient Greek art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=College Street Journal | date=February 28, 2003 | url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/022803/quidnunc.shtml | title=Quidnunc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In 1954, Hadzi married sculptor [[Dimitri Hadzi]] at [[Capitoline Hill|the Campidoglio]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-dimitri-hadzi-13080 | title=Oral history interview with Dimitri Hadzi, 1981 Jan. 2-1990 Mar. 9 | website=aaa.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children together. Hadzi and Dimitri Hadzi later divorced during the 1980s.

'''Media art history''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that explores the current developments as well as the history and genealogy of [[new media art]], [[digital art]], and [[electronic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubitt, Sean and Paul Thomas. eds. 2013. Relive: Media Art Histories. Cambridge/Mass.: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, Oliver. ed. 2007. MediaArtHistories. Cambridge: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieling, Rudolf and Dieter Daniels. eds. 2004. Media Art Net 1: Survey of Media Art. New York/Vienna: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, media art histories addresses the contemporary interplay of art, technology, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2002. Information Arts. Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2010. Art + Science Now. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Linda. 1983. The Fourth Dimension and Non - Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art . Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, it aims to reveal the historical relationships and aspects of the ‘afterlife’ ([[Aby Warburg]]) in new media art by means of a historical comparative approach. This strand of research encompasses questions of the history of media and perception, of so-called archetypes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Grau, Oliver. 2003. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of [[iconography]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ″Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[new media art]] itself is of great importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. Köln: Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of [[interactivity]], processuality, [[multimedia]], and [[real time (media)|real time]]. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities – more or less its ‘media-specificity’ – of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.

Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‘genre’ of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres). The list of genres that are commonly subsumed under the label of new media art illustrates its broad scope and includes, among others, virtual art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank. 2007.

== Resources and research projects ==

Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/&lt;/ref&gt; platform located in New York, Netzspannung&lt;ref&gt;http://netzspannung.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2005), the database project Compart&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.&lt;ref&gt;http://monoskop.org/Monoskop&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as [[Nettime]] or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community.

In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the [[Ars Electronica]], the [[Transmediale]], the [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and [[SIGGRAPH]] (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, [[ZKM]] (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], or the [[Walker Art Center]]) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin-based DAM – Digital Art Museum).  Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums.

Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued.  These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Art Net.  This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration Liverpool Declaration]. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney;  Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Brasília; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt-University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU’s  Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re-live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/]

== Focus of research ==

Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours – the field is driven by the idea of a ‘deep time of the media’ (S. Zielinski).

Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science ([[Lorraine Daston]], Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science ([[Oliver Grau]], [[Barbara Stafford]], Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, [[Edward A. Shanken]], Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, [[Jonathan Crary]], [[Horst Bredekamp]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Hans Belting]]), [[media studies]] and [[media archaeology]] ([[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Jussi Parikka]], [[ Wolfgang Ernst (media theorist)|Wolfgang Ernst]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], Stephan Oettermann, [[Lev Manovich]]), [[sound studies]] ([[Douglas Kahn]]), [[film studies]] (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczyński), as well as [[computer science]] ([[Frieder Nake]]).

[[Preservation (library and archival science)|Preservation]] of documents, pictures, recordings, digital content, etc., is a major aspect of [[archival science]]. It is also an important consideration for people who are creating [[time capsule]]s, [[family history]], [[historical document]]s, [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] and [[family tree]]s. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future.

==Paper/prints (photos)==
{{Main|Photograph preservation}}

Color [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and ordinary color [[Photographic printing|prints]] may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because [[Color photography|color processing]] results in a less stable image than traditional [[black-and-white]] processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century.

Black-and-white photographic films using [[silver halide]] emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. [[Nitrate film]] was replaced with acetate-base films. These [[Cellulose acetate film]]s were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by [[polyester]] film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than nitrate- and acetate-base films.

Color prints made on most [[inkjet printer]]s look very good at first but they have a very short lifespan, measured in months rather than in years. Even prints from commercial photo labs will start to fade in a matter of years if not processed properly and stored in cool, dry environments.

==Documents/books==
With documents for which the media are not so critical as what the documents contain, the information in documents can be copied by using [[photocopier]]s and [[image scanner]]s. Books and manuscripts can also have their information saved without destruction by using a [[Book scanning|book scanner]].

Where the medium itself needs to be preserved, for example if a document is a crayon sketch by a famous artist on paper, a complex process of preservation may be used. Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media. [[Polyester]] sleeves, [[Acid-free paper|acid-free]] folders, and pH buffered document boxes are common supportive protective enclosures whose selection must match the media’s chemical and physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html | title =Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper| work = Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other considerations in preserving paper/books are:
* Damaging light, particularly [[UV]] light, which fades and destroys media over time by breaking down the molecules.
* Atmosphere contains small traces of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitric acid]] which turn media yellow and break the fibers down.
* Humidity and moisture also aid in the breakdown of media. If there is too much, the document can be attacked by bacteria, and if too little, [[cellulose]] material breaks down.
* Temperature, particularly elevated ones, can destroy some media. Low temperatures can cause the water to form crystals which expands destroying the structure of paper-based documents.

==Online photo albums==
Although there are many websites that allow the [[image hosting service|upload of photographs]] and [[video hosting service|videos]], [[digital preservation]] for the long-term is still an issue.  There is a lack of confidence that such websites are capable of storing data for long periods of time (ex. 50 years) without data degradation or loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster |first=John |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-21546_3-10309283-10253464.html |title=How long is long-term storage? &amp;#124; Data-driven - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical media - CD, DVD==
Optical media, such as [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s, contain an organic dye that distinguishes data reading from data writing based on the dye’s transparency along the disk.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress, "NIST/LC: Optical Disc Longevity Study,"	https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rt/NIST_LC_OpticalDiscLongevity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional CDs and DVDs have finite shelf-life due to natural degradation of the dye; the newer [[M-DISC]] uses different technology to produce DVDs with a claimed lifespan of up to 1000 years. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] lists published life expectancies to be 10 or 25 years or more for normal [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s and conservative life expectancies to be between 2 and 5 years.&lt;ref name ="NARA"&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Optical Storage Media: Storing Temporary Records on CDs and DVDs, National Archives,"	https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/temp-opmedia-faq.html&lt;/ref&gt; Storage environments, such as temperature and humidity, as well as handling conditions such as frequency of media use and compatibility between the recorder and media, affect media shelf-life.&lt;ref name = "UKOLN"&gt;UKOLN, "Digital Archaeology: Rescuing Neglected and Damaged Data Resources,"	http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/papers/supporting/pdf/old-p2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in media storage and migrations to new recording technologies can make certain formats obsolete within their respective lifespan. Technologists have pointed to internet [[streaming media]], where services such as [[video-on-demand]] have contributed to the 33 percent decline in [[DVD]] sales the past 5 years, as a challenge for [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref name="DownfallOfDVD"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Magnetic media - video cassettes, tapes, hard drives==
[[magnetic tape|Magnetic media]] such as [[audio tape|audio]] and [[videotape|video]] tape and [[Floppy disk|floppy disks]] also have limited life spans.

Audio and video tapes require specific care and handling to ensure that the recorded information will be preserved. For information that must be preserved indefinitely, periodic transcription from old media to new ones is necessary, not only because the media are unstable but also because the recording technology may become obsolete.

[[File:Molded VHS tape.jpg|thumb|A badly molded [[VHS]] tape. Mold can grow due to humidity on the storage space, and then prevent modern usage.]]

[[magnetic tape|Magnetic media]] also deteriorates naturally with typical shelf lives between 10 and 20 years.&lt;ref name ="Broadway Video"&gt;Broadway Video Digital Media, "Causes and Measurement of Videotape Decay," http://sportsvideo.org/main/files/2010/08/video-tape-white-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic tape can degrade from binder hydrolysis or magnetic remanence decay. Binder hydrolysis, also known as [[sticky-shed syndrome]], refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape. Tapes which have been stored in hot, humid conditions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon and may suffer from accelerated degradation. Severe binder can cause the magnetic material to fall off or sheds from the base, leaving a pile of dust and clear backing. [[Archivist]]s can [[Tape baking|bake the tape]], which evaporates water molecules on the tape, to temporarily restore the binder before making a copy.

[[Magnetic tape]] can also be destabilized by magnetic [[Data remanence|remanence]] decay, which refers to the weakening of the tape’s magnetization over time. This weakens the affect tape’s readability, leading to reduced sound clarity and volume or picture hue and contrast. Baking the tape will not restore magnetization. [[Archivist]]s might instead digitally encode a copy of the tape, preserving its content as a digital data file.

Media at risk include recorded media such as [[Master recording|master]] audio recordings of symphonies and videotape recordings of the news gathered over the last 40 years. Threats to media that must be considered when archiving important record media include accidental erasure, physical loss due to disasters such as fires and floods, and media degradation.

Along with the actual media being degraded over the years, the machines that are available to play back or reproduce the audio sources are becoming archaic themselves. Manufacturers and their support (parts, technical updates) for their machines have disappeared throughout the years. Even if the medium is vaulted and archived correctly, the mechanical properties of the machines have deteriorated to the point that they could do more harm than good to the tape being played.

Many major film studios are now backing up their libraries by converting them to electronic media files, such as .[[AIFF]] or .[[WAV]]-based files via digital audio workstations. That way, even if the digital platform manufacturer goes out of business or no longer supports their product, the files can still be played on any common computer.

There is a detailed process that must take place previous to the final archival product now that a digital solution is in place. Sample rates and their conversion and reference speed are both critical in this process.

In floppy disks, the lubricants inside the plastic jackets of many older floppies promote the decay of the magnetic medium. Also, the alignment of the magnetic particles of the disk substrate may gradually degrade, leading to a loss of formatting and data. Early laser disk media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to peel apart, damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.

'''Nixtun-Ch’ich‘''' is a [[Itza people|Itza]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in [[Petén Department]], [[Guatemala]]. It has an urban grid with fairly well ordered streets and avenues dated to around 2500 years ago. This is one of the earliest urban grids in the [[Americas]] and likely emerged as the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed more complex forms of [[Political organisation|political organization]]. It was likely a means to regulate and perhaps dominate the [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Nevertheless, the [[Grid plan|grid system]] at Nixtun-Ch’ich’ did not catch on and is not seen in later [[Maya civilization|Maya]] cities.

== Location ==
Nixtun-Ch’ich’ stands on the western edge of [[Lake Petén Itzá]]. It is bordered by the [[lake]] to the [[south]] and [[east]]; by [[karst]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ic hills to the north; and uneven terrain to the west. The area of the site is relatively flat, but it was built upon a low [[ridge]] that extends east to west. [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites are generally dispersed, but Nixtun-Ch’ich’ was laid out with an [[Urban area|urban]] grid. It also includes an ''axis urbis'' composed of a row of over 15 buildings extending east to west. The axis and grid were established in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic period]] (800-400 BC). The site also has major construction in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic period]] (400 BC-AD 200) after which the site appears to have suffered a decline—a trend seen in many sites in central [[Petén Department|Petén]]. The site was also occupied in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic through the Colonial period]] (AD 600-1734).

== Preclassic period ==
During the 1995, 2006-2008, and 2013-2014 seasons at Nixtun-Ch’ich, Proyecto [[Itza people|Itza]] encountered [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] (ca.1000 BC-AD 200) constructions in nearly every test unit [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;d. It was clear that the site’s most substantial constructions occurred before AD 200. In 2013-2014, Proyecto [[Itza people|Itza]] remapped the site and found that it contained an [[Urban area|urban]] grid. In 2015, Proyecto [[Itza people|Itza]] began to intensively investigate the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] occupations along with its work on the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]].

== Late postclassic and colonial period ==
[[File:Nixtun and Tayasal map, Timothy Pugh.jpg|thumb|A map to portray different sections among the excavation]]
[[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic and Colonial period]] [[Human settlement|settlements]] have been found at Nixtun-Ch'ich' in Sector QQ ([[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle to Late Postclassic period]]), Sector WW ([[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle to Late Postclassic period]]), Sector XX ([[Mesoamerican chronology|Contact or Colonial period]]), and Sector ZZ ([[Mesoamerican chronology|Colonial period]]). See map below.

== Underwater Archaeology ==
[[File:Nixtun-Chich-Diving, Timothy Pugh.jpg|thumb|A diver on Lake Peten near Nixtun Ch'ich]]
In 2015, Proyecto [[Itza people|Itza]] initiated a program of [[underwater archaeology]] on [[Lake Petén Itzá]] and began sampling in 2018. The goal of this work is to discern deposits in the lake left as offerings or accidentally dropped into the lake as a result of trade. Proyecto Itza has identified several areas that “look like” [[port]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at Nixtun-Ch’-ich’ and we will test this hypothesis though underwater [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]].

== Nixtun Ch’ich’ documentary ==
In 2017, Proyecto [[Itza people|Itza]] began filming a [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the development of [[Urban planning|city planning]] and the state at Nixtun-Ch’ich’.

{{nihongo|'''Noburu Katagami'''|片上 伸|Katagami Noburu|February 20, 1884 &amp;ndash; March 5, 1928}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] literary critic and a professor of Russian literature at [[Waseda University]]. He is also known as '''Tengen Katagami''' (片上天絃; later 片上天弦).

==Biography==
Katagami was born in [[Ehime]], [[Japan]], and graduated [[Waseda University]] in 1906, majoring [[English literature]]. He supported [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] as an editor of a journal ''[[Waseda bungaku]]''. He became a professor at [[Waseda University]] in 1910, but later he became interested in [[Russian literature]] and traveled to [[Russia]] to study [[Russian literature]] (1915-1918). In 1920, when [[Waseda University]] created a department of [[Russian literature]], Katagami was appointed as the chief professor. [[Masuji Ibuse]], who was one of his students at that time, was harassed sexually by Katagami, so had to leave the university before graduation (1921).

Katagami's literature theory became the basis of [[proletarian literature]] in [[Japan]].

'''Otto J. von Sadovszky''' (July 3, 1925 – May 12, 2004) was a [[Hungarian American]] [[anthropologist]]&lt;ref name=tribute /&gt; who worked at [[California State University, Fullerton]] in southern California for most of his career until his retirement. He is best known for his linguistic work attempting to link Native American languages of California to languages spoken in Siberia.

==Personal life and education==

Sadovszky was born in [[Hungary]] on July 3, 1925 and grew to maturity there during World War II.&lt;ref name=csuf-obit /&gt;  He and his wife Maria raised two children.

Sadovszky received his Ph.L. at Collegium Aloysianum in Italy.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

After leaving Europe for the United States to study Sanskrit at [[UC Berkeley]] he met a graduate student in linguistics who was studying [[Miwok languages|Miwok]], and Sadovszky found that he could understand many of the terms from Miwok, a language of the [[Penutian]] group, despite having no training in it, due to the familiarity of many of the terms to [[Uralic languages]] from central [[Siberia]] he had studied earlier in Europe which were related to his native [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].  Sadovszky moved to Los Angeles to continue his graduate studies at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name=tribute /&gt;

==Academic career==

Sadovszky taught in Germany, and in the U.S. at [[UC Berkeley]], UCLA, and the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] before joining the [[California State University, Fullerton|Cal State Fullerton]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] south of Los Angeles in 1971. He continued working there until his retirement in 1994, even after achieving professor emeritus status in 1991.&lt;ref name=csuf-obit /&gt;

During his tenure as [[professor]] of anthropology at CSUF he claimed to have proven that almost 80 percent{{clarify|date=August 2017}} of the languages spoken by 19 Indian tribes in [[California]] are related to those spoken by two nations in [[Siberia]]. This became known as the Cal-Ugrian Theory.&lt;ref name=csuf-obit&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Emeritus Professor Otto J. Sadovszky Dies |url=https://calstate.fullerton.edu/news/people/2004/250_sandovszky.html |website=Calstate Fullerton.edu |location= |date=May 17, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080436/http://calstate.fullerton.edu/news/people/2004/250_sandovszky.html |archivedate=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2014-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cal-Ugrian theory===

Sadovszky elaborates the Cal-Ugrian theory in his book.&lt;ref name=Cal-Ugrian&gt;{{cite book |last=Von Sadovszky |first=Otto |date=1996 |title=The discovery of California: a Cal-Ugrian comparative study |url={{Google books|wg2DAAAAIAAJ|The discovery of California: a Cal-Ugrian comparative study|plainurl=yes}} |location=Budapest |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |series=ISTOR |volume=3 |page= |isbn=9789630566308 |accessdate=2014-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory describes the relationship between the [[Penutian languages]] native to California (itself a disputed hypothesis) and the [[Ob-Ugric languages]] spoken in Siberia. According to Sadovszky, this relationship is based on more than 10,000 different words and grammatical traits. The Penutian languages were or are spoken in an area along the [[Northern California]] coast from [[Bodega Bay]] to [[Big Sur]]&lt;ref name=magtudin&gt;{{cite web |title=The Discovery of California: Breaking the Silence of the Siberia to America Migrators |last1=Sadovszky |first1=Otto |date=November 1984 |website=Magtudin.org |publisher=Magyarságtudományi Intézet (Institute Of Hungarian Studies) |url=http://www.magtudin.org/otto_sadovszky.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055731/http://www.magtudin.org/otto_sadovszky.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2014-11-27 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as along the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] rivers; the Ob-Ugric languages by 6,000 [[Mansi people|Mansi]] and 17,000 [[Khanty people|Khanty]], east of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]].&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;http://www.fullerton.edu/emeriti/_resources/pdfs/tributes/von%20Sadovszky%20Otto%20Tribute.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One claim of Sadovszky's theory is that the ancestors of some California tribes arrived only 3,000 years ago, which is much more recently than the origin of most tribes in the Americas which according to the generally accepted theory regarding the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] date their original migrations to around 20,000 years ago across the Bering Strait.  In contrast, the migration around 1,000 B.C.E. would have occurred from the [[Ob river]] delta across the Arctic Ocean in summer months and down the American coast.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Billiter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 1985 |title=3,000-Year-Old Connection Claimed : Siberia Tie to California Tribes Cited |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-01/local/me-10267_1_tribes |deadurl=no |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128090656/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-01/local/me-10267_1_tribes |archivedate=2014-11-28  |accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====

The Cal-Ugrian theory was not well accepted in the United States, with some linguists noting that he was not trained in comparative linguistics although he had done some fieldwork among California Indians.  As a result, his book was published abroad, and the upshot was that he gained a reputation for his knowledge of Indo-European and Uralic languages but more so in Europe than in the United States. Evidence for a relatively recent marine migration is very limited, but Sadovszky claims that archaeological and other evidence back up the linguistic evidence of his theory but there has been little interest in further research in this area.

Specialists in the [[Uralic languages]] have generally rejected Sadovszsky's theory, citing general lack of understanding of the methods of [[comparative linguistics]], leading to his work being riddled with problems such as poor semantic and phonetic correspondences. Sadovszky often makes no effort to show that some material he compares is truly native within the two language groups he compares, often [[cherrypicking]] examples from just one or two of the dozens of languages encompassed by "Penutian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ugrisch und Penuti|author-first=Michael|author-last=Knüppel|year=2012|journal=Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen|volume=61|p=92–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pajaral''', otherwise known as El Pajaral, is the modern name for a mid-sized ruined city of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located to the south of the San Pedro Martir river in the [[Petén (department)|Petén]] department of [[Guatemala]].  The name ''El Pajaral'' was coined by archaeologist Ian Graham, who discovered the site in the 1970s, and refers to the numerous birds he encountered there during his survey.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons, James (2006) "The discovery of a Classic Maya kingdom".  Invited paper given at the Peabody Museum for the Department of Anthropology, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pajaral, along with the ancient Maya site of [[Zapote Bobal]], has recently been the focus of an archaeological project, the Proyecto Peten Noroccidente [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201407/http://www.jaguarhill.com/ (PNO).]  Endeavors in the area are being directed by James Fitzsimmons ([[Middlebury College]]) and Laura Gamez ([[University of Pittsburgh]]).  The increased attention being paid to these sites is largely the result of a discovery made by [[epigrapher]] [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]], who connected the archaeological site of [[Zapote Bobal]] with a name repeatedly mentioned in the inscriptions of sites like [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] and [[Yaxchilan]].  That name was the toponym '''''Hix Witz''''', or "Jaguar Hill"&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens: Deciphering the Dynasties of the Ancient Maya |author1=Martin, Simon  |author2=Grube, Nikolai  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=2000 |location=London |isbn=0-500-05103-8 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, David (2003) "La identificacion de Hixwitz".  Paper presented at the XV Simposio de Investigaciones Arqueologicas en Guatemala, Museo Nacional de Arqueologia y Etnologia de Guatemala.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of that name occur on monuments recovered at Pajaral as well, suggesting that the two sites were related during the apogee of [[Maya civilization]].&lt;ref name="Stuart, David 2003"&gt;Stuart, David (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediately visible architecture at Pajaral is characterized by temple-mounds ranging from between {{convert|8|and|20|m|abbr=off}} in height.  Some of these are built atop natural hills: the upper plaza at the site, for example, was constructed on a modified hill {{convert|300|m|abbr=off}} long by {{convert|30|m|abbr=off}} high.  Although the map of the site is far from complete, it appears that settlement here is rather dispersed and in keeping with other large settlements in the area, including the [[archaeological site]] of [[La Joyanca]]. Such settlement is not the norm in many places around the [[Petén Basin]]. Even [[Zapote Bobal]], the likely regional capital, is more centralized and characterized by a royal palace proper. However, the architecture at the heart of Pajaral is massive: for example, the Main Plaza at Pajaral is accessed by a well-preserved, enormous staircase {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} wide and perhaps {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} long.&lt;ref name="Stuart, David 2003"/&gt; Based upon inscriptions and feline iconography at this site, scholars have suggested that this staircase, and its accompanying hill, was the basis for the name ''Hix Witz'' and that Pajaral, not [[Zapote Bobal]], was the original regional capital&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, David (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons, James (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the scale of construction at [[Zapote Bobal]] clearly indicates that by the 7th century it had eclipsed its western neighbor and taken the name ''Hix Witz'' for its own.

'''''Police Academy''''' is a series of American [[comedy film]]s, the first six of which were made in the 1980s. The series opened with ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984) which started with the premise that a new mayor had announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. The film followed a group of misfit recruits in their attempts to prove themselves capable of being police officers, and succeeding both in spite of and because of their eccentricities. The main character in the first four films, Carey Mahoney ([[Steve Guttenberg]]), was a repeat offender who was forced to join the [[police academy]] as punishment.  The seventh and to date last installment, ''[[Police Academy: Mission to Moscow|Mission to Moscow]]'', was released in 1994. Guttenberg in September 2018 announced that a new ''Police Academy'' film was in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Steve Guttenberg says another 'Police Academy' film is in the works |publisher= Yahoo|date=2018-09-04|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2018/09/03/police-academy-8-movies-franchise-sequel/|accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, all of the films and television shows depended on low-brow humor, usually based on simple characterizations and [[physical comedy]]. As with many similar films, the theme was a group of underdogs struggling to prove themselves while various stereotyped authority figures tried to suppress them. The sequels have not been well received by critics, although they were generally commercially successful. The first film grossed $81.2 million in North America, with the following films earning $150 million in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= `Police Academy` Films Just Roll On |publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=1987-04-16|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-16/features/8701290061_1_david-graf-comedy-camp-r-rating|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parallels are often drawn between ''Police Academy'' and the British ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allon|first=Arum|title=Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower Press|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their common reliance on a largely constant ensemble cast throughout the various films, the two series' frequent use of low-brow humor, sexual innuendo and physical comedy.

==Films==

===Overview===
''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' was released in 1984 and directed by [[Hugh Wilson (director)|Hugh Wilson]]. The film has a newly-elected female mayor announcing a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. The movie followed a group of misfit recruits in their attempts to prove themselves capable of being police officers and their adventures at the police academy.

In 1985's ''[[Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment]]'', the newly-graduated cadets are sent to one of the worst [[precinct]]s in the city to improve the conditions. Lt. Mauser undermines their attempts so that he can get Capt. Lassard fired and get the position in charge.

''[[Police Academy 3: Back in Training]]'' was released in 1986, and like its predecessor was directed by [[Jerry Paris]]. When the governor of the state announces that budget cuts are in order to get rid of the worst of the two police academies, the Metropolitan police academy, led by Commandant Lassard, work on ensuring it isn't theirs. This is hindered by their unusual gang of new cadets.

The fourth installment, ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol]]'', released in 1987, involves new recruits being brought in when the officers work with a newly formed Citizens On Patrol group. However, Harris and Proctor are in charge and plan to dismantle the program. ''Citizens on Patrol'' was the final film starring Guttenberg.

''[[Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach]]'' was released in 1988 and directed by [[Alan Myerson]]. The plot involves the officers attending a police convention in [[Florida]] to honor Commandant [[Eric Lassard]] as [[police officer]] of the decade where Commandant Lassard inadvertently switches his sports bag with that of a group of jewel thieves. The thieves try to get it back.

The sixth installment, ''[[Police Academy 6: City Under Siege]]'' directed by [[Peter Bonerz]], was released in 1989. When the city suffers from a dangerous set of crimes by a gang of jewel thieves, the Metropolitan Police Academy graduates are brought in to do something about it.

''[[Police Academy: Mission to Moscow]]'' released in 1994, and directed by Alan Metter involved the officers going to [[Russia]] to help catch an international crime figure.

===Music===
The music score was composed by [[Robert Folk]], which includes a famous melody theme that appears in all the rest of the movies. However, a pop song entitled "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" by [[Max Carl|Jack Mack]] is used at the end of #1. For #4, a rap song, "Citizens on Patrol", was written by [[John Debney]] and sung by [[Michael Winslow]] and [[LA Dream Team]].

===Future===
As of September 2003, plans were set in motion for an eighth "Police Academy" film to be released in 2007 after more than thirteen years of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/16068 |title=Police Academy 8 is in the works |publisher=Ain't it Cool |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Says series creator Paul Maslansky: "I felt it was time to start again.

[[Leslie Easterbrook]] (Capt. Debbie Callahan) and [[Marion Ramsey]] (Sgt. Laverne Hooks) mentioned that filming for the next ''Police Academy'' film was due to start shooting in summer 2006 for a release in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20061221_police_academy_shuts_down.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129100928/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20061221_police_academy_shuts_down.html |archivedate=2008-01-29 |title='&amp;#39;Police Academy'&amp;#39; shuts down |publisher=Moviehole |date=2006-12-21 |author=Clint Morris |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shelved in October 2006. Easterbrook did mention that there was still hope for a direct to DVD sequel. She added that while [[Warner Bros.]] wanted to do one, they wanted a producer to get independent financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargater.co.uk/forum/movies-films/police-academy-2007-t2207.html |title=Police Academy (2007) |publisher=Stargater |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505222138/http://www.stargater.co.uk/forum/movies-films/police-academy-2007-t2207.html |archivedate=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunton |first=Richard |url=http://www.filmstalker.co.uk/archives/2006/12/police_academy_8_dead.html |title=Police Academy dead? |publisher=Film Stalker |date=2006-12-21 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2008, Michael Winslow replied to a question about a possible new ''Police Academy'' film: “Anything’s possible. You’ve got to hope for Paul Maslansky and those folks over there to put it together. It’s up to them. It would be great to see everyone again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/51617/the_den_of_geek_interview_michael_winslow.html|title=The Den Of Geek Interview: Michael Winslow - Den of Geek|publisher=Den of Geek|date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio interview on November 26, 2008, with [[Colin Paterson]] for [[BBC Five Live]]'s [[Simon Mayo]] show, [[Steve Guttenberg]] (Sgt. Carey Mahoney) confirmed that 8 was still in development and that he was working on the script with [[Warner Bros.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=- 14:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive |title=BBC Radio Five Live |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815095832/http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/ |archivedate=August 15, 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg is slated to direct the film,&lt;ref name="Moviehole"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.moviehole.net/200816749-guttenberg-returns-to-police-academy|title=Guttenberg returns to Police Academy|last=Morris| first=Clint|date=2008-11-26|publisher=Moviehole|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that all of the cast from the previous installments (except for the deceased [[David Graf]], [[Billie Bird]] and [[Tab Thacker]]) would return to reprise their roles.&lt;ref name="Moviehole"/&gt;

After seven films in its original ten-year run, New Line is planning on reviving the ''Police Academy'' series, which grossed $240 million worldwide and spawned a pair of TV spinoffs. The slapstick comedy will be helmed by original producer Paul Maslansky. "It's going to be very worthwhile to the people who remember it and to those who saw it on TV," Maslansky told the Hollywood Reporter. "It's going to be a new class. We hope to discover new talent and season it with great comedians. It'll be anything but another movie with a numeral next to it. And we'll most probably retain the wonderful musical theme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheat-sheet/item/police-academy-returning-to-big-screen/nostalgia/ |title=Police Academy Returning to Big Screen |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with MTV Movies Blogs on March 17, 2010, Paul Maslansky stated that he plans to bring back some of the original cast to train the new recruits. When asked which characters he would bring back, Maslansky stated, "I haven't decided which ones. And I don't want to mention names and others will be disappointed, at this point, All I know is that I want to bring back some of the older characters to it, and maybe they'll have principal roles, some of them, and some of them might be just you know [a cameo]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/17/police-academy-update-paul-maslansky/ |title=Maslansky considering bringing back original characters for Police Academy 8 |publisher=MTV Movies Blog |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While appearing as a guest on the July 12, 2010 edition of ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', [[Michael Winslow]] (Sgt. Larvell Jones) confirmed that ''Police Academy 8'' is still in production. In August 2010, Steve Guttenberg revealed a script was being written by [[David Diamond (screenwriter)|David Diamond]] and [[David Weissman]].&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviemikes.com/2010/08/interview-with-steve-guttenberg/|title=Interview with Steve Guttenberg|last=Gencarelli|first=Mike|date=2010-08-01|publisher=Movie Mikes|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2010, actor [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] (Officer Zed) released a statement urging Hollywood to reboot the ''Police Academy'' series with a new group of actors instead of the original cast members. Goldthwait confirmed that Steve Guttenberg would return and that movie bosses were trying to get [[Kim Cattrall]] and [[Sharon Stone]] to return for an eighth film though Goldthwait said he had no desire to return to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/1/20100809/ten-goldthwait-wants-new-police-academy-c60bd6d.html|title=Yahoo News UK|work=Yahoo News UK}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2012, [[New Line Cinema]] confirmed that [[Scott Zabielski]] (''[[Tosh.0]]'') will be the director of the upcoming film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/new-line-taps-scott-zabielski-to-helm-police-academy-remake/ |title=New Line taps Scott Zabielski to helm 'Police Academy' remake |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |last=Fleming |first=Mike |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a radio interview on March 21, 2012, [[Michael Winslow]] stated that production of the eighth film was due to begin in November and that an offer had been made to [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to replace the late [[Bubba Smith]] as Hightower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1291275/michael_winslow_the_new_police_academy_film_shaquille_oneal_as_hightower.html|title=Michael Winslow: the new Police Academy film, Shaquille O'Neal as Hightower?|work=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 5, 2012, [[Jeremy Garelick]] (''[[The Break-Up]]'') was hired by New Line Cinema to help rewrite the aforementioned script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/06/jeremy-garelick-enlists-in-police-academy-rewrite/ |title=Jeremy Garelick enlists in 'Police Academy' rewrite |website=Deadline Hollywood |last=Fleming |first=Mike |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/police-academy/21580/writer-hired-for-new-police-academy-movie |title=Writer hired for new 'Police Academy' movie |work=Denofgeek.com |last=Brew |first=Simon |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2018, Steve Guttenberg announced that a new ''Police Academy'' film was in the works when he responded to a fan on [[Twitter]] saying "the next Police Academy is coming, no details yet, but it is in a gift bag being readied!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2018/09/03/police-academy-8-movies-franchise-sequel/|title=New 'Police Academy' Movie in the Works According to Steve Guttenberg |work=comicbook.com |last=Anderson |first=Jenna |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
An animated comedy entitled ''[[Police Academy (TV series)|Police Academy: The Series]], also known as ''Police Academy: The Animated Series'', was produced by [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. It ran from September 1988 to September 1989, lasting two seasons with 65 episodes produced.

''[[Police Academy: The Series]]'' was a 1997 live-action show based on the films, comprising 26 hour-long episodes. It was produced by Warner Bros. Television and Protocol Entertainment. [[Michael Winslow]] reprised his role from the films, the only cast member from the films to have a recurring role on the show, although several others made occasional guest appearances.

==Setting==
The Blue Oyster Bar is a fictional gay bar, and the setting of a recurring [[Joke|gag]]-scene. The bar is a stereotypical depiction of a [[Leather subculture|leathermen's]]/[[Bear (gay culture)|bear]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] bar, featuring patrons dressed up as [[motorcycling|bikers]] in leather clothing, and as police officers, sailors, and other stereotypical masculine gay fashion archetypes. The Blue Oyster was originally located on Howell Street in the first movie, but was relocated to 655 Cowan Avenue in the second (Proctor erroneously gives the address number as 621).

Within the film series, unsuspecting characters periodically enter the bar unaware of its nature, usually as the result of a prank by the lead characters. Once inside the victims are trapped and forced to dance with the patrons to the signature tune, "[[Bimbo Jet|El Bimbo]]".  Among those lured into the bar were: 
* Cadets Blanks and Copeland (First film: The first time it is intentional and the second time, it is accidental.) 
* Sweetchuck, Mahoney, and Hightower (second movie, due to a riot)
* Proctor (third and fourth films)
* Captain Harris and Proctor (fourth film)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38677">{{sexual orientation}}
The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain hormones plays a role in fetal [[sex differentiation]], such exposure also influences the [[sexual orientation]] that emerges later in the adult. '''Prenatal hormones''' may be seen as the primary determinant of adult sexual orientation, or a co-factor with genes, [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological factors]] and/or environmental and social conditions.

==Sex-typed behavior==

The hormonal theory of sexuality and gender identity holds that, just as exposure to certain [[hormones]] plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation and or gender identity that emerges later in the adult. Differences in brain structure that come about from chemical messengers and genes interacting on developing brain cells are believed to be the basis of sex differences in countless behaviors, including sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF. Sexual hormones and the brain: an essential alliance for sexual identity and sexual orientation.  Endocr Dev. 2010;17:22-35. {{DOI|10.1159/000262525}} {{PMID|19955753}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}    Prenatal factors that affect or interfere with the interaction of these hormones on the developing brain can influence later [[Childhood gender nonconformity|sex-typed behavior]] in children.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} This hypothesis is originated from countless experimental studies in non-human mammals, yet the argument that similar effects can be seen in human neurobehavioral development is a much debated topic among scholars.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; Recent studies, however, have provided evidence in support of prenatal androgen exposure influencing childhood sex-typed behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–456|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions.&lt;ref name=BornGay&gt;Wilson, G., &amp; Q. Rahman, ''Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Human Sex Orientation'', Peter Owen Publishers; 2nd edition (May 1, 2008) {{ISBN|9780720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} However, Garcia-Falgueras and [[Dick Swaab]] disagree that social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree. As seen in young children as well as in vervet and rhesus monkeys, sexually differentiated behavior in toy preference is differing in males versus females, where females prefer dolls and males prefer toy balls and cars; these preferences can be seen as early as 3–8 months in humans.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  It is impossible to completely rule out the social environment or the child's cognitive understanding of gender when discussing sex typed play in androgen-exposed girls.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  Conversely, children tend towards objects which have been labelled for their own sex, or toys that they have seen members of their sex playing with previously.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;

An endocrinology study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab postulated that "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of {{sic}} sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|25}} Further, their study puts forward that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, the authors say that sexual organs are differentiated first, and then the brain is sexually differentiated "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well ... . The changes brought about in this stage are permanent. ... [S]exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, even though they are very important for gender identity and sexual orientation."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Organizational aspects===

Fetal gonads develop primarily based on the presence or absence of [[androgen]] hormones, mainly [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) and [[androstenedione]]; production of testosterone and conversion into dihydrotestosterone during weeks 6 to 12 of pregnancy are key factors in the production of a male fetus's penis, scrotum and prostate.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  In a female, on the other hand, absence of these levels of androgens results in development of typically female genitals.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Following this, sexual differentiation of the brain occurs; sex hormones exert organizational effects on the brain that will be activated in puberty.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=Ai-Min|author2=Dick F. Swaab|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: Relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=18 February 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=214–226|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.007|pmid=21334362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of these two processes occurring separately, the degree of genital masculinization does not necessarily relate to the masculinization of the brain.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Sex differences in the brain have been found in many structures, most notably the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  However, few of these have been related to behavioral sex differences, and scientists are still working to establish firm links between early hormones, brain development and behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; The study of the organizational theory of prenatal hormones can be difficult, as ethically researchers cannot alter hormones in a developing fetus; instead, scholars must rely on naturally occurring abnormalities of development to provide answers.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berenbaum|first=Sheri A.|author2=Adriene M. Beltz|title=Sexual differentiation of human behavior: Effects of prenatal and pubertal organizational hormones|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|date=April 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=183–200|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.03.001|pmid=21397624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most extensively studied in organizational effects of hormones is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hines |first=Melissa |year=2011 |title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=170–182 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006 |pmid=21333673|pmc=3296090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAH is a genetic disease that results in exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] beginning early in gestation.  Girls with CAH are born with masculinized genitalia, which is corrected surgically as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;  CAH provides the opportunity for [[natural experiments]], as people with CAH can be compared to people without it.  However, "CAH is not a perfect experiment", since, "social responses to masculinized genitalia or factors related to the disease itself" can [[confound]] results.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;   Nonetheless several studies have shown that CAH has a clear but not determining influence on sexual orientation; women with CAH are less likely to be exclusively heterosexual than are other women.&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;
  
Since hormones alone do not determine sexual orientation and differentiation of the brain, the search for other factors that act upon sexual orientation have led genes such as the [[SRY]] and ZFY to be implicated.&lt;ref name="Ngun et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngun|first=Tuck C. |author2=Negar Ghahramani |author3=Francisco J. Sanchez |author4=Sven Bocklandt |author5=Eric Vilain|title=The genetics of sex differences in brain and behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=October 2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=227–246|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.10.001|pmid=20951723|pmc=3030621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal maternal stress===

As of 2006 results from studies in humans had found conflicting evidence regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to hormones and psychosexual outcomes; Gooren noted in 2006 that studies in subprimate mammals are invalid measures of human sexual differentiation, as sex hormones follow a more "on-off" role in sex-typed behavior than is found in primates.&lt;ref name=Gooren&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooren|first=Louis|title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=November 2006|volume=50|issue=4|pages=589–601|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011|pmid=16870186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies do suggest that prenatal stress significantly increases the likelihood of [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]], although varying evidence exists for which trimester is most important.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}  Studies of endocrinology have found implications for amphetamines and thyroid-gland hormones to increase homosexuality in female offspring as well, although it has not been examined in conjunction with prenatal stress levels.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Some have postulated that postnatal (e.g., social and environmental factors) development can play a role in the sexual orientation of an individual, yet solid evidence of this has yet to be discovered. Children born through artificial insemination with donor sperm and consequently raised by lesbian couples have typically been heterosexually oriented.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Summed up by Bao and Swaab, "The apparent impossibility of getting someone to change their sexual orientation ... is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;

===Male homosexuality as hypermasculine===
{{main|Hypermasculinity}}

There is evidence of a correlation between sexual orientation and traits that are determined [[in utero]].&lt;ref name=BornGay/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}   A study by McFadden in 1998 found that auditory systems in the [[brain]], another physical trait influenced by prenatal hormones is different in those of differing orientations; likewise the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] was found by Swaab and Hofman to be larger in homosexual men than in heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panzica|first1=GC|last2=Aste|first2=N|last3=Viglietti-Panzica|first3=C|last4=Ottinger|first4=MA|title=Structural sex differences in the brain: influence of gonadal steroids and behavioral correlates.|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|date=March 1995|volume=18|issue=3|pages=232–52|doi=10.1007/BF03347808|pmid=7615911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-3806(94)90129-5 |vauthors=Swaab DF, Zhou JN, Ehlhart T, Hofman MA |title=Development of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons in the human suprachiasmatic nucleus in relation to birth and sex |journal=Brain Res.

====Fraternal birth order====
According to some studies, gay men have more older [[brother]]s on average, a phenomenon known as the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]].  It has been suggested that the greater the number of older male siblings the higher the level of [[androgen]] fetuses are exposed to&lt;!--I think this is a reference to Williams et al. Nature paper, but I don't think it says quite says what this last sentence says--&gt;. No evidence of birth order effects have been observed in women. The theory holds that the fraternal birth order effect is a result of a maternal immune response that is produced towards a factor of male development over several male pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Bogaert's hypothesis argues that "the target of the immune response may be malespecific molecules on the surface of male fetal brain cells (e.g., including those in the anterior hypothalamus). Antimale antibodies might bind to these molecules and thus interfere with their role in normal sexual differentiation, leading some later born males to being attracted to men as opposed to women."&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that  "The ... fraternal birth order effect ... is putatively explained by an immunological response by the mother to a product of the Y chromosome of her sons. The chance of such an immune response to male factors would increase with every pregnancy resulting in the birth of a son."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

In conjunction with fraternal birth order, [[Handedness and sexual orientation|handedness]] provides further evidence of prenatal effects on sexual orientation, because handedness is regarded by many as a marker of early neurodevelopment. Other correlates to handedness (e.g., cerebral laterality, prenatal hormonal profiles, spatial ability) have been linked to sexual orientation, either empirically and/or theoretically.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  In right-handed individuals, the number of older brothers increased the odds of homosexual orientation, but this effect was not seen in left-handed individuals.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt; As with other purported marks indicating higher incidence of homosexuality, however, the link with handedness remains ambiguous and several studies have been unable to replicate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=====Implicated genes in fraternal birth order=====

A gene of the ''Rh'' system has been discussed as a possible candidate for affecting fraternal birth order, as it has been linked to both handedness and immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaert|first=Anthony|author2=Ray Blanchard |author3=Lesley Crothswait |title=Interaction of Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in the Kinsey Interview Data|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=October 2007|volume=121|issue=5|pages=845–853|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.121.5.845|pmid=17907817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene variants in the ''Rh'' system are implicated in a maternal response to what is known as [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]]. ''Rh'' is a factor in blood, and in cases where the mother is absent of this (''Rh-'') while carrying an ''Rh+'' fetus, an immune response may develop with deleterious effects. The ''Rh'' gene hypothesis is a strong candidate because not only does it involve the maternal immune response, but it has been implicated in handedness as well.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;

Variants of the androgen receptor (''AR'') gene have also been discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the ''AR'' gene, which in turn is associated with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the corpus callosum is supported by this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Witelson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra|author2=R. S. Nowakowski|title=Left out axons make men right: A hypothesis for the origin of handedness and functional asymmetry|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1991|volume=29|issue=4|pages=327–333|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90046-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male homosexuality as hypomasculine===
{{main|Hypomasculinity}}

In a 1991 study, [[Simon LeVay]] demonstrated that a tiny clump &lt;!--name that 'clump' (&amp; call it a nucleus) --&gt; of neurons of the anterior [[hypothalamus]]—which is believed to control sexual behavior and linked to prenatal hormones—known as the interstitial nuclei of the anterior was, on average, more than twice the size in heterosexual men when contrasted to homosexual men. Due to this area also being nearly twice the size in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women, the implication is that the sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus in homosexuals is in a female direction.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  In 2003 scientists at [[Oregon State University]] announced that they had replicated his findings in sheep. Later studies in humans, however, have yet to confirm this finding.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; &lt;!-- I believe this has also been replicated in human subjects: Byne, W., S. Tobet, ''et al.'' (2001). "The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and hiv status." Horm Behav 40(2): 86–92. Dr. Simon LeVay, in his study of the hypothalamic differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men, offered the following criticisms of his own research, "It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain."--&gt;

===Female homosexuality===

Most empirical or theoretical research into women's sexual orientation has, historically, been guided by the idea of lesbians as essentially masculine and heterosexual women as essentially feminine.&lt;ref name=Peplau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peplau|first=Letitia|author2=Mark Huppin|title=Masculinity, Femininity and the Development of Sexual Orientation in Women|journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health|date=October 2008|volume=12|issue=1–2|pages=145–165|doi=10.1300/J529v12n01_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this belief is traced to the early "inversion theory" of sex researchers who state that homosexuality is a result of biological abnormalities that "invert" sexual attraction and personality.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;  Handedness research has provided implications; because more men than women present a preference for their left hand, the higher proportion of non-right handedness that has been discovered among lesbians when compared to heterosexual women demonstrates a possible link of prenatal masculinization and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt; Backing this up are reports that lesbians display more masculinized 2D;4D digit ratios than heterosexual women, based on data gathered from at least six different laboratories.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins" /&gt;  This effect has not yet been observed between homosexual and heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobrogge|first=Kyle L|author2=S. Marc Breedlove |author3=Kelly L. Klump |title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on 2D;4D Finger Length Ratios: A Study of Monozygotic and Dizygotic Male and Female Twins|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=February 2008|volume=37|issue=1|pages=112–118|doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9272-2|pmid=18074216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the validity of this measure of digit ratios remains controversial as a predictor of prenatal androgen, as many other prenatal factors may play roles in bone growth in prenatal stages of development.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  While many studies have found results confirming this hypothesis, others have failed to replicate 
these findings,&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  leaving the validity of this measure unconfirmed.

[[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), a drug that has been in the past prescribed to prevent miscarriages, has also been studied in relation to women's sexual orientation. It has been observed to exert a masculinizing/defeminizing  effect on the developing brain of the fetus.&lt;ref name=Peplau /&gt; When compared to controls, higher percentages of DES-exposed women (17% vs 0%) reported that they had engaged in same-sex relations; however, the great majority of DES women stated an exclusively heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an autosomal recessive condition which results in high androgen levels during fetal development) have more masculinized sex role identities and are more likely to have a homosexual sexual orientation as adults than controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dittmann|first=V|author2=Dilling H.  |date=June 1990|title=Chapter V (F) of ICD-10: mental, behavioural and developmental disorders—introduction and overview.|journal=Pharmacopsychiatry|volume=23|issue=suppl 4|pages=137–41|pmid=2197637|doi=10.1055/s-2007-1014552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dittmann V, von Cranach M, Eckermann G |title=Abnormalities of adult personality and behaviour (section F 6)--results of the ICD-10 field trial |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=23 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=170–2 |year=1990 |pmid=2197643 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1014559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dittmann|first=V|date=1992-08-01|title=[ICD-10 in psychiatric diagnosis.

However, the degree to which the girls' genitals are masculinized does not correlate with their sexual orientation, suggesting that prenatal hormones are a stronger causal factor, not parental influence.

Together with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, DES studies have provided little support of the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation; they do, however, provide the framework for possible pathways to a homosexual orientation for a small number of women.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{main|Gender dysphoria}}

In individuals with [[gender dysphoria]], previously known as gender identity disorder (GID), prenatal exposure to testosterone has been hypothesized to have an effect on gender identity differentiation. The 2D;4D finger ratio, or relative lengths of the 2nd "index" and 4th "ring" fingers, has become a popular measure of prenatal androgen because of accumulated evidence suggesting the 2D;4D ratios are related to prenatal exposure to testosterone.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=Madeleine|author2=Kenneth J. Zucker |author3=Thomas D. Steensma |author4=Peggy T. Cohen-Kettenis |title=2D:4D finger-length ratios in children and adults with gender identity disorder|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=August 2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=450–454|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.05.002|pmid=18585715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children with GID differentiate a homosexual orientation during adolescence, but not all of them; adults with "early onset", or a childhood history of cross-gender behavior, often have a homosexual orientation. Adults with "late onset", or those without a childhood history of said behavior, are more likely to have a non-homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"/&gt;

Prenatal androgen exposure has  been associated with an increased chance of patient-initiated [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment]] to male after being initially raised as female in early childhood or infancy.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer-Bahlburg 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Bahlburg|first=Heino|title=gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile albation|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=28 August 2005|volume=34|issue=4|pages=423–438|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gooren found that organizational effects of prenatal androgens are more prevalent in gender role behavior than in gender identity, and that there are preliminary findings that suggest evidence of a male gender identity being more frequent in patients with fully male-typical prenatal androgenization.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Individuals with complete [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] are almost always brought up as females, and the differentiation of gender identity/role is feminine.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;   This example is important in demonstrating that chromosomes and gonads alone do not dictate gender identity and role.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

====Transsexualism====
{{main|Transsexualism}}

Because organ differentiation and brain differentiation occur at different times, in rare cases transsexualism can result.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in transsexuality in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  
 
Drawing on some transsexualism cases, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that "[f]rom these examples it appears that the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation ... ."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|26}} Countless studies have been run on peripheral levels of sex steroids in male and female homosexuals, a considerable number of which claimed to find "less 'male hormone' and/or more 'female hormone' in male homosexuals and vice versa in female homosexuals".&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  However, these findings have been reviewed and have subsequently been dismissed by scholars as suffering from faulty design and interpretation.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Factors implicated in the development of transsexuality include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in [[aromatase]] (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and [[CYP17]].&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of transsexuality later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of transsexualism and homosexuality exists.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Due to relatively small population sizes, generalizability of studies on transsexuality cannot be assumed.

'''The Preservation Society of Newport County''' is a private, [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  It is Rhode Island's largest and most-visited cultural organization.  The organization protects the architectural heritage of Newport County, especially the [[Bellevue Avenue Historic District]].  Seven of its 14 historic properties and landscapes are [[National Historic Landmark]]s, and most are open to the public.

== History ==
[[File:Osgood-Pell House, Newport Rhode Island.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Preservation Society's administrative offices are located in the Osgood-Pell House]]
The Preservation Society of Newport County was founded in 1945 by a group of Newport residents led by Katherine and George Warren to save [[Hunter House (Newport, Rhode Island)|Hunter House]] from demolition. They were known as the Georgian Society until they changed their name to the Preservation Society of Newport County.

[[Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt]], [[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]]'s widow, bequeathed $1.25 million to the society upon her death in 1978.&lt;ref name="democratvanderbiltwill"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanderbilt will |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/137019006/?terms=%22Gertrude%2BVanderbilt%22 |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |work=Democrat and Chronicle |location=Rochester, New York |date=August 19, 1978|page=13|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''{{lang|la|Primum non nocere}}''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈpriːmʊ̃n noːn nɔˈkeːrɛ|classical}}) is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "'''first, to do no harm'''." The phrase is sometimes recorded as '''''{{lang|la|primum nil nocere}}'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%201_2%201800,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201970&amp;tbo=p&amp;q=%22primum+nil+nocere%22&amp;num=10 Google book search, 1800–1970]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-maleficence''', which is derived from the maxim, is one of the principal precepts of [[bioethics]] that all medical students are taught in school and is a fundamental principle throughout the world. Another way to state it is that, "given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good." It reminds physicians to consider the possible harm that any intervention might do. It is invoked when debating the use of an intervention that carries an obvious risk of harm but a less certain chance of benefit.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Non-maleficence is often contrasted with its [[corollary]],{{vague|reason=the word is rare, and IMO more often has the meaning "trivial implication", which feels like pretentious chatter in this 'pediac context|date=March 2018}} [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence&lt;!-- $15 word! --&gt;]].

== Origin ==

The origin of the phrase is uncertain. The [[Hippocratic Oath]] includes the promise "to abstain from doing harm" ({{lang-el|ἐπὶ δηλήσει δὲ καὶ ἀδικίῃ εἴρξειν}}) but does not include the precise phrase. Perhaps the closest approximation in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] is in ''Epidemics'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.eastridges.com/wesley/primum.html Primum non nocere]'' &amp;ndash; Tells why "''primum non nocere''" is not actually from Hippocrates, but is a phrase in the ''Epidemics''&lt;/ref&gt; "The physician must ... have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm" (book I, sect. 11, trans. Adams, {{lang-el|ἀσκέειν, περὶ τὰ νουσήματα, δύο, ὠφελέειν, ἢ μὴ βλάπτειν}}).

According to Gonzalo Herranz, Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Navarre, ''Primum non nocere'' was introduced into American and [[UK|British]] medical culture by [[Worthington Hooker]] in his 1847 book ''Physician and Patient''. Hooker attributed it to the [[Paris]]ian pathologist and clinician [[Auguste François Chomel]] (1788&amp;ndash;1858), the successor of [[René Laennec|Laennec]] in the chair of medical pathology, and the preceptor of [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis|Pierre Louis]]. Apparently, the axiom was part of Chomel's oral teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of ''primum non nocere''." ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' electronic responses and commentary, 1 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooker, however, was quoting an earlier work by Elisha Bartlett &lt;ref&gt;An Essay on the Philosophy of Medical Science, Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1844 &lt;/ref&gt; who, on pages 288-289, says "The golden axiom of Chomel, that it is only the second law of therapeutics to do good, its first law being this – not to do harm – is gradually finding its way into the medical mind, preventing an incalculable amount of positive ill.”

However,  Hooker used neither the specific expression, nor the traditional Latin phrase. A detailed investigation of the origins of the [[aphorism]] was reported by the clinical pharmacologist Cedric M. Smith in the April 2005 issue of ''[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=C. M. |year=2005 |title=Origin and Uses of ''Primum Non Nocere'' – Above All, Do No Harm! |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=371–77 |doi=10.1177/0091270004273680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the questions of the origin and chronology of appearance of the maxim. Rather than being of ancient origin as usually assumed, the specific expression, and its even more distinctive associated Latin phrase, has been traced back to an attribution to [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624&amp;ndash;1689) in a book by [[Thomas Inman]] (1860), ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine''.  Inman's book and his attribution were [[Academic journal#Book reviews|review]]ed by an author who signed simply as "H. H." in ''[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]]'', also in 1860.&lt;ref name="TAJMS"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QEHAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA450&amp;dq=inman+The+American+Journal+of+the+Medical+Sciences+page+450&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=frwjUaefDIro9ATG1YHgDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inman%20The%20American%20Journal%20of%20the%20Medical%20Sciences%20page%20450&amp;f=false |editor-last=Hays |editor-first=Isaac |editor-link=Isaac Hays |year =1860 |title=Book review of ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine'' |author=Inman, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Inman |volume= XL |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=450–58 |publisher=Blanchard and Lea}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An American surgeon, [[L.A. Stimson|L. A. Stimson]], used the expression in 1879 and again in 1906 (in the same journal). That it was in common use by the 20th century is apparent from later mentions, such as by the prominent [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[J. Whitridge Williams]] in 1911, as well as detailed discussion of its use in a popular book authored by [[Dr. Morris Fishbein]], editor of ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1930.

The article also reviews the various uses of the now popular aphorism, its limitations as a moral injunction, and its increasingly frequent use in a variety of contexts.

'''RPM Nautical Foundation''' is a non-profit [[archaeological]] research and educational organization dedicated to the advancement of [[maritime archaeology]] that includes littoral surveys and excavation of individual [[shipwreck]] and [[harbor]] sites.

RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) is organized to operate exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary and educational purposes, all within the meaning of sections [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|170(c)(2) and 501(c)(3)]] of the [[United States Internal Revenue Code]]. The operating purpose of the company is to engage in the detection, identification, study and preservation of nautical archaeological and [[historic site]]s for scientific research, public education, the advancement of technology. The organization also provides fieldwork and training experience in the field to students as well as the personnel and staff of various government, cultural and educational institutions.

Among the goals for RPMNF is the effort to assist [[Mediterranean countries]] with the location, identification, assessment, and research of their submerged cultural material so that these important cultural resources can be protected for future generations.  Accordingly, RPMNF projects are carried out in conjunction with host governments in the Mediterranean and serve as a crucial component in the effort to protect submerged archaeological sites and maritime heritage in association with UNESCO’s efforts to preserve world heritage sites. RPMNF policy stipulates that all artifacts are under the jurisdiction of the host government at all times. The location and assessment of [[Shipwreck|wreck sites]], as well as site and artifact analysis is beneficial to the many governments that RPMNF works with, as it provides cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting archaeological resources.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;

Over the past decade RPMNF has made advances in maritime archaeology of the littoral region of the Mediterranean through intensive and systematic use of technology. RPMNF’s research vessel, the R/V Hercules, is a purpose-built maritime archaeological platform that has seafloor mapping and three-dimensional modeling capabilities for identification of submerged cultural material sites. The vessel is designed as a self-sufficient base for a wide range of project functions in moderately deep littoral waters, typically limited to 500 m.  These operations include remote sensing equipment that includes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and various multibeam systems, the deployment of ROVs, data and media processing and other research functions.  Hercules is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and advanced data processing capabilities, as well as adequate deck space and lifting systems to transport and deploy survey equipment.  Potential sites are verified and documented with ROV investigation.  The ROV is employed for video and image documentation, sampling, artifact retrieval, and limited excavation of sites.&lt;ref name=Hvistendahl2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hvistendahl, Mara |title=The Adriatic's Uncharted Past |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |year=2011 |volume=64 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1103/features/adriatic_shipwrecks_albania.html |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROV is also employed for the excavation of deep-water sites; an excavation methodological process that RPMNF is helping to advance within the field of [[maritime archaeology]].

RPMNF research vessel R/V ''Hercules'' is Maltese flagged and based in [[Valletta]], Malta during the winter months.  This research vessel can be deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==History==
[[File:RPMNF expedition areas through 2014.png|thumbnail|RPMNF expedition areas through 2014]]
The foundation was established in 2001 by its President, George Robb, who was a Director for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.  As part of RPMNF's initial foundation, it was establishes as a supporting institute for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology  Early field work centered in Florida and select supporting projects in the Mediterranean.  In 2003, Dr. Jeff Royal became Archaeological Director, then in 2011 took over as Executive Director, during which time RPMNF's focus has centered on the Mediterranean.  At the end of 2010, RPMNF entered into an agreement and is a supporting institute for the Program in Maritime Studies at [[East Carolina University]].  RPMNF continues to grow its associations with Universities, individual scholars, students, and new countries around the Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Project History==
[[File:Maritimearchaeologistworking.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
RPMNF's cooperative projects have proved successful in the identification, mapping, and recording of shipwreck sites and harbor works from the ancient through modern eras.  To date, project areas include Spain, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia, Malta, Morocco, Cyprus, Sicily, Amalfi and Calabria in Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey.  As all archaeological work is performed in conjunction with the host country’s cultural authority, the one of the crucial outcomes is that the projects assist in both scholarly research and educational projects.  All recovered artifacts remain under the jurisdiction of the host government for educational/research purposes and eventual museum display in each country.  The location and assessment data of wreck sites has proved beneficial to the many governments with which RPMNF have worked as it provides their cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting their submerged archaeological resources.  Bathymetric data is also made available to host country hydrographic departments in order to supplement their oceanographic mapping programs.  RPMNF research vessel Hercules is flagged in Malta, where it based in Valletta during the off-season, and is deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==Publications==
RPMNF Project reports are filed with the appropriate government agency in each country.  Scholarly articles from RPMNF field work are published.

'''''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''''' is the name of several [[documentary film|documentary television series]] based on the newspaper feature. The first series aired on [[NBC]] from 1949 to 1950, and was hosted by [[Robert L. Ripley]] until his death, after which several substitute hosts filled in. The series was revived for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the 1980s, and was hosted primarily by [[Jack Palance]]. Another revival debuted on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in 2000, and aired until 2003, with [[Dean Cain]] as host. A Filipino version, hosted by [[Chris Tiu]], debuted in 2008. An animated series based on the ''Ripley's'' franchise was also created.

==Original series (1949–1950)==
The first ''Believe It or Not!'' TV series, a live show hosted by [[Robert L. Ripley]], premiered on [[NBC]] television on March 1, 1949. Shortly after the 13th episode, on May 27, 1949, Ripley died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and several of his friends substituted as host, including future ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' president [[Doug Storer]]. Robert St. John served as host from the second season until the series ended on October 5, 1950.

In 1956, [[Worldvision Enterprises|ABC Films Syndication]] had John Gibbs and Meridian Pictures prepare a ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' [[television pilot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Film Synd. Plans for Big 1956|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yB4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69|accessdate=May 6, 2015|work=Billboard|date=January 28, 1956|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival (1982–1986)==
''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' later returned to television in a second series from 1982 to 1986,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} on the American [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. Actor [[Jack Palance]] hosted the popular series throughout its run,&lt;ref name=Jan2000/&gt; while three different co-hosts appeared from season to season, including Palance's daughter, Holly Palance, actress [[Catherine Shirriff]], and singer [[Marie Osmond]]. The 1980s series reran on the [[Sci-fi Channel]] (UK) and Sci-fi Channel (US) during the 1990s.

==Animated series (1999)==
In December 1995, development was underway by [[Cookie Jar Group|Cinar]] for an animated series based on ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wendel Mans Cinar's Front|url=https://variety.com/1995/more/news/wendel-mans-cinar-s-front-99123591/|accessdate=May 23, 2017|work=Variety|date=December 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26-episode series,&lt;ref name=AWN/&gt; titled ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'', was co-produced by French production company [[Alphanim]], which was founded in 1997. The series premiered on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]] on July 14, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilmer|first=David|title=Alphanim announces new productions|url=https://www.awn.com/news/alphanim-announces-new-productions|accessdate=June 14, 2017|work=Animation World Network|date=June 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was about three young people who discover unexplained mysteries and unusual items.&lt;ref name=AWN&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Animation and Fox Family Channel: a perfect match!|url=https://www.awn.com/news/animation-and-fox-family-channel-perfect-match|accessdate=June 14, 2017|work=[[Animation World Network]]|date=March 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second revival (2000–2003)==
In March 1994, a pilot for ''The New Ripley's Believe It or Not'' had been ordered for ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=Fleet of pilots ready|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/fleet-of-pilots-ready-119378/|accessdate=May 23, 2017|work=Variety|date=March 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1998, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS Superstation]] outbid two broadcast network competitors to purchase the rights from [[Columbia TriStar Television]] Distribution for 22 hour-long episodes of ''The New Ripley's Believe It or Not'', to premiere on TBS in January 2000.

The new series was to involve correspondents being sent around the world to report on amazing and unusual subjects.

The building is inside of [[Sakitama Kofun Park]].  It is one of Japan's many museums which are supported by a prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA671&amp;dq= "Museums"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 671-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was originally established as {{Nihongo|Sakitama Museum|さきたま資料館}} in 1969 as part of the construction of {{Nihongo|Sakitama Fudoki  Hills|さきたま風土記の丘}}, an archeological preserve encompassing the Sakitama [[Kofun]] Cluster.  In 2006, Saitama Prefecture renamed the museum as Museum of the Sakitama Ancient Burial Mounds and made its goals the research, collection, preservation of the site's archeological data as well as educating the site’s cultural and historical value to its visitors.

Nearly 100,000 visitors come to the museum every year to learn about Sakitama Kofun Cluster and its artifacts, including a national treasure, [[Inariyama Sword]]. The museum consists of two buildings, Sakitama Shiseki Hall and Shōgunyama Kofun Exhibit Hall, which opened in 1997 and allows visitors to walk inside of the reconstructed stone chamber of the Shōgunyama Kofun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sakitama-muse.spec.ed.jp/top-page/organization.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226002902/http://www.sakitama-muse.spec.ed.jp/top-page/organization.html |date=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Society exists to encourage interest in the history of architecture, to enable the exchange and discussion of ideas related to this. The Society has no official location and its activities cover the [[United Kingdom]]. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.

''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' is the main journal of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members.

== History ==

The foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by [[Turpin Bannister]] in discussion with [[Frank Jenkins (architect)|Frank Jenkins]], a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the [[University of Illinois]] in the [[United States]]. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American [[Society of Architectural Historians]] partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the [[York Institute of Architectural Study]].

'''Stylianos Harkianakis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Στυλιανός Χαρκιανάκης) is the Greek Orthodox [[Archbishop of Australia]] and Primate of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia]]. He serves as inaugural and permanent Chairman of the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Churches in Australia and Dean of Saint Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College. He is a [[theologian]] specialising in [[ecclesiology]] and also an award-winning poet.

==Overview==
Harkianakis was born in [[Rethymno]], on the island of [[Crete]], [[Greece]] on 29 December 1935. He studied theology at the [[Theological School of Halki]], on the island of [[Halki (Greece)|Halki]] and graduated in 1958. He was ordained a deacon in 1957 and a priest in 1958. He completed postgraduate studies in systematic theology and the philosophy of religion at the [[University of Bonn]] in [[West Germany]], from 1958 to 1966. His lecturers included Cardinal  (then Reverend Father) Joseph Ratzinger, who later became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. He wrote his thesis on the concept that the Orthodox Church possessed infallibility when it acted together in conciliarity (e.g. the Ecumenical Councils). At that time, the idea of infallibility was thought to be an exclusively Roman Catholic idea, entirely alien to the Orthodox Church.

In 1965, whilst still completing his postgraduate studies, Harkianakis was appointed Professor of Theology at the [[University of Athens]]. In 1966, he was appointed abbot of the Holy Patriarchal Monastery of Vlatodon, in [[Thessaloniki]]. He was a founding member, then became vice-president and later president, of the Patriarchal Institute of Patristic Studies within the monastery. From 1969 to 1975, he lectured in systematic theology at the [[University of Thessaloniki]].

In 1970, Harkianakis was elected the Titular Metropolitan of Militoupolis (whilst remaining in the Holy Monastery of Vlatadon) as exarch in matters concerning Northern Greece and [[Mt. Athos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/aboutus/archbishopstylianos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035720/http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/aboutus/archbishopstylianos |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop of Australia==
In 1975, Harkianakis was elected [[Archbishop of Australia]] and Exarch of Oceania. In this role, he engaged in many dialogues between Orthodoxy and other Christian groups, most prominently as co-chairman of the theological dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church, but also as co-chairman of the dialogue with the Anglican churches.

Harkianakis has taught Orthodox theology and spirituality at [[Sydney University]] since 1975. In 1986 he  became the inaugural dean of St Andrew's Theological College where he also serves as Lecturer in Systematic Theology.

==Awards==
In 1973, Harkianakis was awarded the International Award Gottfried von Herder. A noted poet with an extensive bibliography, he was given the Award for Poetry from the Academy of Athens in 1980. In 1985 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Lublin University]], Poland. One of his poems, "After Ephialtes", was set to music by [[Costas Tsicaderis]].

'''''The Heartland Series''''' is a series of [[television program]]s about the culture of [[Appalachia]], produced by [[WBIR-TV]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], over the 25-year period 1984 through 2009. The series has been produced on a limited basis since 2010.

==Production history==
''The Heartland Series'' was conceived in 1984 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] with a special series celebrating the people and land of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Actor [[Bill Landry]] was hired to host the series. He had previously been a teacher, had written and begun performing a one-man [[Play (theater)|play]] based on the life of [[Albert Einstein]] called "Einstein the Man," and had portrayed a fictional [[Tennessee River]] boat captain named "Captain Nat" as part of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) exhibit at the [[1982 World's Fair]] in Knoxville. Following the fair, he had continued to play the role of Captain Nat on a months-long [[barge]] tour of the Tennessee, [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]], and [[Mississippi River]]s that TVA conducted for its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutLandry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tva.gov/heritage/worldsfair/index.htm When the World Came to TVA], Tennessee Valley Authority website, accessed October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Landry's skill as an [[interview]]er has been remarked upon by many observers. His folksy, rambling style made him effective at putting people at ease and drawing out the interesting stories of the people that he encountered in the "hills, hollows, small towns and major cities" of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smyser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venable/&gt;

In 1998, the series was expanded to include a 30-minute version airing each Saturday at 7:00 p.m., while it continued to run the original five-minute version during the morning news, after ''10 News at Noon'', and after ''10 News Nightbeat''.&lt;ref name=AboutLandry&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/b_landry.aspx About Bill Landry], WBIR website, accessed October 6, 1009&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has been successful with audiences, sometimes achieving [[Audience measurement|audience ratings]] of 7.0 or higher.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; In addition to being broadcast on WBIR, the series appeared on [[WTVC]] in [[Chattanooga]] during the 1980s and was shown on the [[Travel Channel]] (under the title ''Appalachian Stories'') for six years.&lt;ref name=Shearer&gt;John Shearer, [http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_156006.asp Former Chattanoogan Landry Had 25-Year Run With Popular Appalachian Features], The Chattanoogan,  August 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesNews/&gt;

===End of production===
In February 2009, WBIR announced plans to suspend production of the series in September 2009 after taking it "through to some sort of conclusion."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; WBIR general manager Jeff Lee cited economics as the reason for ending production, noting "it is a luxury for three people to produce 3-1/2 minutes of TV a week."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; He said that the station would continue to show the hundreds of episodes already produced "for as long as the viewers like them."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; More than 3,000 people signed an online [[petition]] asking for the series to be continued, but WBIR followed through with its plan to end it.&lt;ref name=Morrowprime/&gt; The last episode was taped at the [[Museum of Appalachia]] in [[Norris, Tennessee|Norris]] on August 8, 2009 before an audience estimated at 10,000 people, one of the largest crowds in the museum's history.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowfans&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml 10,000 fans turn out for last 'Heartland Series' taping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019224041/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml |date=2009-10-19 }}, Knoxnews.com, August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People seeking Landry's [[autograph]] waited in line for an hour.&lt;ref name=Morrowfans/&gt; The final show featured several [[Appalachian traditional music]]ians who had appeared previously in the series, including [[fiddler]] [[Danny Gammon]], [[Bobby Fulcher]], [[Tony Thomas (bluegrass musician)|Tony Thomas]] and [[Jimmy McCarroll]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/09/heartland-says-goodbye/  'Heartland Series' says goodbye; Many turn out to celebrate longtime WBIR series], Knoxville News Sentinel, August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode was scheduled for broadcast as an hour-long special on September 19, 2009, but  to avoid conflict with a [[Tennessee Volunteers]] football game the broadcast was postponed and rescheduled to be shown in a [[prime time]] slot at 8:00 p.m. on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/wbir_sets_date.shtml WBIR sets date for 'Heartland Series' finale], KnoxNews.com, September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/heartland_serie.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale postponed], KnoxNews.com, September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowprime&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/10/heartland_serie_1.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale to go primetime], KnoxNews.com, October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===

Public response to the cancellation of the series caused management to reconsider its demise. In 2010 producer Steve Dean was contracted to produce four more episodes, each an hour long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=116170 New Heartland Series program to air in March], WBIR-TV website, March 17, 2010.

==Recognition and influence==
During its 25-year history, ''The Heartland Series'' received four [[Emmy Award]]s, six [[Iris Award]]s from the [[NATPE|National Association of Television Program Executives]], one silver medal and two bronze medals from the [[New York International Film and Television Festival]], and a Theodore Roosevelt Award for Best Outdoor Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knoxvilletennessee.com/news.html Knoxville News / Knoxville Weather], KnoxvilleTennessee.com website, accessed October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day that the last episode was taped, former [[U.S. Senator]] [[Howard Baker]], who had appeared in one episode, called the series "the last iteration of our history and culture of a generation."&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Mark Brown, [[Carson Newman College]]'s director of news and media relations, described the series as "the nation's longest-running sociological video repository" and said "it did for Southern Appalachia what [[Studs Terkel]] did for [[Chicago]]."&lt;ref name=Venable&gt;Sam Venable, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/sep/18/whichever-way-the-wind-blows/ Whichever way the wind blows], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zenodo logo.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Siddham''' or the '''Asia Inscriptions Database''' is an open-access resource for the study of inscriptions from South, Central and South East Asia. Siddham was established by the [[European Research Council]] with start-up funding from the project [[Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State]].  The first focus of Siddham is [[Sanskrit]] [[epigraphy]], mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods. In South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, Richard. ''Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In its next phases, Siddham will expand to include inscriptions in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Prakrit]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]. 

==Etymology==
In [[Sanskrit]] ''siddhaṃ'' means "success, accomplished, perfected." It was also symbolism and substitution for an "auspicious sign" found in the oldest inscriptions of the South Asia. In some cases, siddham is not spelled out, but indicated with a sign such as ''[[Om]]'' or a ''srivasta'', and various scholars consider ''siddham'' in inscriptions to be equivalent to these signs.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lore Sander (1986), ''Om or Siddham–Remarks on Openings of Buddhist Manuscripts and Inscriptions from Gilgit and Central Asia'', in Deyadharma: Studies in Memory of Dr. DC Sircar, pages 251-261&lt;/ref&gt;

This word, written out in characters (such as those shown in the Siddham logo) or represented by a symbol, often stands at the beginning of inscriptions in Indic languages.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Siddham'' is also used as a short name for the Indian script known as [[Siddhaṃ_script|siddhamātṛkā]].

==Technical background==
The records in Siddham have been prepared in [[EpiDoc]], a tool for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]]. 

==Numbering system==
Within Siddham, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, copper-plate, stone slab and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each inscription has been assigned a separate Siddham number. A good example is the [[Allahabad pillar]] -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of Aśoka, [[Samudragupta]] and Jahāngīr.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Harry. ''Aśokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography''. Mainz am Rhein: Ph. von Zabern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription of Samdragupta appears in Siddham as IN00001.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://siddham.uk/object/ob00001&lt;/ref&gt; All material generated for SIDDHAṂ is archived in [[Zenodo]].

The further example illustrated here is from [[Salihundam]], Gara Mandal, Srikakulam district, [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, a Buddhist place located approximately at 18°20'7"N 84°2'28"E. At this site, a series of five votive inscriptions are engraved on the semi-circular threshold of a ruined shrine. In Siddham, the semi-circular stone will carry an object number and each votive record an independent inscription number. The photograph of the inscriptions is archived as Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.557032.
[[File:Salihundam votive inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Salihundam, Andhra Pradesh. Votive inscriptions. In SIDDHAṂ the semi-circular threshold will have an object number, and each votive record an inscription number.]]

[[File:Erc-logo.jpg|thumb|]]
==Translations==
Translations of inscription texts into western languages appear separately in the community called '''SIDDHAṂ traductions''' in [[Zenodo]]. Each translation is numbered according to the inscription number assigned in Siddham.

==Mapping==
Epigraphic documentation involves mapping sites of key dynasties and their inscriptions, especially land-charters recording gifts of land. The mapping undertaken to date can be explored through these links:

The Cambridge University Press originally published the anthology in 1897. An EBook version was made available through ''[[Project Gutenberg|The Project Gutenberg]]'' on 3 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm Sharp, Evelyn.

==Plot==
The tale of "The Wonderful Toymaker" begins with a spoiled princess named Petulant, an eight-year-old girl who cannot be pleased at any cost. Her father, the King, gathers his council together to help find a toy for the Princess that will surpass all others. The Prime Minister volunteers his son Martin to find the princess a special toy. Martin talks with Princess Petulant and promises to return in four weeks with an amazing toy.

At the beginning of Martin’s journey he encounters Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter who knows everything. Martin hopes that Bobolink will help him to find his way to The Wonderful Toymaker. However, Bobolink is annoyed about having to provide information about everything to everyone, and is initially reluctant to assist Martin. Martin’s lack of flattery towards him serves as a refreshing change, and Bobolink soon becomes quite eager to help him. Bobolink tells Martin that his next step is to reach the pine dwarfs, warning him to avoid conversation with the creatures or he will be stuck in the country of conversation forever. Martin almost makes it through the country of conversation without a single word, but he becomes distracted and engages in conversation with a fish. Martin’s error forces him to "become conversation," and suddenly he is trapped with no way out. The princess continues to wait patiently but she eventually becomes very upset that Martin has not returned with her toy. The council becomes worried, and contemplates where Martin could possibly be. The Princess, alone and sobbing, is confronted by a pine dwarf who promises to bring her to the waterfall and show her the way to Martin. The Princess stuffs her ears with cotton and begins her journey.

Princess Petulant finally makes it to Martin without speaking a single word, and they are both able to escape. The two run as fast as they can to the toyshop. The Toymaker, so pleased to see them, wishes that they stay and play with him forever. Martin and Princess Petulant play with the best toys they have ever seen, finally satisfying the Princess’ desire for a new toy. Martin and Princess Petulant tell the Toymaker that they are unable to stay and although he is sad, he assists them in their journey home. Upon their return they tell the entire story to a Royal Historian who records it all in the very book in which this story is contained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm Sharp, Evelyn.

==Author==

[[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] (4 August 1869 – 17 June 1955) was a British suffragette and Children's writer born in [[Denmark Hill]], London. She was prevented from receiving a formal education by her family for quite some time, but later entered school and attended [[Collège de France]]. Sharp began writing novels and short stories that reflected her understanding of children’s perspectives, as well as her evolving perspectives on life, social issues, and women's rights. In 1906, after becoming inspired by a speech by suffragette [[Elizabeth Robins]], she became active and devoted to the women’s suffrage movement. Sharp married [[Henry Nevinson]] in 1933. He died in 1941. Sharp fell into a depression and eventually became blind; she died in London in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V. "Sharp , Evelyn Jane (1869-1955)."

{{lead too short|date=January 2017}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] '''theories about religion''' (or '''theories of religion''') generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

==History==
From [[presocratic]] times, ancient authors advanced [[:wikt:prescientific | prescientific]] theories about religion.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"&gt;Segal 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Herodotus]] (484 – 425 [[Common Era|BCE]]) saw the gods of Greece as the same as the gods of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euhemerus]] (about 330 – 264 BCE) regarded gods as excellent historical persons whom admirers eventually [[Euhemerism|came to worship]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"/&gt;

Scientific theories, inferred and tested by the [[comparative sociology | comparative method]], emerged after data from tribes and peoples all over the world became available in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"/&gt; [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) has the reputation of having founded the scientific study of religion; he advocated a comparative method that developed into  [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926-2006) and others questioned the validity of abstracting a general theory of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Theories of religion can be classified into:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Substantive (or [[essentialist]]) theories that focus on the contents of religions and the meaning the contents have for people. This approach asserts that people have faith because beliefs make sense insofar as they hold value and are comprehensible. The theories by Tylor and Frazer (focusing on the explanatory value of religion for its adherents), by Rudolf Otto (focusing on the importance of [[religious experience]], more specifically experiences that are both fascinating and terrifying) and by Mircea Eliade (focusing on the longing for otherworldly perfection, the quest for meaning, and the search for patterns in mythology in various religions) offer examples of substantive theories.
* [[Structural functionalism|Functional]] (and in a stronger form [[Reductionism|reductionist]]) theories that focus on the social or psychological functions that religion has for a group or a person. In simple terms, the functional approach sees religion as "performing certain functions for society"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories by Karl Marx (role of religion in capitalist and pre-capitalist societies), Sigmund Freud ([[psychology|psychological]] origin of religious beliefs), Émile Durkheim (social function of religions), and the theory by Stark and Bainbridge exemplify functional theories.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1998|loc=Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach tends to be static, with the exception of Marx' theory, and unlike e.g. Weber's approach, which treats of the interaction and dynamic processes between religions and the rest of societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other dichotomies according to which theories or descriptions of religions can be classified include:&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "insider" versus "outsider" perspectives (roughly corresponding to [[emic and etic|emic versus etic]] descriptions)
* individualist versus social views
* [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] versus [[relativism|relativist]] views

==Methodologies==
Early '''essentialists''', such as Tylor and Frazer, looked for similar beliefs and practices in all societies, especially the more primitive ones, more or less regardless of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Emile Durkheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; They relied heavily on reports made by missionaries, discoverers, and colonial civil servants. These were all investigators who had a religious background themselves, thus they looked at religion from the inside. Typically they did not practice investigative field work, but used the accidental reports of others. This method left them open to criticism for lack of universality, which many freely admitted. The theories could be updated, however, by considering new reports, which [[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1866-1943) did for Tylor's theory of the evolution of religion.

Field workers deliberately sent out by universities and other institutions to collect specific cultural data made available a much greater database than random reports. For example, the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902-1973) preferred detailed [[Ethnography|ethnographical]] study of tribal religion as more reliable. He criticised the work of his predecessors, [[Max Müller|Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Tylor]], and [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], as untestable speculation. He called them "armchair anthropologists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second methodology, '''functionalism''', seeks explanations of religion that are outside of religion; i.e., the theorists are generally (but not necessarily) atheists or agnostics themselves. As did the essentialists, the functionalists proceeded from reports to investigative studies. Their fundamental assumptions, however, are quite different; notably, they apply what is called{{by whom|date=April 2015}} "methodological naturalism". When explaining religion they reject divine or [[supernatural]] explanations for the status or origins of religions because they are not scientifically testable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, theorists such as Marett (an Anglican) excluded scientific results altogether, defining religion as the domain of the unpredictable and unexplainable; that is, comparative religion is the rational (and scientific) study of the irrational. The dichotomy between the two classifications is not bridgeable, even though they have the same methods, because each excludes the data of the other.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The functionalists and some of the later essentialists (among others E. E. Evans-Pritchard) have criticized the '''substantive''' view as neglecting social aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|pp=47, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such critics go so far as to brand Tylor's and Frazer's views on the origin of religion as unverifiable speculation.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 47"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of [[monotheism]] as more evolved than [[polytheism]] represents a mere preconception, they assert. There is evidence that monotheism is more prevalent in hunter societies than in agricultural societies.{{cn|date=November 2015}} The view of a uniform progression in folkways is criticized as unverifiable, as the writer [[Andrew Lang]] (1844–1912) and E. E. Evans-Pritchard assert.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2005&gt;{{harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter criticism presumes that the evolutionary views of the early cultural anthropologists envisaged a uniform cultural evolution. Another criticism supposes that Tylor and Frazer were individualists (unscientific). However, some support that supposed approach as worthwhile, among others the anthropologist [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between the two fundamental presumptions - and the question of what data can be considered valid - continues.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Substantive theories==

===Evolutionary theories===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Evolutionary theories view religion as either an adaptation or a byproduct. Adaptationist theories view religion as being of adaptive value to the survival of Pleistocene humans. Byproduct theories view religion as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]].

===Edward Burnett Tylor===
[[File:PSM V26 D156 Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|250px|Edward Burnett Tylor]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832–1917) defined religion as belief in spiritual beings and stated that this belief originated as explanations of natural phenomena. Belief in spirits grew out of attempts to explain life and death. Primitive people used human dreams in which spirits seemed to appear as an indication that the human mind could exist independent of a body. They used this by extension to explain life and death, and belief in the after life. [[Myth]]s and [[deity|deities]] to explain natural phenomena originated by analogy and an extension of these explanations. His theory assumed that the psyches of all peoples of all times are more or less the same and that explanations in [[Unilineal evolution#Tylor .26 Morgan|cultures and religions tend to grow more sophisticated]] via [[monotheism|monotheist]] religions, such as [[Christianity]] and eventually to [[science]]. Tylor saw practices and beliefs in modern societies that were similar to those of primitive societies as ''survivals'', but he did not explain why they survived.

===James George Frazer===
[[James George Frazer]] (1854–1941) followed Tylor's theories to a great extent in his book [[The Golden Bough]], but he distinguished between [[magical thinking|magic]] and [[religion]]. [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] is used to influence the natural world in the primitive man's struggle for survival. He asserted that [[Sympathetic magic|magic relied on an uncritical belief of primitive people in contact and imitation]]. For example, precipitation may be invoked by the primitive man by sprinkling water on the ground. He asserted that according to them magic worked through laws. In contrast religion is faith that the natural world is ruled by one or more deities with personal characteristics with whom can be pleaded, not by laws.

===Rudolf Otto===

The theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) focused on [[religious experience]], more specifically moments that he called [[numinous]] which means "Wholly Other". He described it as ''mysterium tremendum'' (terrifying mystery) and ''mysterium fascinans'' (awe inspiring, fascinating mystery). He saw religion as emerging from these experiences.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

He asserted that these experiences arise from a special, non-rational faculty of the human mind, largely unrelated to other faculties, so religion cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to culture or society. Some of his views, among others that the experience of the [[numinous]] was caused by a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] reality, are untestable and hence unscientific.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"/&gt;

His ideas strongly influenced [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenologists]] and [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|Psychology of religion#Rudolf Otto|Religious experience#The numinous}}

===Mircea Eliade===
[[File:Mircea Eliade2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mircea Eliade]]
{{main|Eternal return (Eliade)|Hierophany|}}
[[Mircea Eliade]]'s (1907–1986) approach grew out of the [[phenomenology of religion]]. Like Otto, he saw religion as something special and autonomous, that cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to the social, economical or psychological alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Durkheim, he saw the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] as central to religion, but differing from Durkheim, he views the sacred as often dealing with the [[supernatural]], not with the clan or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily life of an ordinary person is connected to the sacred by the appearance of the sacred, called [[hierophany]]. [[Theophany]] (an appearance of a god) is a special case of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Eternal return (Eliade)|The Myth of the Eternal Return]]'' Eliade wrote that archaic men wish to participate in the sacred, and that they long to return to lost paradise outside the historic time to escape meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primitive man could not endure that his struggle to survive had no meaning.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, man had a [[nostalgia]] (longing) for an otherworldly perfection. Archaic man wishes to escape the ''terror of time'' and saw [[cyclic time|time as cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"/&gt; Historical religions like Christianity and Judaism revolted against this older concept of cyclic time. They provided meaning and contact with the sacred ''in'' history through the god of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sought and found patterns in [[mythology|myth]] in various cultures, e.g. [[sky god]]s such as [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's methodology was studying [[comparative religion]] of various cultures and societies more or less regardless of other aspects of these societies, often relying on second hand reports. He also used some personal knowledge of other societies and cultures for his theories, among others his knowledge of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[folk religion]].

He has been criticized for vagueness in defining his key concepts. Like Frazer and Tylor he has also been accused of out-of-context comparisons of religious beliefs of very different societies and cultures.
He has also been accused of having a pro-religious bias (Christian and Hindu), though this bias does not seem essential for his theory.

===E. E. Evans-Pritchard&lt;!--linked from 'E. E. Evans-Pritchard'--&gt;===
[[File:Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard.jpg|thumb|250px|Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard in the Social and Cultural Anthropology Library, Oxford]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) did extensive [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies among the [[Azande]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] peoples who were considered "primitive" by society and earlier scholars. Evans-Pritchard saw these people as different, but not primitive.

Unlike the previous scholars, Evans-Pritchard did not propose a grand universal theory and he did extensive long-term fieldwork among "primitive" peoples, studying their culture and religion, among other among the [[Azande]]. Not just passing contact, like Eliade.

He argued that the religion of the Azande ([[witchcraft]] and [[oracle]]s) can not be understood without the social context and its social function. Witchcraft and oracles played a great role in solving disputes among the Azande. In this respect he agreed with Durkheim, though he acknowledged that Frazer and Tylor were right that their religion also had an intellectual explanatory aspect. The Azande's faith in witchcraft and oracles was quite logical and consistent once some fundamental tenets were accepted. Loss of faith in the fundamental tenets could not be endured because of its social importance and hence they had an elaborate system of explanations (or excuses) against disproving evidence. Besides an alternative system of terms or school of thought did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was heavily critical about earlier theorists of [[primitive religion]] with the exception of [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], asserting that they made statements about primitive people without having enough inside knowledge to make more than a guess. In spite of his praise of Bruhl's works, Evans-Pritchard disagreed with Bruhl's statement that a member of a "primitive" tribe saying "I am the moon" is prelogical, but that this statement makes perfect sense within their culture if understood metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Azande, Evans-Pritchard, also studied the neighbouring, but very different [[Nuer people|Nuer]] people. The Nuer had had an abstract monotheistic faith, somewhat similar to [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], though it included lesser spirits. They had also [[totemism]], but this was a minor aspect of their religion and hence a corrective to Durkheim's generalizations should be made. Evans-Pritchard did not propose a theory of religion''s'', but only a theory of the Nuer religion.

===Clifford Geertz===
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926–2006) made several studies in [[Java]]nese villages. He avoided the subjective and vague concept of group [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] as used by [[Ruth Benedict]] by using the analysis of society as proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] who in turn had adapted it from [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Parsons' adaptation distinguished all human groups on three levels i.e. ''1.'' an individual level that is controlled by ''2.'' a [[social system]] that is in turn controlled by ''3.'' a [[cultural system]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Geertz followed Weber when he wrote that "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/obituaries/01geertz.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title=Clifford Geertz, Cultural Anthropologist, Is Dead at 80 | accessdate=2008-03-14 | first=Andrew L. | last=Yarrow |date=November 1, 2006 | journal=New York Times: Obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz held the view that mere explanations to describe religions and cultures are not sufficient: interpretations are needed too. He advocated what he called ''[[thick description]]s'' to interpret symbols by observing them in use, and for this work, he was known as a founder of symbolic anthropology. 

Geertz saw religion as one of the [[cultural system]]s of a society. He defined religion as 
:(1) a system of symbols
:(2) which acts to establish powerful, pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in men
:(3) by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
:(4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that
:(5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With symbols Geertz meant a carrier that embodies a conception, because he saw religion and culture as systems of communication.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"/&gt;

This definition emphasizes the mutual reinforcement between [[world view]] and [[ethos]].
&lt;!-- WHAT DOES EACH POINT THIS DEFINITION MEAN? SOURCES: PALSE AND KUNIN --&gt;

Though he used more or less the same methodology as Evans-Pritchard, he did not share Evans-Pritchard's hope that a theory of religion could ever be found. Geertz proposed methodology was not the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]], but [[Historical method|the method of historians studying history]].

==Functional theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Image:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) ]]
{{main|Marxism and religion}}
The social philosopher [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) held a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] worldview.
According to Marx, the dynamics of society were determined by the [[relations of production]], that is, the relations that its members needed to enter into to produce their means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing on the ideas of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], he saw religion as a product of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] that was functional to [[opium of the people|relieving people's immediate suffering]], and as an ideology that masked the real nature of social relations.
He deemed it a contingent part of human culture, that would have disappeared after the abolition of class society.

These claims were limited, however, to his analysis of the historical relationship between European cultures, political institutions, and their Christian religious traditions.
&lt;!--WHAT IS FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO RELIGION? (Pals) --&gt;

Marxist views strongly influenced individuals' comprehension and conclusions about society, among others the anthropological school of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].

Marx' explanations for all religions, always, in all forms, and everywhere have never been taken seriously by many experts in the field, though a substantial fraction accept that Marx' views possibly explain some aspects of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent work has suggested that, while the standard account of Marx's analysis of religion is true, it is also only one side of a dialectical account, which takes seriously the disruptive, as well as the passifying moments of religion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=AM | year=2005 | title=Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion | journal=Critical Sociology | volume= 31 | number=No. 1-2 | pages=15–38 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud===
[[File:Freud 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|Sigmund Freud, 1885]]
{{main|Freud and religion|The Future of an Illusion|Totem and Taboo|Moses and Monotheism|Oedipus complex}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) saw religion as an [[The Future of an Illusion|illusion]], a belief that people very much wanted to be true. Unlike Tylor and Frazer, Freud attempted to explain why religion persists in spite of the lack of evidence for its tenets. Freud asserted that religion is a largely [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neurosis|neurotic]] response to [[Psychological repression|repression]]. By repression Freud meant that civilized society demands that we not fulfill all our desires immediately, but that they have to be repressed. Rational arguments to a person holding a religious conviction will not change the neurotic response of a person. This is in contrast to Tylor and Frazer, who saw religion as a rational and conscious, though primitive and mistaken, attempt to explain the natural world.

In his 1913 book ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' he developed a speculative story about how all [[monotheism|monotheist religions]] originated and developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he asserted that monotheistic religions grew out of a homicide in a clan of a father by his sons. This incident was subconsciously remembered in human societies.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of [[Akhenaten]] who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=S | last=Freud | encyclopedia=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume=Volume XXIII (1937{{ndash}}1939) | title=Moses and monotheism | location=London | publisher=[[Hogarth Press]] | year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's view on religion was embedded in his larger theory of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Psychoanalysis#Scientific criticism|which has been criticized as unscientific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Freud's attempt to explain the historical [[origin of religion|origins of religions]] have not been accepted, his generalized view that all religions originate from unfulfilled psychological needs is still seen as offering a credible explanation in some cases.{{sfn|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion|pp=280–281}}
{{see also|Psychology of religion#Sigmund Freud|}}

===Émile Durkheim===
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917)]]

[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) saw the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|concept of the sacred]] as the defining characteristic of religion, not faith in the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw religion as a reflection of the concern for society. He based his view on recent research regarding [[totemism]] among the [[Australian aboriginals]]. With [[totemism]] he meant that each of the many clans had a different object, plant, or animal that they held sacred and that symbolizes the clan. Durkheim saw [[totemism]] as the original and simplest form of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Durkheim, the analysis of this simple form of religion could provide the building blocks for more complex religions. He asserted that moralism cannot be separated from religion. The sacred i.e. religion reinforces group interest that clash very often with individual interests. Durkheim held the view that the function of religion is group cohesion often performed by collectively attended rituals. He asserted that these group meeting provided a special kind of energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A | year=2014 | title=Elementary Forms of the Metaphorical Life: Tropes at Work in Durkheim’s Theory of the Religious | journal=Journal of Classical Sociology | volume= 14 | number=No. 2 | pages=203–221 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3284/1/elementary_metaphors_of_the_religious_life_author_version_doc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he called [[collective effervescence|effervescence]], that made group members lose their individuality and to feel united with the gods and thus with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differing from Tylor and Frazer, he saw magic not as religious, but as an individual instrument to achieve something.

Durkheim's proposed method for progress and refinement is first to carefully study religion in its simplest form in one contemporary society and then the same in another society and compare the religions then and only between societies that are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF ASCETICISM? SOURCE Pals--&gt;
&lt;!--WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTARY FORMS OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION THAT ARE ALSO PRESENT IN MORE COMPLEX RELIGIONS? SOURCE PALS --&gt;
The empirical basis for Durkheim's view has been severely criticized when more detailed studies of the Australian aboriginals surfaced. More specifically, the definition of religion as dealing with the sacred only, regardless of the supernatural, is not supported by studies of these aboriginals. The view that religion has a social aspect, at the very least, introduced in a generalized very strong form by Durkheim has become influential and uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's approach gave rise to [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalist school in sociology and anthropology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism is a sociological paradigm that originally attempted to explain social institutions as collective means to fill individual biological needs, focusing on the ways in which social institutions fill social needs, especially social stability. Thus because Durkheim viewed society as an "organismic analogy of the body, wherein all the parts work together to maintain the equilibrium of the whole, religion was understood to be the glue that held society together.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronisław Malinowski===
The anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was strongly influenced by the functionalist school and argued that religion originated from coping with [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strenski2006p269&gt;{{harvnb|Strenski|2006|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw science as practical knowledge that every society needs abundantly to survive and magic as related to this practical knowledge, but generally dealing with phenomena that humans cannot control.

===Max Weber===
[[Image:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Max Weber]]]]
{{main|Sociology of Religion (book)|Charismatic authority|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism|Three-component theory of stratification}}
[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) thought that the truth claims of religious movement were irrelevant for the scientific study of the movements.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; He portrayed each religion as rational and consistent in their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weber acknowledged that religion had a strong social component, but diverged from Durkheim by arguing, for example in his book  [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] that religion can be a force of change in society. In the book Weber wrote that modern [[capitalism]] spread quickly partially due to the Protestant worldly ascetic morale.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; Weber's main focus was not on developing a theory of religion but on the interaction between society and religion, while introducing concepts that are still widely used in the [[sociology of religion]]. These concept include
* [[Church sect typology]], Weber distinguished between [[sect]]s and churches by stating that membership of a sect is a personal choice and church membership is determined by birth. The typology later developed more extensively by his friend [[Ernst Troeltsch]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bendix49-50"&gt;{{harvnb|Bendix|1977|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the typology, churches, [[Ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesia]], [[Religious denomination|denomination]], and [[sect]]s form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are protest break away groups and tend to be in tension with society.
* [[Ideal type]], a hypothetical "pure" or "clear" form, used in [[Typification|typologies]]
* [[Charismatic authority]] Weber saw charisma as a volatile form or authority that depends on the acceptance of unique quality of a person by this person's followers. Charisma can be a revolutionary force and the authority can either be [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinized]] (change into [[Tripartite classification of authority|other forms of authority]]) or disappear upon the death of the charismatic person.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

Somewhat differing from Marx, Weber dealt with [[status group]]s, not with [[Social class|class]]. In status groups the primary motivation is prestige and [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status groups have differing levels of access to power and prestige and indirectly to economic resources. In [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his 1920 treatment of the religion in China]] he saw [[Confucianism]] as helping a certain status group, i.e. the educated elite to maintain access to prestige and power. He asserted that Confucianism opposition against both extravagance and thrift made it unlikely that capitalism could have originated in China.

He used the concept of ''[[Verstehen#Weber and the social sciences|Verstehen]]'' (German for "understanding") to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Sociological classifications of religious movements#The church-sect typology|Sociology of religion#Max_Weber}}

===Rational choice theory===
{{main|Theory of religious economy}}
The [[rational choice theory]] has been applied to religions, among others by the sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] (1934 – ) and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1940 – ).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see religions as systems of "compensators",  and view human beings as "rational actors, making choices that she or he thinks best, calculating costs and benefits".&lt;ref&gt;The quote is from {{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{harvnb|Nauta|1998|loc=Stark, Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compensators are a body of language and practices that compensate for some physical lack or frustrated goal. They can be divided into specific compensators (compensators for the failure to achieve specific goals), and general compensators (compensators for failure to achieve any goal).&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; They define religion as a system of compensation that relies on the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasoning behind this theory is that the compensation is what controls the choice, or in other words the choices which the "rational actors" make are "rational in the sense that they are centered on the satisfaction of wants".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that social or political movements that fail to achieve their goals will often transform into religions. As it becomes clear that the goals of the movement will not be achieved by natural means (at least within their lifetimes), members of the movement will look to the supernatural to achieve what cannot be achieved naturally. The new religious beliefs are compensators for the failure to achieve the original goals. Examples of this include the [[counterculture]] movement in America: the early counterculture movement was intent on changing society and removing its injustice and boredom; but as members of the movement proved unable to achieve these goals they turned to Eastern and new religions as compensators.

Most religions start out their lives as [[cult]]s or [[sect]]s, i.e. groups in high tension with the surrounding society, containing different views and beliefs contrary to the societal norm. Over time, they tend to either die out, or become more established, mainstream and in less tension with society. Cults are new groups with a new novel [[theology]], while sects are attempts to return mainstream religions to (what the sect views as) their original purity. Mainstream established groups are called [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s. The comments below about cult formation apply equally well to sect formation.

There are four models of cult formation: the [[psychopathology|Psychopathological]] Model, the Entrepreneurial Model, the Social Model and the Normal [[Revelation]]s model.
*'''Psychopathological model''': religions are founded during a period of severe stress in the life of the founder. The founder suffers from psychological problems, which they resolve through the founding of the religion. (The development of the religion is for them a form of self-therapy, or self-medication.)
*'''Entrepreneurial model''': founders of religions act like entrepreneurs, developing new products (religions) to sell to consumers (to convert people to). According to this model, most founders of new religions already have experience in several religious groups before they begin their own. They take ideas from the pre-existing religions, and try to improve on them to make them more popular.
*'''Social model:''' religions are founded by means of [[social implosion]]s. Members of the religious group spend less and less time with people outside the group, and more and more time with each other within it. The level of affection and emotional bonding between members of a group increases, and their emotional bonds to members outside the group diminish. According to the social model, when a social implosion occurs, the group will naturally develop a new theology and rituals to accompany it.
*'''Normal revelations''': religions are founded when the founder interprets ordinary natural phenomena as supernatural; for instance, ascribing his or her own creativity in inventing the religion to that of the deity.
Some religions are better described by one model than another, though all apply to differing degrees to all religions.

Once a cult or sect has been founded, the next problem for the founder is to convert new members to it. Prime candidates for [[religious conversion]] are those with an openness to religion, but who do not belong or fit well in any existing religious group. Those with no religion or no interest in religion are difficult to convert, especially since the cult and sect beliefs are so extreme by the standards of the surrounding society. But those already happy members of a religious group are difficult to convert as well, since they have strong social links to their preexisting religion and are unlikely to want to sever them in order to join a new one. The best candidates for religious conversion are those who are members of or have been associated with religious groups (thereby showing an interest or openness to religion), yet exist on the fringe of these groups, without strong social ties to prevent them from joining a new group.

Potential converts vary in their level of social connection. [[New religious movement|New religions]] best spread through pre-existing friendship networks. Converts who are marginal with few friends are easy to convert, but having few friends to convert they cannot add much to the further growth of the organization. Converts with a large social network are harder to convert, since they tend to have more invested in mainstream society; but once converted they yield many new followers through their friendship network.

Cults initially can have quite high growth rates; but as the social networks that initially feed them are exhausted, their growth rate falls quickly. On the other hand, the rate of [[exponential growth|growth is exponential]] (ignoring the limited supply of potential converts): the more converts you have, the more missionaries you can have out looking for new converts. But nonetheless it can take a very long time for religions to grow to a large size by natural growth. This often leads to cult leaders giving up after several decades, and withdrawing the cult from the world.

It is difficult for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more than about a generation. As children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.

The [[theory of religious economy]] sees different [[religious organizations]] competing for followers in a religious economy, much like the way [[business]]es compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. Theorists assert that a true religious economy is the result of [[religious pluralism]], giving the population a wider variety of choices in religion. According to the theory, the more [[religion]]s there are, the more likely the population is to be religious and hereby contradicting the [[Secularization|secularization thesis]].

|ShortSummary=Tony and the team rip up the pristine lawns of Paul Whight's stately home in search of the secrets of its illustrious former owners: the De Veres, who built a priory here in the 12th century. They are also hoping to discover the later manor house. There is a rumour that the dissolute 17th Earl, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Edward]], wrote at least some of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays, and could be buried here, along with his ancestors and descendants. Geophysics is now able to produce 3D images of what is underground; while Jackie has plenty of bones to look at. Alex helps stone carver Lucy Churchill to carve some de Vere symbols from blocks of rare [[alabaster]]. Among the many finds are stained glass and [[encaustic tile]]s. They are joined by Anna Whitelock from the University of London. Finally, state-of-the-art laser technology entombs Alex in his own [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="IMDB 1907"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2362859/|title=Time Team - Earls Colne, Essex|accessdate=2015-10-09|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landowner Mickey Bradley hopes that the site will be preserved as a heritage site. High class stone carvings indicate what is likely to be one of King John's hunting lodges or a ceremonial hall, rather than a fully fledged palace. They are joined by Tony Rotherham, who describes the practices and terrible punishments meted out to local poachers such as Robin Hood. He was probably only one of many outlaws inhabiting these forests, which were maintained by royalty for hunting and other amusements. Tony Rotherham also demonstrates the unmaking ritual, or butchery of a deer carcass.

The '''Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi''' (Arabic: قبر النبيا Qubur El Anbiyya, lit. "Grave (of) The Prophets") is an ancient burial site located on the upper western slope of the [[Mount of Olives]], [[Jerusalem]]. According to a medieval Jewish tradition also adopted by Christians, the catacomb is believed to be the burial place of [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Malachi]], the last three [[Hebrew Bible]] prophets who are believed to have lived during the 6th-5th centuries BC. Archaeologists have dated the three earliest burial chambers to the 1st century BC, thus contradicting the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700, 2008 (5th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial chamber==
The chamber forms two concentric passages containing 38 burial niches.&lt;ref name="Cornfeld1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gaalyahu Cornfeld|title=I Love Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJsxXIZvjcsC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=22 November 2010|year=1973|publisher=Kinneret|page=138|id=GGKEY:75S35PKF07B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to the large [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut burial cave]] is on the western side, where a staircase descends, flanked on both sides by a stone [[balustrade]].&lt;ref name="KlonerZissu2007"/&gt; It leads into a large circular central vault measuring 24&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter. From it, two parallel tunnels, 5&amp;nbsp;ft wide and 10&amp;nbsp;ft high, stretch some 20 yards through the rock. A third tunnel runs in another direction. They are all connected by cross galleries, the outer one of which measures 40  yards in length.&lt;ref name="Porter1866"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Josias Leslie Porter]]|title=The giant cities of Bashan and Syria's Holy places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mo75ino-q6MC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=27 November 2010|year=1866|publisher=T. Nelson and Sons|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the complex actually dates from the 1st-century BCE, when these style of tombs came into use for Jewish burial. Some Greek inscriptions discovered at the site suggest the cave was re-used to bury foreign Christians during the 4th and 5th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Winter1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave Winter|title=Israel handbook: with the Palestinian Authority areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFmaH4AbP6QC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=22 November 2010|year=1999|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-900949-48-4|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one of the side walls of the vault, a Greek inscription translates:

'''''Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics''''', or '''''Totem and Taboo: Some Points of Agreement between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics''''', ({{lang-de|Totem und Tabu: Einige Übereinstimmungen im Seelenleben der Wilden und der Neurotiker}}) is a 1913 book by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in which the author applies his work to the fields of [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], and the study of religion. It is a collection of four essays inspired by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Carl Jung]] and first published in the journal ''[[American Imago|Imago]]'' (1912–13): "The Horror of Incest", "Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence", "Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thoughts", and "The Return of [[Totemism]] in Childhood".

Though ''Totem and Taboo'' has been seen as one of the classics of anthropology, comparable to [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and Sir [[James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), the work is now considered discredited by anthropologists. The cultural anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] was an early critic of ''Totem and Taboo'', publishing a critique of the work in 1920. Some authors have seen redeeming value in the work.

==Background==
Freud, who had a longstanding interest in [[social anthropology]] and was devoted to the study of [[archaeology]] and [[prehistory]], wrote that the work of Wilhelm Wundt and Carl Jung provided him with his "first stimulus" to write the essays included in ''Totem and Taboo''. The work was translated twice into English, first by [[Abraham Brill]] and later by [[James Strachey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dickson, Albert |author2=Freud, Sigmund |title=The Penguin Freud Library Volume 13: The Origins of Religion |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=45, 46, 49 |isbn=0-14-013803-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud was influenced by the work of [[James George Frazer]], including ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Chapter 1===
"The Horror of Incest" concerns [[incest]] [[taboos]] adopted by societies believing in [[totemism]].

Freud examines the system of Totemism among the [[Australian Aborigines]]. Every clan has a totem (usually an animal, sometimes a plant or force of nature) and people are not allowed to marry those with the same totem as themselves. Freud examines this practice as preventing against incest. The totem is passed down hereditarily, either through the father or the mother. The relationship of father is also not just his father, but every man in the clan that, hypothetically, could have been his father. He relates this to the idea of young children calling all of their parents' friends as aunts and uncles. There are also further marriage classes, sometimes as many as eight, that group the totems together, and therefore limit a man's choice of partners. He also talks about the widespread practices amongst the cultures of the Pacific Islands and Africa of avoidance. Many cultures do not allow brothers and sisters to interact in any way, generally after puberty. Men are not allowed to be alone with their mothers-in-law or say each other's names. He explains this by saying that after a certain age parents often live through their children to endure their marriage and that mothers-in-law may become overly attached to their son-in-law. Similar restrictions exist between a father and daughter, but they only exist from puberty until engagement.

===Chapter 2===
In "Taboo and emotional ambivalence," Freud considers the relationship of [[taboo]]s to totemism. Freud uses his concepts [[psychological projection|projection]] and [[ambivalence#In psychoanalysis|ambivalence]] he developed during his work with neurotic patients in Vienna to discuss the relationship between taboo and totemism.

Like [[neuroticism|neurotics]], 'primitive' people feel ambivalent about most people in their lives, but will not admit this consciously to themselves. They will not admit that as much as they love their mother, there are things about her they hate. The suppressed part of this ambivalence (the hate parts) are projected onto others. In the case of natives, the hateful parts are projected onto the totem, as in: 'I did not want my mother to die; the totem wanted her to die.'

Freud expands this idea of ambivalence to include the relationship of citizens to their ruler. In ceremonies surrounding kings, which are often quite violent, – such as the king starving himself in the woods for a few weeks – he considers two levels that are functioning to be the "ostensible" (i.e., the king is being honored) and the "actual" (i.e., the king is being tortured). He uses examples to illustrate the taboos on rulers. He says the kings of Ireland were subject to restrictions such as not being able to go to certain towns or on certain days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund ''Totem and Taboo'' London WW Norton 1989 page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 3===
In "Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thought," Freud examines the animism and narcissistic phase associated with a primitive understanding of the universe and early libidinal development. A belief in magic and sorcery derives from an overvaluation of psychical acts whereby the structural conditions of mind are transposed onto the world: this overvaluation survives in both primitive men and neurotics. The [[animistic]] mode of thinking is governed by an "omnipotence of thoughts", a [[projection (psychology)|projection]] of inner mental life onto the external world. This imaginary construction of reality is also discernible in [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive]] thinking, [[delusional disorder]]s and [[phobia]]s. Freud comments that the omnipotence of thoughts has been retained in the magical realm of art. The last part of the essay concludes the relationship between [[magic (paranormal)]], [[superstition]] and taboo, arguing that the practices of animism are merely a cover up of instinctual [[repression (psychological)|repression]] (Freud).

===Chapter 4===
In "The Return of Totemism in Childhood," Freud combines one of [[Charles Darwin]]'s more speculative theories about the arrangements of early human societies (a single alpha-male surrounded by a harem of females, similar to the arrangement of [[gorilla]] groupings) with the theory of the sacrifice ritual taken from [[William Robertson Smith]] to conclude that the origins of  [[totem]]ism lie in a singular event, when a band of prehistoric brothers expelled from the alpha-male group returned to kill their father, whom they both feared and respected. In this respect, Freud located the beginnings of the [[Oedipus complex]] at the origins of human society, and postulated that all religion was in effect an extended and collective form of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and ambivalence to cope with the killing of the father figure (which he saw as the true [[original sin]]).

==Reception==
===Early reviews===
In 1914, ''Totem and Taboo'' received a negative review from Carl Furtmüller in ''Zentralblatt für Psychologie und Psychotherapie''. Other reviews written between 1912 and 1920 include those by the psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in ''Zentralblatt für Psychologie und Psychotherapie'', the neurologist and psychiatrist [[William Alanson White]] in ''Psychoanalytic Review'', the biographer [[Francis Hackett]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'', the psychologist [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', and the anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kiell, Norman |title=Freud Without Hindsight: Reviews of His Work, 1893-1939 |publisher=Intertational Universities Press, Inc. |location=Madison, Connecticut |year=1988 |pages=387–417 |isbn=0-8236-2055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furtmüller wrote that the work showed Freud's increasing "isolation from the scientific world". He accused Freud of ignoring criticisms directed against his theories, and objected to Freud's basing his investigations on the theory of the Oedipus complex. He credited Freud with providing a "compact survey" of the confusing state of research into totemism, but believed that it was difficult for psychoanalysts to deal with the subject because they could not base their conclusions on "first-hand experience", and that Freud attached too much importance to "the belief of totemistic acolytes that they are descendants of the totem animal." He criticized Freud's attempt to explain totemism through parallels with the "psychological life" of children, arguing that the analytical results Freud employed were of questionable accuracy and did little to provide a "solution of the problem of totemism", and that Freud failed to explain why the totem was represented as an animal. He also considered Freud wrong to consider exogamy one of the most important features of totemism. Though believing that Freud showed "sharp wit", he accused him of engaging in "the free play of fantasy" where "logical argumentation" was needed and of misunderstanding the work of Darwin. He wrote that Freud explained morality as the "product of a social contract" and compared the Oedipus complex to the "original sin of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kiell, Norman |title=Freud Without Hindsight: Reviews of His Work, 1893-1939 |publisher=Intertational Universities Press, Inc. |location=Madison, Connecticut |year=1988 |pages=393–396 |isbn=0-8236-2055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of anthropologists===
''Totem and Taboo'' became widely known in the United States by the end of [[World War I]]. According to Annemarie De Waal Malefijt, the book produced "angry reactions" from anthropologists even on the basis of its subtitle alone.&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;{{cite book |author=De Waal Malefijt, Annemarie |title=Images of Man: A History of Anthropological Thought |publisher=Alfred A. Knpof |location=New York |year=1974 |page=295 |isbn=0-394-48330-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist critics of ''Totem and Taboo'' included Kroeber, who described Freud as a "gallant and stimulating adventurer into ethnology" but rejected the idea that Freud's theories could explain social origins and evolutionary phases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroeber|first1=Alfred, L.|title=Totem and Taboo: An Ethnologic Psychoanalysis|jstor=660103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Boas]], who considered Freud's method in ''Totem and Taboo'' one-sided and useless for advancing understanding of cultural development,&lt;ref name="De Waal" /&gt; and [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], who referred to the work as a "just-so story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gay, Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=Papermac |location=London |year=1995 |pages=327 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] criticized ''Totem and Taboo'' in his ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;concluding chapter of Claude Levi-Strauss, 562-563-564 pages of the edition by Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, 2002, ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949), Needham, Rodney, ed&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroeber published a reassessment of ''Totem and Taboo'' in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Marvin |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |year=1971 |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company |page=431 |isbn=0-690-703228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] described ''Totem and Taboo'' as representative of what Boas's followers regarded as "the worst form of evolutionary speculation", criticizing "the grandiosity of its compass, the flimsiness of its evidence ... the generality of its conclusions" and its "anachronistic framework". In his view, nothing about the work prepared "orthodox Freudians" to deal with the variety of culturally determined personality structures revealed by the work of [[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Margaret Mead]], and [[Ruth Benedict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Marvin |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |year=1971 |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company |pages=425–6 |isbn=0-690-703228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Farb]] wrote that ''Totem and Taboo'' "demonstrates the lengths to which a theorist will go to find an explanation" for totemism, adding that despite their disagreements on other issues, anthropologists now concur that the work is "totally discredited".&lt;ref name="Farb"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farb, Peter |title=Man's Rise to Civilization: The Cultural Ascent of the Indians of North America |publisher=E. P. Dutton |location=New York |year=1978 |pages=67–68 |isbn=0-525-15270-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of psychoanalysts===
[[Géza Róheim]], an anthropologist as well as a psychoanalyst, considered ''Totem and Taboo'' one of the great landmarks in the history of anthropology, comparable only to Edward Burnett Tylor's ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and Sir James George Frazer's ''The Golden Bough'' (1890). Róheim described ''Totem and Taboo'' as an "epoch-making work" in both anthropology and the social sciences generally. Róheim eventually abandoned the assumptions of ''Totem and Taboo'', but continued to regard it as a classic, the work that created psychoanalytic anthropology. [[Wilhelm Reich]], following [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]] and other authors, maintained that early human societies were matriarchies and that this ruled out Freud's account of the origins of civilization in ''Totem and Taboo''. Reich argued that Freud's theory that the Oedipus complex was a prime factor in the development of civilization ignored the cultural relativity of the Oedipus complex, which, drawing on the work of Malinowski, he saw as only a result of the patriarchal order.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Paul |title=The Freudian Left |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca and London |year=1990 |pages=50–51, 89–90 |isbn=0-8014-9716-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself considered "The Return of Totemism in Childhood" his best-written work, and ''Totem and Taboo'' as a whole remained one of his favorite works.&lt;ref name="Dickson" /&gt;

===Other responses===
The classical scholar [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] called ''Totem and Taboo'' one of the most important works in her intellectual life. Harrison's work ''Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion'' (1912) has been compared to ''Totem and Taboo'', since Harrison and Freud both attempted to find a universal mechanism that would account for the origins of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ackerman, Robert |title=The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=116, 124 |isbn=0-415-93963-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Thomas Mann]] wrote that ''Totem and Taboo'' had made a stronger impression on him than any of Freud's other works, and that of all Freud's works it had the greatest artistic merit.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dickson, Albert |author2=Freud, Sigmund |title=The Penguin Freud Library Volume 13: The Origins of Religion |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=47 |isbn=0-14-013803-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] criticized ''Totem and Taboo'' in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), writing that Freud is forced to "invent strange fictions" to explain the passage from "the individual to the society"; she saw the inability to explain this transition as a failing of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beauvoir, Simone de |title=The Second Sex |publisher=Vintage Books |location=London |year=2009 |page=56 |isbn=978-0-099-49938-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Bataille]] argued that Freud was misled by the "superficial knowledge of ethnographical data" typical of his time into concluding that the taboo on touching corpses generally countered a desire to touch them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bataille, Georges |title=Eroticism |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=2001 |page=47 |isbn=0-14-118410-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical scholar [[Norman O. Brown]] criticized the work in ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), writing that Freud correlates psycho-sexual stages of development with stages of history, thereby seeing history as a "process of growing up". Brown saw this view as a "residue of eighteenth-century optimism and rationalism", and found it inadequate as both history and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Norman O. |title=Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of Human History |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location=Hanover |year=1985 |page=14 |isbn=0-8195-6144-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] considered Freud's ''Totem and Taboo'' and Jung's ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'' (1912) the two key works that initiated the systematic interpretation of ethnological materials through insights gained through the study of neurotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=16 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[René Girard]] wrote in ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'' (1972) that despite the rejection of ''Totem and Taboo'' by "contemporary criticism", its concept of collective murder is close to the themes of his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Girard, René |title=Violence and the Sacred |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |year=2005 |page=204 |isbn=0-8264-7718-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Peter Gay]], writing in ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988), suggested that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud made conjectures more ingenious than those of the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Gay observed that ''Totem and Taboo'' was in part an attempt by Freud to outdo his rival Jung, and that the work is full of evidence that "Freud's current combats reverberated with his past history, conscious and unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gay, Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=Papermac |location=London |year=1995 |pages=325–6 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Harold Bloom]] asserted in ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992) that ''Totem and Taboo'' has no greater acceptance among anthropologists than does the [[Book of Mormon]], and that there are parallels between the two works, such as a concern with [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=106–7 |isbn=0-671-67997-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Schechner]] criticized Freud for having assumed in ''Totem and Taboo'' that some humans are more "primitive" than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schechner, Richard |editor=Ingold, Tim |title=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology: Humanity, Culture, and Social Life |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1994 |pages=635–6 |isbn=0-415-16421-4 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[David P. Barash]] concluded that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud "combines idiosyncratic, almost crackpot fantasy with startling profundity and originality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barash, David P. |title=Ideas of Human Nature: From the Bhagavad Gita |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=116 |isbn=0-13-647587-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Elliott argued that Freud's account of social and cultural organization suffers from limitations, and that because of anthropological knowledge that became available subsequent to ''Totem and Taboo'' the theories Freud proposed there now have few advocates. Elliott wrote that, "Freud's attempt to anchor the Oedipus complex in a foundational event displaces his crucial insights into the radically creative power of the human imagination", ascribing to real events "what are in fact products of fantasy". Elliott added that Freud should be credited with showing that "reality is not pre-given or natural", but rather structured by the social and technical frameworks fashioned by human beings, and that "individual subjectivity and society presuppose one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elliott, Anthony |title=Psychoanalytic Theory: An Introduction |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave |page=43 |isbn=0-333-91912-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominique Bourdin wrote that in ''Totem and Taboo'', Freud "develops an idea that clearly embarrasses the current psychoanalysts, but that is essential to the logic of Freudian thought: that of [[Phylogenetics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bourdin, Dominique |title=La psychanalyse de Freud à aujourd'hui: Histoire, concepts, pratique |publisher=Bréal |location=Paris |year=2007 |page=89 |isbn=978-2749507460 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]] and the psychologist [[Sonu Shamdasani]] argued that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud applied to history "the same method of interpretation that he used in the privacy of his office to 'reconstruct' his patients' forgotten and repressed memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Borch-Jacobsen, Mikkel |author2=Shamdasani, Sonu |title=The Freud Files: An Inquiry into the History of Psychoanalysis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2012 |pages=179–180 |isbn=978-0-521-72978-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">'''Transnational Barrios''' as a concept within [[Latin America]]n and [[Latino]] studies explains the social construction of space, place, culture, traditions, and artistic symbolic meanings that are established beyond national boundaries by diverse Latina/o populations in communities of a hosting country. Therefore '''Transnational Barrios''' are seen by scholars as critical spaces to celebrate and embrace cultural production, political mobilizations, [[ethnic identity]] and [[solidarity]], and develop a sense of belonging within communities. 

''Transnational'' as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, is extending or going beyond national boundaries or consisting of persons from different nationalities.

According to Anthropologist ''Michael Kearney'', ''Transnational'' deals with forms of organization and identity of Latinas/os that are not restricted by national boundaries, meaning not being constraint by nation-state of origin in order to form a collective identity in a hosting country.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Michael. “Transnationalism in California and Mexico at the End of Empire,” In Border Identities: Nation and State at International Frontiers. Ed. Thomas W. Wilson and Hastings Connan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 117-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Barrio|''Barrios'']] refer to a part of an inner city area mostly composed of a Spanish-speaking population. “Both historically and today, barrio formations are the result of specific plans and policies on the local, state, and federal levels that have resulted in high levels of racial segregation, substandard and limited housing stock, poor schooling, and severely circumscribed mobility.”&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as ''Gina M. Perez'', ''Frank A. Guridy'', and ''Adrian Burgos Jr.'' believe that one must use the ''transnational'' approach in Latin American and Latino Studies to create a framework that will better apprehend the diverse experiences of Latinas/os in multiple contexts. As well as confronting the negative notions of ''Barrios'' as being places of social dislocation, and marginalized and criminalized locations. '''Transnational Barrios''' therefore strive to create and progress through new meanings, experiences, and identities of diverse and compelling Latina/o populations of various communities throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Transnational Barrios==
An example of a '''Transnational Barrio''' is explained in ''Cary Cordova’s'' article “''The Mission in Nicaragua''”&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Cary. “The Mission in Nicaragua,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; in regards to the Nicaraguan community in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] of San Francisco. Nicaraguans in the U.S. mobilized in the 1970s during the ''[[Sandinista]] revolution'' to rally support for the overthrow of the current oppressive regime of ''[[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]]''. They believed that if the Sandinistas succeeded then Nicaragua would become a model for freedom and equality around the world, including the U.S. As citizens in Nicaragua were struggling with control over their own lives, so too were Nicaraguans in the U.S. due to the lack of social reforms needed by the community, mainly because of U.S. capitalism. Artists and activists used the ideas of the Nicaraguan revolution to express the political needs of Latinos in ''San Francisco'' and the Americas. Poets such as ''Alejandro Murguia, Roberto Vargas and Nina Serrano'' accomplished this by creating events such as poetry readings, rallies, demonstrations, and the creation of murals to illustrate the struggles of people in Nicaragua and in the U.S. Cordova demonstrates that the barrio served as a ''transnational space'' where ideas such as revolution, liberation and equality and political mobilization and solidarity could be transformed and used together to fight the revolution abroad and fight the war on the home front.  

[[Lourdes Gutierrez Najera]] describes another example of using barrios as a ''transnational space'' with her study of Oaxacans in the city of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez Najera, Lourdes. “Hayandose,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; In her article "Hayandose", to maintain their Zapotec and Yalalteco indigenous identity, Oaxacans organize to aid one another in times of crisis such as in the viewing of a young Oaxacan individual where a traditional Oaxacan funeral ceremony was conducted in the Koreatown district of Los Angeles. Such practices demonstrate that their strong ties are established and maintained with their hometowns. Given the marginality of indigenous people both in Mexico and the U.S. they create a space of inclusion and belonging by practicing the same customs that they perform in Oaxaca. Traditional Oaxacan dances and festivals known as ''[[Guelaguetza|Guelaguetza's]]'' are as well an important means to celebrate their indigenous roots and reaffirm their ethnic membership within transnational borders. This folkloric dance along with the other customs Zapotecs and Yalaltecos bring with them, situate their barrio as a transnational space.

[[Nuyorican Movement|''The Nuyorican poetry movement'']] of the 1970s in Manhattan’s Lower Eastside is one more example of a '''Transnational Barrio'''.  The Nuyorican movement was seen as a venue for spoken word performances, stand-up comedy, poetry slams, musical performances and theater productions. The use of code switching between Spanish and English demonstrated the concern for the low income, poor experience of life in New York for Puerto Ricans, which strongly made visible the political motivation behind the poetry movement. ''Miguel Algarin, Miguel Pinero, Bittman “Bimbo” Rivas and Lucky Cienfuegos'' were among the creators and poets of the movement in the 1970s along with other poets such as ''Bob Holman, Saul Williams, Sarah Jones, and Beau Sia''. The transnational space created in the barrios of Manhattan’s Lower Eastside provide New York Puerto Ricans, or as they called themselves Nuyoricans, a chance to mobilize leftist ideals in their poetry, art performances and literature.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol'']. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W.

Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''.

She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913).

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907.

She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''.

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings.

* French architect and designer [[Charlotte Perriand]] (1903–1999) established a partnership with an icon of [[modern architecture]], [[Le Corbusier]], contributing to the development of functional living spaces, especially by designing interiors and furniture for his buildings. She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

*Also in Australia, [[Mary Turner Shaw]] (1906-1990) had found it difficult to complete her architecture studies at the University of Melbourne, and instead became an architect via articled studentship. She worked for various architectural firms in [[Australia]] (1931-1936) and the UK (1937), and traveled Europe meeting many key Modernist architects. After working for others again in Australia (1938), she formed an architectural firm, Romberg &amp; Shaw, with the Modernist architect [[Frederick Romberg]]. The firm operated from 1939 to 1942. During that period they produced "some of the most celebrated blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s in [[Australia]]",&lt;ref name="Willis (2012)"&gt;Willis, J. 2012 "Shaw, Mary Turner" in P.Goad and J.Willis "The Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture, Cambridge University Press, New York, p.624&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Yarrabee Flats]], [[South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]](1940) and the [[Newburn Flats]], [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]in 1939.

*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both buildings have since become national monuments.

==Progress since 2000==
Several women architects have had considerable success in recent years, gaining wide recognition for their achievements:

In 2004, the Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] became the first woman to be awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34337929 |title=Dame Zaha Hadid awarded the Riba Gold Medal for architecture - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= 2015-09-24|accessdate=2015-09-24|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her many projects, special mention was made of the [[Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Cincinnati]] and the [[BMW Central Building]] in Leipzig.

[[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Lord Palumbo]], the jury chairman, spoke of their architecture "that is simultaneously delicate and powerful, precise and fluid, ingenious but not overly or overtly clever; for the creation of buildings that successfully interact with their contexts and the activities they contain, creating a sense of fullness and experiential richness." Special consideration had been given to the Glass Center at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] in Ohio, and the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/announcement "Announcement: Architectural Partners in Japan Become the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

==Women's influence==

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H.

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''.

The '''Çineköy inscription''' is a [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[bilingual inscription|bilingual]] inscription, uncovered in 1997 in Çineköy, [[Adana Province]], Turkey (ancient [[Cilicia]]). The village of Çineköy lies 30&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Adana]].

The inscription is dated to the 8th century BC. It was originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Tekoglu, R. &amp; Lemaire, A. (2000). [http://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_2000_num_144_3_16174 La bilingue royale louvito-phénicienne de Çineköy]. ''Comptes rendus de l’Académie des inscriptions, et belleslettres, année 2000'', 960-1006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important inscription of the same type is known as the [[Karatepe inscription]], which was known earlier. Both of these inscriptions trace the kings of ancient [[Adana]] from the "house of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]" (given in Hieroglyphic Luwian as Moxos and in Phoenician as Mopsos in the form ''mps''). He was a legendary king of antiquity.

==Background==
The object on which the inscription is found is a monument to the Storm God [[Teshub|Tarhunza]].

The inscription was authored by the man known as Urikki in Assyrian texts, which is equivalent to Warika, or Awariku in Luwian. He was the [[vassal]] king of [[Quwê]] (Assyrian name), the modern [[Cilicia]]. In Luwian this region was known as 'Hiyawa'.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Bryce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k0dbRu1TOgUC&amp;pg=PA156 ''The World of The Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History.''] Oxford University Press, 2012 {{ISBN|0199218722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] overlords.

==Significance==
The Çineköy inscription was the subject of a 2006 paper published in the [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]], in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name "Syria" being derived from "Assyria" (see [[Syria#Etymology|Etymology of Syria]]).

The Luwian inscription reads "Sura/i" whereas the Phoenician translation reads ''’ŠR'' or "Ashur" which, according to Rollinger (2006), "settles the problem once and for all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Rollinger |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=The terms "Assyria" and "Syria" again |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf | doi = 10.1086/511103 |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]| volume = 65| issue = 4 |id= |pages=284–287 |page= |year=2006 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The text==
[[File:AdanaMuseumCineköy2.jpg|thumb|Part of Çineköy inscription in [[Adana Archaeology Museum]]]]
The examined section of the Luwian inscription reads:
::'''§VI''' ''And then, the/an Assyrian king (su+ra/i-wa/i-ni-sa(URBS)) and the whole Assyrian "House" (su+ra/i-wa/i-za-ha(URBS)) were made a fa[ther and a mo]ther for me,''&lt;br /&gt;'''§VII''' ''and Hiyawa and Assyria (su+ra/i-wa/i-ia-sa-ha(URBS)) were made a single “House.”''

The corresponding Phoenician inscription reads:
::''And the king [of Aššur and (?)]''
::''the whole “House” of Aššur (’ŠR) were for me a father [and a]''
::''mother, and the DNNYM and the Assyrians (’ŠRYM)''
::''were a single “House.”''

Also, in the inscription, Awariku claims to have built 15 fortresses in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Bryce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k0dbRu1TOgUC&amp;pg=PA156 ''The World of The Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History.''] Oxford University Press, 2012 {{ISBN|0199218722}}&lt;/ref&gt;
