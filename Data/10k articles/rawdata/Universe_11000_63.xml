      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">The '''1999 Southern Brazil blackout''' was a widespread [[power outage]] (the largest ever at the time) that occurred in [[Brazil]] on March 11, 1999. 

The blackout involved [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], affecting an estimated 75 to 97 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/main-body3.pdf |title=Does Liberalisation cause more electricity blackouts? |accessdate=2009-04-07 |author=Claire Craig-Nassar |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gkMHqK7g?url=http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/main-body3.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/11/11/general-blackouts-glance_7112363.html|title=Notable power outages around the world|accessdate=2009-11-24|author=Associated Press|archivedate=19 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119100404/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/11/11/general-blackouts-glance_7112363.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chain reaction was started when a lightning strike occurred at 22h 16m at an electricity substation in Bauru, São Paulo State causing most of the 440kV circuits at the substation to trip.  Brazil was undergoing a severe investment crisis during 1999, which limited spending on maintenance and expansion of the power grid.  With few routes for the power to flow from the generating stations via the 440kV system (a very important system to São Paulo state, carrying electricity generated by the [[Paraná River|Paraná river]]) a lot of generators automatically shut down because they did not have any load.  The world's biggest power plant at the time, [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]], tried to support the load that was no longer being supplied by the 440kV power plants, but the 750kV AC lines and the 600kV DC lines that connected the plant to the rest of the system could not take the load and tripped too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/296038.stm|title=Lightning knocked out Brazil power |accessdate=2009-04-07 | work=BBC News | date=1999-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
South of São Paulo the consumers experienced an overfrequency, caused because they had more generation than load, mostly because Itaipu was now connected only to this sub-system, but that problem was automatically solved by all generators in the area, that reduced their loads.
The rest of the system experienced a much bigger problem, an underfrequency, since the system had a lot of load and not enough generation capacity. Some generators tripped because of the overfrequency, which aggravated the problem, and after an automatic rejection of 35% of the sub-system load the underfrequency did not go away.  This caused the system to break in many pieces, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states were split with a few areas remaining online.  Most of the Minas Gerais system remained online, and powered Brazil's capital, [[Brasília]], as well as the state of Goias and some of [[Espírito Santo|Espirito Santo]].

In Rio, the [[Military Police (Brazil)|military police]] placed 1,200 men in the streets to avoid [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzil.com/pages/p07mar99.htm |title=The Darkest Night |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gkMIEQcB?url=http://www.brazzil.com/pages/p07mar99.htm |archivedate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In São Paulo, traffic authorities announced they closed the city's tunnels to prevent assaults. More than 60,000 people were on Rio's subway when lights went out.
At midnight, power began returning to some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/12/world/wide-power-failure-strikes-southern-brazil.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/B/Blackouts%20and%20Brownouts%20(Electrical)|title=Wide Power Failure Strikes Southern Brazil|accessdate=2009-04-07 | work=The New York Times | date=1999-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20090717 Windpark bei Sayda 1.png|thumb|Wind energy received a large increase from federal funding.]]
The '''2009 energy efficiency and renewable energy research investment''' was a part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and it increased federal funds in [[renewable energy]]. The package included $50 billion in spending and $20 billion in tax provisions.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt; The research within the [[investment]] also increased; as a result $8.8 billion went into [[renewable energy]] research. The investment also included a boost for "[[green building]]s".  Federal buildings received $4.5 billion in renovations; [[public housing]] was also granted $4 billion in renovations. An additional $250 million was made out to energy-efficient affordable housing, in part by installing insulation.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;  [[Environment America]], an organization of state-based, environmental advocacy organizations, reviewed the final bill and stated there was $32.80 billion in funding for [[clean energy]] projects, $26.86 billion for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] initiatives and $18.95 billion for [[green transport]]ation, totaling $78.61 billion just for "green" projects.&lt;ref name=tool&gt;{{cite news |last=Sterlicchi |first=John |url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1801486/obamas-stimulus-green-lights-green-spending |title= Obama's stimulus bill green lights green spending |publisher= Incisive Financial Publishing Limited |work= Business Green |date=February 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During his 2008 presidential campaign President [[Barack Obama]] stated to help and invest federal money into the green energy industry in the [[United States]].   President Obama stated that the plan would put 460,000&amp;nbsp;Americans to work on renewable energy projects and double the amount of renewable energy produced over the next three years.&lt;ref name=jat&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruggeri |first=Amanda |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/energy/articles/2009/03/06/what-the-stimulus-package-does-for-renewable-energy |title= What the Stimulus Package Does for Renewable Energy |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date= March 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan provided funds to 2 million homes by improving things such as insulation problems. The government pledged to use federal funds to improve the efficiency of 75 percent of federal buildings.

==New green job market==
President Obama made a plan that put 460,000&amp;nbsp;Americans to work on energy projects and doubled the amount of [[alternative energy]] produced over the next three years.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;  The number of green energy jobs increased.  In the short term, the plan would provide funds to improve 2 million homes by improving things such as [[Building insulation|insulation]] and leaky windows. The government also hired additional workers to improve the efficiency of 75 percent of federal buildings. $500 million was distributed as grants for training workers in their respected jobs markets.&lt;ref name=bust&gt;{{cite news |last=Elliot |first=Daniel |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/26/government-to-announce-bi_n_207843.html |title=Government Announces Money For Green Jobs, Training From Stimulus Package |work=Huffington Post |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate= May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That sum includes $50 million for communities battered by job losses and restructuring the auto industry after the financial crisis of 2008. The energy, education and labor departments also started a partnership to help link the unemployed with jobs, training and education opportunities together.&lt;ref name=bust/&gt;

==Capital requirements==
The United States government’s need to have the [[capital market]] back up their initiatives was studied by [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] [[economist]] [[Robert Pollin]] and was written in Nation magazine in February 2009.&lt;ref name=tool/&gt; Bank, as he research stated, would be required to devote a percentage of loan portfolios to green investments in the next decade, he wrote, while larger [[tax credits]] could be provided to homes and businesses for installation of [[solar energy]] and other renewable energy. Funds from a [[Cap and trade|cap-and-trade]] emissions program or a [[carbon tax]] could also be recycled back.&lt;ref name=tool/&gt;

==Improvements to renewable energy programs==
===Wind energy===
[[Wind farm]] developers had extended [[tax credit]]s for every [[kilowatt hour]] of electricity they produce. Until now, the credit expired every year and investors were hesitant to put money into projects that could lose their favored tax status in a matter of months.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;  The wind industry called for many of the swaps to the tax credits that the stimulus bill includes.  That credit was extended for up to three years.  The United States wind industry in 2008 installed about 42% of all the new electric generating space added that year and created 35,000 jobs, in construction and manufacturing.&lt;ref name=grizz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/02/renewable-energy-industry-reacts-to-stimulus-package |title=US Renewable Energy Industry Reacts to Stimulus Package Passage |publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate= May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The renewable energy measures in the stimulus bill proposed to aid and sustain green energy as well as encourage additional clean energy job creation.&lt;ref name=tool/&gt;

===Solar energy===

[[Solar energy]] developers were also included in the bill.  The bill backed proposed statements in the [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus package]] that would change the current system of tax credits for investing in the alternative energy project.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;

Since the [[recession]] has begun to effect the economy, many banks didn't have enough revenue and tax bills and weren't very interested in partnering to get tax credit.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt; So the money to invest in alternative energy decreased significantly.  In the stimulus package it shifted federal money directly to developers, in addition to keeping the original [[tax break]]s for the renewable energy programs in America.

==Green buildings==
Green building developers have to now get permits and rights-of-way to build lines across [[private property]].  The stimulus package doesn't address one big obstacle for green energy building, the cheap cost of burning [[coal]].  To make electricity renewable energy advocates are trying to persuade [[United States Congress|Congress]] to put a carbon price on carbon-heavy [[fossil fuel]]s that contribute to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=jat/&gt;

The '''Adams–Williamson equation''', named after L. H. Adams and [[Erskine Douglas Williamson|E. D. Williamson]], is an equation used to determine density as a function of radius, more commonly used to determine the relation between the velocities of [[seismic wave]]s and the [[density]] of the Earth's interior.&lt;ref&gt; [[C. M. R. Fowler]] (2005). The Solid Earth: An Introduction to Global Geophysics. Cambridge University Press. pp. 333–. {{ISBN|978-0-521-89307-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the average density of rocks at the Earth's surface and profiles of the [[P-wave]] and [[S-wave]] speeds as function of depth, it can predict how density increases with depth.&lt;ref&gt; Eugene F. Milone; William J.F. Wilson (30 January 2014). Solar System Astrophysics: Planetary Atmospheres and the Outer Solar System. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 494–. {{ISBN|978-1-4614-9090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It assumes that the compression is [[adiabatic]] and that the Earth is spherically symmetric, homogeneous, and in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. It can also be applied to spherical shells with that property. It is an important part of models of the Earth's interior such as the [[Preliminary reference Earth model]] (PREM).&lt;ref name=Poirier&gt;{{cite book  |last = Poirier  |first = Jean-Paul  |title = Introduction to the Physics of the Earth's Interior  |series = Cambridge Topics in Mineral Physics &amp; Chemistry  |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]  |date = 2000  |isbn = 0-521-66313-X  |ref=harvnb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last = Dziewonski  |first = A.

== History ==

Williamson and Adams first developed the theory in 1923. They concluded that "It is therefore impossible to explain the high density of the Earth on the basis of compression alone. The dense interior cannot consist of ordinary rocks compressed to a small volume; we must therefore fall back on the only reasonable alternative, namely, the presence of a heavier material, presumably some metal, which, to judge from its abundance in the Earth's crust, in meteorites and in the Sun, is probably iron."&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

== Theory ==

The two types of seismic body waves are compressional waves ([[P-waves]]) and shear waves ([[S-waves]]). Both have speeds that are determined by the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] properties of the medium they travel through, in particular the [[bulk modulus]]&amp;nbsp;''K'', the [[shear modulus]]&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and the [[density]]&amp;nbsp;''ρ''. In terms of these parameters, the P-wave speed ''v''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and the S-wave speed ''v''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
v_p &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{K+(4/3)\mu}{\rho}} \\
v_s &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These two speeds can be combined in a seismic parameter&lt;br /&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \Phi = v_p^2-\frac{4}{3}v_s^2 = \frac{K}{\rho}. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}&lt;br /&gt;
The definition of the bulk modulus,

:&lt;math&gt;K = -V\frac{dP}{dV},&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;K = \rho\frac{dP}{d\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Suppose a region at a distance ''r'' from the Earth's center can be considered a fluid in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], it is acted on by gravitational attraction from the part of the Earth that is below it and pressure from the part above it. Also suppose that the compression is [[adiabatic]] (so [[thermal expansion]] does not contribute to density variations). The [[pressure]] ''P''(''r'') varies with ''r'' as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho(r)g(r),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where ''g''(''r'') is the [[gravitational acceleration]] at radius&amp;nbsp;''r''.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

If Equations {{EquationNote|1}},{{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|3}} are combined, we get the Adams–Williamson equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\rho}{dr} = -\frac{\rho(r)g(r)}{\Phi(r)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be integrated to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \ln\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right) = -\int_{r_0}^r \frac{g(r)}{\Phi(r)}dr, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius at the Earth's surface and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the density at the surface. Given ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and profiles of the P- and S-wave speeds, the radial dependence of the density can be determined by numerical integration.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

[[Image:Alternation of generations simpler.svg|thumb|360px|Diagram showing the alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte (bottom) and a haploid gametophyte (top)]]
'''Alternation of generations''' (also known as '''metagenesis''') is the type of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] that occurs in those [[plant]]s and [[algae]] in the [[Archaeplastida]] and the [[Heterokontophyta]] that have distinct sexual haploid and asexual diploid stages.  In these groups, a multicellular [[gametophyte]], which is  [[haploid]] with ''n'' [[chromosome]]s, alternates with a multicellular [[sporophyte]], which is  [[diploid]] with 2''n'' chromosomes, made up of ''n'' pairs. A mature sporophyte produces [[spore]]s by [[meiosis]], a process which reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from 2''n'' to ''n''. 

The haploid spores germinate and grow into a haploid gametophyte. At maturity, the gametophyte produces [[gamete]]s by [[mitosis]], which does not alter the number of chromosomes. Two gametes (originating from different organisms of the same [[species]] or from the same organism) [[fertilisation|fuse]] to produce a [[zygote]], which develops into a diploid sporophyte.  This cycle, from gametophyte to gametophyte (or equally from sporophyte to sporophyte), is the way in which all land plants and many [[algae]] undergo [[sexual reproduction]].

The relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte varies among different groups of plants. In those [[alga]]e which have alternation of generations, the sporophyte and gametophyte are separate independent organisms, which may or may not have a similar appearance. In [[liverwort]]s, [[moss]]es and [[hornwort]]s, the sporophyte is less well developed than the gametophyte and is largely dependent on it. Although moss and hornwort sporophytes can photosynthesise, they require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and depend on it for supply of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Thomas1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glime2007/&gt; By contrast, in all modern [[vascular plants]] the gametophyte is less well developed than the sporophyte, although their Devonian ancestors had gametophytes and sporophytes of approximately equivalent complexity.&lt;ref name=Kerp/&gt; In [[fern]]s the gametophyte is a small flattened [[autotrophic]] [[prothallium|prothallus]] on which the young sporophyte is briefly dependent for its nutrition. In [[flowering plant]]s, the reduction of the gametophyte is much more extreme; it consists of just a few cells which grow entirely inside the sporophyte.

Animals develop differently. They &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; produce haploid gametes. No haploid spores capable of dividing are produced, so they do not have a haploid gametophyte alternating with a diploid sporophyte. (Some insects have a [[Arrhenotoky|sex-determining system]] whereby haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs; however the females are diploid.)

Life cycles of plants and algae with alternating haploid and diploid multicellular stages are referred to as '''diplohaplontic''' (the equivalent terms '''haplodiplontic''', '''diplobiontic''' or '''dibiontic''' are also in use). Life cycles, such as those of animals, in which there is only a diploid multicellular stage are referred to as '''diplontic'''. Life cycles in which there is only a haploid multicellular stage are referred to as '''haplontic'''.

==Definition==
Alternation of generations is defined as the alternation of multicellular diploid and haploid forms in the organism's life cycle, regardless of whether or not these forms are free-living.&lt;ref name="Taylor_2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|Kerp|Hass|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as the alga ''[[Ulva lactuca]]'', the diploid and haploid forms are indeed both free-living independent organisms, essentially identical in appearance and therefore said to be isomorphic. The free-swimming, haploid gametes form a diploid zygote which germinates into a multicellular diploid sporophyte.  The sporophyte produces free-swimming haploid spores by [[meiosis]] that germinate into haploid gametophytes.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|url= http://www.plantscience4u.com/2014/05/diplohaplontic-life-cycle-in-algae.html#.V3vOW6s7o3R |title=Plant Science 4 U |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some other groups, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte is very much reduced and is incapable of free living. For example, in all [[bryophytes]] the gametophyte generation is dominant and the sporophyte is dependent on it.  By contrast, in all modern [[vascular plants|vascular land plants]] the gametophytes  are strongly reduced, although the fossil evidence indicates that they were derived from isomorphic ancestors.&lt;ref name=Kerp/&gt; In [[seed plant]]s, the female gametophyte develops totally within the sporophyte which protects and nurtures it and the embryo sporophyte that it produces. The pollen grains, which are the male gametophytes, are reduced to only a few cells (just three cells in many cases). Here the notion of two generations is less obvious; as Bateman &amp; Dimichele say "[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single organism".&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 403"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative term 'alternation of phases' may then be more appropriate.&lt;ref name="Stewart_Rothwell_1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Debates about alternation of generations in the early twentieth century can be confusing because various ways of classifying "generations" co-exist (sexual vs. asexual, gametophyte vs. sporophyte, haploid vs. diploid, etc.).&lt;ref name=Haig08&gt;{{Citation |last1=Haig |first1=David |date=2008 |title=Homologous versus antithetic alternation of generations and the origin of sporophytes |journal=The Botanical Review |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=395–418 |doi=10.1007/s12229-008-9012-x |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11148775/Haig_HomologousVersus.pdf?sequence=3 |accessdate=2014-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Chamisso]] and [[Japetus Steenstrup|Steenstrup]] described the succession of differently organized generations (sexual and asexual) in animals as "alternation of generations", while studying the development of [[tunicate]]s, [[cnidarian]]s and [[trematode]] animals.&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt; This phenomenon is also known as [[heterogamy]]. Presently, the term "alternation of generations" is almost exclusively associated with the life cycles of plants, specifically with the alternation of haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes.&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated the morphological alternation of generations in plants,&lt;ref name=Sved27/&gt; between a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing generation (gametophyte).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hofmeister |first=W. |date=1851 |url=https://archive.org/details/vergleichendeun00hofmgoog |title=Vergleichende Untersuchungen der Keimung, Entfaltung und Fruchtbildildiung höherer Kryptogamen (Moose, Farne, Equisetaceen, Rhizocarpeen und Lycopodiaceen) und der Samenbildung der Coniferen |publication-place=Leipzig |publisher=F.

[[Eduard Strasburger]] (1874) discovered the alternation between diploid and haploid nuclear phases,&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt; also called cytological alternation of nuclear phases.&lt;ref name=Feld72&gt;{{Citation |last=Feldmann |first=J. |authorlink=Jean Feldmann |date=1972 |title=Les problèmes actuels de l'alternance de génerations chez les Algues |journal=Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France |volume=119 |pages=7–38 |doi=10.1080/00378941.1972.10839073 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00378941.1972.10839073 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most often coinciding, morphological alternation and nuclear phases alternation are sometimes independent of one another, e.g., in many [[red algae]], the same nuclear phase may correspond to two diverse morphological generations.&lt;ref name=Feld72/&gt; In some [[fern]]s which lost sexual reproduction, there is no change in nuclear phase, but the alternation of generations is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Schopfer, P. |author2=Mohr, H. | title = Plant physiology | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 1995 | pages = 288–291 | isbn = 3-540-58016-6 | chapter = Physiology of Development | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=jTxfMQg38B4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mohr%20physiology&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternation of generations in plants==

===Fundamental elements===
The diagram above shows the fundamental elements of the alternation of generations in plants. The many variations found in different groups of plants are described by use of these concepts later in the article. Starting from the right of the diagram, the processes involved are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, the material in the whole of this section is based on {{Harvnb|Foster|Gifford|1974}}, {{Harvnb|Sporne|1974a}} and {{Harvnb|Sporne|1974b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Two single-celled haploid gametes, each containing ''n'' unpaired chromosomes, fuse to form a single-celled diploid zygote, which now contains ''n'' pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2''n'' chromosomes in total.
* The single-celled diploid zygote germinates, dividing by the normal process ([[mitosis]]), which maintains the number of chromosomes at 2''n''. The result is a multi-cellular diploid organism, called the ''sporophyte'' (because at maturity it produces spores).
* When it reaches maturity, the sporophyte produces one or more '''sporangia''' (singular: sporangium) which are the organs that produce diploid spore mother cells (sporocytes). These divide by a special process ([[meiosis]]) that reduces the number of chromosomes by a half. This initially results in four single-celled haploid spores, each containing ''n'' unpaired chromosomes.
* The single-celled haploid spore germinates, dividing by the normal process (mitosis), which maintains the number of chromosomes at ''n''. The result is a multi-cellular haploid organism, called the ''gametophyte'' (because it produces gametes at maturity).
* When it reaches maturity, the gametophyte produces one or more '''gametangia''' (singular: gametangium) which are the organs that produce haploid gametes. At least one kind of gamete possesses some mechanism for reaching another gamete in order to fuse with it.
The 'alternation of generations' in the life cycle is thus between a diploid (2''n'') generation of sporophytes and a haploid (''n'') generation of gametophytes.
[[Image:Onoclea sensibilis 4 crop.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of the fern ''[[Onoclea sensibilis]]'' (the flat thallus at the bottom of the picture) with a descendant sporophyte beginning to grow from it (the small frond at the top of the picture).]]

The situation is quite different from that in animals, where the fundamental process is that a diploid (2''n'') individual &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; produces haploid (''n'') gametes by meiosis. Spores (i.e. haploid cells which are able to undergo mitosis) are not produced, so neither is an asexual multi-cellular generation that alternates with a sexual multi-cellular generation. (Some insects have haploid males that develop from unfertilized eggs, but the females are all diploid.)

===Variations===
The diagram shown above is a good representation of the life cycle of some multi-cellular algae (e.g. the genus ''[[Cladophora]]'') which have sporophytes and gametophytes of almost identical appearance and which do not have different kinds of spores or gametes.&lt;ref name="Guiry_Guiry_2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guiry|Guiry|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many possible variations on the fundamental elements of a life cycle which has alternation of generations. Each variation may occur separately or in combination, resulting in a bewildering variety of life cycles. The terms used by botanists in describing these life cycles can be equally bewildering. As Bateman and Dimichele say "[...] the alternation of generations has become a terminological morass; often, one term represents several concepts or one concept is represented by several terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible variations are:
* ''Relative importance of the sporophyte and the gametophyte.''
** ''Equal'' ('''homomorphy''' or '''isomorphy''').&lt;br/&gt;Filamentous algae of the genus ''[[Cladophora]]'', which are predominantly found in fresh water, have diploid sporophytes and haploid gametophytes which are externally indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Shyam_1980"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shyam|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; No living land plant has equally dominant sporophytes and gametophytes, although some theories of the evolution of alternation of generations suggest that ancestral land plants did.
** ''Unequal'' ('''heteromorphy''' or '''anisomorphy''').[[Image:Mnium hornum 2005.04.02 14.55.41.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of ''[[Mnium hornum]]'', a moss.]]
*** ''Dominant gametophyte'' ('''gametophytic''').&lt;br/&gt;In liverworts, mosses and hornworts, the dominant form is the haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte is not capable of an independent existence, gaining most of its nutrition from the parent gametophyte, and having no chlorophyll when mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Blechnum discolor - crown fern.jpg|thumb|Sporophyte of ''[[Blechnum discolor]]'', a fern.]]
*** ''Dominant sporophyte'' ('''sporophytic''').&lt;br/&gt;In ferns, both the sporophyte and the gametophyte are capable of living independently, but the dominant form is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid gametophyte is much smaller and simpler in structure. In seed plants, the gametophyte is even more reduced (at the minimum to only three cells), gaining all its nutrition from the sporophyte. The extreme reduction in the size of the gametophyte and its retention within the sporophyte means that when applied to seed plants the term 'alternation of generations' is somewhat misleading: "[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single organism".&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 403"/&gt; Some authors have preferred the term 'alternation of phases'.&lt;ref name="Stewart_Rothwell_1993"/&gt;
* ''Differentiation of the gametes.''
** ''Both gametes the same'' ('''isogamy''').&lt;br/&gt;Like other species of ''[[Cladophora]]'', ''C. callicoma'' has flagellated gametes which are identical in appearance and ability to move.&lt;ref name="Shyam_1980" /&gt;
** ''Gametes of two distinct sizes'' ('''anisogamy''').
*** ''Both of similar motility''.&lt;br/&gt;Species of ''[[sea lettuce|Ulva]]'', the sea lettuce, have gametes which all have two flagella and so are motile. However they are of two sizes: larger 'female' gametes and smaller 'male' gametes.&lt;ref name="Kirby_2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirby|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** ''One large and sessile, one small and motile'' ('''oogamy'''). The larger sessile megagametes are eggs (ova), and smaller motile microgametes are sperm (spermatozoa, spermatozoids). The degree of motility of the sperm may be very limited (as in the case of flowering plants) but all are able to move towards the sessile eggs. When (as is almost always the case) the sperm and eggs are produced in different kinds of gametangia, the sperm-producing ones are called '''antheridia''' (singular antheridium) and the egg-producing ones '''archegonia''' (singular archegonium).[[Image:Pellia epiphylla IMG 1610.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of ''[[Pellia epiphylla]]'' with sporophytes growing from the remains of archegonia.]]
**** ''Antheridia and archegonia occur on the same gametophyte,'' which is then called '''[[monoicous]]'''. (Many sources, including those concerned with bryophytes, use the term 'monoecious' for this situation and 'dioecious' for the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bell|Hemsley|2000|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here 'monoecious' and 'dioecious' are used only for sporophytes.)&lt;br/&gt;The liverwort ''Pellia epiphylla'' has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. It is monoicous: the small reddish sperm-producing antheridia are scattered along the midrib while the egg-producing archegonia grow nearer the tips of divisions of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|pp=425–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**** ''Antheridia and archegonia occur on different gametophytes,'' which are then called '''dioicous'''.&lt;br/&gt;The moss ''Mnium hornum'' has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. It is dioicous: male plants produce only antheridia in terminal rosettes, female plants produce only archegonia in the form of stalked capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|pp=287–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed plant gametophytes are also dioicous. However, the parent sporophyte may be monoecious, producing both male and female gametophytes or dioecious, producing gametophytes of one gender only. Seed plant gametophytes are extremely reduced in size; the archegonium consists only of a small number of cells, and the entire male gametophyte may be represented by only two cells.{{sfn|Sporne|1974a|pp=17–21}}
* ''Differentiation of the spores.''
** ''All spores the same size'' ('''homospory''' or isospory).&lt;br/&gt;Horsetails (species of ''[[Equisetum]]'') have spores which are all of the same size.&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 350–1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|pp=350–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Spores of two distinct sizes'' ('''heterospory''' or anisospory): larger '''megaspores''' and smaller '''microspores'''. When the two kinds of spore are produced in different kinds of sporangia, these are called '''megasporangia''' and '''microsporangia'''. A megaspore often (but not always) develops at the expense of the other three cells resulting from meiosis, which abort.
*** ''Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on the same sporophyte,'' which is then called '''monoecious'''.&lt;br/&gt;Most flowering plants fall into this category. Thus the flower of a lily contains six stamens (the microsporangia) which produce microspores which develop into pollen grains (the microgametophytes), and three fused carpels which produce integumented megasporangia (ovules) each of which produces a megaspore which develops inside the megasporangium to produce the megagametophyte. In other plants, such as hazel, some flowers have only stamens, others only carpels, but the same plant (i.e. sporophyte) has both kinds of flower and so is monoecious.[[Image:Hollyflowers.jpg|right|thumb|Flowers of European Holly, a dioecious species: male above, female below (leaves cut to show flowers more clearly)]]
*** ''Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on different sporophytes,'' which are then called '''dioecious'''.&lt;br/&gt;An individual tree of the European holly (''[[Ilex aquifolium]]'') produces either 'male' flowers which have only functional stamens (microsporangia) producing microspores which develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) or 'female' flowers which have only functional carpels producing integumented megasporangia (ovules) that contain a megaspore that develops into a multicellular megagametophyte.

There are some correlations between these variations, but they are just that, correlations, and not absolute. For example, in flowering plants, microspores ultimately produce microgametes (sperm) and megaspores ultimately produce megagametes (eggs). However, in ferns and their allies there are groups with undifferentiated spores but differentiated gametophytes. For example, the fern ''[[Ceratopteris]] thalictrioides'' has spores of only one kind, which vary continuously in size. Smaller spores tend to germinate into gametophytes which produce only sperm-producing antheridia.&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 350–1"/&gt;

===A complex life cycle===
[[Image:Alternation of generations complex.svg|500px|thumb|right|Graphic referred in text.]]
The diagram shows the alternation of generations in a species which is heteromorphic, sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic and dioecious. A seed plant example might be a [[willow]] tree (most species of the genus ''Salix'' are dioecious).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=1911 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=11th |publication-place=New York |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=XIX |contribution=Willows  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_28.djvu/708 |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the centre of the diagram, the processes involved are:
* An immobile egg, contained in the archegonium, fuses with a mobile sperm, released from an antheridium. The resulting zygote is either ''''male'''' or ''''female''''.
** A ''''male'''' zygote develops by mitosis into a microsporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more microsporangia. Microspores develop within the microsporangium by meiosis.&lt;br/&gt;In a willow (like all seed plants) the zygote first develops into an embryo microsporophyte within the ovule (a megasporangium enclosed in one or more protective layers of tissue known as integument). At maturity, these structures become the [[seed]]. Later the seed is shed, germinates and grows into a mature tree. A 'male' willow tree (a microsporophyte) produces flowers with only stamens, the anthers of which are the microsporangia.
** Microspores germinate producing microgametophytes; at maturity one or more antheridia are produced. Sperm develop within the antheridia.&lt;br/&gt;In a willow,  microspores are not liberated from the anther (the microsporangium), but develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) within it. The whole pollen grain is moved (e.g. by an insect or by the wind) to an ovule (megagametophyte), where a sperm is produced which moves down a pollen tube to reach the egg.
** A ''''female'''' zygote develops by mitosis into a megasporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more megasporangia. Megaspores develop within the megasporangium; typically one of the four spores produced by meiosis gains bulk at the expense of the remaining three, which disappear.&lt;br/&gt;'Female' willow trees (megasporophytes) produce flowers with only carpels (modified leaves that bear the megasporangia).
** Megaspores germinate producing megagametophytes; at maturity one or more archegonia are produced. Eggs develop within the archegonia.&lt;br/&gt; The carpels of a willow produce ovules, megasporangia enclosed in integuments. Within each ovule, a megaspore develops by mitosis into a megagametophyte. An archegonium develops within the megagametophyte and produces an egg. The whole of the gametophytic 'generation' remains within the protection of the sporophyte except for pollen grains (which have been reduced to just three cells contained within the microspore wall).{{clear}}

==Life cycles of different plant groups==
The term "plants" is taken here to mean the [[Archaeplastida]], i.e. the [[glaucophyte]]s, [[red algae|red]] and [[green algae]] and [[land plants]].

Alternation of generations occurs in almost all multicellular red and green algae, both freshwater forms (such as ''[[Cladophora]]'') and seaweeds (such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''). In most, the generations are homomorphic (isomorphic) and free-living. Some species of red algae have a complex triphasic alternation of generations, in which there is a gametophyte phase and two distinct sporophyte phases. For further information, see [[Red algae#Reproduction|Red algae: Reproduction]].

Land plants all have heteromorphic (anisomorphic) alternation of generations, in which the sporophyte and gametophyte are distinctly different. All [[bryophyte]]s, i.e. [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[moss]]es and [[hornwort]]s, have the gametophyte generation as the most conspicuous. As an illustration, consider a monoicous moss. Antheridia and archegonia develop on the mature plant (the gametophyte). In the presence of water, the biflagellate sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte grows up from the archegonium. Its body comprises a long stalk topped by a capsule within which spore-producing cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Most mosses rely on the wind to disperse these spores, although ''[[Splachnum sphaericum]]'' is [[entomophilous]], recruiting  insects to disperse its spores. For further information, see [[Marchantiophyta#Life cycle|Liverwort: Life cycle]], [[Moss#Life cycle|Moss: Life cycle]], [[Hornwort#Life cycle|Hornwort: Life cycle]].

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Liverwort life cycle.jpg|Diagram of alternation of generations in liverworts.
Image:Lifecycle moss svg diagram.svg|Moss life cycle diagram
Image:Hornwort life cicle svg diagram.svg|Hornwort life cycle diagram
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[fern]]s and their allies, including [[clubmoss]]es and [[horsetail]]s, the conspicuous plant observed in the field is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid spores develop in [[sorus|sori]] on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by the wind (or in some cases, by floating on water). If conditions are right, a spore will germinate and grow into a rather inconspicuous plant body called a [[prothallus]]. The haploid prothallus does not resemble the sporophyte, and as such ferns and their allies have a heteromorphic alternation of generations. The prothallus is short-lived, but carries out sexual reproduction, producing the diploid [[zygote]] that then grows out of the prothallus as the sporophyte. For further information, see [[Fern#Life cycle|Fern: Life cycle]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the [[spermatophyte]]s, the seed plants, the sporophyte is the dominant multicellular phase; the gametophytes are strongly reduced in size and very different in morphology. The entire gametophyte generation, with the sole exception of pollen grains (microgametophytes), is contained within the sporophyte. The life cycle of a dioecious flowering plant (angiosperm), the willow, has been outlined in some detail in an earlier section ([[#A complex life cycle|A complex life cycle]]). The life cycle of a [[gymnosperm]] is similar. However, flowering plants have in addition a phenomenon called '[[double fertilization]]'. Two sperm nuclei from a pollen grain (the microgametophyte), rather than a single sperm, enter the archegonium of the megagametophyte; one fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte to form '[[endosperm]]', which nourishes the developing embryo. For further information, see [[Double fertilization]].

==Evolutionary emergence of the dominant diploid phase==
It has been proposed that the basis for the emergence of the diploid phase of the life cycle (sporophyte) as the dominant phase (e.g. as in vascular plants) is that diploidy allows masking of the expression of deleterious mutations through [[Complementation (genetics)|genetic complementation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bernstein |first1=H. |last2=Byers |first2=G.S. |last3=Michod |first3=R.E. |year=1981 |title=Evolution of sexual reproduction: Importance of DNA repair, complementation, and variation |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=537–549 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/283734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Michod |first1=R.E. |last2=Gayley |first2=T.W. |year=1992 |title=Masking of mutations and the evolution of sex |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=706–734 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/285354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if one of the parental genomes in the diploid cells contained [[mutation]]s leading to defects in one or more [[gene product]]s, these deficiencies could be compensated for by the other parental genome (which nevertheless may have its own defects in other genes).  As the diploid phase was becoming predominant, the masking effect likely allowed [[genome size]], and hence information content, to increase without the constraint of having to improve accuracy of DNA replication.  The opportunity to increase information content at low cost was advantageous because it permitted new adaptations to be encoded. This view has been challenged, with evidence showing that selection is no more effective in the haploid than in the diploid phases of the lifecycle of mosses and angiosperms.&lt;ref name="SzövRiccHockShaw13"&gt;{{Citation |last=Szövényi |first=Péter |last2=Ricca |first2=Mariana |last3=Hock |first3=Zsófia |last4=Shaw |first4=Jonathan A. |last5=Shimizu |first5=Kentaro K. |last6=Wagner |first6=Andreas |year=2013 |title=Selection is no more efficient in haploid than in diploid life stages of an angiosperm and a moss |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1929 |doi=10.1093/molbev/mst095 |lastauthoramp=yes |pmid=23686659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar processes in other organisms==

=== Rhizaria ===
Some organisms currently classified in the clade [[Rhizaria]] and thus not plants in the sense used here, exhibit alternation of generations.  [[Foraminifera]] undergo a heteromorphic alternation of generations between haploid '''''gamont''''' and diploid '''''agamont''''' forms. The single-celled haploid organism is typically much larger than the diploid organism.

=== Fungi ===
Fungal [[mycelia]] are typically haploid. When mycelia of different mating types meet, they produce two [[multinucleate]] ball-shaped cells, which join via a "mating bridge". Nuclei move from one mycelium into the other, forming a '''''[[heterokaryon]]''''' (meaning "different nuclei"). This process is called '''''[[plasmogamy]]'''''. Actual fusion to form [[diploid]] nuclei is called '''''[[karyogamy]]''''', and may not occur until [[sporangia]] are formed. Karogamy produces a diploid zygote, which is a short-lived sporophyte that soon undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. When the spores germinate, they develop into new mycelia.

=== Slime moulds ===
The life cycle of [[slime mould]]s is very similar to that of fungi. Haploid spores germinate to form swarm cells or '''''myxamoebae'''''.  These fuse in a process referred to as ''plasmogamy'' and ''karyogamy'' to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into a plasmodium, and the mature plasmodium produces, depending on the species, one to many fruiting bodies containing haploid spores.

=== Animals ===
Alternation between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation is never encountered in animals.&lt;ref name=Barnes2001&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|Calow|Olive|Golding|2001|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some animals, there is an alternation between [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproductive]] phases ([[heterogamy]]).  Both phases are diploid. This has sometimes been called "alternation of generations",&lt;ref name=Scott1996&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is quite different. In some other animals, such as [[hymenoptera]]ns, males are haploid and females diploid, but this is always the case rather than there being an alternation between distinct generations.

The '''American Sign Museum''' in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], preserves, archives, and displays a collection of [[Signage|signs]]. The museum also displays the equipment utilized in the design and manufacture of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rothstein.

Travel, C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Swormstedt had been working at the journal for over twenty years before becoming inspired to start a sign museum in 1999.&lt;ref name=USA /&gt; His family provided $1 million for the project, and figures from the signage industry gave donations of their own. The museum was founded as a [[nonprofit corporation]].&lt;ref name=denver /&gt; Swormstedt considered building the museum in [[Los Angeles]], [[St. Louis]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and other sites, but eventually settled on Cincinnati, the base of operations for ''Signs of the Times''.&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt;

'''Arcing horns''' (sometimes '''arc-horns''') are projecting [[Conductor (material)|conductor]]s used to protect [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s or switch hardware on high voltage [[electric power transmission]] systems from damage during [[electric arc|flashover]].  Overvoltages on transmission lines, due to [[atmospheric electricity]], [[lightning]] strikes, or electrical faults, can cause [[electric arc|arcs]] across insulators (flashovers) that can damage them.  Alternately, atmospheric conditions or transients that occur during switching can cause an arc to form in the breaking path of a switch during its operation.  Arcing horns provide a path for flashover to occur that bypasses the surface of the protected device.&lt;ref name="Short"&gt;{{cite book|last=Short|first=Tom A.|title=Electric Power Distribution Handbook|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-8493-1791-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTmcEVsLy_cC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horns are normally paired on either side of an insulator, one connected to the high voltage part and the other to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]], or at the breaking point of a switch contact. They are frequently to be seen on [[insulator string]]s on overhead lines, or protecting [[transformer]] [[bushing (electrical)|bushings]].

The horns can take various forms, such as simple cylindrical rods, circular guard rings, or contoured curves, sometimes known as 'stirrups'.

== Background ==
[[High voltage]] equipment, particularly that which is installed outside, such as [[overhead power line]]s, is commonly subject to transient [[overvoltage]]s, which may be caused by phenomena such as [[lightning strike]]s, faults on other equipment, or [[switching surge]]s during circuit re-energisation.&lt;ref name="guile&amp;paterson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guile|first=A. E.|author2=Paterson, W.|title=Electrical Power Systems|publisher=Pergamon |date=1977|pages=131–132|isbn=0-08-021729-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overvoltage events such as these are unpredictable, and in general cannot be completely prevented. Line terminations, at which a transmission line connects to a [[busbar]] or transformer bushing, are at greatest risk to overvoltage due to the change in [[characteristic impedance]] at this point.&lt;ref name="PSP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Electricity Training Association| title=Power System Protection|publisher=IET|volume=2|pages=296&amp;ndash;297|isbn=978-0-85296-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electrical insulator serves to provide physical separation of conducting parts, and under normal operating conditions is continuously subject to a high [[electric field]] which occupies the air surrounding the equipment. Overvoltage events may cause the electric field to exceed the [[dielectric strength]] of air and result in the formation of an [[electric arc|arc]] between the conducting parts and over the surface of the insulator.&lt;ref name="Short"/&gt;  This is called flashover.   Contamination of the surface of the insulator reduces the breakdown strength and increases the tendency to flash over. On an electrical transmission system, [[protective relay]]s are expected to detect the formation of the arc and automatically open [[circuit breaker]]s to discharge the circuit and extinguish the arc. Under a worst case, this process may take as long as several seconds, during which time the insulator surface would be in close contact with the highly energetic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the arc. This is very damaging to an insulator, and may shatter brittle glass or ceramic disks, resulting in its complete failure.

== Operation ==
[[File:Trasformatore Tipo TSA (5).JPG|thumb|right|Arcing horns protecting bushings on a distribution transformer]]
Arcing horns form a [[spark gap]] across the insulator with a lower breakdown voltage than the air path along the insulator surface, so an overvoltage will cause the air to break down and the arc to form between the arcing horns, diverting it away from the surface of the insulator.&lt;ref name="PSP"/&gt; An arc between the horns is more tolerable for the equipment, providing more time for the fault to be detected and the arc to be safely cleared by remote circuit breakers. The geometry of some designs encourages the arc to migrate away from the insulator, driven by rising currents as it heats the surrounding air. As it does so, the path length increases, cooling the arc, reducing the electric field and causing the arc to extinguish itself when it can no longer span the gap. Other designs can utilise the [[magnetic field]] produced by the high current to drive the arc away from the insulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Looms|first=J.S.T.|title=Insulators for High Voltages|publisher=IET|date=1988|isbn=978-0-86341-116-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wn2LZLYt2DIC&amp;pg=PA107|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of arrangement can be known as a [[magnetic blowout]].

Design criteria and maintenance regimes may treat arcing horns as sacrificial equipment, cheaper and more easily replaced than the insulator, failure of which can result in complete destruction of the equipment it insulates. Failure of insulator strings on overhead lines could result in the parting of the line, with significant safety and cost implications.

Arcing horns thus play a role in the process of correlating system protection with protective device characteristics, known as [[insulation coordination]]. The horns should provide, amongst other characteristics, near-infinite [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] during normal operating conditions to minimise conductive current losses, low impedance during the flashover, and physical resilience to the high temperature of the arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=J.D.|author2=Sarma, M.|title=Power System Analysis and Design|publisher=PWS-KENT|date=1987|isbn=0-534-07860-5|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As operating voltages increase, greater consideration must be given to such design principles. At medium voltages, one of the two horns may be omitted as the horn-to-horn gap can otherwise be small enough to be bridged by an alighting bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCombe |first=John |author2=Haigh, F.R.|title=Overhead Line Practice | edition = 3rd | publisher=Macdonald | date=1966 | page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, duplex gaps consisting of two sections on opposite sides of the insulator can be fitted.&lt;ref name="PSP"/&gt; Low voltage distribution systems, in which the risk of arcing is much lower, may not use arcing horns at all.

The presence of the arcing horns necessarily disturbs the normal electric field distribution across the insulator due to their small but significant [[capacitance]]. More importantly, a flashover across arcing horns produces an earth fault resulting in a [[Downtime|circuit outage]] until the fault is cleared by circuit breaker operation. For this reason, [[Varistor|non-linear resistors]] known as [[varistor]]s can replace arcing horns at critical locations.&lt;ref name="PSP"/&gt;

== Switch protection ==
Arcing horns are sometimes installed on  air-insulated [[switchgear]] and transformers to protect the switch arm from arc damage. When a high voltage switch breaks a circuit, an arc can establish itself between the switch contacts before the [[electric current|current]] can be interrupted. The horns are designed to endure the arc rather than the contact surfaces of the switch itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hordeski|first=Michael F.|author2=Pansini, Anthony J. |title=Electrical Distribution Engineering|publisher=Fairmont Press|date=2007|isbn=978-0-88173-546-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3DRIiujJCUC&amp;pg=PA395|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pansini|first=Anthony J.|title=Electrical Transformers and Power Equipment|publisher=Fairmont Press|date=1998|isbn=978-0-88173-311-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f77zWwA3oS4C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corona and grading rings==
Arcing horns are not to be confused with [[corona ring]]s (or the similar grading rings) which are ring-shaped assemblies surrounding connectors, or other irregular hardware pieces on high potential equipment.  Corona rings and grading rings are intended to equalize and redistribute accumulated potential away from components that might be subject to local accumulation and destructive discharges, although sometimes either device may be installed in close proximity to an arcing horn assembly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">{{About|the property of two-dimensional objects|computer storage comparisons|Areal density (computer storage)|other uses|Density (disambiguation)}}

The '''areal density''' (also known as '''area density''', '''surface density''', '''superficial density''', or '''density thickness''') of a two-dimensional object is calculated as the [[mass]] per unit [[area]]. The [[SI]] derived unit is: [[kilogram]] per square metre (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In the paper and fabric industries, it is called [[grammage]] and is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm); for paper in particular, it may be expressed as pounds per [[paper ream|ream]] of standard sizes ("basis ream").

== Formulation ==
It can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \frac {m} {A} &lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \rho \cdot l&lt;/math&gt;

where,
:{|
|-
|''{{math|ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}'' || = average area density
|-
|''{{math|m}}''             || = total mass of the object
|-
|''{{math|A}}''             || = total area of the object
|-
|''{{math|ρ}}''             || = average [[density]]
|-
|''{{math|l}}''             || = average thickness of the object
|}

== Column density ==
A special type of area density is called '''column (mass) density''' (also '''columnar mass density'''), denoted ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or ''σ''. It is the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along a path;&lt;ref name="Boeker_vanGrondelle2000"&gt;
{{cite book
 |author1=Egbert Boeker |author2=Rienk van Grondelle | title=Environmental Physics 
 | edition=2nd
 | year=2000
 | publisher=Wiley
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained integrating [[density|volumetric density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; over a column:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Visconti | first1 = Guido | title = Fundamentals of physics and chemistry of the atmosphere | year = 2001 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin  | isbn = 978-3-540-67420-7 | pages = 470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\int \rho \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

In general the integration path can be slant or oblique incidence (as in, for example, [[line of sight propagation]] in [[atmospheric physics]]). A common special case is a vertical path, from the bottom to the top of the medium:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth).

Columnar density &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the vertically averaged volumetric density &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho} = \frac{\rho_A}{\Delta z},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta z = \int 1 \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;; notice that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; have units of, for example, grams per cubic metre, grams per square metre, and metres, respectively.

=== Column number density ===
'''Column number density''' refers instead to a [[number density]] type of quantity: the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==

===Atmospheric physics===
It is a quantity commonly retrieved by [[remote sensing]] instruments, for instance the [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS) which retrieves ozone columns around the globe.  Columns are also returned by the [[differential absorption spectroscopy|differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)]] method&lt;ref name="Sinreich_etal2008"&gt;

A closely related concept is that of ice or [[liquid water path]], which specifies the volume per unit area or depth instead of mass per unit area, thus the two are related:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\sigma}{\rho_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

Another closely related concept is [[optical depth]].

===Astronomy===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}

In Astronomy the column density is generally used to indicate the number of atoms or molecules per square cm (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) along the line of sight in a particular direction, as derived from observations of e.g. the 21-cm [[hydrogen line]] or from observations of a certain molecular species. Also the [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] can be related to the column density of H or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Column+Density&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of area density can be useful when analysing [[accretion disk]]s. In the case of a disk seen face-on, area density for a given area of the disk is defined as column density: that is, either as the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along the vertical path that goes through the disk [[Sightline|(line-of-sight)]], from the bottom to the top of the medium:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth), or as the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path (column number density):

:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

===Data storage media===
{{Main article|Areal density (computer storage)}}
Areal density is used to quantify and compare different types media used in data storage devices such as [[hard disk drives]], [[optical disc|optical disc drives]] and [[tape drives]].  The current unit of measure is typically gigabits per square inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/areal_density.html |title=Areal Density |publisher=Webopedia |accessdate= April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
{{main|grammage}}
The area density is often used to describe the thickness of paper; e.g., 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is very common.

===Fabric===
{{main|grammage}}
Fabric "weight" is often specified as mass per unit area, grams per square meter (gsm) or [[ounce]]s per square yard. It is also sometimes specified in ounces per yard in a standard width for the particular cloth. One gram per square meter equals 0.0295 ounces per square yard; one ounce per square yard equals 33.9 grams per square meter.

===Other===

It is also an important quantity for the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of radiation]]. 

When studying bodies falling through air, area density is important because resistance depends on area, and gravitational force is dependent on mass.

[[Bone density]] is often expressed in grams per square centimeter (g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) as measured by x-ray absorptiometry, as a proxy for the actual density.

The [[body mass index]] is expressed in units of kilograms per square meter, though the area figure is nominal, being simply the square of the height.

The [[total electron content]] in the ionosphere is a quantity of type columnar number density.

[[Snow water equivalent]] is a quantity of type columnar mass density.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5713">[[File:Electricity Grid Schematic English.svg|thumb|right|An electrical grid may have many types of generators and loads; generators must be controlled to maintain stable operation of the system.]]
In an [[Electrical grid|electric power system]], '''automatic generation control (AGC)''' is a system for adjusting the power output of multiple generators at different [[Power station|power plants]], in response to changes in the load. Since a power grid requires that generation and load closely balance moment by moment, frequent adjustments to the output of generators are necessary. The balance can be judged by measuring the [[Utility frequency|system frequency]]; if it is increasing, more power is being generated than used, which causes all the machines in the system to accelerate.  If the system frequency is decreasing, more load is on the system than the instantaneous generation can provide, which causes all generators to slow down.

== History ==
Before the use of automatic generation control, one generating unit in a system would be designated as the regulating unit and would be manually adjusted to control the balance between generation and load to maintain system frequency at the desired value. The remaining units would be controlled with [[droop speed control|speed droop]] to share the load in proportion to their ratings. With automatic systems, many units in a system can participate in regulation, reducing wear on a single unit's controls and improving overall system efficiency, stability, and economy.

Where the grid has tie interconnections to adjacent control areas, automatic generation control helps maintain the power interchanges over the tie lines at the scheduled levels. With computer-based control systems and multiple inputs, an automatic generation control system can take into account such matters as the most economical units to adjust, the coordination of thermal, hydroelectric, and other generation types, and even constraints related to the stability of the system and capacity of interconnections to other power grids.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Herschel Miller, James H. Malinowski, ''Power system operation'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994 {{ISBN|0-07-041977-9}},  page 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Turbine-governor control (TGC) ===

Turbine generators in a power system have stored kinetic energy due to their large rotating masses. All the kinetic energy stored in a power system in such rotating masses is a part of the grid inertia. When system load increases, grid inertia is initially used to supply the load. This, however, leads to a decrease in the stored kinetic energy of the turbine generators. Since the mechanical power of these turbines correlates with the delivered electrical power, the turbine generators have a decrease in angular velocity, which is directly proportional to a decrease in frequency in synchronous generators. 
[[File:Steady state frequency-power relation for a turbine governor.png|thumb|Steady state frequency-power relation for a turbine governor]]
The purpose of the turbine-governor control is to maintain the desired system frequency by adjusting the mechanical power output of the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Duncan J. et al. Power System Analysis and Design. 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. 2012. pp. 657-658.&lt;/ref&gt; These controllers have become automated and at steady state, the frequency-power relation for turbine-governor control is,

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_m = \Delta p_{ref} - 1/R\times\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_m&lt;/math&gt; is the change in turbine mechanical power output

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_{ref}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in a reference power setting

&lt;math&gt;R = -\Delta f/\Delta p_m = -slope&lt;/math&gt; is the regulation constant which quantifies the sensitivity of the generator to a change in frequency

&lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is the change in frequency.

For steam turbines, [[steam turbine governing]] adjusts the mechanical output of the turbine by increasing or decreasing the amount of steam entering the turbine via a throttle valve.

=== Load-frequency control (LFC) ===

[[Utility frequency#Load-frequency control|Load-frequency control]] is employed to allow an area to first meet its own load demands, then to assist in returning the steady-state frequency of the system, Δf, to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Duncan J. et al. Power System Analysis and Design. 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. 2012. pp. 663.&lt;/ref&gt; Load-frequency control operates with a response time of a few seconds to keep system frequency stable.

=== Economic dispatch ===

The goal of [[economic dispatch]] is to minimize total operating costs in an area by determining how the real power output of each generating unit will meet a given load.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Duncan J. et al. Power System Analysis and Design. 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. 2012. pp. 667.&lt;/ref&gt; Generating units have different costs to produce a unit of electrical energy, and incur different costs for the losses in transmitting energy to the load. An economic dispatch algorithm will run every few minutes to select the combination of generating unit power setpoints that minimizes overall cost, subject to the constraints of transmission limitation or security of the system against failures.&lt;ref name=Dorf06&gt;Richard C. Dorf (ed.), Section 9.3 "Automatic Generation Control" in ''Electrical Engineering Handbook''  Taylor and Francis, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8493-2274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further constraints may be imposed by the water supply of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generation, or by the availability of sun and wind power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9563">'''Beyond-armour effect''' is a term coined by [[Försvarets Fabriksverk]] (FFV),&lt;ref&gt;FFV is now part of [[Saab Bofors Dynamics]]&lt;/ref&gt; a semi-governmental Swedish defense firm, while developing the [[AT4]].  From the 1980s this phrase was used in its brochures, press releases, weapon instruction manuals and other documentation to denote the ''post-penetration effect'' of the AT4's [[HEAT]] anti-armour warhead against the interior and occupants of armoured vehicles.

The phrase now has become more or less standard in modern military terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish, Mark "FFV's Lightweight AT4, first of a new family of Swedish anti-armour weapons", International Defense Review, 5/1982, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with ''Behind-the-armor effect'' or ''After-armour effect'' which is a term sometimes used to describe the effects of armour piercing shells fired by tanks, antitank cannons and naval warships that have a small high explosive charge in the rear of the projectile that explodes after penetrating the armour plating&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During [[World War II]], man-portable antitank weapons using [[Anti-tank warfare#Shaped charge weapons|shaped charge warheads]], more commonly known today as [[HEAT]] projectiles, came into widespread use with almost all armies. These warheads have the advantage of not being affected by the projectile's velocity. They penetrate armour by the detonation of an explosive charge fitted in a liner in the shape of a cone or, more precisely, an [[ogive]]. The liner is often made of a soft metal, such as copper. Detonation of this shaped charge  turns it into a highly focused stream moving forward at extreme speeds. Like medium and high velocity solid shot armour piercing projectiles, these warheads also cause [[spall]]ing on the interior of the vehicle's armour plate.&lt;ref&gt;(solid shot AP projectiles also strike other items inside the vehicle and transfer very large amounts of kinetic energy to the object(s) struck&lt;/ref&gt;)

A problem with shaped charge warheads is that if the ogive shaped liner is deep, the warhead will have more penetration but will form a smaller hole; smaller holes are associated with less damage inside the armoured vehicle than larger ones.  Research on shaped charge warheads has shown a hole that is the size of a large coin on the outside of a tank turret will have the diameter of a pencil lead on the turret's inner face.  If, on the other hand, the ogive is shallow, it will have less penetration, but cause a larger hole on the inside which will result in a massive spalling.&lt;ref&gt;A rule of thumb for infantry antitank weapons is that if a HEAT warhead has to use more than two-thirds of its official penetration capability, it will have less effect on the interior of the vehicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|siege of Dien Bien Phu]], France had dismantled and flown in a number of [[M-24 Chaffee]] light tanks. Their thickest armor was only 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm.  The [[Viet Minh|Viet Minh's]] main infantry antitank weapon was the old World War Two U.S. 2.36-inch [[bazooka]], captured from [[Nationalist Chinese]] forces and supplied by [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. During the siege the French launched counterattacks using the M-24 in support of their infantry. One Chaffee took seven hits from 2.36-inch bazookas and still continued to fight, demonstrating that portable rocket launchers were hardly a flawless tank-killer.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, "Dien Bien Phu", page 110, Ballantine Books, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples became evident during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[North Vietnamese]] and their [[Viet Cong|allied forces in South Vietnam]] were equipped with two types of light anti-armour weapons.  One was the 1950s era [[RPG-2|B-40]], which was a Chinese manufactured version of the Russian RPG-2, and the other was the newer [[RPG-7]]. The RPG-2 had a shallow cone and the RPG-7 a deep cone. The B-40 had a maximum penetration against armour of approximately 150&amp;nbsp;mm while the RPG-7 penetration was more than double that of the B-40. But to the surprise of the North Vietnamese, the B-40, while not effective against heavy tanks, was far more effective than the RPG-7 in killing or wounding the occupants of light armoured vehicles, and in igniting the ammunition storage or the vehicle's fuel, including the more modern [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113 APC]] which U.S. and South Vietnamese forces at that time operated in large numbers. In addition, the B-40 proved more effective than the RPG-7 against non-armoured targets, like the bunkers at fire base camps. There are many stories from U.S. Vietnam veterans of the enemy attacking or ambushing very effectively with the B-40.&lt;ref&gt;John Weeks "Small Arms Profiles #21 - Recoilless Anti-Tank Weapons", Profile Publications, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army also discovered that in combat, with rare exceptions, more than one hit by the [[M72 LAW]] rocket was required to disable or kill the North Vietnamese [[PT-76]] light tank.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Phillips, Night of the Silver Stars, pg 80, Naval Institute Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The combat record of light anti-armour weapons was studied by the engineers at FFV working on a replacement for the [[Miniman antitank weapon|Pansarskott m/68]] in the late 1970s. The result was the AT4 with a HEAT warhead that had, as the early AT4 brochures stated, a "special beyond-armour effect".  The designers of the AT4's warhead intended that one hit would cause massive damage to both the occupants and the interior of the targeted vehicle.  FFV has said very little about the design of the AT4's warhead, being willing only to describe its effects.  Defense journalists and military experts have speculated on the warhead's design.  A cutaway photo of the AT4's projectile gave clues.  Instead of the standard cone shape liner used by other HEAT warheads, the AT4 has a unique trumpet-shaped liner.&lt;ref&gt;Trumpet liners for HEAT warheads were first developed by the Swiss for their U.S. made [[M47 Dragon]] wire guided antitank missiles&lt;/ref&gt; Trumpet-shaped liners are believed to be more effective in resisting the counter-blast of [[reactive armour]] tiles, that explode and disrupt the HEAT warhead's particle stream.  There has been speculation that the liner in the AT4's HEAT warhead is constructed of a special aluminum alloy.  Others have stated it is primarily a copper liner with a secondary liner of aluminum bonded to the back of the copper liner. Another clue to the effectiveness of the AT4 is the presence of a "focus ring" to concentrate the blast.  All public statements to 1984 on the subject are speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Staff editors, "Tank Killers", SOF's Combat Weapons, page 46, Fall/1985&lt;/ref&gt; Tests conducted by the U.S. Army on the AT4 confirmed that the claims made by FFV regarding the AT4's devastating post-penetration effect were substantially correct.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==Description==

As described by FFV in their first AT4 brochure in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;FFV Ordnance, Brochure FFV A 1204-1911 E&lt;/ref&gt; the ''beyond-armour effect''  had five distinctive characteristics upon penetration of an armoured vehicle:

* A massive overpressure inside the vehicle of approximately [[Bar (unit)|11 bar]] over normal.
* Secondary fragments from the warhead itself due to the large entry hole, plus more extensive spalling than caused by HEAT warheads of similar diameter.
* An intense light that is 100 times brighter than sunlight.
* Generation of dense smoke in the armoured vehicle's interior.
* Generation of extensive heat inside the armoured vehicle.

FFV claims that besides the effect of the massive spalling and fragmentation on the occupants of the armoured vehicle, which is standard for all HEAT warheads to a degree, the massive overpressure and intense heat will ignite ammunition and more importantly the armoured vehicle's diesel fuel&lt;ref&gt;Diesel fuel has a very high flash point and is hard to ignite by a HEAT warhead. In some armoured vehicles, the diesel fuel cells are used as additional protection behind the main armour plating; for example, the Israeli [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The intense light effect will blind any occupants for at least seven minutes, adding to the obscuring effect of the dense smoke created by the AT4's HEAT warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish  Mark, "FFV's Lightweight AT4, first of a new family of Swedish anti-armour weapons", International Defense Review, 5/1982, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6044">'''Bismuth germanium oxide''' or '''bismuth germanate''' is an inorganic chemical compound of [[bismuth]], [[germanium]] and [[oxygen]]. Most commonly the term refers to the compound with chemical formula {{Bismuth}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{{Germanium}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; ('''BGO'''), with the [[cubic crystal|cubic]] [[evlitine]] [[crystal structure]], used as a [[scintillator]].  (The term may also refer to a different compound with formula Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, an electro-optical material with [[sillenite]] structure, and {{Bismuth}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{Germanium}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.)

==Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;==
When irradiated by [[x-rays]] or [[gamma ray]]s, bismuth germanate emits [[photon]]s of [[wavelength]]s between 375-650&amp;nbsp;nm, with peak at 480&amp;nbsp;nm. It produces about 8500 photons per [[megaelectronvolt]] of the high energy radiation absorbed. It has good [[nuclear hardness|radiation hardness]] (parameters remaining stable up to 5.10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; [[gray (unit)|Gy]]), high scintillation efficiency, good energy resolution between 5-20 MeV, is mechanically strong, and is not [[hygroscopic]]. It has very high density, 7.13 g/cm³ and a high Z value. Its melting point is 1050&amp;nbsp;°C. It is the most common oxide-based scintillator.

Bismuth germanium oxide is used in detectors in [[particle physics]], [[aerospace]] physics, [[nuclear medicine]], geology exploration, and other industries. Bismuth germanate arrays are used for gamma pulse spectroscopy. BGO crystals are also used in [[positron emission tomography]] detectors.

Commercially available crystals are grown by the [[Czochralski process]] and usually supplied in the form of [[cuboid]]s or cylinders. Large crystals can be obtained.

==Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;==
Bismuth germanate has high [[electro-optic coefficient]]s (3.3 pm/V for Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;

The crystals of BGO and similar compounds BSO (Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, [[bismuth silicon oxide]], [[sillenite]]) and BTO (Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;), are [[photorefractive]] and [[photoconductive]]. BGO and BSO crystals are efficient photoconductors with low [[Dark current (physics)|dark conductivity]]. They can be used in [[electro-optical]] applications, like optical [[programmable read-only memory|PROM]], PRIZ [[spatial light modulator]]s, realtime [[hologram]] recording, correlators, and systems for adaptive correction of ultrashort laser pulses, and in [[fiber optic sensor]]s for electric and magnetic fields. [[Waveguide]] structures allow uniform illumination over wide spectral range. [[Thin film]] sillenite structures, which can be deposited e.g. by [[sputtering]], have wide range of potential applications. BSO crystals are used in optically addressed [[spatial light modulator]]s and in liquid crystal [[light valve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.alkor.net/photorefractive_crystal_BGO.html|title = Sillenite Photorefractive Crystals (BGO and BSO) - Alkor Technologies|website = www.alkor.net|access-date = 2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optical activity of BTO is much smaller than of BGO and BSO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad5G1HWtDRgC|title = Springer Handbook of Lasers and Optics|last = Träger|first = Frank|date = 2012-05-05|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn = 9783642194092|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike somewhat similar performing [[perovskite]]s, sillenites aren't [[ferroelectric]].

The materials can find use in [[phased-array optics]].

When sputtering, the target has to be kept below 450&amp;nbsp;°C as otherwise the bismuth vapor pressure would get the composition out of [[stoichiometry]], but above 400&amp;nbsp;°C to form the piezoelectric γ phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pmpV4RYHpdcC|title = Thin Film Materials Technology: Sputtering of Compound Materials|last = Wasa|first = Kiyotaka|last2 = Kitabatake|first2 = Makoto|last3 = Adachi|first3 = Hideaki|date = 2004-05-10|publisher = William Andrew|isbn = 9780815519317|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21602">The '''bond-dissociation energy'''  ('''BDE''', '''''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''', or '''''DH°''''')  is one measure of the [[bond strength|strength]] of a [[chemical bond]] A–B.  It can be defined as the [[enthalpy|standard enthalpy change]] when A–B is cleaved by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]] to give fragments A and B, which are usually radical species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Bond-dissociation energy |file=B00699 |access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The value reported as the bond-dissociation energy (BDE) is generally the enthalpy of the homolytic dissociation of a ''gas-phase species''.  For instance, the BDE of diiodine is calculated as twice the heat of formation of iodine radical (25.5 kcal/mol) minus the heat of formation of diiodine gas (14.9 kcal/mol).  This gives the accepted BDE of diiodine of 36.1 kcal/mol.  (By definition, diiodine in the solid state has a heat of formation of 0.)&lt;/ref&gt; The enthalpy change is temperature dependent, and the bond-dissociation energy is often defined to be the enthalpy change of the homolysis at 0&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] ([[absolute zero]]), although the enthalpy change at 298 K ([[standard conditions]]) is also a frequently encountered parameter.&lt;ref&gt;The IUPAC Gold Book does not stipulate a temperature for its definition of bond-dissociation energy (ref. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a typical example, the bond-dissociation energy for one of the C–H bonds in [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the process

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–H → [[ethyl group|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;]] + H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,
:''DH''°&lt;sub&gt;298&lt;/sub&gt; (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–H) = Δ''H°'' = 101.1(4)&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol = 423.0&amp;nbsp;± 1.7 [[Joule per mole|kJ/mol]] = 4.40(2)&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] (per bond).&lt;ref&gt;The corresponding BDE at 0 K (''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is 99.5(5) kcal/mol.&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert a molar BDE to the energy needed to dissociate the bond ''per molecule'', the conversion factor 23.060 kcal/mol (96.485 kJ/mol) for each eV can be used.

A variety of experimental techniques, including spectrometric determination of energy levels, generation of radicals by pyrolysis or photolysis, measurements of chemical kinetics and equilibrium, and various calorimetric and electrochemical methods have been used to measure bond dissociation energy values.  Nevertheless, bond dissociation energy measurements are challenging and are subject to considerable error.  The majority of currently known values are accurate to within ± 1 or 2 kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comprehensive handbook of chemical bond energies|last=Luo|first=Y. R.|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-7366-4|location=Boca Raton|pages=|oclc=76961295|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, values measured in the past, especially before the 1970s, can be especially unreliable and have been subject to revisions on the order of 10 kcal/mol (e.g., benzene C-H bonds, from 103 kcal/mol in 1965 to the modern accepted value of 112.9(5) kcal/mol).  Even in modern times (between 1990 and 2004), the O-H bond of phenol has been reported to be anywhere from 85.8 to 91.0 kcal/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mulder P, Korth HG, Pratt DA, DiLabio GA, Valgimigli L, Pedulli GF, Ingold KU | title = Critical re-evaluation of the O-H bond dissociation enthalpy in phenol | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A | volume = 109 | issue = 11 | pages = 2647–55 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 16833571 | doi = 10.1021/jp047148f }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the bond dissociation energy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 298 K has been measured to high precision and accuracy: ''DH''°&lt;sub&gt;298&lt;/sub&gt; (H–H) = 104.1539(1) kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Definitions and related parameters==
The term ''bond-dissociation energy'' is similar to the related notion of ''bond-dissociation enthalpy'' (or ''bond enthalpy''), which is sometimes used interchangeably.  However, some authors make the distinction that the bond-dissociation energy (''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) refers to the enthalpy change at 0 K, while the term bond-dissociation enthalpy is used for the enthalpy change at 298&amp;nbsp;K (unambiguously denoted ''DH''°&lt;sub&gt;298&lt;/sub&gt;).  The former parameter tends to be favored in theoretical and computational work, while the latter is more convenient for thermochemical studies.  For typical chemical systems, the numerical difference between the quantities is small and the distinction can often be ignored. For a hydrocarbon RH where R is significantly larger than H, for instance, the relationship ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(R–H) ≈ ''DH''°&lt;sub&gt;298&lt;/sub&gt;(R–H) – 1.5 kcal/mol is a good approximation.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanksby SJ, Ellison GB | title = Bond dissociation energies of organic molecules | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–63 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12693923 | doi = 10.1021/ar020230d | citeseerx = 10.1.1.616.3043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some textbooks ignore the temperature dependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | title=Modern physical organic chemistry | first1 = Eric V | last1 = Anslyn | first2 = Dennis A | last2 = Dougherty | name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=University Science |isbn=978-1-891389-31-3|location=Sausalito, CA|oclc=55600610}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have defined the bond-dissociation energy to be the reaction enthalpy of homolysis at 298&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name="Darwent1970"&gt;{{cite book | last = Darwent | first = B. deB. | name-list-format = vanc | date = January 1970 | title = Bond Dissociation Energies in Simple Molecules | place = Washington, DC | publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|U.S. National Bureau of Standards]] | series = NSRDS-NBS 31 | lccn = 70602101 | url = http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/NSRDS/nbsnsrds31.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Organic Chemistry |last=Streitwieser |first=Andrew |last2=Heathcock |first2=Clayton H. |last3=Kosower |first3=Edward M. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Medtech (Scientific International, reprint of 4th revised edition, 1998, Macmillan) |year=2017 |isbn=9789385998898 |location=New Delhi |pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Perspectives on structure and mechanism in organic chemistry | first = Felix A | last = Carroll | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-27610-5|edition= 2nd|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=286483846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bond dissociation energy is related to but slightly different from the depth of the associated potential energy well of the bond, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the ''electronic energy''. This is due to the existence of a [[zero-point energy]] ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the vibrational ground state, which reduces the amount of energy needed to reach the dissociation limit.  Thus, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is slightly less than ''D''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, and the relationship ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; –  ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; holds.&lt;ref name="BDE" /&gt;

The bond dissociation energy is an enthalpy change of a particular chemical process, namely homolytic bond cleavage, and "bond strength" as measured by the BDE should not be regarded as an intrinsic property of a particular bond type but rather as an energy change that depends on chemical context.  For instance, Blanksby and Ellison cites the example of ketene (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CO), which has a C=C bond dissociation energy of 79 kcal/mol, while ethylene (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a bond dissociation energy of 174 kcal/mol.  This vast difference is accounted for by the thermodynamic stability of carbon monoxide (CO), formed upon C=C bond cleavage of ketene.&lt;ref name="BDE" /&gt;  The difference in availability of spin states upon fragmentation further complicates the use of BDE as a measure of bond strength for head-to-head comparisons, and force constants have been suggested as an alternative.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalescky|first=Robert|last2=Kraka|first2=Elfi|last3=Cremer|first3=Dieter|date=2013-08-30|title=Identification of the Strongest Bonds in Chemistry|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp406200w|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|language=EN|volume=117|issue=36|pages=8981–8995|doi=10.1021/jp406200w|issn=1089-5639}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historically, the vast majority of tabulated bond energy values are bond enthalpies.  More recently, however, the ''free energy'' analogue of bond-dissociation ''enthalpy'', known as the ''bond-dissociation free energy'' (BDFE), has become more prevalent in the chemical literature.  The BDFE of a bond A–B can be defined in the same way as the BDE as the standard free energy change (Δ''G''°) accompanying homolytic dissociation of AB into A and B.  However, it is often thought of and computed stepwise as the sum of the free energy changes of heterolytic bond dissociation (A–B → A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + :B&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), followed by one-electron reduction of A (A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; → A•) and one-electron oxidation of B (:B&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; → •B + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller DC, Tarantino KT, Knowles RR | title = Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in Organic Synthesis: Fundamentals, Applications, and Opportunities | journal = Topics in Current Chemistry | volume = 374 | issue = 3 | pages = 30 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27573270 | pmc = 5107260 | doi = 10.1007/s41061-016-0030-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the BDE, which is usually defined and measured in the gas phase, the BDFE is often determined in the solution phase with respect to a solvent like DMSO, since the free energy changes for the aforementioned thermochemical steps can be determined from parameters like acid dissociation constants (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and standard redox potentials (ℇ°) that are measured in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordwell|first=F.

===Bond energy===
Except for [[diatomic molecules]], the bond-dissociation energy differs from the ''[[bond energy]]''. While the bond-dissociation energy is the energy of a single chemical bond, the bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies of the bonds of the same type for a given molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of organic synthesis | first1 = Richard O C | last1 = Norman | first2 = James M | last2 = Coxon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2001|publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=978-0-7487-6162-3|edition= 3rd|location=London|pages=7|oclc=48595804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a homoleptic compound EX''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the E–X bond energy is (1/''n'') multiplied by the enthalpy change of the reaction EX''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → E + ''n''X.  Average bond energies given in tables are the average values of the bond energies of a collection of species containing 'typical' examples of the bond in question.

For example, dissociation of [[hydroxyl|HO]]–[[hydrogen|H]] bond of a water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) requires 118.8 kcal/mol (497.1&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol). The dissociation of the remaining [[hydroxyl radical]] requires 101.8 kcal/mol (425.9&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol). The bond energy of the covalent [[oxygen|O]]–[[hydrogen|H]] bonds in water is said to be 110.3 kcal/mol (461.5&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol), the average of these values.&lt;ref name="LehningerNelson2005"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lehninger | first1 = Albert L. | authorlink1 = Albert L. Lehninger | last2 = Nelson | first2 = David L. | authorlink2 =  | last3 = Cox | first3 = Michael M. | authorlink3 =  | name-list-format = vanc | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7chAN0UY0LYC&amp;pg=PA48 | edition = 4th | date = 2005 | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-4339-2 | page = 48 | access-date = May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, for removing successive hydrogen atoms from methane the bond-dissociation energies are 105&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (439&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) for ''D''(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–H), 110&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (460&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) for ''D''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–H), 101&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (423 kJ/mol) for ''D''(CH–H) and finally 81&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (339&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) for ''D''(C–H). The bond energy is, thus, 99&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol or 414&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (the average of the bond-dissociation energies). None of the individual bond-dissociation energies equals the bond energy of 99&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ia601508.us.archive.org/21/items/BDEAndPKaTables/TableOfBondDissociationEnergies2018.pdf|title=Table of Bond Dissociation Energies|last=|first=|date=19 September 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BDE" /&gt;

===Strongest bonds and weakest bonds===
According to BDE data, the strongest single bonds are Si–F bonds.  The BDE for H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si–F is 152 kcal/mol, almost 50% stronger than the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C–F bond (110 kcal/mol).  The BDE for F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si–F is even larger, at 166 kcal/mol.  One consequence to these data are that many reactions generate silicon fluorides, such as glass etching, [[deprotection]] in organic synthesis, and volcanic emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible87th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength of the bond is attributed to the substantial electronegativity difference between silicon and fluorine, which leads to a substantial contribution from both ionic and covalent bonding to the overall strength of the bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Ronald J.|date=July 1998|title=Covalent and Ionic Molecules: Why Are BeF2 and AlF3 High Melting Point Solids whereas BF3 and SiF4 Are Gases?|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed075p923|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|language=EN|volume=75|issue=7|pages=923|doi=10.1021/ed075p923|issn=0021-9584|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The C-C single bond of [[diacetylene]] (HC≡C–C≡CH) linking two sp-hybridized carbon atoms is also among the strongest, at 160 kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The strongest bond for a neutral compound, including multiple bonds, is found in carbon monoxide at 257 kcal/mol.  The protonated forms of CO, HCN and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are said to have even stronger bonds, although another study argues that the use of BDE as a measure of bond strength in these cases is misleading.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the other end of the scale, there is no clear boundary between a very weak covalent bond and an intermolecular interaction.  Lewis acid-base complexes between transition metal fragments and noble gases are among the weakest of bonds with substantial covalent character, with (CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;W:Ar having a W–Ar bond dissociation energy of less than 3.0 kcal/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Grills|first=D.C.|title=Transition metal-noble gas complexes|date=2001|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0898883805520026|work=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|pages=113–150|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0898-8838(05)52002-6|isbn=9780120236527|access-date=2018-10-23|last2=George|first2=M.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Held together entirely by the [[van der Waals force]], [[helium dimer]], He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, has the smallest measured bond dissociation energy of only 0.021 kcal/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerpa|first=Erick|last2=Krapp|first2=Andreas|last3=Flores-Moreno|first3=Roberto|last4=Donald|first4=Kelling J.|last5=Merino|first5=Gabriel|date=2009-02-09|title=Influence of Endohedral Confinement on the Electronic Interaction between He atoms: A He2@C20H20Case Study|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.200801399|journal=Chemistry - A European Journal|language=en|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1985–1990|doi=10.1002/chem.200801399|issn=0947-6539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homolytic versus heterolytic dissociation==
Bonds can be broken symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former is called homolysis and is the basis of the usual BDEs.  Asymmetric scission of a bond is called heterolysis. For molecular hydrogen, the alternatives are:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaces|10}} Δ''H''&amp;nbsp;= 104.2&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (see table below)
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaces|10}} Δ''H''&amp;nbsp;= 400.4&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol (gas phase)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartmess|first=John E.|last2=Scott|first2=Judith A.|last3=McIver|first3=Robert T. | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 1979 |title=Scale of acidities in the gas phase from methanol to phenol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=101 |issue=20 |pages=6046–6056 |doi=10.1021/ja00514a030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in the gas phase, the enthalpy of heterolysis is larger than that of homolysis, due to the need to separate unlike charges. However, this value is lowered substantially in the presence of solvent.

Boron carbide was discovered in 19th century as a [[by-product]] of reactions involving metal borides, but its [[chemical formula]] was unknown. It was not until the 1930s that the chemical composition was estimated as B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, Ramond R [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=CA&amp;NR=339873&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E "Boron Carbide"], European Patent CA339873 (A), publication date: 1934-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;
There remained, however, controversy as to whether or not the material had this exact 4:1 [[stoichiometry]], as in practice the material is always slightly carbon-deficient with regard to this formula, and [[X-ray crystallography]] shows that its structure is highly complex, with a mixture of C-B-C chains and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; [[icosahedron|icosahedra]]. These features argued against a very simple exact B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C empirical formula.&lt;ref name=stoi&gt;

Because of the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; structural unit, the chemical formula of "ideal" boron carbide is often written not as B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, but as B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;CBC units.

The ability of boron carbide to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s makes it attractive as an absorbent for [[neutron radiation]] arising in [[nuclear power plant]]s and from anti-personnel [[neutron bomb]]s. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, [[control rod]] and shut down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.&lt;ref name=w330&gt;Weimer, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borfig12a.png|thumb|right|150px|Fragment of the B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C crystal structure.]]

Boron carbide has a complex crystal structure typical of [[Crystal structure of boron-rich metal borides|icosahedron-based borides]]. There, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; [[icosahedron|icosahedra]] form a [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral]] lattice unit (space group: ''R{{overline|3}}m'' (No. 166), lattice constants: ''a'' = 0.56&amp;nbsp;nm and ''c'' = 1.212&amp;nbsp;nm) surrounding a C-B-C chain that resides at the center of the [[unit cell]], and both carbon atoms bridge the neighboring three icosahedra. This structure is layered: the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedra and bridging [[carbons]] form a network plane that spreads parallel to the ''c''-plane and stacks along the ''c''-axis. The lattice has two basic structure units – the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedron and the B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; [[octahedron]]. Because of the small size of the B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra, they cannot interconnect. Instead, they bond to the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; icosahedra in the neighboring layer, and this decreases bonding strength in the ''c''-plane.&lt;ref name=zhangyb28.5c4/&gt;

Because of the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; structural unit, the chemical formula of "ideal" boron carbide is often written not as B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, but as B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units.&lt;ref name=stoi/&gt;&lt;ref name=gr/&gt; Some studies indicate the possibility of incorporation of one or more carbon atoms into the boron icosahedra, giving rise to formulas such as (B&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;C)CBC = B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C at the carbon-heavy end of the stoichiometry, but formulas such as B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(CBB) = B&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;C at the boron-rich end. "Boron carbide" is thus not a single compound, but a family of compounds of different compositions.

===Semiconductor properties===
Boron carbide is a [[semiconductor]], with electronic properties dominated by hopping-type transport.&lt;ref name="Domnich2011" /&gt; The energy [[band gap]] depends on composition as well as the degree of order. The band gap is estimated at 2.09 eV, with multiple mid-bandgap states which complicate the photoluminescence spectrum.&lt;ref name="Domnich2011" /&gt; The material is typically p-type.

==Preparation==
Boron carbide was first synthesized by [[Henri Moissan]] in 1899,&lt;ref name=gr&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; by reduction of [[boron trioxide]] either with [[carbon]] or [[magnesium]] in presence of carbon in an electric [[arc furnace]]. In the case of carbon, the reaction occurs at temperatures above the melting point of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C and is accompanied by liberation of large amount of [[carbon monoxide]]:&lt;ref name=w131&gt;Weimer, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; 
:2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 C → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C + 6 CO

If magnesium is used, the reaction can be carried out in a graphite [[crucible]], and the magnesium byproducts are removed by treatment with acid.&lt;ref&gt;Patnaik, Pradyot (2002). ''Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals''. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-049439-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Joinery-T-BriddleJoint.svg|thumb|250px|right|T-bridle joint]]
A '''bridle joint''' is a [[woodworking joint]], similar to a [[mortise and tenon]], in that a tenon is cut on the end of one member and a mortise is cut into the other to accept it.&lt;ref&gt;Bridle Joints, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/frame/slip WoodworkDetails.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing feature is that the tenon and the mortise are cut to the full width of the tenon member.

The '''corner bridle joint''' (also known as a '''slot mortise and tenon''') joins two members at their respective ends, forming a corner. This form of the joint is commonly used to house a rail in uprights, such as legs. It provides good strength in compression and is fairly resistant to stacking, although a mechanical fastener or pin is often required. The bridle joint is very popular in [[workbench]] construction.

Corner bridles are often used to join frame components when the frame is to be shaped. Material can be removed from the joined members after assembly without sacrificing joint integrity.

A variation of the bridle joint is the '''T-bridle''', which joins the end of one member to the middle of another.&lt;ref&gt;Woodwork Joints [http://www.provenwoodworking.com/woodworking-joints.html Proven Woodworking]&lt;/ref&gt;  The tee bridle joint is very strong and good for joining 2 pieces together.

In traditional [[timber framing]] the bridle joint is commonly used to join the tops of principal [[rafter]]s.

==Applications==
* Legs or stiles to rails
* Frames

==Methods==
Corner bridles can be cut by the following methods:
* [[Hand saw]] and [[chisel]]
* [[circular saw]] with multiple passes (depending on width and depth)
* [[dado set]] in a single pass
* [[Wood router|electric router]] using a straight or rebate bit
* [[spindle mould]]
* [[brace (tool)]] and [[auger (drill)]] to start the mortise, followed by chiseling to square the opening
* mortising machine to create the mortise

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11727">'''CFSMC''', or '''Carbon Fiber Sheet Molding Compound''' (also known as '''CSMC''' or '''CF-SMC'''), is a ready to mold [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] composite material used in [[compression molding]].  While traditional [[Sheet moulding compound|SMC]] utilizes chopped [[Glass fiber|glass fibers]] in a polymer resin, CFSMC utilizes chopped [[carbon fibers]].  The length and distribution of the carbon fibers is more regular, homogeneous, and constant than the standard glass SMC.  CFSMC offers much higher stiffness and usually higher strength than standard SMC, but at a higher cost.

== Manufacturing ==
[[File:CF-SMC.png|thumb|268x268px|Scheme of the tow-based microsructure of CF-SMC.]]
CF-SMC are made up of carbon tow chunks, spread between two layers of uncured [[thermosetting resin]]. The carbon fibre tows are cut from prepreg UD tape. The originating tape can be made up of a certain number of fibres (filaments), thus affecting the properties of the final composite: values can vary from 3 to 50 thousand filaments, while typical tow lengths are within 10 to 50 mm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.temp.speautomotive.com/SPEA_CD/SPEA2013/pdf/CF/CF3.pdf|title=SPE Automotive|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As for the resin, thermosetting resins are used: possible choices are [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]] or [[epoxy]], with the former being the cheapest and the latter being the most performant. Despite not being as strong nor stiff as epoxy, vinyl ester is often used for its properties like [[corrosion]] and higher temperature resistance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/vinyl-ester-vs-polyester-resins-820376|title=Resins|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The constituents are combined in sheets of prepreg material. The tows usually fall from the cutter to one of the two layers of resin, and are then covered by the second layer. The prepreg sheets of SMC are made after the viscous assemble is compacted via rolls. In this phase, any control over the orientation of the fibres is generally impossible, and the fibres can be considered to have an equiprobable orientation in all directions. 

Once the prepreg sheets are made, the material can be compression moulded into the final desired shape. Compression moulding is a manufacturing technique that requires a two parts mould: the first one hosts the moulding material (charge), while the second one is mounted on a press to close the cavity while applying high pressure. Due to complex geometry, it may be necessary to cut the sheets to place them more easily in the lower mould. Then, when the upper part start closing, the material is pushed inside the cavity until complete filling. Pressure is maintained, together with elevated temperature, to allow the curing of the resin and low porosity.  This stage has a heavy influence on the mechanical performances of the final product, as the flow of the viscous assemble into the cavity tends to orient the fibres along the flowing direction. By controlling the amount and direction of the flow, it is thus possible to influence the fibre orientation, having a quasi-isotropic material (low-flow moulding) or higher performances in a desired direction (high-flow moulding)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.temp.speautomotive.com/SPEA_CD/SPEA2013/pdf/CF/CF3.pdf|title=Quantum resume|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The manufacturing phase is also important to avoid, when possible, defects like weld lines. Weld lines occur when two flow fronts of material meet when filling the cavity. When this happens, the material is locally as or even more weak than the neat resin. This is generally due to multiple reasons, like absence of fibres intermingle, air traps or even low entanglement of polymeric chaining during curing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptonline.com/articles/what-to-do-about-weak-weld-lines|title=Weld lines|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Material Properties ==
[[File:CF-SMC stressstrain.png|thumb|286x286px|Different behaviour, in terms of stress strain curve, of CF-SMC according to the orientation of the tows. In the picture are shown the two (irrealistic) extreme cases of the tows perfectly aligned parallel or perpendicular to load direction.]]
Due to their [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] and [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] microstructure, mechanical properties of CF-SMC can vary significantly within broad ranges. Parameters having profound impact on these materials performances are mainly related to the fibres and matrix neat mechanical and geometrical properties (especially those of the fibres) and the orientation and content of the reinforcement. [[Elastic modulus|Modulus]] can vary from less than 20 GPa to 60 GPa, while [[Strength of materials|strength]] values are within 60-500 MPa&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

CF-SMC can also be engineered, to some extent, to have better performances in a specific direction, in a similar fashion as continuous fibres composites. This can be achieved by carefully controlling the compression moulding stage to influence fibre orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Advani |first1=Suresh G. |last2=Tucker |first2=Charles L. |title=The Use of Tensors to Describe and Predict Fiber Orientation in Short Fiber Composites |journal=Journal of Rheology |date=November 1987 |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=751–784 |doi=10.1122/1.549945}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fibres are mainly aligned with the loading direction, the material behaviour is mainly dominated by that of the fibres, thus resulting in stronger and stiffer, but also more brittle response. In the opposite case, if fibres tend to dispose perpendicular to the loading direction, the resin contributes more to the load bearing, and the overall composite will be less stiff, less strong and more ductile. Being based on hydrodynamic transport phenomena, however, the control over fibre orientation in CF-SMC is much more limited than in the continuous composites case, where orientation is often directly determined accurately by the manufacturer. In addition, while continuous fibres composites have a specific orientation, short fibre reinforced plastics can have a preferential orientation, meaning that, considering a generic system of axis, the majority of fibres can have a higher component along a direction and a lower component along the other two axis.
[[File:UD laminate vs CFSMC.png|thumb|295x295px|Comparison of the accurate fibre orientation in a laminate of UD plies (a) and the preferential orientation achievable with CF-SMC (b).]]
The discontinuous tow-based microstructure of these materials makes is even more heterogeneous than standard composites: fibre ends themselves acts as [[stress concentration]] areas for both the resin and the neighbouring tows; moreover, especially for complex shaped parts, it is impossible to prevent some local spots with badly aligned tows (e.g. perpendicular to the direction of axial stress) or with low fibre volume content, like resin pockets. Although making the material weaker and the structural design more complex, this feature makes these materials quite notch-insensitive&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

When moulded, CFSMC has a very different appearance than traditional carbon fibre fabric composites, which traditionally appear with a woven checkerboard pattern. CFSMC has the appearance of black and grey [[marble]] or [[burl]]. 

== Industrial use ==
CF SMC combines the lightweight properties of carbon composites with a manufacturing process, as compression moulding, that allows fast manufacturing and thus is suitable for high volume industrial applications. For these reasons, the [[automotive industry]] is one of the best candidate for this technology.

Car manufacturers have used standard glass SMC for over 30 years as a material for body panels in select sport cars such as the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.superchevy.com/how-to/vemp-1108-corvette-body-materials/|title=Corvette Body Materials - Tracing the Evolution of Corvette's Use of Lightweight Materials - Vette Magazine|date=2011-08-01|work=Super Chevy|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Substituting glass fibres with carbon is a recent development, having been used for significant structural components of the [[Dodge Viper|2003 Dodge Viper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=APPLICATIONS OF CARBON FIBER SMC FOR THE DODGE VIPER|url=https://www.4spe.org/Resources/resource.aspx?ItemNumber=25313|journal=ACCE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the multifunctional spare wheel pan of [[Mercedes-AMG]] E-Class &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/astar-carbon-fibre-smc-multifunctional-spare-wheel-pan-astar-s-a-/|title=ASTAR Carbon Fibre SMC for Multifunctional Spare Wheel Pan of Mercedes-AMG E-Class|}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]], the 2009 [[Lexus LFA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/07/the-making-of-the-lexus-lfa-supercar-an-inside-report-chapter-2-in-the-clean-room/|title=The Making Of The Lexus LFA Supercar.

[[Lamborghini]] (together with [[Callaway Golf Company]]) patented an advanced version of CF-SMC called [[Forged composite|Forged Composite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamborghini.com/it-en/brand/innovazione-eccellenza/forged-composites|title=Forged Composites®|website=www.lamborghini.com|language=it|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They first introduced it in the [[Lamborghini Sesto Elemento|Sesto Elemento]] [[concept car]], and since then, Forged Composite has been a distinctive mark for Lamborghini cars, used both in structural and aesthetical purposes. CF-SMC use is recently spreading also to the much broader non-high performance automotive sector as for the 2017 [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid|Toyota Prius PHV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plasticstoday.com/automotive-and-mobility/smc-adopted-rear-door-frame-toyota-s-new-prius-phv/163725208056557|title=SMC adopted for rear door frame of Toyota’s new Prius PHV|date=2017-04-03|work=PlasticsToday|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

CF-SMC has also been used in the aeronautic industry by [[Boeing]], for the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] window frames, while producers suggest that the use of these materials will grow in this sector as well&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astar.es/overview/csmc-carbon-smc/carbon-smc_62-61-en|title=Astar CSMC Materials|website=www.astar.es|language=en|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexcel.com/Products/HexMC-Materials-for-Industries|title=HexMC Materials {{!}} Hexcel|website=www.hexcel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/boeing-787-update|title=Boeing 787 Update|last=Brosius|first=Dale|website=www.compositesworld.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The '''Condor Cliff Dam''', formerly known as '''Néstor Kirchner Dam''' and previously '''Condor Cliff Dam''', is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] being built on the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]] about {{Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Puerto Santa Cruz]] in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina]]. It was renamed after the former president [[Néstor Kirchner]], born in Santa Cruz. A consortium led by China's [[Gezhouba Group]] was awarded the contract to build the Néstor Kirchner Dam and [[Jorge Cepernic Dam]] downstream in August 2013. The consortium will also fund the construction. Both dams are expected to cost nearly US$4.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/08/22/china-will-build-and-finance-two-dams-in-patagonia-equivalent-to-10-of-argentine-power-demand | title=China will build and finance two dams in Patagonia equivalent to 10% of Argentine power demand | date=22 August 2013 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be built by the firm ''Electroingeniería'', led by Osvaldo Acosta and Gerardo Ferreyra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/economia/Represas-Kirchner-y-Cepernic--La-ultima-gran-joya-de-los-reyes-de-la-obra-publica-20130803-0029.html Represas Kirchner y Cepernic | La última gran joya de los reyes de la obra pública] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and its power station will have an installed capacity of {{convert|1140|MW}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.obraspublicas.gov.ar/documentos/Libros_Respresas/Libro_Ingles.pdf | title=Hydroelectric Projects in the Santa Cruz River | work=Water and Energy National and Regional Integration | agency=Government of Argentina |page=95| accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|A polarized dielectric material]]

A '''dielectric''' (or '''dielectric material''') is an [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]] that can be polarized by an applied [[electric field]]. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an [[electrical conductor]] but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing '''dielectric polarization'''. Because of [[dielectric]] [[Polarization density|polarization]], positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself.&lt;ref name=britannica1/&gt; If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarized, but also reorient so that their [[Symmetry axis|symmetry axes]] align to the field.&lt;ref name=britannica1/&gt;

The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur R. von Hippel]], in his seminal work, ''Dielectric Materials and Applications'', stated: "''Dielectrics''... are not a narrow class of so-called insulators, but the broad expanse of ''nonmetals'' considered from the standpoint of their interaction with electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields. Thus we are concerned with gases as well as with liquids and solids, and with the storage of electric and magnetic energy as well as its dissipation." (Technology Press of MIT and John Wiley, NY, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thoms|first1=E.|last2=Sippel|first2=P.|last3=et.|first3=al.|title=Dielectric study on mixtures of ionic liquids|journal=Sci.

Rep.|date=2017|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01007-9|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..932B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in [[electronics]], [[optics]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[cell biophysics]].

==Terminology==
Although the term ''[[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]'' implies low [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conduction]], ''dielectric'' typically means materials with a high [[polarizability]]. The latter is expressed by a number called the [[relative permittivity]]. The term insulator is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while the term dielectric is used to indicate the [[Energy storage|energy]] storing capacity of the material (by means of polarization). A common example of a dielectric is the electrically insulating material between the metallic plates of a [[capacitor]]. The polarization of the dielectric by the applied electric field increases the capacitor's surface charge for the given electric field strength.&lt;ref name=britannica1&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/dielectric Dielectric]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "Dielectric, insulating material or a very poor conductor of electric current. When dielectrics are placed in an electric field, practically no current flows in them because, unlike metals, they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[:wikt:dielectric|dielectric]]'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] (from ''[[:wikt:dia-|dia]]-'' + ''electric'') in response to a request from [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daintith, J. |title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=0-7503-0287-9|page=943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Frank A.J.L., editor. The Correspondence of Michael Faraday, Volume 3, 1841–1848, {{cite web|url = http://hermital.org/book/holoprt5-1.htm#F5.8|title =Letter 1798, William Whewell to Faraday, p. 442.}} The Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, United Kingdom, 1996. {{ISBN|0-86341-250-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''perfect dielectric'' is a material with zero electrical conductivity ([[cf.]] [[perfect conductor]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ZecSEXlJE0YC |page=21 }} |title=Microwave Engineering – R. S. Rao (Prof.) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus exhibiting only a [[Displacement current#History and interpretation|displacement current]]; therefore it stores and returns electrical energy as if it were an ideal capacitor.

==Electric susceptibility==
{{Main article|Electric susceptibility|Permittivity}}

The [[electric susceptibility]] ''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a dielectric material is a measure of how easily it [[polarization density|polarizes]] in response to an electric field. This, in turn, determines the electric [[permittivity]] of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of [[capacitor]]s to the [[speed of light]].

It is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a [[tensor]]) relating an electric field '''E''' to the induced dielectric [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] '''P''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]].

The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity ''ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_e\ = \varepsilon_r - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So in the case of a vacuum,

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_e\ = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[electric displacement]] '''D''' is related to the polarization density '''P''' by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} \ = \ 
  \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \ = \ 
  \varepsilon_0 \left(1 + \chi_e\right) \mathbf{E} \ = \ 
  \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \mathbf{E}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Dispersion and causality===
In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field. The more general formulation as a function of time is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t) = \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^t \chi_e\left(t - t'\right) \mathbf{E}\left(t'\right)\, dt'.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by ''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''(Δ''t''). The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{nowrap|''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''(Δ''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|Δ''t'' &lt; 0}}. An instantaneous response corresponds to [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{nowrap|''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''(Δ''t'') {{=}} ''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;δ''(Δ''t'')}}.

It is more convenient in a linear system to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Due to the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

Note the simple frequency dependence of the susceptibility, or equivalently the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e., {{nowrap|''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''(Δ''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{nowrap|Δ''t'' &lt; 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers–Kronig relation|Kramers–Kronig constraints]] on the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility ''χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω'').

===Basic atomic model===

[[Image:dielectric model.svg|right|thumb|400px|Electric field interaction with an atom under the classical dielectric model.]]

In the classical approach to the dielectric model, a material is made up of atoms. Each atom consists of a cloud of negative charge (electrons) bound to and surrounding a positive point charge at its centre. In the presence of an electric field the charge cloud is distorted, as shown in the top right of the figure.

This can be reduced to a simple [[dipole]] using the [[superposition principle]]. A dipole is characterized by its [[electrical dipole moment|dipole moment]], a vector quantity shown in the figure as the blue arrow labeled ''M''. It is the relationship between the electric field and the dipole moment that gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric. (Note that the dipole moment points in the same direction as the electric field in the figure. This isn't always the case, and is a major simplification, but is true for many materials.)

When the electric field is removed the atom returns to its original state. The time required to do so is the so-called [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] time; an exponential decay.

This is the essence of the model in physics. The behavior of the dielectric now depends on the situation. The more complicated the situation, the richer the model must be to accurately describe the behavior. Important questions are:
*Is the electric field constant or does it vary with time? At what rate?
*Does the response depend on the direction of the applied field ([[isotropy]] of the material)?
*Is the response the same everywhere ([[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the material)?
*Do any boundaries or interfaces have to be taken into account?
*Is the response [[Linear system|linear]] with respect to the field, or are there [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]]?

The relationship between the electric field '''E''' and the dipole moment '''M''' gives rise to the behavior of the dielectric, which, for a given material, can be characterized by the function '''F''' defined by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{E})&lt;/math&gt;.

When both the type of electric field and the type of material have been defined, one then chooses the simplest function ''F'' that correctly predicts the phenomena of interest. Examples of phenomena that can be so modeled include:

*[[Refractive index]]
*[[Group velocity dispersion]]
*[[Birefringence]]
*[[Self-focusing]]
*[[Harmonic generation]]

===Dipolar polarization=== &lt;!--Dipolar polarization redirects here--&gt;
Dipolar polarization is a polarization that is either inherent to [[polar molecule]]s ('''orientation polarization'''), or can be induced in any molecule in which the asymmetric distortion of the nuclei is possible ('''distortion polarization'''). Orientation polarization results from a permanent dipole, e.g., that arising from the 104.45° angle between the asymmetric bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the water molecule, which retains polarization in the absence of an external electric field. The assembly of these dipoles forms a macroscopic polarization.

When an external electric field is applied, the distance between charges within each permanent dipole, which is related to [[chemical bond]]ing, remains constant in orientation polarization; however, the direction of polarization itself rotates. This rotation occurs on a timescale that depends on the [[torque]] and surrounding local [[viscosity]] of the molecules. Because the rotation is not instantaneous, dipolar polarizations lose the response to electric fields at the highest frequencies. A molecule rotates about 1 radian per picosecond in a fluid, thus this loss occurs at about 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Hz (in the microwave region). The delay of the response to the change of the electric field causes [[friction]] and heat.

When an external electric field is applied at [[infrared]] frequencies or less, the molecules are bent and stretched by the field and the molecular dipole moment changes. The molecular vibration frequency is roughly the inverse of the time it takes for the molecules to bend, and this '''distortion polarization''' disappears above the infrared.

===Ionic polarization=== &lt;!--Ionic polarization redirects here--&gt;
Ionic polarization is polarization caused by relative displacements between positive and negative [[ion]]s in [[ionic crystal]]s (for example, [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]).

If a crystal or molecule consists of atoms of more than one kind, the distribution of charges around an atom in the crystal or molecule leans to positive or negative. As a result, when lattice vibrations or molecular vibrations induce relative displacements of the atoms, the centers of positive and negative charges are also displaced. The locations of these centers are affected by the symmetry of the displacements. When the centers don't correspond, polarization arises in molecules or crystals. This polarization is called '''ionic polarization'''.

Ionic polarization causes the [[ferroelectric effect]] as well as [[dipolar polarization]]. The ferroelectric transition, which is caused by the lining up of the orientations of permanent dipoles along a particular direction, is called an '''order-disorder phase transition'''. The transition caused by ionic polarizations in crystals is called a '''displacive phase transition'''.

====In cells====
Ionic polarization enables the production of energy-rich compounds in cells (the [[proton pump]] in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]) and, at the [[plasma membrane]], the establishment of the [[resting potential]], energetically unfavourable transport of ions, and cell-to-cell communication (the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]]).

All cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's [[plasma membrane]], known as the [[membrane potential]]. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between [[Ion transporter|ion transporters]] and [[ion channels]].

In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the [[dendrite]]s, [[axon]], and [[soma (biology)|cell body]] different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not.

==Dielectric dispersion==
In physics, '''dielectric dispersion''' is the dependence of the permittivity of a dielectric material on the frequency of an applied electric field. Because there is a lag between changes in polarization and changes in the electric field, the permittivity of the dielectric is a complicated function of frequency of the electric field. Dielectric dispersion is very important for the applications of dielectric materials and for the analysis of polarization systems.

This is one instance of a general phenomenon known as [[material dispersion]]: a frequency-dependent response of a medium for wave propagation.

When the frequency becomes higher:
# dipolar polarization can no longer follow the oscillations of the electric field in the [[microwave]] region around 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]];
# ionic polarization and molecular distortion polarization can no longer track the electric field past the [[infrared]] or far-infrared region around 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Hz, ;
# electronic polarization loses its response in the ultraviolet region around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz.

In the frequency region above ultraviolet, permittivity approaches the constant ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in every substance, where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of the free space. Because permittivity indicates the strength of the relation between an electric field and polarization, if a polarization process loses its response, permittivity decreases.

==Dielectric relaxation==
'''Dielectric relaxation''' is the momentary delay (or lag) in the [[dielectric constant]] of a material. This is usually caused by the delay in molecular polarization with respect to a changing electric field in a dielectric medium (e.g., inside capacitors or between two large [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] surfaces). Dielectric relaxation in changing electric fields could be considered analogous to [[hysteresis]] in changing [[magnetic field]]s (for [[inductor]]s or [[transformer]]s). Relaxation in general is a delay or lag in the response of a [[linear system]], and therefore dielectric relaxation is measured relative to the expected linear steady state (equilibrium) dielectric values. The time lag between electrical field and polarization implies an irreversible degradation of [[Gibbs free energy]].

In [[physics]], '''dielectric relaxation''' refers to the relaxation response of a dielectric medium to an external, oscillating electric field. This relaxation is often described in terms of permittivity as a function of [[frequency]], which can, for ideal systems, be described by the Debye equation. On the other hand, the distortion related to ionic and electronic polarization shows behavior of the [[resonance]] or [[oscillator]] type. The character of the distortion process depends on the structure, composition, and surroundings of the sample.

===Debye relaxation===
'''Debye relaxation''' is the dielectric relaxation response of an ideal, noninteracting population of dipoles to an alternating external electric field. It is usually expressed in the complex permittivity ''ε'' of a medium as a function of the field's [[frequency]] ''ω'':

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\varepsilon}(\omega) = \varepsilon_{\infty} + \frac{\Delta\varepsilon}{1 + i\omega\tau},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, {{nowrap|Δ''ε'' {{=}} ''ε&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''ε&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;''}} where ''ε&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the static, low frequency permittivity, and ''τ'' is the characteristic [[relaxation time]] of the medium. Separating the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric permittivity yields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dielectric Phenomena in Solids|last=Kao|first=Kwan Chi|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2004|isbn=0-12-396561-6|location=London|pages=92–93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \varepsilon' &amp;= \varepsilon_\infty + \frac{\varepsilon_s - \varepsilon_\infty}{1 + \omega^2\tau^2} \\[3pt]
  \varepsilon'' &amp;= \frac{(\varepsilon_s - \varepsilon_\infty)\omega\tau}{1+\omega^2\tau^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric loss is also represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta) = \frac{\varepsilon''}{\varepsilon'} = \frac{\left(\varepsilon_s - \varepsilon_\infty\right)\omega\tau}{\varepsilon_s + \varepsilon_\infty \omega^2 \tau^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This relaxation model was introduced by and named after the physicist [[Peter Debye]] (1913).&lt;ref&gt;Debye, P. (1913), Ver. Deut. Phys. Gesell. 15, 777; reprinted 1954 in collected papers of Peter J.W. Debye. Interscience, New York&lt;/ref&gt; It is characteristic for dynamic polarization with only one relaxation time.

===Variants of the Debye equation===
;[[Cole–Cole equation]]: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows symmetric broadening.
;[[Cole–Davidson equation]]: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows asymmetric broadening.
;[[Havriliak–Negami relaxation]]: This equation considers both symmetric and asymmetric broadening.
;[[Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function]]: Fourier transform of [[stretched exponential function]].
;[[Curie–von Schweidler law]]: This shows the response of dielectrics to an applied DC field to behave according to a power law, which can be expressed as an integral over weighted exponential functions..

==Paraelectricity==

{{See also|Ferroelectricity}}

Paraelectricity is the ability of many materials (specifically [[ceramic]]s) to become polarized under an applied [[electric field]]. Unlike [[ferroelectricity]], this can happen even if there is no permanent [[electric dipole]] that exists in the material, and removal of the fields results in the [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]] in the material returning to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Y. et al. (1997) ''Physical Ceramics'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], New York&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms that cause '''paraelectric''' behaviour are the distortion of individual [[ions]] (displacement of the electron cloud from the nucleus) and polarization of molecules or combinations of ions or defects.

Paraelectricity can occur in [[crystal]] phases where electric dipoles are unaligned and thus have the potential to align in an external [[electric field]] and weaken it.

An example of a paraelectric material of high dielectric constant is [[strontium titanate]].

The [[lithium niobate|LiNbO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;]] crystal is [[ferroelectric]] below 1430 [[Kelvin|K]], and above this temperature it transforms into a disordered paraelectric phase. Similarly, other [[perovskite]]s also exhibit paraelectricity at high temperatures.

Paraelectricity has been explored as a possible refrigeration mechanism; polarizing a paraelectric by applying an electric field under [[adiabatic|adiabatic process]] conditions raises the temperature, while removing the field lowers the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuhn | first1 = U. | last2 = Lüty | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1016/0038-1098(65)90060-8 | title = Paraelectric heating and cooling with OH—dipoles in alkali halides | journal = Solid State Communications | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 31 | year = 1965 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1965SSCom...3...31K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A heat pump that operates by polarizing the paraelectric, allowing it to return to ambient temperature (by dissipating the extra heat), bringing it into contact with the object to be cooled, and finally depolarizing it, would result in refrigeration.

==Tunability==

''Tunable dielectrics'' are insulators whose ability to store electrical charge changes when a voltage is applied.&lt;ref name=k&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/self-correcting-crystal-may-lead-to-the-next-generation-of-advanced-communications-2 |title=Self-correcting crystal may lead to the next generation of advanced communications |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7472 |pages=532 |doi=10.1038/nature12582|pmid=24132232 |year=2013 |last1=Lee |first1=Che-Hui |last2=Orloff |first2=Nathan D. |last3=Birol |first3=Turan |last4=Zhu |first4=Ye |last5=Goian |first5=Veronica |last6=Rocas |first6=Eduard |last7=Haislmaier |first7=Ryan |last8=Vlahos |first8=Eftihia |last9=Mundy |first9=Julia A. |last10=Kourkoutis |first10=Lena F. |last11=Nie |first11=Yuefeng |last12=Biegalski |first12=Michael D. |last13=Zhang |first13=Jingshu |last14=Bernhagen |first14=Margitta |last15=Benedek |first15=Nicole A. |last16=Kim |first16=Yongsam |last17=Brock |first17=Joel D. |last18=Uecker |first18=Reinhard |last19=Xi |first19=X.

Generally, [[strontium titanate]] ({{chem|Sr|Ti|O|3}}) is used for devices operating at low temperatures, while [[barium strontium titanate]] ({{chem|Ba|1−x|Sr|x|Ti|O|3}}) substitutes for room temperature devices. Other potential materials include microwave dielectrics and carbon nanotube (CNT) composites.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electrically tunable dielectric materials and strategies to improve their performances |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2010.04.004 |volume=55 |issue=8 |journal=Progress in Materials Science |pages=840–893|last1=Kong |first1=L.B. |last2=Li |first2=S. |last3=Zhang |first3=T.S. |last4=Zhai |first4=J.W. |last5=Boey |first5=F.Y.C. |last6=Ma |first6=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Giere | first1 = A. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Maune | first3 = H. | last4 = Sazegar | first4 = M. | last5 = Paul | first5 = F. | last6 = Zhou | first6 = X. | last7 = Binder | first7 = J.

In 2013 multi-sheet layers of strontium titanate interleaved with single layers of [[strontium oxide]] produced a dielectric capable of operating at up to 125&amp;nbsp;GHz. The material was created via [[molecular beam epitaxy]]. The two have mismatched crystal spacing that produces strain within the strontium titanate layer that makes it less stable and tunable.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;

Systems such as {{chem|Ba|1−x|Sr|x|Ti|O|3}} have a paraelectric–ferroelectric transition just below ambient temperature, providing high tunability. Such films suffer significant losses arising from defects.

==Applications==

===Capacitors===

{{Main|Capacitor}}

[[Image:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|upright|Charge separation in a parallel-plate capacitor causes an internal electric field. A dielectric (orange) reduces the field and increases the capacitance.]]

Commercially manufactured capacitors typically use a [[solid]] dielectric material with high permittivity as the intervening medium between the stored positive and negative charges. This material is often referred to in technical contexts as the ''capacitor dielectric''.&lt;ref&gt;Müssig, Hans-Joachim. ''Semiconductor capacitor with praseodymium oxide as dielectric'', {{US Patent|7113388}} published 2003-11-06, issued 2004-10-18, assigned to IHP GmbH- Innovations for High Performance Microelectronics/Institute Fur Innovative Mikroelektronik&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious advantage to using such a dielectric material is that it prevents the conducting plates, on which the charges are stored, from coming into direct electrical contact. More significantly, however, a high permittivity allows a greater stored charge at a given voltage. This can be seen by treating the case of a linear dielectric with permittivity ''ε'' and thickness ''d'' between two conducting plates with uniform charge density ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this case the charge density is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon\frac{V}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[capacitance]] per unit area by

:&lt;math&gt;c=\frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}}{V}=\frac{\varepsilon}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, it can easily be seen that a larger ''ε'' leads to greater charge stored and thus greater capacitance.

Dielectric materials used for capacitors are also chosen such that they are resistant to [[ionization]]. This allows the capacitor to operate at higher voltages before the insulating dielectric ionizes and begins to allow undesirable current.

===Dielectric resonator===
{{Main|Dielectric resonator}}

A ''dielectric resonator oscillator'' (DRO) is an electronic component that exhibits [[resonance]] of the polarization response for a narrow range of frequencies, generally in the microwave band. It consists of a "puck" of ceramic that has a large dielectric constant and a low [[dissipation factor]]. Such resonators are often used to provide a frequency reference in an oscillator circuit. An unshielded dielectric resonator can be used as a [[Dielectric Resonator Antenna|dielectric resonator antenna]] (DRA).

=== BST thin films ===

From 2002 to 2004, the [[Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) conducted research on thin film technology. Barium strontium titanate (BST), a ferroelectric thin film, was studied for the fabrication of radio frequency and microwave components, such as voltage-controlled oscillators, tunable filters, and phase shifters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Novel tunable acceptor doped BST thin films for high quality tunable microwave devices|url=|journal=REVISTA MEXICANA DE FI´SICA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was part of an effort to provide the Army with highly-tunable, microwave-compatible materials for broadband electric-field tunable devices, which operate consistently in extreme temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzZLtRlUPNoC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=tunable+microwave+devices+army+research+laboratory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L8a2AO0aR7&amp;sig=-aGvspVGkj3hZqs8MS3PDh1oOPQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF-_ORxbXcAhUDMt8KHWl_Amg4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tunable%20microwave%20devices%20army%20research%20laboratory&amp;f=false|title=Developments in Dielectric Materials and Electronic Devices: Proceedings of the 106th Annual Meeting of The American Ceramic Society, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA 2004|last=Nair|first=K.

In a 2004 research paper, ARL researchers explored how small concentrations of acceptor dopants can dramatically modify the properties of ferroelectric materials such as BST.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=M.

Researchers “doped” BST thin films with magnesium, analyzing the “structure, microstructure, surface morphology and film/substrate compositional quality” of the result. The Mg doped BST films showed “improved dielectric properties, low leakage current, and good tunability,” meriting potential for use in microwave tunable devices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Some practical dielectrics==
Dielectric materials can be solids, liquids, or gases. In addition, a high [[vacuum]] can also be a useful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=David|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly lossless dielectric even though its relative [[dielectric constant]] is only unity.

Solid dielectrics are perhaps the most commonly used dielectrics in electrical engineering, and many solids are very good insulators. Some examples include [[porcelain]], [[glass]], and most [[plastic]]s. Air, [[nitrogen]] and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] are the three most commonly used [[gaseous dielectric]]s.
*[[Industrial coating]]s such as [[parylene]] provide a dielectric barrier between the substrate and its environment.
*[[Mineral oil]] is used extensively inside electrical [[transformer]]s as a fluid dielectric and to assist in cooling. Dielectric fluids with higher dielectric constants, such as electrical grade [[castor oil]], are often used in [[high voltage]] capacitors to help prevent [[corona discharge]] and increase capacitance.
*Because dielectrics resist the flow of electricity, the surface of a dielectric may retain ''stranded'' excess electrical charges. This may occur accidentally when the dielectric is rubbed (the [[triboelectric effect]]). This can be useful, as in a [[Van de Graaff generator]] or [[electrophorus]], or it can be potentially destructive as in the case of [[electrostatic discharge]].
*Specially processed dielectrics, called [[electret]]s (which should not be confused with [[ferroelectric]]s), may retain excess internal charge or "frozen in" polarization. Electrets have a semipermanent electric field, and are the electrostatic equivalent to magnets. Electrets have numerous practical applications in the home and industry.
*Some dielectrics can generate a potential difference when subjected to mechanical [[Stress (physics)|stress]], or (equivalently) change physical shape if an external voltage is applied across the material. This property is called [[piezoelectricity]]. Piezoelectric materials are another class of very useful dielectrics.
*Some ionic [[crystal]]s and [[polymer]] dielectrics exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment, which can be reversed by an externally applied electric field. This behavior is called the [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric effect]]. These materials are analogous to the way [[ferromagnetic materials]] behave within an externally applied magnetic field. Ferroelectric materials often have very high dielectric constants, making them quite useful for capacitors.

==History==
Ekoa was initially developed by [[Blackbird Guitars]], a company that has made musical instruments out of [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer]], but started working on a biobased composite material that would work well for musical instruments. Blackbird worked with Entropy Resins to develop Ekoa, and released the first production musical instrument in 2013. Joe Luttwak of Blackbird and  Desi Banatao of Entropy formed a separate company, Lingrove, LLC, to further develop Ekoa and expand applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lingrove - How it all started|url=http://lingrove.com/our-story-page/|publisher=Lingrove|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttwak filed for a patent for "METHOD FOR MAKING LIGHT AND STIFF PANELS AND STRUCTURES USING NATURAL FIBER COMPOSITES" on November 18, 2014, which was given A1 Kind Code status on May 15, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent Application 20150135930 |url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=20150135930&amp;OS=20150135930&amp;RS=20150135930 |publisher=United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office |accessdate=24 September 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingrove filed "Ekoa" as a registered trademark on November 12, 2013. The trademark was registered on February 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EKOA - Trademark Details|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/861/16/ekoa-86116937.html|publisher=Justia Trademarks|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark is registered under two separate classes: 015 - Musical instruments, and 024 - Textiles and textile goods, not included in other classes; bed and table covers.

==Applications==
Ekoa was initially developed to combine the tone of wooden instruments with the durability of a composite instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio-prepreg guitar: The look, feel and acoustic quality of wood|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/bi-prepreg-guitar-the-look-feel-and-acoustic-quality-of-wood-|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, composite instruments had been made with carbon fiber, glass fiber, or aluminum to achieve durability, but these materials did not have the same tonality of wood. To address this, Ekoa utilizes [[flax]] fibers and produces a tone more like wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anaheim debut for Blackbird's El Capitan Ekoa acoustic guitar|url=http://www.gizmag.com/blackbird-el-capitan-ekoa-acoustic-guitar/35747/|publisher=GizMag|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first musical instrument product made of Ekoa was the Blackbird Clara concert ukulele, which has won a variety of awards in the composites industry, including at The Composites And Advanced Material Expo (CAMX), JEC Americas, and Industrial Designers Society of America's IDEA Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out the Competition: Visit the Awards Pavilion at The Composites And Advanced Material Expo (CAMX)|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ace-and-camx-awards-nominees-announced|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights from JEC Americas|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/blog/post/highlights-from-jec-americas|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 IDSA IDEA Award - Bronze - Entertainment - Blackbird Clara Ukulele|url=http://www.idsa.org/awards/idea/entertainment/blackbird-clara-ukulele|publisher=Industrial Designers Society of America|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackbird later introduced the El Capitan guitar model, also made with Ekoa.

For sports equipment, RockWest Composites has produced a bicycle frame in conjunction with Calfee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ekoa Bike Frame - Get A Matching Guitar And Bike |url=http://macnichol.com/forum-post/8169 |publisher=MacNichol, Inc. |accessdate=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926044235/http://macnichol.com/forum-post/8169 |archivedate=26 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a lacrosse stick with a hexagonal shape core wrapped in Ekoa twill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Fiber + EKOA Lacrosse Stick |url=http://www.rockwestcomposites.com/products/45412ek-attack |publisher=Rock West Composites |accessdate=24 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926032650/http://www.rockwestcomposites.com/products/45412ek-attack |archivedate=26 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Uruguay''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Uruguay]]. 
==Overview==
Historically, energy has been a stronghold of state-owned companies, such as [[UTE]] and [[ANCAP (Uruguay)|ANCAP]].

The National Directorate of Energy ({{lang-es|Dirección Nacional de Energía}}) is the main governmental body in charge of energy policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dne.gub.uy/ DNE] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay is notable for its use of renewable energies, which nowadays provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity and 55% of the country's total [[energy mix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy |title=Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy|publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8955">The Democratic Republic of the Congo was a net [[energy]] exporter in 2008. Most energy was consumed domestically in 2008. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] statistics the energy export was in 2008 small and less than from the [[Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 population figures were 3.8 million for the RC compared to CDR 67.8 Million. In both countries journalists and media were threatened by the authorities.&lt;ref name=AIReport2011&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [http://static.amnesty.org/air11/amnesty_international_report_2011_en.pdf ''Report 2011'']{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 2011 p. 123-126, population and mortality in country pages,population figures are for 2010 and Under-5 mortality figures are estimates for the period 2005-2010, both drawn from the [http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/swp/2010/swop_2010_eng.pdf UN Fund for Population Activities’ Demographic, Social and Economic Indicators].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] have influenced the energy markets and [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|economy]]. On 1 October 2010 the UN reported on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed within the DRC between March 1993 and June 2003. The report raised hopes of justice for crimes. In the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) are cases against using children under the age of 15 for the armed group and against ex Vice President [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] charged with crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=AIReport2011/&gt;

==Electricity==
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has reserves of [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], and a potential [[hydroelectric]] power generating capacity of around 100,000&amp;nbsp;MW. The [[Inga Dam]], alone on the [[Congo River]], has the potential capacity to generate 40,000 to 45,000&amp;nbsp;MW of electric power, sufficient to supply the electricity needs of the whole Southern Africa region. Ongoing uncertainties in the political arena, and a resulting lack of interest from investors has meant that the Inga dam's potential has been limited.

In 2001, the dam was estimated to have an installed generating capacity of 2,473&amp;nbsp;MW. It is estimated that the dam is capable of producing no more than 650–750&amp;nbsp;MW, because two-thirds of the facility's turbines do not work.  There are plans to raise the Inga power station to 44,000 MW capacity by 2010.  The African Development bank has agreed to supply $8 million towards it.  The government has also agreed to strength the Inga-kolwezi and Inga-South Africa interconnections and to construct a 2nd power line to supply power to Kinshasa.

If harvested to its full potential, the hydroelectricity could provide power for the whole of Africa {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In 2007, the DROC had a gross production of public and self-produced electricity of 8,302 million kWh.  The DROC imported 78 million kWh of electricity in 2007. The DROC is also an exporter of electric power. In 2003, electric power exports came to 1.3&amp;nbsp;TWh, with power transmitted to the [[Republic of Congo]] and its capital, [[Brazzaville]], as well as to [[Zambia]] and [[South Africa]]. There were plans to build the [[Western Power Corridor]] (Westcor) to supply electricity from [[Inga III]] hydroelectric power plant to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]].

The national power company is [[Société nationale d'électricité (SNEL)]].

Only 6% of the country has access to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/rankings/electrification_by_country_2007_2008.html Electrification by Country 2007/2008 - Country Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, 98.2% of electricity was produced by hydroelectric power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=cd&amp;product=hydro&amp;graph=production+consumption&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydro electric.png]]

==Petroleum==
The DROC has [[crude oil]] reserves that are second only to [[Angola]]'s in southern Africa.  As of 2009, the DROC’s crude oil reserves came to {{convert|180|Moilbbl|m3}}.  In 2008, the DROC produced {{convert|19960|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day and consumed {{convert|11000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.  As of 2007, the DROC exported {{convert|20090|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} and imported {{convert|11350|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

In 2007, the DROC produced 836,000 metric tons of crude petroleum, exported 836,000 metric tons and had a reserve of 25,000,000 metric tons. The DROC had no refining capacity as of January 1, 2005, and must import refined petroleum products. In 2002, imports of refined petroleum products totaled {{convert|8180|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

Oil product imports consist of [[gasoline]], [[jet fuel]], [[kerosene]], aviation gas, fuel oil, and liquefied [[petroleum gas]]. Oil products are exported and imported by [[Cohydro]] and Dalbit Petroleum. Dalbit Petroleum is a Kenya based energy company that supplies products to Lubumbashi and North Eastern DRC.  As of 2008, the DROC had natural gas reserves of 991.1 million cu m.  There was no production, consumption or importation or exportation of natural gas.
Galaxy Moriah Oil is the government contracted supplier of oil for the DROC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=cd&amp;product=oil&amp;graph=production+consumption&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal==
As of July 2005, the DROC is reported to have [[coal]] reserves of 97&amp;nbsp;million short tons. Domestic coal production and consumption in 2003 totaled 0.11&amp;nbsp;million short tons and 0.26&amp;nbsp;million shorts tons, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=cd&amp;product=coal&amp;graph=production+consumption&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ICTs for climate change mitigation'''

One of the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]] is to make the benefits of new technologies - especially information and communications technologies (ICTs) – available to both industrialized nations and developing regions.  In light of these goals, several projects have been founded by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and other organisations in order to explore ICTs and climate change.

'''Climate Change Legislation'''

DRC has no national climate change policy and strategy which can present the DRC’s current and future efforts to effectively address its climate change vulnerability and adaptation.  It currently relies on environment-related policies and action plans to implement climate change initiatives and activities.  Nevertheless, several NGOs and donor agencies have been active in the DRC to develop an administrative structure to address the needs of environmental protection and natural resources management.

The DRC is in a very high level sun belt that makes the installation of photovoltaic systems and the use of thermal solar systems viable throughout the country. Currently there are 836 solar power systems, with a total power of 83&amp;nbsp;kW, located in Equateur (167), Katanga (159), Nord-Kivu (170), the two Kasaï provinces (170), and Bas-Congo (170). There is also the 148 Caritas network system, with a total power of 6.31 kW7. The potential for further solar development is high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/58927/scaling-up-renewable-energy-in-africa-democratic-republic-of-congo Scaling-up renewable energy in Africa: Democratic Republic of Congo, June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DRC has a wide diversity of natural resources, allowing it to consider a significant growth in hydro, wind and solar energy.  It has been called "a virtual continent."  For the first time in Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has adopted an interactive atlas of [[renewable energy]] sources.

This Atlas was created by the UNDP, Netherlands Development Organization SNV, and the Congolese Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity.  It has 600 interactive maps and informs policymaking on decentralizing energy and encourages further renewable energy investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/09/23/en-rd-congo-un-atlas-pour-d-velopper-l-nergie-renouvelable.html In DRC, an Atlas to boost renewable energies.

In [[open channel flow]], [[specific energy]] (&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;) is the energy length, or head, relative to the channel bottom.  Specific energy is expressed in terms of [[kinetic energy]], and [[potential energy]], and [[internal energy]].  The [[Bernoulli's equation|Bernoulli equation]], which originates from a control volume analysis, is used to describe specific energy relationships in [[fluid dynamics]].  The form of Bernoulli’s equation discussed here assumes the flow is incompressible and steady.  The three energy components in Bernoulli's equation are elevation, [[pressure]] and [[velocity]].  However, since with open channel flow, the water surface is open to the [[atmosphere]], the pressure term between two points has the same value and is therefore ignored. Thus, if the specific energy and the velocity of the flow in the channel are known, the depth of flow can be determined. This relationship can be used to calculate changes in depth upstream or downstream of changes in the channel such as steps, constrictions, or control structures. It is also the fundamental relationship used in the [[standard step method]] to calculate how the depth of a flow changes over a reach from the energy gained or lost due to the slope of the channel.

==Introduction==

With the pressure term neglected, energy exists in two forms, [[Potential energy|potential]] and [[Kinetic energy|kinetic]].  Assuming all the fluid particles are moving at the same velocity, the general expression for kinetic energy applies (&lt;var&gt;KE&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;½mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;).  This general expression can be written in terms of kinetic energy per [[unit weight]] of fluid,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathit{KE}}{\textrm{weight}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2}{\gamma V} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\bigl(\rho V\bigr)v^2}{\rho g V}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1)

:{|
|Where: || &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt; = mass
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; = fluid velocity (length/time)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;V&lt;/var&gt; = volume (length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;ρ&lt;/var&gt; = fluid density (mass/volume)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt; = [[specific weight]] of water (weight/unit volume)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt; = [[acceleration]] due to [[gravity]] (length/time&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}

The kinetic energy, in feet, is represented as the [[velocity head]],

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{KE}=\frac{v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(2)

The fluid particles also have potential energy, which is associated with the fluid elevation above an arbitrary datum.  For a fluid of weight (&lt;var&gt;ρg&lt;/var&gt;) at a height &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; above the established datum, the potential energy is &lt;var&gt;wy&lt;/var&gt;.  Thus, the potential energy per unit weight of fluid can be expressed as simply the height above the datum,

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathit{PE}}{\rho g} = y&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(3)

Combining the energy terms for kinetic and potential energies along with influences due to pressure and headloss, results in the following equation:

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_1^2}{2g}+y_1+\frac{P_1}{\gamma}-h_f = \frac{v_2^2}{2g}+y_2+\frac{P_2}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4)

:{|
|Where: || &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; = the vertical distance from the datum (length)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; = pressure (weight/volume)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; = headloss due to friction (length)
|}

As the fluid moves downstream, energy is lost due to friction.  These losses can be due to channel bed roughness, channel constrictions, and other flow structures.  Energy loss due to friction is neglected in this analysis.

Equation 4 evaluates the flow at two locations: point 1 (upstream) and point 2 (downstream).  As mentioned previously, the pressure at locations 1 and 2 both equal [[atmospheric pressure]] in open-channel flow, therefore the pressure terms cancel out.  Headloss due to friction is also neglected when determining specific energy; therefore this term disappears as well.  After these cancelations, the equation becomes,

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_1^2}{2g}+y_1 = \frac{v_2^2}{2g}+y_2&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(5)

and the total specific energy at any point in the system is,

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{v^2}{2g}+y&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(6)

===Volumetric discharge===

To evaluate the kinetic-energy term, the fluid velocity is needed.  The volumetric discharge, &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt; is typically used in open channel flow calculations.  For rectangular channels, the unit discharge is also used, and many alternative formulas for rectangular channels use this term instead of &lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; or &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt;.  In US customary units, &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt; is in ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/sec. and &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; is in ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sec.

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{Q}{b}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(7)

:{|
|Where: || &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; = unit discharge (length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/time)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt; = volumetric discharge (length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/time)
|-
| || &lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt; = base width of rectangular channel (length)
|}

Equation 6 can then be rewritten for rectangular channels as,

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{q^2}{2gy^2}+y&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(8)

==The E–y diagram==

For a given discharge, the specific energy can be calculated for various flow depths and plotted on an E–y diagram.  A typical E–y diagram is shown below.

&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:EYDiagram-General.png|400px|alt=E–Y Diagram]]

Three different &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; values are plotted on the specific energy diagram above.  The unit discharges increase from left to right, meaning that &lt;var&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &lt; &lt;var&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &lt; &lt;var&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;.  There is a distinct [[asymptotic]] relationship as the top part of the curve approaches the &lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; line and the bottom part of the curve tends toward the &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;-axis.  Also shown are the critical energy or minimum energy, &lt;var&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and the corresponding critical depth value, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;.  The values shown are for the &lt;var&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; discharge only, but unique critical values exist for any discharge.

===Critical flow relationships===

The [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Critical Flow|critical depth]] value mentioned in the E–y diagram section above is mathematically represented by the ratio of the fluid velocity to the velocity of a small amplitude [[gravity wave]].  This ratio is called the [[Froude number]].

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(9)

The critical depth has a Froude number equal to one and corresponds to the minimum energy a flow can possess for a given discharge.  Not all flows are critical, so what about Froude numbers not equal to one?  Froude numbers below one are considered [[subcritical]] and Froude numbers above one are considered [[Supercritical flow|supercritical]].

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr} = 1; \; \textit{Critical}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(10)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr} &lt; 1; \; \textit{Subcritical}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(11)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr} &gt; 1; \; \textit{Supercritical}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(12)

Physically, subcritical flow is deep and the velocities are slow.  This means subcritical flow has high potential energy and low kinetic energy.  Supercritical flow on the other hand tends to be shallow and the velocities are fast.  Supercritical flow has low potential energy and high kinetic energy.

If we refer back to the E–y diagram, it is seen that a line passes through the critical value on each successive discharge curve.  This line corresponds to &lt;math&gt;y = 2/3E&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:EYDiagram-IncrDischarges.png|400px|alt=E–Y diagram for increasing discharge]]
[[File:EYDiagram-SSCritical.png|400px|alt=E–Y Diagram showing super- and sub-critical flow regions]]

Depth values on the E–y curve greater than the critical depth correspond to subcritical flow depths.  Likewise, values less than the critical depth correspond to supercritical flow depths.

For rectangular channels, the critical depth can be calculated by taking the [[derivative]] of the energy equation and setting it equal to zero.  The energy associated with the critical depth is found by placing the critical depth expression into the specific energy equation.  The critical energy expression is demonstrated graphically by the line &lt;math&gt;y_c = 2/3E_c&lt;/math&gt;, which connects critical depth values.

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dE}{dy} = \frac{d}{dy}\biggl(\frac{q^2}{2gy^2}+y\biggr) = 0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(13)

:&lt;math&gt;y_c = \biggl(\frac{q^2}{g}\biggr)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(14)

:&lt;math&gt;E_c = \frac{3}{2}y_c&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(15)

===Alternate depths===

&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:EYDiagram-AltDepths.png|400px|alt=E–Y diagram illustrating alternate depths for a given specific energy]]

For a given energy value and discharge, there generally exists two possible corresponding flow depths. In the diagram above, the alternate depths are labeled &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and correspond to the subcritical and supercritical flow regions, respectively. This holds true for all energy values greater than critical energy. This relationship does not hold true at critical energy where only the critical depth, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;, is possible and for energy values less than critical depth’s energy where there are no positive depths. The following equation can be used to solve for one alternate depth in terms of the other in rectangular channels. The values for &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; are interchangeable.

:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8gy_1^3}{q^2}}}=\frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8}{{Fr_1}^2}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(16)

====Theory and derivation of alternate depth relationship====

In the open-channel flow of rectangular channels, the alternate depth equation relates the upstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) and downstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) steady-state flow depths of a flow that encounters a control device, such as a sluice gate, which conserves energy for a given discharge.

The alternate depth equation can be derived in a similar fashion as the conjugate depth equation. In the open-channel flow of rectangular channels, the conjugate depth equation relates the upstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) and downstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) steady-state flow depths for a flow that encounters a pure hydraulic jump, which conserves momentum for a given discharge. The [[Hydraulic Jumps in Rectangular Channels#Conjugate depths relationships|mathematical derivation of the conjugate depth equation]] can be a useful tool in understanding the derivation of the alternate depth equation, please refer to the above link for a more in-depth discussion of its derivation.

=====Conjugate depth equation=====

:&lt;math&gt;y_2=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(17)

====Duality relationship between momentum and specific energy functions and the derivation of the alternate depth relationship====
Another important concept that can be applied towards the derivation the alternate depth equation arises from the comparison of the dimensionless momentum function to the dimensionless specific energy function. It can be seen that the dimensionless momentum function (&lt;var&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) has the identical functional relationship as the dimensionless specific energy function (&lt;var&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) when both are properly transformed. (Henderson 1966). From this comparison it can be observed that any result that applies to the dimensionless momentum equation (&lt;var&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) would likewise apply to the dimensionless specific energy equation (&lt;var&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;). From this duality concept we can determine the analog to the conjugate depth equation for the specific energy equation to provide an analytical relationship between alternate depths &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;. Below gives the mathematical derivations behind this concept:

====Dimensionless momentum function====
:1) Starting with the momentum function for a rectangular channel:

::&lt;math&gt;{M}=\frac{q^2}{gy}+ \frac{y^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(18)

:2) Divide through by (&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; ) to obtain [[Dimensionless momentum-depth relationship in open-channel flow|dimensionless form]]:
 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M}{y_c^2} = \frac{q^2}{gyy_c^2} + \frac{y^2}{2y_c^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(19)

:3) Setting &lt;math&gt;M'= \frac{M}{y_c^2}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;y' = \frac{y}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;, and making the substitution for &lt;math&gt;q^2 = gy_c^3&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;M'= \frac{1}{y'} + \frac{y'^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(20)

====Dimensionless specific-energy function====
:1) Starting with the specific-energy function for a rectangular channel:

::&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{q^2}{2gy^2}+y&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(8)

:2) Divide through by &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;  to obtain dimensionless form:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{E}{y_c} = \frac{y}{y_c} + \frac{q^2}{2gy^2y_c}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(21)

:3) Where &lt;math&gt;E'= \frac{E}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;y' = \frac{y}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;, and making the substitution for &lt;math&gt;q^2 = gy_c^3&lt;/math&gt; :

::&lt;math&gt; E' = y' + \frac{1}{2y'^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(22)

:4) Setting &lt;math&gt;y''= \frac{1}{y'} = \frac{y_c}{y}&lt;/math&gt;  and substituting into equation (22) we find the final dimensionless form of the specific-energy function:

::&lt;math&gt;E''= \frac{1}{y''} + \frac{y''^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(23)

Through the comparison of the dimensionless momentum and specific-energy functions it can be observed that our final dimensionless specific-energy equation is identical to the functional relationship as was determined for the dimensionless-momentum equation:

::&lt;math&gt;M'= \frac{1}{y'} + \frac{y'^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E''= \frac{1}{y''} + \frac{y''^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(20, 23)

Therefore, any result that applies to the dimensionless-momentum equation would likewise apply to the dimensionless specific-energy equation, provided the  transform is used.

====Derivation of alternate depth equation====
Using the [[The Momentum-Depth Relationship in a Rectangular Channel#Conjugate Depths in a Rectangular Channel|conjugate depth]] equation and the duality concept between the dimensionless forms of the momentum (&lt;var&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) and specific energy (&lt;var&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) functions an analytical relationship between alternate depths can be obtained.

:1) Start with the [[The Momentum-Depth Relationship in a Rectangular Channel#Conjugate Depths in a Rectangular Channel|conjugate depth equation]] (eq. 17):

::&lt;math&gt;y_2=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8 \mathit{Fr}_1^2}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;var&gt;Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the Froude number at location 1

:2) Develop the analog to &lt;var&gt;Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; by observing that the dimensionless momentum equation (eq. 20) has a value of &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt; equal to unity at critical depth. If we chose &lt;math&gt;q=\sqrt{g}&lt;/math&gt; then the resulting M-y relationship will be numerically identical to the dimensionless &lt;var&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt; relationship since &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;  is unity. For this unit discharge q, the Froude number simplifies to:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr}_{\left(q=\sqrt{g}\right)} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}} = \frac{q}{\sqrt{gy^3}} = \frac{\sqrt{g}}{\sqrt{gy^3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y^3}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(24)

:3) Although dimensionally &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;"&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt; are different, their numerical magnitudes are the same at unity and thus we can express the analog of the &lt;var&gt;Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; in the conjugate depth equation as:

::&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathit{Fr}_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y''^3}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(25)

:where the tilde in the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathit{Fr}_1}&lt;/math&gt; symbol indicates that this is simply the specific-energy equation analog to the Froude number in this analysis.

:4) Substituting &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mathit{Fr}_1}&lt;/math&gt;  into the dimensionless conjugate depth equation and recalling  &lt;math&gt;y''= \frac{1}{y'} = \frac{y_c}{y}&lt;/math&gt;  for both &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;  and  &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;y''_2=\frac{y''_1}{2}\left(-1+ \sqrt{1+\frac{8} {(y_1'')^3}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(26)

:5) Observing that &lt;math&gt;y_2= \frac{y_c}{y_2''}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(y_1''\right)^3 = \left(\frac{y_c}{y_1}\right)^3 = \frac{q^2}{gy_1^3}&lt;/math&gt;  , equation (26) can be simplified to the final analytical alternate depth relationship:
::&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8gy_1^3}{q^2}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(27)

:6) Recalling that for rectangular channels, &lt;math&gt;y_c=\left(\frac{q^2}{g}\right)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Fr = \frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}} = \frac{q}{y\sqrt{gy}}&lt;/math&gt; and recognizing that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Fr}^2=\left(\frac{y_c}{y}\right)^3 = \frac{q^2}{gy^3}&lt;/math&gt; , the final analytical alternative depth relationship can also be represented as:

::&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8gy_1^3}{q^2}}}=\frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8}{{\mathit{Fr}_1}^2}}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(16)

Notice that because of the symmetry of the original conjugate depth equation, the resulting dimensionless alternate depth equation applies regardless of the Froude number at location 1. That is, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; may correspond to either supercritical or subcritical flow conditions. The alternate depth relationship will yield the alternate depth to &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; corresponding to the opposite flow regime in either case.

To the best of the author’s knowledge, this final result for the alternate depth relationship appears in no textbook and is an original contribution by [http://filebox.vt.edu/users/moglen/index.html Dr. Glenn E. Moglen] of Virginia Tech and appears on this website through the assistance of Paul Le Bel and the CEE 5984 Open Channel Flow course at Virginia Tech.

===Example===
The concept of alternate depths can be demonstrated with a [[Sluice|sluice gate]] example. Sluice gates are used to control the flow of water in open channels and under ideal conditions, where friction is ignored, they conserve energy for a given discharge.

Water flows in a rectangular channel that contains a sluice gate. The upstream depth of flow, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;  is 5.0&amp;nbsp;ft, the sluice gate opening is 1.0&amp;nbsp;ft, and the unit discharge is, &lt;math&gt;q = 10.\frac{\textrm{ft}^2}{\textrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the flow depth downstream of the sluice gate, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;?

&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:SluiceGateDiagram.png|alt=Diagram of Sluice Gate in Open Channel Flow]]

Since energy is conserved at a sluice gate, the upstream and downstream energies are equal, or &lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2&lt;/math&gt;. The specific energy equation (eq. 8), alternate depth equation (eq. 16), and an E–y diagram are used to demonstrate how to solve this problem.

:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8gy_1^3}{q^2}}}= \frac{2(5.0\,\mathrm{ft})}{-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{8(32.2\frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}^2})(5.0\,\mathrm{ft})^3}{\left(10\frac{\mathrm{ft}^2}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2}}}=0.59\,\mathrm{ft}&lt;/math&gt;

Compare specific energies at upstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) and downstream(&lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) depths to demonstrate conservation of energy (&lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2&lt;/math&gt;) at a sluice gate:

:&lt;math&gt;E_1 = y_1 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_1^2} = 5.0\,\mathrm{ft} + \frac{\left(10\frac{\mathrm{ft}^2}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2}{2\left(32.2\frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}^2}\right)(5.0\,\mathrm{ft})^2} = 5.06\,\mathrm{ft}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_2 = y_2 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_2^2} = 0.59\,\mathrm{ft} + \frac{\left(10\frac{\mathrm{ft}^2}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^2}{2\left(32.2\frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}^2}\right)(0.59\,\mathrm{ft})^2} = 5.06\,\mathrm{ft}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2=5.06\,\mathrm{ft}&lt;/math&gt; and energy is conserved.

The '''European Nuclear Energy Tribunal''' ('''ENET''') is an international tribunal, established 1 January 1960, that operates under the auspices of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).  Its member states are [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

The purpose of the tribunal is to hear cases concerning liability over nuclear accidents. Formerly it also had the role of hearing cases concerning the violation of the European regional nuclear safeguards system operated by the OECD but that jurisdiction was suspended in the 1970s due to its duplication of the [[IAEA]] and the [[Euratom]] systems.

The tribunal consists of seven judges appointed to five-year terms.

The judges appointed for the term of office commencing 24 May 2006 are: Dr. Peter Baumann (Austria), Ms. Mia Wouters (Belgium), Mr. Olivier Talevski (Denmark), Ms. Marie-Claire Guyader (France), Professor Armin von Bogdandy (Germany), Mr. Engelbertus Albertus [Bert] Maan (Netherlands) and Professor Vaughan Lowe (United Kingdom).

The figure is an example of how a fracture surface of this material looks like. The strong fibers form bridges over the cracks before they fail at elongations around 0.7%, and thus prevent brittle rupture of the material at 0.05%, especially under [[thermal shock]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Krenkel, ed.:''Ceramic Matrix Composites'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-31361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows using this type of ceramics for [[heat shields]] applied for the re-entry of [[space vehicle]]s, for [[disk brakes]] and slide [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1712">In chemistry, a '''hydrochloride''' is an [[acid salt]] resulting, or regarded as resulting, from the reaction of [[hydrochloric acid]] with an organic [[base (chemistry)|base]] (e.g. an [[amine]]). An alternative name is '''chlorhydrate''', which comes from French. An archaic alternative name is '''muriate''', derived from hydrochloric acid's ancient name: muriatic acid.

For example, reacting [[pyridine]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) yields its hydrochloride salt, [[pyridinium chloride]]. The molecular formula is either written as C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N·HCl or as C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Uses==
Converting insoluble [[amine]]s into hydrochlorides is a common way to make them [[solubility|water-soluble]]. This characteristic is particularly desirable for substances used in medications.&lt;ref name=Stahl&gt;P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor): ''Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use'', 2. Ed., Wiley, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-90639-051-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Pharmacopoeia]] lists more than 200 hydrochlorides as active ingredients in medications.&lt;ref&gt;European Pharmacopoeia 7th Edition 2011, EDQM.&lt;/ref&gt; These hydrochlorides, compared to free bases, may more readily dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract and be able to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly. In addition, many hydrochlorides of amines have a longer shelf-life than their respective free bases.

==History==
The first suggestions for an international renewable agency is based on the 1980 [[Brandt Report]] activities. NGOs and industry lobbying groups like [[Eurosolar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosolar.de0/de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=298&amp;Itemid=85 EUROSOLAR-Memorandum zur Einrichtung einer Internationalen Agentur für Erneuerbare Energien (IRENA)]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Council for Renewable Energy]] (WCRE) and the [[World Wind Energy Association]] have promoted IRENA since several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=68|title=World Wind Energy Association|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031102718/http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=68|archive-date=31 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Austrian government of [[Franz Vranitzky]] suggested a reneweables agency to the UN.&lt;ref name=lw/&gt; One of the drivers was [[Hermann Scheer]], a German politician and lobbyist which was acting as president of [[Eurosolar|EUROSOLAR]] and chair of WCRE.&lt;ref name=lw&gt;[http://www.wcre.de/en/images/stories/pdf/irena_chronologie.pdf The long Road to IRENA- A chronology, by Hermann Scheer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719113248/http://www.wcre.de/en/images/stories/pdf/irena_chronologie.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, at their annual event, the WWEA gave their 2010 World Wind Energy Award to the Founding member States of IRENA. They stated: "The creation of IRENA can be seen as the most important decision ever taken on the global level in favour of renewable energy. The founding of IRENA sent out a very strong signal to the world community that renewable energy will have to play and will play a key role in the future energy supply all over the world. With the Award, WWEA would also like to indicate that WWEA is committed to work closely with IRENA and will continue to give its full support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=269&amp;Itemid=40|title=World Wind Energy Association|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411120515/http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=269&amp;Itemid=40|archive-date=11 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, several meetings took place to discuss the formation of IRENA. The Preparatory Conference for founding IREA was held on 10 and 11 April 2008 with 54&amp;nbsp;countries participating. Here, government representatives discussed the objectives, activities, finances, and organizational structure of IRENA. Participants expressed a need to begin a swift transition to a more secure, sustainable renewable energy economy with the assistance of an international body.&lt;ref name="ren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52254|title=Renewable Energy News|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founding Conference of the International Renewable Energy Agency was held in [[Bonn]], Germany, on 26 January 2009. 75 countries signed the Agency's statute. The statute entered into force on 8 July 2010, 30 days after the 25th country deposited its instrument of ratification. The Founding Conference established the Preparatory Commission for IRENA, which consists of all signatory states.

During the first session of the Preparatory Commission in Bonn on 27 January 2009, the signatory countries adopted criteria and procedures for selecting IRENA's Interim Director-General and its interim headquarters. An Administrative Committee was created to assist the Commission in preparing its second session. The Administrative Committee prepared draft proposals for an interim work programme and budget as well as for interim staff regulations and interim financial rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=102 |title=Preparatory Commission of IRENA |access-date=13 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428185550/http://www.irena.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=102 |archive-date=28 April 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominations for the Interim Director-General and the interim headquarters were submitted by 30 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second session of the Preparatory Commission met in [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], [[Egypt]], on 29–30 June 2009, to elect the Interim Director General and decide the location of IRENA's [[interim]] headquarters. It was decided, that the interim headquarters will be located in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. The UAE thus became the first developing country to host a major international organisation. In addition, an innovation and technology center will be located in Bonn, and an office dedicated to liaising with the [[United Nations]] and other international institutions will be located in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=gulf1&gt;

The agency has staged a number of events bringing together member states for interaction on ways and means of furthering renewable energy, and conducted significant research and development into viable solutions for the future. On 8 September 2014, IRENA published a notable report on its works titled ''REthinking energy'', which encouraged "speedier adoption of renewable energy technologies," as "the most feasible route to reduce carbon emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change." The study set out to gauge the global power sector and establish how technological advances, economic growth and climate change are transforming it. "A convergence of social, economic and environmental forces are transforming the global energy system as we know it. But if we continue on the path we are currently on and fuel our growing economies with outmoded ways of thinking and acting, we will not be able avoid the most serious impacts of climate change," Director-General Amin said at a function to release the report.&lt;ref name="REthinkingEnergy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedier adoption of renewable energy mooted to offset climate change|url=http://www.abudhabinews.net/index.php/sid/225556185|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=10 September 2014|publisher=''Abu Dhabi News.Net''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195150/http://www.abudhabinews.net/index.php/sid/225556185|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Meeting of International Renewable Energy Agency Council was held on 10–11 June 2015 at Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India to be the Chair at 9th Meeting of IRENA at Abu Dhabi in June|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/04/india-to-be-the-chair-at-9th-meeting-of-irena-at-abu-dhabi-in-june/|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=11 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712194737/http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/04/india-to-be-the-chair-at-9th-meeting-of-irena-at-abu-dhabi-in-june/|archive-date=12 July 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
IRENA aims to become the main driving force in promoting a transition towards the use of renewable energy on a global scale:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Acting as the global voice for renewable energies, IRENA will provide practical advice and support for both industrialised and developing countries, help them improve their regulatory frameworks and build capacity. The agency will facilitate access to all relevant information including reliable data on the potential of renewable energy, best practices, effective financial mechanisms and state-of-the-art technological expertise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IRENA provides advice and support to governments on [[renewable energy policy]], capacity building, and technology transfer. IRENA will also co-ordinate with existing renewable energy organizations, such as [[REN21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=40|title=World Wind Energy Association|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411121433/http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=40|archive-date=11 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member states==
As of October 2018, 159 states and the [[European Union]] are members of IRENA, and a further 26 are in the process of accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/irenamembership |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107232939/http://www.irena.org/irenamembership# |archive-date=7 January 2018 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations==
{{quote|Various UN organisations work in the field of renewable energy. But IRENA is the only one dedicated to the promotion of 100% renewable energy worldwide. IRENA and the UN will join forces to speed up the transformation of the global energy sector.}}

Hélène Pelosse, former Interim Director General of IRENA, met with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] during 2009 Climate week in [[New York City]], and together with Mr Ban explored future fields of cooperation between IRENA and various UN bodies. IRENA also seeks to cooperate with the UN and associated organisations like the [[United Nations University]], UNESCO, the [[World Bank]], GEF, [[UNIDO]], [[UNDP]], [[UNEP]], and [[WTO]] in the areas of education and training, financing, access to energy, potential studies and trade.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Director-General==
The first director-general of IRENA is the current Director General [[Adnan Z. Amin]]. He was elected to the post in April 2011. He previously spent more than 25 years in the development of international environment and sustainable development policy, and worked in political, management, and interagency coordination areas of the United Nations. He was Head of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) Secretariat.&lt;ref name="IRENAstates"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global support for International Renewable Energy Agency growing fast|url=http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/225578647|date=10 September 2014|accessdate=10 September 2014|publisher=''Big News Network.com''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002500/http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/225578647|archive-date=11 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''James Cook''' {{postnominals|FRS|country=GBR|size=100%}} (7 November 1728&lt;ref group="NB"&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old style date]]: 27 October&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the [[Royal Navy]]. Cook made detailed maps of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the first recorded [[circumnavigation]] of [[New Zealand]].

Cook joined the British [[merchant navy]] as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]] and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|siege of Quebec]]. This helped bring Cook to the attention of the [[Admiralty]] and [[Royal Society]]. This acclaim came at a crucial moment in both Cook's career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of {{ship|HM Bark|Endeavour}} for the first of three Pacific voyages.

In three voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved. As he progressed on his voyages of discovery, he surveyed and named features, and he recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage, and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.

Cook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific while [[Kidnapping of Kalaniʻōpuʻu by Captain James Cook|attempting to kidnap]] [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu]], a [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] chief, in order to reclaim a [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] stolen from one of his ships.  He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which influenced his successors well into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him.

==Early life and family==
James Cook was born on 7 November 1728 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]) in the village of [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] in [[Yorkshire]] and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the [[parish church]] of [[Marton, Middlesbrough#St Cuthbert's Church|St Cuthbert]], where his name can be seen in the church register.&lt;ref name="Rigby25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robson|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second of eight children of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from [[Ednam]] in [[Roxburghshire]], and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from [[Thornaby-on-Tees]].&lt;ref name="Rigby25"&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collingridge"&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at [[Great Ayton]], where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, [[Roseberry Topping]], enjoying the opportunity for solitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooks' Cottage]], his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in [[Melbourne]], Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.&lt;ref name="horwitz" /&gt;

In 1745, when he was 16, Cook moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the fishing village of [[Staithes]], to be apprenticed as a shop boy to grocer and [[haberdasher]] William Sanderson.&lt;ref name="Rigby25" /&gt; Historians have speculated that this is where Cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out of the shop window.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt;

After 18 months, not proving suitable for shop work, Cook travelled to the nearby port town of [[Whitby]] to be introduced to friends of Sanderson's, John and Henry Walker.&lt;ref name="horwitz" /&gt; The Walkers, who were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade. Their house is now the [[Captain Cook Memorial Museum]]. Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Freelove'', and he spent several years on this and various other [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]], sailing between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and London. As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]—all skills he would need one day to command his own ship.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Batts Cook.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Batts Cook|Elizabeth Cook]], by William Henderson, 1830]]

His three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on trading ships in the [[Baltic Sea]]. After passing his examinations in 1752, he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his promotion in that year to [[Master's mate|mate]] aboard the collier [[brig]] ''Friendship''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, within a month of being offered command of this vessel, he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy, when Britain was re-arming for what was to become the [[Seven Years' War]]. Despite the need to start back at the bottom of the naval hierarchy, Cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the Navy at [[Wapping]] on 17 June 1755.&lt;ref name="Rigby27"&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook married [[Elizabeth Batts Cook|Elizabeth Batts]], the daughter of Samuel Batts, [[Public house#Inns|keeper]] of the Bell Inn in Wapping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet22JamesCookDickTurpin.pdf|title=Famous 18th&amp;nbsp;century people in Barking and Dagenham: James Cook and Dick Turpin|publisher=London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|accessdate=5 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124552/http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet22JamesCookDickTurpin.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his mentors, on 21 December 1762 at [[St Margaret's Church, Barking]], [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robson|2009|pp=120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had six children: James (1763–1794), Nathaniel (1764–1780, lost aboard {{HMS|Thunderer|1760|6}} which foundered with all hands in a hurricane in the [[West Indies]]), Elizabeth (1767–1771), Joseph (1768–1768), George (1772–1772) and Hugh (1776–1793, who died of scarlet fever while a student at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]). When not at sea, Cook lived in the [[East End of London]]. He attended [[St Paul's Church, Shadwell]], where his son James was baptised. Cook has no direct descendants—all of his children died before having children of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start of Royal Navy career==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}

Cook's first posting was with {{HMS|Eagle|1745|6}}, serving as [[Able seaman (rank)#Royal Navy|able seaman]] and [[master's mate]] under Captain Joseph Hamar for his first year aboard, and Captain [[Hugh Palliser]] thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Captain Cook's War and Peace: The Royal Navy Years 1755–1768|first=John|last=Robson|year=2009|pages=19–25|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|isbn=978-1742231099}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October and November 1755, he took part in ''Eagle'''s capture of one French warship and the sinking of another, following which he was promoted to [[boatswain]] in addition to his other duties.&lt;ref name="Rigby27" /&gt; His first temporary command was in March 1756 when he was briefly master of ''Cruizer'', a small cutter attached to ''Eagle'' while on patrol.&lt;ref name="Rigby27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1757 Cook formally passed his [[Master (naval)|master]]'s examinations at [[Trinity House]], [[Deptford]], qualifying him to navigate and handle a ship of the King's fleet.&lt;ref name="G_Williams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/captaincook_01.shtml|title=Captain Cook: Explorer, Navigator and Pioneer|first=Glyn|last=Williams|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=5 September 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the frigate {{HMS|Solebay|1742|6}} as master under Captain Robert Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu62.htm|work=Life in the Royal Navy (1755–1767)|title=The Captain Cook Society: Cook's Log|first=Paul|last=Capper|date=1985–96|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland===
[[File:Cooks Karte von Neufundland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|James Cook's 1775 chart of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]]]

During the Seven Years' War, Cook served in North America as master aboard the [[fourth-rate]] Navy vessel {{HMS|Pembroke|1757|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|Dear|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; With others in ''Pembroke''{{'}}s crew, he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] from the French in 1758, and in the siege of [[Quebec City]] in 1759. Throughout his service he demonstrated a talent for [[surveying]] and [[cartography]] and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the siege, thus allowing [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]] to make his famous stealth attack during the 1759 [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's surveying ability was also put to use in mapping the jagged coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the 1760s, aboard {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}. He surveyed the northwest stretch in 1763 and 1764, the south coast between the [[Burin Peninsula]] and [[Cape Ray]] in 1765 and 1766, and the west coast in 1767. At this time, Cook employed local pilots to point out the "rocks and hidden dangers" along the south and west coasts. During the 1765 season, four pilots were engaged at a daily pay of 4 [[shilling]]s each: John Beck for the coast west of "[[St. Lawrence, Newfoundland and Labrador|Great St Lawrence]]", [[Morgan Snook]] for [[Fortune Bay]], John Dawson for Connaigre and [[Hermitage Bay]], and John Peck for the "[[Bay d'Espoir|Bay of Despair]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns/JamesCookInNewfoundland1762_1767.pdf|title=James Cook in Newfoundland 1762–1767|first=William|last=Whiteley|date=1975 |accessdate=27 August 2012 |work=Newfoundland Historical Society Pamphlet Number 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His five seasons in Newfoundland produced the first large-scale and accurate maps of the island's coasts and were the first scientific, large scale, hydrographic surveys to use precise triangulation to establish land outlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Captain_Cook_Monument_Corner_Brook.jpg|work=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada|title=Captain James Cook R.N.|last=Government of Canada|date=2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also gave Cook his mastery of practical surveying, achieved under often adverse conditions, and brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society at a crucial moment both in his career and in the direction of British overseas discovery. Cook's map were used into the 20th century, with copies being referenced by those sailing Newfoundland's waters for 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from his exertions in Newfoundland, Cook wrote that he intended to go not only "farther than any man has been before me, but as far as I think it is possible for a man to go".&lt;ref name="G_Williams" /&gt;

==Voyages of exploration==

===First voyage (1768–71)===
{{main|First voyage of James Cook}}

On 25 May 1768,&lt;ref name=kippis1&gt;{{cite book|title=Narrative of the voyages round the world, performed by Captain James Cook; with an account of his life during the previous and intervening periods|first=Andrew|last=Kippis|date=1788|at=Chapter 2 |url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/cook/james/c77n/chapter2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Admiralty commissioned Cook to command a scientific voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The purpose of the voyage was to observe and record the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the [[Sun]] which, when combined with observations from other places, would help to determine the distance of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook, at age 39, was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] to grant him sufficient status to take the command.&lt;ref name="Rigby30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911%20Encyclopædia%20Britannica/Cook,%20James Wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Cook, James]&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the Royal Society agreed that Cook would receive a one hundred [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]] gratuity in addition to his Naval pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=cix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endeavour replica in Cooktown harbour.jpg|left|thumb|[[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|''Endeavour'' replica]] in [[Cooktown, Queensland]] harbour&amp;nbsp;— anchored where the original ''Endeavour'' was beached for seven weeks in 1770]]

The expedition sailed aboard {{HMS|Endeavour||6}}, departing England on 26 August 1768.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16774546|title=The Sydney Morning Herald|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2 May 1931|accessdate=4 September 2012|page=12|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook and his crew rounded [[Cape Horn]] and continued westward across the Pacific, arriving [[Tahiti]] on 13 April 1769, where the [[1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti|observations of the Venus Transit]] were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cook_captain_james.shtml|title=BBC – History – Captain James Cook|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the result of the observations was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped. Once the observations were completed, Cook opened the sealed orders which were additional instructions from the Admiralty for the second part of his voyage: to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated rich southern continent of ''[[Terra Australis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Instructions to Captain Cook, 30 June 1768|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/nsw1_doc_1768.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cook then sailed to New Zealand and mapped the complete coastline, making only some minor errors. He then voyaged west, reaching the southeastern coast of Australia on 19 April 1770, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline.&lt;ref group="NB"&gt;At this time, the [[International Date Line]] had yet to be established, so the dates in Cook's journal are a day earlier than those accepted today.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April, he made his first recorded direct observation of [[indigenous Australians]] at [[Brush Island]] near [[Bawley Point, New South Wales|Bawley Point]], noting in his journal: "...and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach they appear'd to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes&lt;!--not a mistake, don't change it--&gt; they might have on I know not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700422.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 22 April 1770|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]]. Cook originally christened the area as "Stingray Bay", but later he crossed this out and named it "[[Botany Bay]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1473813|title=Pages From the Past|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|location=Melbourne|date=31 May 1919|accessdate=4 September 2012|page=20|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]]. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the [[Gweagal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308574533.html|title=Once were warriors – smh.com.au|accessdate=21 September 2011|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure from Botany Bay, he continued northwards. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as [[Seventeen Seventy, Queensland|Seventeen Seventy]]) on 23 May 1770. On 24 May, Cook and Banks and others went ashore. Continuing north, on 11 June a mishap occurred when HMS ''Endeavour'' ran aground on a shoal of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], and then "nursed into a river mouth on 18 June 1770".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robson|2004|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was badly damaged, and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern [[Cooktown, Queensland]], at the mouth of the [[Endeavour River]]).&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt; The voyage then continued and at about midday on 22 August 1770, they reached the northernmost tip of the coast and, without leaving the ship, Cook named it Cape York. Leaving the east coast, Cook turned west and nursed his battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of [[Torres Strait]]. Searching for a high vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on  a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see 'a passage into the Indian Seas'. He climbed the hill with three others, including Joseph Banks. On seeing a navigable passage, he signalled the good news down to the men on the ship, who cheered loudly.

Cook later wrote that he had claimed possession of the east coast when up on that hill, and named the place 'Possession Island'. However, the Admiralty's instructions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook Journals vol.1 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0851157443 |page=cclxxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not authorized Cook to annex [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (Australia) and therefore it is unlikely that any possession ceremony occurred that August. Importantly, Joseph Banks, who was standing beside Cook, does not mention any such episode or announcement in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Banks |first1=Joseph |title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks: 1768–1771. vol. 2 |date=1962 |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson |location=Sydney |isbn=978-1406800517 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cook re-wrote his journal  on his arrival in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (Jakarta) when he was confronted with the news that the Frenchman, [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Louis Bougainville]], had sailed across the Pacific the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=978-0648043966 |page=183, 190–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his revised journal entry, Cook wrote that he had claimed the entire coastline that he had just explored as British territory. He returned to England via [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] (modern [[Jakarta]], Indonesia), where many in his crew succumbed to [[malaria]], and then the [[Cape of Good Hope]], arriving at the island of [[Saint Helena]] on 12 July 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interlude===
Cook's journals were published upon his return, and he became something of a hero among the scientific community. Among the general public, however, the aristocratic botanist Joseph Banks was a greater hero.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt; Banks even attempted to take command of Cook's second voyage but removed himself from the voyage before it began, and [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and his son [[Georg Forster]] were taken on as scientists for the voyage. Cook's son George was born five days before he left for his second voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britain.docuwat.ch/videos/empire/captain-cook-obsession-discovery-part-1-of-4|title=Captain Cook: Obsession &amp; Discovery.

===Second voyage (1772–75)===
{{main|Second voyage of James Cook}}

Shortly after his return from the first voyage, Cook was promoted in August 1771 to the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, he was commissioned to lead another scientific expedition on behalf of the Royal Society, to search for the hypothetical Terra Australis. On his first voyage, Cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating New Zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south. Although he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia, showing it to be continental in size, the Terra Australis was believed to lie further south. Despite this evidence to the contrary, [[Alexander Dalrymple]] and others of the Royal Society still believed that a massive southern continent should exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Cook, English navigator, witnessing human sacrifice in Taihiti (Otaheite) c. 1773.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|James Cook witnessing human sacrifice in [[Tahiti]] c. 1773]]

Cook commanded {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} on this voyage, while [[Tobias Furneaux]] commanded its companion ship, {{HMS|Adventure|1771|6}}. Cook's expedition circumnavigated the globe at an extreme southern [[latitude]], becoming one of the first to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 17 January 1773. In the Antarctic fog, ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure'' became separated. Furneaux made his way to New Zealand, where he lost some of his men during an encounter with [[Māori people|Māori]], and eventually sailed back to Britain, while Cook continued to explore the Antarctic, reaching 71°10'S on 31 January 1774.&lt;ref name="G_Williams" /&gt;

Cook almost encountered the mainland of [[Antarctica]] but turned towards Tahiti to resupply his ship. He then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent. On this leg of the voyage, he brought a young Tahitian named [[Omai]], who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the Pacific than [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] had been on the first voyage. On his return voyage to New Zealand in 1774, Cook landed at the [[Tonga|Friendly Islands]], [[Easter Island]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]].

[[File:Cook-1777.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|James Cook's 1777 South-Up map of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]]]]

Before returning to England, Cook made a final sweep across the South Atlantic from [[Cape Horn]] and surveyed, mapped, and took possession for Britain of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], which had been explored by the English merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675. Cook also discovered and named [[Clerke Rocks]] and the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] ("Sandwich Land"). He then turned north to [[South Africa]] and from there continued back to England. His reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of Terra Australis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's second voyage marked a successful employment of [[Larcum Kendall#K1|Larcum Kendall's K1]] copy of [[John Harrison]]'s H4 [[marine chronometer]], which enabled Cook to calculate his longitudinal position with much greater accuracy. Cook's log was full of praise for this time-piece which he used to make charts of the southern Pacific Ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php|title=Captain James Cook: His voyages of exploration and the men that accompanied him|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=10 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421232853/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/package/30/links-cook.php|archivedate=21 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of [[post-captain]] and given an honorary retirement from the Royal Navy, with a posting as an officer of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]]. He reluctantly accepted, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise.&lt;ref name="Beaglehole"&gt;{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1974|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fame extended beyond the Admiralty; he was made a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] and awarded the [[Copley Medal|Copley Gold Medal]] for completing his second voyage without losing a man to [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name="Rigby79"&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|p=79|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]] painted his portrait; he dined with [[James Boswell]]; he was described in the [[House of Lords]] as "the first navigator in Europe".&lt;ref name="G_Williams" /&gt; But he could not be kept away from the sea. A third voyage was planned, and Cook volunteered to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. He travelled to the Pacific and hoped to travel east to the Atlantic, while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third voyage (1776–79)===
{{main|Third voyage of James Cook}}
[[File:James Cook, Waimea Kauai.JPG|left|thumb|A statue of James Cook stands in [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]], [[Kauai]] commemorating his first contact with the Hawaiian Islands at the town's harbour in January 1778]]

On his last voyage, Cook again commanded HMS ''Resolution'', while Captain [[Charles Clerke]] commanded {{HMS|Discovery|1774|6}}. The voyage was ostensibly planned to return the [[Pacific Islander]] [[Omai]] to Tahiti, or so the public was led to believe. The trip's principal goal was to locate a [[Northwest Passage]] around the American continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dropping Omai at Tahiti, Cook travelled north and in 1778 became the first European to begin formal contact with the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref name="Fish2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Shirley|last=Fish|title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons : The Treasure Ships of the Pacific: With An Annotated List of the Transpacific Galleons 1565–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk_iU0f-iT8C&amp;pg=PA360|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1456775438|pages=360–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his initial landfall in January 1778 at [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]] harbour, [[Kauai]], Cook named the [[archipelago]] the "Sandwich Islands" after the [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|fourth Earl of Sandwich]]—the acting [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Sandwich Islands, Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in [[Alta California]]. He made landfall on the [[Oregon]] coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point [[Cape Foulweather]]. Bad weather forced his ships south to about [[43rd parallel north|43° north]] before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|1999|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He unknowingly sailed past the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and soon after entered [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. He anchored near the [[First Nations]] village of [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]]. Cook's two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in what Cook called Ship Cove, now Resolution Cove,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bcgnis|18990|Resolution Cove|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the south end of [[Bligh Island (Canada)|Bligh Island]]. Relations between Cook's crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained. In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had worked in Hawaii. Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute. The most valuable items which the British received in trade were [[sea otter]] pelts. During the stay, the Yuquot "hosts" essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fisher|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American northwest coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the west) and Spanish (from the south) exploratory probes of the northern limits of the Pacific.&lt;ref name="G_Williams" /&gt;

[[File:John Cleveley the Younger, Views of the South Seas (No. 3 of 4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Discovery'' in Tahiti]]

By the second week of August 1778, Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the [[Chukchi Sea]]. He headed northeast up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice. His furthest north was 70 degrees 44 minutes. Cook then sailed west to the [[Siberia]]n coast, and then southeast down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the [[Bering Sea]] to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Captain James Cook|first=John Cawte|last=Beaglehole|date=1974|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=978-0713613827|pages=615–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat [[walrus]] meat, which they had pronounced inedible.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

===Return to Hawaii===
Cook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]], on [[Hawaii (island)|'Hawaii Island']], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]. Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]. Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt; Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[Apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono.&lt;ref name="Sahlins1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2nd ed"&gt;{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
{{Main|Kidnapping of Kalaniʻōpuʻu by Captain James Cook}}
[[File:Zoffany Death of Captain Cook.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779]]'', an unfinished painting by [[Johan Zoffany]], circa 1795.&lt;ref name="NMM – The Death of Captain James Cook"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=11 July 2012|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11916.html|title=The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779 – National Maritime Museum|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After a month's stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, the ''Resolution'''s foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.

Tensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay. An unknown group of Hawaiians took one of Cook's small boats. The evening when the cutter was taken, the people had become "insolent" even with threats to fire upon them.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere1997"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gananath|last=Obeyesekere|title=The Apotheosis of Captain Cook: European Mythmaking in the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7uMcVV0J-UC&amp;pg=PA310|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691057521|pages=310–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook attempted to kidnap and ransom the [[Alii Aimoku of Hawaii|King of Hawaiʻi]], [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu]].

The following day, 14 February 1779, Cook marched through the village to retrieve the king. Cook took the king ([[Ali'i|aliʻi nui]]) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favourite wives, [[Kanekapolei]], and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go. An old [[kahuna]] (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere1997" /&gt; As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the [[Breaking wave|surf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named [[Kalaimanokahoʻowaha]] or Kanaʻina (namesake of [[Charles Kana'ina]]) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa.&lt;ref name="Samwell(Jr)1791"&gt;{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Samwell|first2=Ebenezer (Jr)|last2=Townsend|first3=George|last3=Gilbert|author4=Hawaiian Historical Society|first5=Joseph|last5=Ingraham|first6=John|last6=Meares|first7=Bruce|last7=Cartwright|title=Extracts from Voyages Made in the Years 1788 and 1789, from China to the Northwest Coast of America: With an Introductory Narrative of a Voyage Performed in 1786, from Bengal in the Ship "Nootka".|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USMOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=1791|publisher=Paradise of the Pacific Press|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sheldon |last=Dibble|title=History of the Sandwich Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwqpkYKuXSMC|date=1843|publisher=Press of the Mission Seminary|authorlink=Sheldon Dibble|location=Lahainaluna|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass.

===Aftermath===
The esteem which the islanders nevertheless held for Cook caused them to retain his body. Following their practice of the time, they prepared his body with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest elders of the society. The body was [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], baked to facilitate [[Excarnation|removal of the flesh]], and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as [[Icon|religious icons]] in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the treatment of European saints in the [[Middle Ages]]. Some of Cook's remains, thus preserved, were eventually returned to his crew for a formal [[burial at sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerke assumed leadership of the expedition and made a final attempt to pass through the Bering Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of tuberculosis on 22 August 1779 and  [[John Gore (Royal Navy captain)|John Gore]], a veteran of Cook's first voyage, took command of  ''Resolution'' and of the expedition. [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]] replaced Gore in command of  ''Discovery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition returned home, reaching England in October 1780. After their arrival in England, King completed Cook's account of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/better-conceiv-d-than-describ-d-the-life-and-times-of-captain-james-king-1750-84-captain-cook-s-friend-and-colleague-steve-ragnall-2013|title=Better Conceiv’d than Describ’d: the life and times of Captain James King (1750–84), Captain Cook’s Friend and Colleague.

David Samwell, who sailed with Cook on ''Resolution'', wrote of him: "He was a modest man, and rather bashful; of an agreeable lively conversation, sensible and intelligent. In temper he was somewhat hasty, but of a disposition the most friendly, benevolent and humane. His person was above six feet high: and, though a good looking man, he was plain both in dress and appearance. His face was full of expression: his nose extremely well shaped: his eyes which were small and of a brown cast, were quick and piercing; his eyebrows prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USMOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80|page=20|title=A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook|first=David|last=Samwell|edition=Reprint|publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2011|date=1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic collections===

The [[Australian Museum]] acquired its "Cook Collection" in 1894 from the [[Government of New South Wales]]. At that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on Cook's three voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, during the period 1768–80, along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages. Many of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] artifacts were collected at a time of first contact between [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Peoples]] and [[Europeans]]. In 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the Mitchell Library in the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. The provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of Cook's widow Elizabeth Cook, and her descendants, until 1886. In this year John Mackrell, the great-nephew of [[Isaac Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Isaac Smith]], Elizabeth Cook's cousin, organised the display of this collection at the request of the NSW Government at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] in London. In 1887 the London-based [[Agent-General]] for the New South Wales Government, Saul Samuel, bought John Mackrell's items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives Reverend Canon Frederick Bennett, Mrs Thomas Langton, H.M.C. Alexander, and William Adams. The collection remained with the Colonial Secretary of NSW until 1894, when it was transferred to the Australian Museum.&lt;ref name="Thomsett, History of Acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomsett|first=Sue|title=Cook Collection, History of Acquisition|url=http://collections.australianmuseum.net.au/amweb/pages/am/NarrativeDisplay.php?irn=35&amp;QueryPage=./NarrativeQuery.php|work=Electronic Museum Narrative|publisher=Australian Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navigation and science===
Cook's 12 years sailing around the Pacific Ocean contributed much to European knowledge of the area. Several islands such as the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) were encountered for the first time by Europeans, and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the Pacific was a major achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5AqNKtDqX0C&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A voyage to the Pacific Ocean ... – Google Books|last1=Cook|first1=James|authorlink1=James Cook|last2=Clerke|first2=Charles|authorlink2=Charles Clerke|last3=Gore|first3=John|authorlink3=John Gore (Royal Navy captain)|last4=King|first4=James|authorlink4=James King (Royal Navy officer)|publisher=W. and A. Strahan|location=London|volume=2|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=1784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create accurate maps, latitude and longitude must be accurately determined. Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1304/Celestial-Sphere-Apparent-Motions-Sun-Moon-Planets-Stars.html|title=Celestial Sphere: The Apparent Motions of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars – Earth, North, Axis, Approximately, Latitude, and Equator|date=2011|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage by his navigational skills, the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]], and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]] tables, via the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method—measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage, Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]], which was the shape of a large [[pocket watch]], {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter. It was a copy of the [[John Harrison#The longitude watches|H4]] clock made by [[John Harrison]], which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship ''Deptford's'' journey to [[Jamaica]] in 1761–62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.nfsa.gov.au/module/1318/|title=Captain Cook – Cook's Chronometer – English and Media Literacy, Documentaries|work=dl.nfsa.gov.au|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook succeeded in circumnavigating the world on his first voyage without losing a single man to [[scurvy]], an unusual accomplishment at the time. He tested several preventive measures, but the most important was frequent replenishment of fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernandez-Armesto|2006|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for presenting a paper on this aspect of the voyage to the Royal Society that he was presented with the [[Copley Medal]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/66/402|title=The Method Taken for Preserving the Health of the Crew of His Majesty's Ship the Resolution during Her Late Voyage Round the World|volume=66|pages=402–06|first=Captain James|last=Cook|journal=Philosophical Transactions|date=2011|accessdate=10 August 2011|doi=10.1098/rstl.1776.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever the observer, Cook was the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly postulated a link among all the Pacific peoples, despite their being separated by great ocean stretches (see [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]). Cook theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which scientist [[Bryan Sykes]] later verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sykes|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of colonisation.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="horwitz"&gt;{{Harvnb|Horwitz|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook carried several scientists on his voyages; they made significant observations and discoveries. Two botanists, [[Joseph Banks]] and Swede [[Daniel Solander]], were on the first voyage. The two collected over 3,000 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/endeavour-botanical/about2.dsml|title=The Endeavour Botanical Illustrations at the Natural History Museum|work=nhm.ac.uk|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks subsequently strongly promoted British settlement of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/banks_sir_joseph.shtml|title=Sir Joseph Banks|publisher=BBC|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/solander-daniel-2677|title=Solander, Daniel (1733–1782)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|first=L.A.|last=Gilbert|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists also sailed on Cook's first voyage. [[Sydney Parkinson]] was heavily involved in documenting the botanists' findings, completing 264 drawings before his death near the end of the voyage. They were of immense scientific value to British botanists.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/endeavour-botanical/people.dsml|title=The Endeavour Botanical Illustrations at the Natural History Museum|work=nhm.ac.uk|date=2011|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's second expedition included [[William Hodges]], who produced notable [[Landscape art|landscape paintings]] of [[Tahiti]], [[Easter Island]], and other locations.

Several officers who served under Cook went on to distinctive accomplishments. [[William Bligh]], Cook's sailing master, was given command of {{HMS|Bounty||6}} in 1787 to sail to Tahiti and return with [[breadfruit]]. Bligh is most known for the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny of his crew]] which resulted in his being set adrift in 1789. He later became [[governor of New South Wales]], where he was the subject of another mutiny—the [[Rum Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_william_bligh.htm|title=Biography: William Bligh &amp;#124; Online Information Bank &amp;#124; Research Collections &amp;#124; Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard|work=royalnavalmuseum.org|date=2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Vancouver]], one of Cook's [[Midshipman|midshipmen]], led a [[Vancouver Expedition|voyage of exploration to the Pacific Coast of North America]] from 1791 to 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/vancouver-george-2755|title=Vancouver, George (1757–1798)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|first=Nan|last=Phillips|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of his former commander, Vancouver's ship was named {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}}. [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]], who sailed under Cook on his third expedition, later commanded his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Barry M.|last=Gough|title=Dixon, George|volume=4|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/dixon_george_1776_91_4E.html|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Roberts]], a lieutenant under Cook, spent many years after that voyage preparing the detailed charts that went into Cook's posthumous atlas, published around 1784.

Cook's contributions to knowledge were internationally recognised during his lifetime. In 1779, while the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] were [[American Revolutionary War|fighting Britain for their independence]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea, recommending that if they came into contact with Cook's vessel, they were to "not consider her an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate return to England by detaining her or sending her into any other part of Europe or to America; but that you treat the said Captain Cook and his people with all civility and kindness ... as common friends to mankind."&lt;ref name="Franklin1837"&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Franklin|title=The works of Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVc-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=22 September 2011|date=1837|publisher=Tappan, Whittemore, and Mason|pages=123–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Franklin, Cook had met his death a month before this [[safe conduct]] "passport" was written.

Cook's voyages were involved in another unusual first. The first recorded circumnavigation of the world by an animal was by Cook's goat, who made that memorable journey twice; the first time on HMS ''Dolphin'', under [[Samuel Wallis]], and then aboard ''Endeavour''. When they returned to England, Cook had the goat presented with a silver collar engraved with lines from [[Samuel Johnson]]: ''Perpetui, ambita bis terra, praemia lactis Haec habet altrici Capra secunda Jovis.'' ("In fame scarce second to the nurse of Jove,/ This Goat, who twice the world had traversed round,/Deserving both her master's care and love,/Ease and perpetual pasture now has found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=James|authorlink=James Boswell|title=Boswell's Life of Johnson|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xvc_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=boswell+Banks+goat#v=onepage&amp;q=boswell%20Banks%20goat&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=1772|publisher=Henry Frowde|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;) She was put to pasture on Cook's farm outside London and was reportedly admitted to the privileges of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Royal Naval Hospital]] at Greenwich. Cook's journal recorded the date of the goat's death: 28 March 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit|first=Joyce E.|last=Chaplin|page=125|date=2012|isbn = 978-1416596202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. coin, the 1928 Hawaiian Sesquicentennial [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] carries Cook's image.

'''Kinetite''' was an [[explosive material]] [[patent]]ed in 1884 by T. Petry and O. Fallenstein,&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican"&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific American: Supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPM8AQAAIAAJ|volume=27|year=1889|publisher=Munn and Company|quote="Kinetite (the name no doubt from , "I move") was patented by T. Petrey and O. Fallenstein (their English patent is No. 10,936, August 6, 1884). As described in their specification, kinetite is made by dissolving gun cotton in nitrobenzene"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of [[nitro-benzol]] thickened or gelatinised by the addition of some [[collodion]]-cotton incorporated with finely ground [[potassium chlorate]] and precipitated [[Stibnite|antimony sulphide]].&lt;ref name="Cundill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cundill|first1=J.

It is an orange coloured, plastic mass, with the characteristic strong smell of nitro-benzol.&lt;ref name="Cundill" /&gt; It was manufactured by dissolving [[gun cotton]] in [[nitrobenzene]].&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;

Developed as a safer alternative to [[dynamite]], its manufacture and manipulation were claimed to be without danger as it required a very high temperature to ignite and, under ordinary circumstances be exploded by heat alone when unconfined.&lt;ref name="Cundill" /&gt; Instead, it detonated only under shock, and then only the part exposed to concussion.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT18850819.2.40.9&amp;dliv=&amp;e=-------10--1----0--|title=(untitled)|date=19 August 1885|work=[[Otago Daily Times]]|publisher=Robert Nobel Adams|page=4|accessdate=4 February 2014|location=Dunedin, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely manufactured in Germany, it was introduced to Australia in 1885 by Thomas Wilkins.&lt;ref name="WestAustralian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2997155|title=A New Explosive|date=10 April 1885|work=The West Australian|publisher=A.

==Safety==
It was largely unaffected by short immersion in water, when immersion was prolonged however the chlorate dissolved out, leaving a practically non-explosive residue. However, if  exposed to moist and dry air alternately, the chlorate crystallised out on the surfaces rendering the explosive very sensitive.&lt;ref name="Cundill" /&gt;

In testing however it was found to be extremely sensitive to combined friction and percussion, and could be readily ignited by a glancing blow with wood. Found also to be chemically unstable, it was known to ignite spontaneously both in the laboratory 
and in a magazine.&lt;ref name="Cundill" /&gt; A report of the French commission on the use of explosives in the presence of [[fire-damp]] in mines concluded that "The presence of chlorate of potash makes this substance too dangerous, for its use to be recommended."&lt;ref name="FrenchCommission"&gt;{{cite book|last1=France.

==Composition==
The principle of the mixture was the enveloping of each particle of the salts in an elastic jelly composed of [[hydrocarbons]] and nitrogen. The jelly additionally supplied material to the explosion.&lt;ref name="Thames" /&gt;

Laser Schlieren Deflectometry (LSD) for temperature measurements in the argon plasma jet.|356x356px]]
'''Laser schlieren deflectometry''' ('''LSD''') is a method for a high-speed measurement of the [[Temperature|gas temperature]] in [[Microscopic scale|microscopic dimensions]], in particular for temperature peaks under dynamic conditions at atmospheric pressure.  The principle of LSD is derived from [[schlieren photography]]: a narrow [[laser beam]] is used to scan an area in a gas where changes in properties are associated with characteristic changes of [[refractive index]]. Laser schlieren deflectometry is claimed to overcome limitations of other methods regarding temporal and spatial resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schäfer|first1=J.|last2=Foest|first2=R.|last3=Reuter|first3=S.|last4=Kewitz|first4=T.|last5=Šperka|first5=J.|last6=Weltmann|first6=K.-D.|title=Laser schlieren deflectometry for temperature analysis of filamentary non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=2012|volume=83|issue=10|pages=103506-8|doi=10.1063/1.4761924|pmid=23126765|bibcode=2012RScI...83j3506S|pmc=3494719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the method is analogous to [[Rutherford scattering|the scattering experiment of Ernest Rutherford]] from 1911. However, instead of [[alpha particle]]s [[scattering|scattered]] by [[Gold|gold atoms]], here an [[Ray (optics)|optical ray]] is deflected by hot spots with unknown temperature.
A general equation of LSD describes the dependence of the measured maximum deflection of the ray ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the local maximum of the neutral gas temperature in the hot spot ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{T_0}{T_1} + \frac{\delta_1}{\delta_0} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ambient temperature and ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a calibration constant depending on the configuration of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schäfer|first1=Jan|last2=Bonaventura|first2=Zdeněk|last3=Foest|first3=Rüdiger|title=On the fundamental relation of laser schlieren deflectometry for temperature measurements in filamentary plasmas|journal=European Physical Journal AP|date=15 July 2015|volume=71|issue=2|pages=20804|doi=10.1051/epjap/2015140491|bibcode=2015EPJAP..7120804S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser schlieren deflectometry has been used for investigation of the temperature dynamics, [[heat transfer]] and energy balance in a miniaturized kind of [[atmospheric-pressure plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Schäfer|first1=J.|last2=Sigeneger|first2=F.|last3=Foest|first3=R.|last4=Loffhagen|first4=D.|last5=Weltmann|first5=K.-D.|title=On plasma parameters of a self-organized plasma jet at atmospheric pressure|journal=The European Physical Journal D|date=14 September 2010|volume=60|issue=3|pages=531–538|doi=10.1140/epjd/e2010-00222-5|bibcode=2010EPJD...60..531S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helsinki Central Library Oodi''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi}}, {{lang-sv|Helsingfors centrumbibliotek Ode}}), commonly referred to as '''Library Oodi''', is an upcoming [[public library]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], expected to be inaugurated in late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Helsinki central library to include sauna after all|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/new_helsinki_central_library_to_include_sauna_after_all/7123693|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=Yle Uutiset|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yle_jan2015"/&gt; The library is under construction in the Töölönlahti district next to [[Helsinki Music Centre]] and [[Kiasma|Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art]].

A bidding to build the library set out in 2012 was won by the Finnish architectural firm ALA Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA Architects wins Helsinki library competition|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2013/06/14/ala-architects-wins-helsinki-library-competition/|website=Dezeen|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural design is by [[Ramboll]] Finland, drawing on competence in Denmark and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helsinki Central Library to bring together people, stories and knowledge|url=http://www.ramboll.com/media/rgr/helsinki-city_library|website=Ramboll|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library will be a three story building and will include a [[sauna]] and a ground floor movie theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Karissa|title=New Images Take You Inside ALA’s Helsinki Central Library|url=http://www.archdaily.com/549461/new-images-take-you-inside-ala-s-helsimnki-central-library/|website=ArchDaily|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the [[Helsinki City Council]] voted 75&amp;ndash;8 to launch the building project. The estimated costs of the new library are 98 million euros, of which the state will pay 30 million in connection with the centenary of [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland's independence]] in 2017. The city of Helsinki has budgeted 66 million euros for the building.&lt;ref name="yle_jan2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/state-of-the-art_helsinki_library_to_showcase_wooden_architecture/7767954|title=State-of-the-art Helsinki library to showcase wooden architecture|work=Yle Uutiset|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2016, it was announced that the new library would be named ''Oodi'' ([[Ode]]). There are two official names for the library in English: ''Helsinki Central Library Oodi'' and ''Library Oodi, Helsinki.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Central Library was named Oodi|url=http://www.hel.fi/www/uutiset/fi/kaupunginkirjasto/keskustakirjasto_sai_+nimen_+-+se_+on_oodi?pd=v|website=Helsinki City Library|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''local flatness''' is a property of a [[submanifold]] in a [[topological manifold]] of larger [[dimension]]. In the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of [[Submanifold#Embedded submanifolds|embedded submanifolds]] in the category of [[smooth manifolds]]. Local flatness and the [[topology]] of ridge networks is of importance in the study of [[Crumpling|crumpled structures]] with importance in materials processing and [[mechanical engineering]].

Suppose a ''d'' dimensional manifold ''N'' is embedded into an ''n'' dimensional manifold ''M'' (where ''d'' &amp;lt; ''n'').  If &lt;math&gt;x \in N,&lt;/math&gt; we say ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at ''x'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt; U \subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the [[topological pair]] &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, with a standard inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That is, there exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;U\to R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;U\cap N&lt;/math&gt; coincides with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The above definition assumes that, if ''M'' has a [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]], ''x'' is not a boundary point of ''M''. If ''x'' is a point on the boundary of ''M'' then the definition is modified as follows. We say that ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at a boundary point ''x'' of ''M'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the topological pair &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n_+,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is included as a standard subspace of its boundary. In more detail, we can set 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+ = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_{d+1}=\cdots=y_n=0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

We call ''N'' '''locally flat''' in ''M'' if ''N'' is locally flat at every point. Similarly, a map &lt;math&gt;\chi\colon N\to M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''locally flat''', even if it is not an embedding, if every ''x'' in ''N'' has a neighborhood ''U'' whose image &lt;math&gt;\chi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is locally flat in ''M''.

Local flatness of an embedding implies strong properties not shared by all embeddings.  Brown (1962) proved that if ''d'' = ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, then ''N'' is collared; that is, it has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to ''N'' &amp;times; [0,1] with ''N'' itself corresponding to ''N'' &amp;times; 1/2 (if ''N'' is in the interior of ''M'') or ''N'' &amp;times; 0 (if ''N'' is in the boundary of ''M'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13422">[[Image:Newton Stone Aberdeenshire Newton House.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Newton Stone from John Stuart's ''Sculptured Stones of Scotland'' (1856).]]The '''Newton Stone''' is a pillar stone, found in [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland. The stone contains two inscriptions, one, written in [[Ogham]], but the second script has never been positively identified and many different decipherments or theories have been proposed since the 1860s.

The second script may have been added to the stone as recently as the late 18th or beginning of the 19th century.

==Discovery and relocation==

The Newton Stone has been known since 1804 when the Earl of Aberdeen [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|George Hamilton-Gordon]] discovered the stone by the opening up of a new road near Pitmachie Farm, Aberdeenshire, after local shepherds told him of a "curious monument" that sat there.&lt;ref name=Macalister&gt;Macalister, R. A. S. (1935). "The Newton Stone". 9(36): 389-398.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was later taken and planted in the garden of Newton House, in the Parish of Culsamond about a mile north of Pitmachie Farm by the antiquarian [[Alexander Gordon (antiquary)|Alexander Gordon]].

Gordon was later indebted by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] for writing a letter describing the original position of the Newton Stone. His letter reads:

{{Quote|"I think it was in the year 1804 that I first saw the Newton Stone, the inscription on which I believe had been discovered by some shepherd boys in the preceding year. The stone, at that time, was situated in a fir plantation, a few paces distant from the high road, and near to the Pitmachie Turnpike. The trees have since been cut down, and the stone removed to the House of Newton."}}

In 1883, [[James Carnegie, 9th Earl of Southesk|James Carnegie]] clarified that the stone was "moved to a site [garden] behind Newton House about 1837".&lt;ref&gt;J. C. (9th Earl of) Southesk. (1883). "The Newton Stone". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. xvii: 21-45. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_017/17_021_045.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==

The Newton Stone contains two inscriptions. The first is an [[Ogham]] script possibly containing personal names, while the second has never been identified and became known from the early 19th century as the "unknown script". The Ogham script is engraved down the left-hand side of the stone and runs across part of its face. There are two rows of Ogham, a long and a short row. Across the top third of the stone, roughly central, is the unidentified script which contains 6 lines comprising 48 characters and symbols, including a [[swastika]].

===Age===

The Ogham inscription is ancient, but dates to [[Late Antiquity]]. Scholars have considered the possibility the unknown inscription was added a century or more after the Ogham.

[[William Forbes Skene]] dated the unknown inscription to the 9th century. It has also been proposed the "unknown script" is a modern forgery.

==Decipherment theories==

[[John Pinkerton]] first published the engravings of the Newton Stone in his ''Inquiry into the History of Scotland'' (1814) yet made no attempt to decipher the "unknown script". In 1821-1822, John Stuart, Professor of Greek at [[Marischal College]], discussed the stone in his paper entitled "Sculpture Pillars in the Northern Part of Scotland" addressed to the Edinburgh Society of Antiquaries. According to Stuart, the first attempt at translation was by [[Charles Vallancey]] who fancied resemblance of the characters to Latin. In 1856, Stuart published ''Sculptured Stones of Scotland'' which mentions that [[William Hodge Mill|William Mill]] from [[Cambridge University]] proposed the script was [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. No other theories had been proposed at that time.

It was apparently [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|George Hamilton-Gordon]]'s son [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur]] who first took drawings of the stone to Cambridge, where Mill studied them:

{{Quote|"A full discussion of it [Newton Stone] took place at the meeting of the British Association at Cambridge in 1862, when I was still living in Perthshire. The Hon. Arthur Gordon, afterwards Lord Stanmore, being a Cambridge man, had brought the subject before the authorities at Cambridge, and Dr Mill and others had studied the minuscules. My friend George Williams read to the Association Dr Mill's opinion, Dr Mill having died some time before. He held the inscription to be Phoenician, and read it as an address to the Syrian Esculapius.  Mr Thomas Wright maintained that it was debased Latin; he read the first two lines ''hie iacet Constantinus'', and later on he saw ''filius'' and the name of Constantine's father ''Constantius Chlorus'' in the genitive. Simonides at the same meeting said it was Greek, but gave it the same meaning as Mr Wright. Dr. Davis, the explorer of Carthage, said it was Phoenician, and made it mean a great deal. A learned Celtic scholar made it mean, among other things, the boundary of the royal field. Mr Vaux of the British Museum declared it to be mediaeval Latin. Professor Aufrecht believed it to be Phoenician."&lt;ref&gt;Browne, G. F. (1921). ''[https://archive.org/stream/onsomeantiquitie00brow#page/110/mode/2up On some antiquities in the neighbourhood of Dunecht house, Aberdeenshire]''. "Newton Stone" [Chapter 10]. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Therefore, a heated debate at Cambridge took place in 1862 regarding the decipherment, when [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]] criticized Mill's Phoenician theory, for a more simple Latin translation: "Here lies Constantinus, the son of". Wright's translation was supported by the palaeographer [[Constantine Simonides|Simonides]] but who substituted the Latin for Greek. Dr. Mill had died in 1853, but his paper "On the Decipherment of the Phoenician Inscription on the Newton Stone discovered in Aberdeenshire" was read out during the debate. His translation was:

{{Quote|"To Eshmun, God of Health, by this monumental stone, may the wandering Exile of me, thy servant, go up in never-ceasing memorial, even the record of Han Thanet Zenaniah, Magistrate, who is saturated with sorrow."}}

In 1865&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, A. (1865). "Notice of the various attempts which have been made to read and interpret the inscription on the Newton Stone". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. v: 224-34. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_005/5_224_234.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the antiquarian Alexander Thomson read a paper to the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] addressing five decipherment theories:

*[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ([[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], [[Theodor Aufrecht]], [[William Hodge Mill|William Mill]])
*[[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] (an unnamed correspondent of Thomson's)
*[[Latin]] ([[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], [[William Sandys Wright Vaux|William Vaux]])
*[[Greek language|Greek]] ([[Constantine Simonides]])
*[[Gnostic]] symbolism ([[John O. Westwood]])

Additionally, [[George Moore (physician)|George Moore]] proposed a [[Hebrew]]-[[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] translation, while Thomson mentions another scholar who likened the unknown inscription to [[Proto-Sinaitic script|Sinaitic]].

The more eccentric or fanciful decipherments such as Phoenician or Hebrew were soon rejected for Latin or Gaelic:

{{Quote|"I find a difficulty in reconciling to my mind the probability of Buddhist priests coming from the far east to the far west, to the cold and then almost uninhabited wastes of the north of Scotland, and inscribing Hebrew words in the Ogham character of the Gaedhil of Erinn. Dr Moore's copy of the inscription is not correct."&lt;ref&gt;Brash, R. R. (1874). "Remarks on the Ogham Inscription of the Newton Pillar-Stone". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. x: 134-141. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_010/10_134_141.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the Scottish historian [[William Forbes Skene]]:

{{Quote|"It will be seen how closely the Ogham corresponds with the main [unknown] inscription. The language is nearly the same. The word ''Josa'' is a Gaelic form. ''Jesw'', the corresponding Welsh and also Latin form. ''Gor'' is the Gaelic form; ''Guor'' the early Welsh."&lt;ref&gt;Skene, W. F. (1865). "Notes on the Ogham Inscription of the Newton Stone". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. v: 289-298. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_005/5_289_298.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1907, William Bannerman, developed Skene's theory that the inscription contains [[Old Irish]]:

{{Quote|"It is the Old Gaelic, the language of the ''Book of Deer'' and of the Celtic manuscripts on which Zeuss based his analysis in the ''Grammatica Celtica''."&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, W. (1907). "The Newton Stone: a critical examination and translation of its main inscription". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. xlii: 56-63. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_042/42_056_065.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Laurence Waddell]] however as late as 1924 offered another radical decipherment as Hitto-Phoenician. His work was strongly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. L. (1925). "[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/607096 The Phoenician Origin of Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons]" [Review]. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London''. 3(4): 808-810.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forgery?===

In 1935, [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]], while accepting the Ogham as ancient, considered the "unknown script" a modern forgery:

{{Quote|"The long line of Ogham writing is ancient: but I have not the slightest doubt that the shorter line, as well as the six lines of alphabetic signs and wonders on the face of the stone, are recent, and that they were executed while it was under cover of the plantation."&lt;ref name=Macalister/&gt;}}

He also wrote:

{{Quote|"There has never been a ‘Newton Stone’ controversy; the literature of the subject, like that of the ‘Number of the Beast’, resembles a series of disconnected runaway knocks, inflicted by street urchins on the door of a tempting corner house."}}

The archaeologist C. A. Gordon however in 1956 disputed Macalister's claim:

{{Quote|"Convinced at first by Macalister's article, I visited the stone expecting to be confirmed in the belief that the incomprehensibility of the inscription was due to its being a forgery perpetrated in the early years of the nineteenth century and inspired by the then recent discovery of the Rosetta Stone. After deliberate examination I changed my mind, and now feel sure that the inscription is genuine ancient work [...] On the whole the evidence, both technical and petrological, seems to be so clearly in favor of the authenticity of the inscription that it can be confidently handed back to the consideration of scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, C. A. (1956). "Carving Technique on the Symbol Stones of North-East Scotland". ''Proc''. ''Soc''. ''Antiq''. ''Scot''. lxxxviii: 40-46. [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_088/88_040_046.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[W. Douglas Simpson]] also rejected Macalister's assertion the unknown inscription was modern.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, W. D. (1943). ''The Province of Mar'' [Being the Rhind Lectures in Archaeology, 1941]. University Press. pp. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, W. D. (1968). ''The Ancient Stones of Scotland''. Robert Hale Ltd; 2nd Revised edition. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical theory===

In 1984, Anthony Jackson a Senior Lecturer in Social Anthropology at Edinburgh University called to abandon the linguistic approach for a numerical interpretation:

{{Quote|"...there is some advantage in abandoning a strictly linguistic approach to the Newton stone in favour of a numerical solution. Naturally this method cannot produce a translation of the unknown script any more than it can with the Oghams or symbol stones, but it does more than hint that the Picts were keenly aware of the property of numbers, especially if they had mystical significance."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, A. (1984). ''The Symbol Stones of Scotland''. Orkney Press. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Infobox niobium}}
'''Niobium''', formerly known as '''columbium''', is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Nb''' (formerly Cb) and [[atomic number]] 41. It is a soft, grey, crystalline, [[ductile]] [[transition metal]], often found in the minerals [[pyrochlore]] and [[columbite]], hence the former name "columbium". Its name comes from [[Greek mythology]], specifically [[Niobe]], who was the daughter of [[Tantalus]], the namesake of [[tantalum]]. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Brian (2002). ''Francium to Polonium''. Atlantic Europe Publishing Company, p. 40. {{ISBN|0717256774}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English chemist [[Charles Hatchett]] reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist [[Heinrich Rose]] determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and [[ferroniobium]], an [[alloy]] of 60–70% niobium with iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special [[steel]] such as that used in gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing [[superalloy]]s is important for its use in [[jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket engine]]s.

Niobium is used in various [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] materials. These [[Type-II superconductor|superconducting alloys]], also containing [[titanium]] and [[tin]], are widely used in the [[superconducting magnet]]s of [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanners]]. Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, [[numismatics]], and jewelry. In the last two applications, the low toxicity and iridescence produced by [[Anodizing|anodization]] are highly desired properties.

In 1809, English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and tantalum—[[tantalite]], with a density over 8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum.&lt;ref name="Wolla" /&gt; This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist [[Heinrich Rose]], who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of [[Tantalus]]: ''niobium'' (from [[Niobe]]) and ''[[pelopium]]'' (from [[Pelops]]).&lt;ref name="Pelop"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber die Zusammensetzung der Tantalite und ein im Tantalite von Baiern enthaltenes neues Metall|pages = 317–341|journal = Annalen der Physik|authorlink = Heinrich Rose|language=German|first = Heinrich|last = Rose|doi = 10.1002/andp.18441391006|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15148n/f327.table|volume = 139|issue = 10|date = 1844|bibcode = 1844AnP...139..317R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber die Säure im Columbit von Nordamérika|language=German|pages = 572–577|first = Heinrich|last = Rose|journal = Annalen der Physik|doi = 10.1002/andp.18471460410|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15155x/f586.table |date=1847| volume = 146|issue = 4|authorlink = Heinrich Rose|bibcode = 1847AnP...146..572R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements ''pelopium'', ''[[ilmenium]]'', and ''dianium''&lt;ref name="Dianium"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber eine eigenthümliche Säure, Diansäure, in der Gruppe der Tantal- und Niob- verbindungen|first = V.|last = Kobell|journal =Journal für Praktische Chemie|volume = 79|issue = 1|pages = 291–303 |doi=10.1002/prac.18600790145|date = 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.&lt;ref name="Ilmen" /&gt;

The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by [[Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand]]&lt;ref name="Ilmen" /&gt; and [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]], as well as [[Louis J. Troost]], who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865&lt;ref name="Ilmen"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Tantalsäure, Niobsäure, (Ilmensäure) und Titansäure|journal = Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry|volume = 5|issue = 1|date = 1866|doi = 10.1007/BF01302537|pages = 384–389|author= Marignac, Blomstrand|author2= Deville, H. |author3= Troost, L. |author4= Hermann, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt; and finally by Swiss chemist [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Annales de chimie et de physique]]|title = Recherches sur les combinaisons du niobium|pages = 7–75|authorlink = Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|language=French| first = M.

Articles on ''ilmenium'' continued to appear until 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Fortgesetzte Untersuchungen über die Verbindungen von Ilmenium und Niobium, sowie über die Zusammensetzung der Niobmineralien (Further research about the compounds of ilmenium and niobium, as well as the composition of niobium minerals)|first = R.|last = Hermann|journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie|language=German|volume = 3|issue = 1|pages =373–427|doi = 10.1002/prac.18710030137|date = 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Marignac was the first to prepare the metal in 1864, when he [[redox|reduced]] niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="nauti"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e04100.html|title = Niobium|publisher = Universidade de Coimbra|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was used in [[incandescent lamp]] filaments, the first commercial application.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt; This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with [[tungsten]], which has a higher melting point. That niobium improves the [[Microalloyed steel|strength of steel]] was first discovered in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt; In 1961, the American physicist [[Eugene Kunzler]] and coworkers at [[Bell Labs]] discovered that [[niobium-tin]] continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields,&lt;ref&gt;Geballe ''et al.'' (1993) gives a critical point at currents of 150&amp;nbsp;[[ampere|kiloamperes]] and magnetic fields of 8.8&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|tesla]].&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrical power [[machinery]]. This discovery enabled — two decades later — the production of long multi-strand cables wound into coils to create large, powerful [[electromagnet]]s for rotating machinery, particle accelerators, and particle detectors.&lt;ref name="geballe"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Geballe|first = Theodore H.| title = Superconductivity: From Physics to Technology|journal = Physics Today|volume = 46|issue = 10|date=October 1993|pages=52–56|doi=10.1063/1.881384|bibcode = 1993PhT....46j..52G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume = 95|pages = 1435–1435|date = 1954|title = Superconductivity of Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn|author=Matthias, B.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Niobium is a [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]], grey, [[ductility|ductile]], [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]] in [[Group 5 element|group 5]] of the [[periodic table]] (see table), with an electron configuration in the outermost [[electron shell|shells]] atypical for group 5. (This can be observed in the neighborhood of [[ruthenium]] (44), [[rhodium]] (45), and [[palladium]] (46).)

Although it is thought to have a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bollinger |first=R.

Niobium becomes a [[superconductor]] at [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at 9.2&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name="Pein"&gt;{{cite journal|title = A Superconducting Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn Coated Multicell Accelerating Cavity|first = M.|last = Peiniger|author2=Piel, H. |journal = Nuclear Science|date= 1985|volume= 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TNS.1985.4334443|pages = 3610–3612|bibcode = 1985ITNS...32.3610P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niobium has the greatest [[superconductor#Meissner effect|magnetic penetration depth]] of any element.&lt;ref name="Pein" /&gt; In addition, it is one of the three elemental [[Type II superconductor]]s, along with [[vanadium]] and [[technetium]].

The metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods.&lt;ref name="Rubber"&gt;{{cite book|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|first = David R.|last = Lide|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8493-0485-9| pages = '''4'''–21|edition = 85th|chapter = The Elements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468&amp;nbsp;°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms [[dielectric]] [[oxide]] layers.

Niobium is slightly less [[electropositive]] and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table, [[zirconium]], whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, as a result of the [[lanthanide contraction]].&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book|title = Extractive Metallurgy of Niobium|first = C.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of niobium}}
Niobium in the Earth's crust comprises one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Nb.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, at least 32 [[radioisotope]]s had been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 81 to 113. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb with a [[half-life]] of 34.7&amp;nbsp;million years. One of the least stable is &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30&amp;nbsp;milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable &lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Nb tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], with some exceptions. &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, &lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, and &lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;Nb have minor β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; delayed [[proton emission]] decay paths, &lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;Nb decays by [[electron capture]] and [[positron emission]], and &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb decays by both [[positron|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[electron|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] decay.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;

At least 25 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only &lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, &lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, and &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Nb do not have isomers. The most stable of niobium's isomers is &lt;sup&gt;93m&lt;/sup&gt;Nb with a half-life of 16.13&amp;nbsp;years. The least stable isomer is &lt;sup&gt;84m&lt;/sup&gt;Nb with a half-life of 103&amp;nbsp;ns. All of niobium's isomers decay by [[isomeric transition]] or beta decay except &lt;sup&gt;92m1&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, which has a minor electron capture branch.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;

After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum [[tantalum pentoxide|Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] and niobium [[Niobium pentoxide|Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] are obtained. The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with [[hydrofluoric acid]]:&lt;ref name="ICE" /&gt;

:Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 14 HF → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 HF → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The first industrial scale separation, developed by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|de Marignac]], exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum [[fluoride]]s, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from [[aqueous]] solution by [[organic solvents]] like [[cyclohexanone]].&lt;ref name="ICE" /&gt; The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the [[organic solvent]] with water and either precipitated by the addition of [[potassium fluoride]] to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with [[ammonia]] as the pentoxide:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; + 2 KF → K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;↓ + 2 HF

Followed by:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F + 7 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Several methods are used for the [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] to metallic niobium. The [[electrolysis]] of a molten mixture of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[sodium chloride]] is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with [[sodium]]. With this method, a relatively high purity niobium can be obtained. In large scale production, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced with hydrogen or carbon.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;  In the [[aluminothermic reaction]], a mixture of [[iron oxide]] and niobium oxide is reacted with [[aluminium]]:
:3 Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 Al → 6 Nb + 2 Fe + 6 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Small amounts of oxidizers like [[sodium nitrate]] are added to enhance the reaction. The result is [[aluminium oxide]] and [[ferroniobium]], an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Progress in Niobium Markets and Technology 1981–2001|author = Tither, Geoffrey|url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/oppening.pdf|journal = Niobium Science &amp; Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9|editors = Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217100553/http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/oppening.pdf|archivedate = 17 December 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Production of Ferroniobium at the Niobec mine 1981–2001 |first=Claude |last=Dufresne |author2=Goyette, Ghislain |url=http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_1/images/pdfs/start.pdf |journal=Niobium Science &amp; Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9712068-0-9 |editors=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217100559/http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_1/images/pdfs/start.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium.&lt;ref name="tesla" /&gt; Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium.

==Compounds==
{{see also|Category:Niobium compounds}}
In many ways, niobium is similar to [[tantalum]] and [[zirconium]]. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with [[fluorine]] at room temperature; with [[chlorine]] and [[hydrogen]] at 200&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]; and with [[nitrogen]] at 400&amp;nbsp;°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; The metal begins to [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air at 200&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1075–1079|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|author=Holleman, Arnold F.|author2=Wiberg, Egon|author3=Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Niob| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It resists corrosion by fused [[alkali metal|alkalis]] and by acids, including [[aqua regia]], [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[phosphoric acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; Niobium is attacked by [[hydrofluoric acid]] and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.

Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from +5 to −1, the most common compounds have niobium in the +5 state.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb–Nb bonding.

===Oxides and sulfides===
Niobium forms [[oxide]]s in the [[oxidation state]]s +5 ([[Niobium pentoxide|Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Niobium_oxide#section=Top|title=Niobium oxide {{!}} Nb2O5 - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; +4 ([[Niobium dioxide|NbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), +3 ({{chem|Nb|2|O|3}}),&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt; and the rarer oxidation state, +2 ([[niobium monoxide|NbO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most common is the pentoxide, precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardarelli"&gt;{{cite book|first = Francois|last = Cardarelli|date = 2008|title = Materials Handbook |publisher = Springer London|isbn = 978-1-84628-668-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[hydroxide]] solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides. Examples are [[lithium niobate]] (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and lanthanum niobate (LaNbO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite]]-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone {{chem|NbO|4|3-}} ions.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt; The layered niobium sulfide (NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also known.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt;

Anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known, owing in part to the [[Lewis acid]]ity of the pentahalides.

Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400&amp;nbsp;°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.&lt;ref name="hightemp" /&gt;

=== Niobium-based alloys ===
'''C-103''' alloy was developed in the early 1960s jointly by the [[Wah Chang Corporation]] and [[Boeing]] Co.  [[DuPont]], [[Union Carbide]] Corp., [[General Electric]] Co. and several other companies were developing [[Niobium alloy|Nb-base alloys]] simultaneously, largely driven by the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]].  It is composed of 89% niobium, 10% [[hafnium]] and 1% titanium and is used for [[liquid rocket]] thruster nozzles, such as the main engine of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s.&lt;ref name="hightemp"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf |title=Niobium alloys and high Temperature Applications |first=John |last=Hebda |journal=Niobium Science &amp; Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) |date=2 May 2001 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217080513/http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactivity of niobium with oxygen requires it to be worked in a [[Outgassing|vacuum]] or [[Inert gas|inert atmosphere]], which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production.  [[Vacuum arc remelting]] (VAR) and [[electron beam melting]] (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals.  The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 with as many as 256 experimental niobium alloys in the "C-series" (possibly from '''c'''olumbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into [[Sheet metal|sheet]].  Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade [[zirconium alloy]]s, that it wanted to put to commercial use.  The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included [[turbine engine]]s and liquid metal [[heat exchanger]]s.  Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.&lt;ref name="hightemp" /&gt;

It belongs to the [[Perovskite|ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] structure ferroelectrics like [[lithium tantalate]] and [[barium titanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Lithium Niobate: Defects, Photorefraction and Ferroelectric Switching|first = Tatyana|last = Volk|author2=Wohlecke, Manfred |publisher = Springer|date = 2008|isbn = 978-3-540-70765-3|pages = 1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niobium capacitor]]s are available as alternative to  [[tantalum capacitor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Quality and Reliability Engineering International|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1638(199803/04)14:2&lt;79::AID-QRE163&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y|pages = 79–82|date = 1991 |title = Reliability comparison of tantalum and niobium solid electrolytic capacitors|first = Y.|last = Pozdeev}}&lt;/ref&gt; but tantalum capacitors still predominate. Niobium is added to glass to obtain a higher [[refractive index]], making possible thinner and lighter [[glasses|corrective glasses]].

====Hypoallergenic applications: medicine and jewelry====
Niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and [[hypoallergenic]]. For this reason, niobium is used in prosthetics and implant devices, such as pacemakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mallela, Venkateswara Sarma|author2=Ilankumaran, V.|author3=Srinivasa Rao, N.| title = Trends in Cardiac Pacemaker Batteries|journal = Indian Pacing Electrophysiol J.|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 201–212|date=1 January 2004|pmid = 16943934|pmc = 1502062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niobium treated with [[sodium hydroxide]] forms a porous layer that aids [[osseointegration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Godley, Reut|author2=Starosvetsky, David|author3=Gotman, Irena|date = 2004|title = Bonelike apatite formation on niobium metal treated in aqueous NaOH|journal = Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine|volume = 15|pages = 1073–1077|doi = 10.1023/B:JMSM.0000046388.07961.81|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l5613670648017wp/|format = PDF|pmid = 15516867|issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, niobium can be heated and [[anodize]]d ("reactive metal [[anodizing|anodization]]") to produce a wide array of [[Iridescence|iridescent]] colours for jewelry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume = 21|issue = 11|doi = 10.1007/BF01077589|pages = 1023–1026 |date = 1991|title = Anodization of niobium in sulphuric acid media|author=Biason Gomes, M.

====Numismatics====

The rim reads: Republik Österreich 25 Euro. The centere shows electric and a steam driven locomotive]]
Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium [[euro]] coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the [[diffraction]] of light by a thin anodized oxide layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2005.10.008|journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials|volume = 24|issue = 4|date = 2006|pages = 275–282|title = Niobium as mint metal: Production–properties–processing|first =Robert|last = Grill|author2=Gnadenberge, Alfred }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow.

In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $5 [[sterling silver]] and niobium coin named ''Hunter's Moon''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/store/coin/5-sterling-silver-and-niobium-coin-hunters-moon-2011-prod1110013|title=$5 Sterling Silver and Niobium Coin – Hunter's Moon (2011)|publisher=Royal Canadian Mint|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = New trends in the use of metals in jewellery|author=Vilaplana, J.|author2=Romaguera, C.|author3=Grimalt, F.|author4=Cornellana, F.|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 25|issue = 3 |pages = 145–148|date = 1990|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1991.tb01819.x|pmid = 1782765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = New developments in jewellery and dental materials|first = J.|last = Vilaplana|author2=Romaguera, C. | journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 39|issue = 2| pages = 55–57|date = 1998|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05832.x|pmid = 9746182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niobium-containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="Haley"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Pharmacology and toxicology of niobium chloride|author=Haley, Thomas J.|author2=Komesu, N.|author3=Raymond, K.|journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]]|volume = 4|issue = 3|pages = 385–392|date = 1962|doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(62)90048-0|pmid=13903824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Toxicity of Niobium Salts |author=Downs, William L. |display-authors=4 |author2=Scott, James K. |author3=Yuile, Charles L. |author4=Caruso, Frank S. |author5=Wong, Lawrence C.

Orphan genes were first discovered when the yeast genome-sequencing project began in 1996.&lt;ref name="Tautz"/&gt; Orphan genes accounted for an estimated 26% of the yeast genome, but it was believed that these genes could be classified with homologues when more genomes were sequenced.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; At the time, gene duplication was considered the only serious model of gene evolution&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=F.|date=1977-06-10|title=Evolution and tinkering|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/196/4295/1161|journal=Science|language=en|volume=196|issue=4295|pages=1161–1166|doi=10.1126/science.860134|pmid=860134|bibcode=1977Sci...196.1161J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were few sequenced genomes for comparison, so a lack of detectable homologues was thought to be most likely due to a lack of sequencing data and not due to a true lack of homology.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, orphan genes continued to persist as the quantity of sequenced genomes grew,&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = G.

The study of orphan genes emerged largely after the turn of the century. In 2003, a study of ''[[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]'' and related species compared over 2000 genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; They proposed that these genes must be evolving too quickly to be detected and are consequently sites of very rapid evolution.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt;  In 2005, Wilson examined 122 bacterial species to try to examine whether the large number of orphan genes in many species was legitimate.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; The study found that it was legitimate and played a role in bacterial adaptation. The definition of taxonomically-restricted genes was introduced into the literature to make orphan genes seem less "mysterious."&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

In 2008, a yeast protein of established functionality, BSC4, was found to have evolved de novo from non-coding sequences whose homology was still detectable in sister species.&lt;ref name="Cai 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Jing|last2=Zhao|first2=Ruoping|last3=Jiang|first3=Huifeng|last4=Wang|first4=Wen|date=2008-05-01|title=De Novo Origination of a New Protein-Coding Gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/179/1/487|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=179|issue=1|pages=487–496|doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084491|pmc=2390625|pmid=18493065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an orphan gene was discovered to regulate an internal biological network:  the orphan gene, QQS, from ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' modifies plant composition.&lt;ref name="Foster, C. M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = L. | last2 = Foster | first2 = C. M. | last3 = Gan | first3 = Q. | last4 = Nettleton | first4 = D. | last5 = James | first5 = M.

==How to identify orphan genes==
Genes can be tentatively classified as orphans if no orthologous proteins can be found in nearby species.&lt;ref name="Wissler"/&gt;

One method used to estimate nucleotide or protein sequence similarity indicative of homology (i.e. similarity due to common origin) is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). BLAST allows query sequences to be rapidly searched against large sequence databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschul|first1=S.|title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 September 1997|volume=25|issue=17|pages=3389–3402|doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|pmid=9254694|pmc=146917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCBI BLAST homepage|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations suggest that under certain conditions BLAST is suitable for detecting distant relatives of a gene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alba|first1=M|last2=Castresana|first2=J|title=On homology searches by protein BLAST and the characterization of the age of genes|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|date=2007|volume=7|page=53|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-53 |pmid=17408474|pmc=1855329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genes that are short and evolve rapidly can easily be missed by BLAST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moyers|first1=B. A.|last2=Zhang|first2=J.|title=Phylostratigraphic Bias Creates Spurious Patterns of Genome Evolution|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=13 October 2014|volume=32|issue=1|pages=258–267|doi=10.1093/molbev/msu286|pmid=25312911|pmc=4271527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic detection of homology to annotate orphan genes is called phylostratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A phylostratigraphy approach to uncover the genomic history of major adaptations in metazoan lineages|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S0168952507002995/abstract|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2007-01-11|pmid = 18029048|pages = 533–539|volume = 23|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.08.014|first = Tomislav|last = Domazet-Lošo|first2 = Josip|last2 = Brajković|first3 = Diethard|last3 = Tautz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylostratigraphy generates a phylogenetic tree in which the homology is calculated between all genes of a focal species and the genes of other species. The earliest common ancestor for a gene determines the age, or phylostratum, of the gene. The term "orphan" is sometimes used only for the youngest phylostratum containing only a single species, but when interpreted broadly as a taxonomically-restricted gene, it can refer to all but the oldest phylostratum, with the gene orphaned within a larger clade.

==Where do orphan genes come from?==
Orphan genes arise from multiple sources, predominantly through de novo origination, duplication and rapid divergence, and horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;

=== De Novo Origination ===
Novel orphan genes continually arise de novo from non-coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLysaght|first1=Aoife|last2=Guerzoni|first2=Daniele|title=New genes from non-coding sequence: the role of de novo protein-coding genes in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=31 August 2015|volume=370|issue=1678|pages=20140332|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0332|pmid=26323763|pmc=4571571}}&lt;/ref&gt; These novel genes may be sufficiently beneficial to be swept to fixation by selection. Or, more likely, they will fade back into the non-genic background. This latter option is supported by research in Drosophila showing that young genes are more likely go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmieri|first1=Nicola|last2=Kosiol|first2=Carolin|last3=Schlötterer|first3=Christian|title=The life cycle of orphan genes|journal=eLife|date=19 February 2014|volume=3|pages=e01311|doi=10.7554/eLife.01311|pmid=24554240|pmc=3927632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De novo genes were once thought to be a near impossibility due to the complex and potentially fragile intricacies of creating and maintaining functional polypeptides,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but research from the past 10 years or so has found multiple examples of de novo genes, some of which are associated with important biological processes, particularly testes function in animals. De novo genes were also found in fungi and plants.&lt;ref name="Cai 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Li|last2=Saelao|first2=Perot|last3=Jones|first3=Corbin D.|last4=Begun|first4=David J.|date=2014-02-14|title=Origin and Spread of de Novo Genes in Drosophila melanogaster Populations|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/769|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6172|pages=769–772|doi=10.1126/science.1248286|pmc=4391638|pmid=24457212|bibcode=2014Sci...343..769Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Mia T.|last2=Jones|first2=Corbin D.|last3=Kern|first3=Andrew D.|last4=Lindfors|first4=Heather A.|last5=Begun|first5=David J.|date=2006-06-27|title=Novel genes derived from noncoding DNA in Drosophila melanogaster are frequently X-linked and exhibit testis-biased expression|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/26/9935|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=103|issue=26|pages=9935–9939|doi=10.1073/pnas.0509809103|pmc=1502557|pmid=16777968|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.9935L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Qi|last2=Zhang|first2=Guojie|last3=Zhang|first3=Yue|last4=Xu|first4=Shiyu|last5=Zhao|first5=Ruoping|last6=Zhan|first6=Zubing|last7=Li|first7=Xin|last8=Ding|first8=Yun|last9=Yang|first9=Shuang|date=2008-09-01|title=On the origin of new genes in Drosophila|url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/9/1446|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1446–1455|doi=10.1101/gr.076588.108|pmc=2527705|pmid=18550802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinen|first=Tobias J.

For young orphan genes, it is sometimes possible to find homologous non-coding DNA sequences in sister taxa, which is generally accepted as strong evidence of de novo origin. However, the contribution of de novo origination to taxonomically-restricted genes of older origin, particularly in relation to the traditional gene duplication theory of gene evolution, remains contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neme|first=Rafik|last2=Tautz|first2=Diethard|date=2014-03-17|title=Evolution: Dynamics of De Novo Gene Emergence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214001547|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=6|pages=R238–R240|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.02.016|pmid=24650912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyers|first=Bryan A.|last2=Zhang|first2=Jianzhi|date=2016-01-11|title=Evaluating phylostratigraphic evidence for widespread de novo gene birth in genome evolution|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/01/11/molbev.msw008|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|pages=1245–56|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw008|pmc=5010002| pmid=26758516|volume=33|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duplication and Divergence ===
The duplication and divergence model for orphan genes involves a new gene being created from some duplication or divergence event and undergoing a period of rapid evolution where all detectable similarity to the originally duplicated gene is lost.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; While this explanation is consistent with current understandings of duplication mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; the number of mutations needed to lose detectable similarity is large enough as to be a rare event,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the evolutionary mechanism by which a gene duplicate could be sequestered and diverge so rapidly remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The altered evolutionary trajectories of gene duplicates|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2004-11-01|pmid = 15475113|pages = 544–549|volume = 20|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2004.09.001|first = Michael|last = Lynch|first2 = Vaishali|last2 = Katju|citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal Gene Transfer ===
Another explanation for how orphan genes arise is through a duplication mechanism called [[horizontal gene transfer]], where the original duplicated gene derives from a separate, unknown lineage.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; This explanation for the origin of orphan genes is especially relevant in bacteria and archaea, where horizontal gene transfer is common.

==Protein characteristics==
Orphans genes tend to be very short (~6 times shorter than mature genes), and some are weakly expressed, tissue specific and simpler in codon usage and amino acid composition.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendsee|first1=Zebulun W.|last2=Li|first2=Ling|last3=Wurtele|first3=Eve Syrkin|title=Coming of age: orphan genes in plants|journal=Trends in Plant Science|date=November 2014|volume=19|issue=11|pages=698–708|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2014.07.003|pmid=25151064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan genes tend to encode more [[intrinsically disordered proteins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukherjee|first1=S.|last2=Panda|first2=A.|last3=Ghosh|first3=T.C.|title=Elucidating evolutionary features and functional implications of orphan genes in ''Leishmania major''|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|date=June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.031|pmid=25843649|volume=32 |pages=330–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Benjamin A.|last2=Foy|first2=Scott G.|last3=Neme |first3=Rafik |last4=Masel|first4=Joanna |author4link=Joanna Masel|title=Young genes are highly disordered as predicted by the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene birth |journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=24 April 2017|volume=1|issue=6|pages=0146|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0146|pmid=28642936|pmc=5476217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="willis_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willis |first1=Sara |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Gene Birth Contributes to Structural Disorder Encoded by Overlapping Genes |journal=Genetics |date=19 July 2018 |volume=210 |issue=1 |pages=303–313 |doi=10.1534/genetics.118.301249 |pmid=30026186 |pmc=6116962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, although some structure has been found in one of the best characterized orphan genes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bungard |first1=Dixie |last2=Copple |first2=Jacob S. |last3=Yan |first3=Jing |last4=Chhun |first4=Jimmy J. |last5=Kumirov |first5=Vlad K. |last6=Foy |first6=Scott G. |last7=Masel |first7=Joanna |last8=Wysocki |first8=Vicki H. |last9=Cordes |first9=Matthew H.J. |title=Foldability of a Natural De Novo Evolved Protein |journal=Structure |date=November 2017 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=1687–1696.e4 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2017.09.006|pmid=29033289 |pmc=5677532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Of the tens of thousands of enzymes of primary or specialized metabolism that have been characterized to date, none are orphans, or even of restricted lineage; apparently, catalysis requires hundreds of millions of years of evolution.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"/&gt;

==Biological functions==
While the prevalence of orphan genes has been established, the evolutionary role of orphans, and its resulting importance, is still being debated. One theory is that many orphans have no evolutionary role; genomes contain non-functional open reading frames (ORFs) that create spurious polypeptide products not maintained by selection, meaning that they are unlikely to be conserved between species and would likely be detected as orphan genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, a variety of other studies have shown that at least some orphans are functionally important and may help explain the emergence of novel phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster, C. M. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donoghue" /&gt;

'''Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex''' ('''PIPC''') is a megaproject development in [[Pengerang]], [[Kota Tinggi District]], [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]]. It spans over an area of 80 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and will house [[oil refineries]], [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] crackers, [[petrochemical]] plants,  [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminals and a [[regasification]] plant upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jpdc.gov.my/pengerang-integrated-petroleum-complex-pipc|title=PIPC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/144708|title=PIPC mampu sumbang RM18.3b menjelang 2020|website=BH Online|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mida.gov.my/env3/uploads/Publications_pdf/MeetMalaysia_AsiaOilGasHub/MeetMalaysiaONG_2013|title=PIPC to become regional downstream oil storage and trading hub|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The site where it stands now was chosen because of its location along major shipping route between [[Middle East]] and [[China]]. The project was launched to increase [[Malaysia]]'s petrochemical output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/04/18/pipc-a-boost-for-johor/|title=PIPC a boost for Johor - Community {{!}} The Star Online|last=Benjamin|first=Nelson|last2=Phaharoradzi|first2=Norbaiti|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mprc.gov.my/our-businesses/pengerang-integrated-petroleum-complex-pipc|title=Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) {{!}} MPRC|website=www.mprc.gov.my|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The Johor Petroleum Development Corporation Berhad (JPDC) was established to oversee the development of the project. JPDC was created as a subsidiary of Malaysia Petroleum Resources Corporation (MPRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mprc.gov.my/our-businesses/pengerang-integrated-petroleum-complex-pipc|title=Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) {{!}} MPRC|website=www.mprc.gov.my|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etp.pemandu.gov.my/About_ETP-@-Overview_of_ETP.aspx|title=Overview of ETP|website=etp.pemandu.gov.my|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The components of PIPC was first initiated with the development of the 5 million cubic meters capacity of Pengerang Deepwater Terminal (PDT), a joint-venture between Dialog Group, Royal Vopak of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Johor]]. It serves as a centralized storage facility for trading, refining and [[petrochemical industry]]. The USD3 billion facility includes an independent terminal for trading, a dedicated industrial terminal within PIPC, and an LNG terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dialogasia.com/pengerangproject.htm|title=Dialog Group Berhad|website=www.dialogasia.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of a deepwater jetty facility enables the berthing of both ultra large crude carriers and very large crude carriers. PDT received its first shipment of oil in the first quarter of 2014.

The other component of PIPC is the [[Petronas]] Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), Petronas' largest [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] [[investment]] in a single location to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pic.petronas.com/Pages/default.aspx|title=Petronas' largest downstream investment in a single location|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development includes the USD16 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development Project (RAPID).

This also involves the USD11 billion associated facilities, which are air separation unit, raw water supply, cogeneration plant, regasification terminal, deepwater terminal and utilities. Upon its completion in 2019, PIC will have a refining capacity of 300,000 barrels per day with petrochemical plants yielding an estimated annual production capacity of 3.6 million tonnes of petrochemical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pic.petronas.com/About-PIC/Pages/The-Projects.aspx|title=PIC projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chow|first1=Emily|last2=Ananthalakshmi|first2=A.|title=Aramco snub puts Malaysia's Petronas in tight spot over RAPID project|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-petronas-analysis-idUSKBN15B0YW|accessdate=27 January 2017|agency=Reuters|date=Jan 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/saudi-arabia-malaysia-sign-pacts-to-strengthen-bilateral-cooperation&lt;/ref&gt;

Its sheltered harbour with a natural water depth of 24 meters provides berthing conditions for [[Oil tanker|Ultra Large Crude Carriers]] (ULCCs) and [[Oil tanker|Very Large Crude Carriers]] (VLCCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jpdc.gov.my/pengerang-integrated-petroleum-complex-pipc|title=Johor Petroleum Development Corporation Berhad (JPDC) {{!}} Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC)|website=Johor Petroleum Development Corporation Berhad (JPDC) {{!}} Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC)|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The complex is accessible by road using the [[Senai–Desaru Expressway]] from [[Johor Bahru]].

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy accidents and fatalities ==

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''REScoop.eu''' is the European federation of [[renewable energy]] [[cooperatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rescoop.eu|url=http://www.managenergy.net/actors/4889|work=European Commission Directorate-General for Energy: ManagEnergy  Initiative|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2011.

{{As of|April 2016}} it has 20 member organisations (either individual REScoops or regional REScoop federations) in 11 European Member States, representing 1,240 individual REScoops and their 300,000 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;https://rescoop.eu/renewable-energy-citizen-initiatives/leading REScoop members&lt;/ref&gt;

Its routine administration is handled by the Belgian cooperative [[Ecopower (cooperative)|Ecopower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation of REScoop.eu|url=http://www.ecopower.be/index.php/rescoopeu|work=Ecopower|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2013, the European federation of groups and cooperatives of citizens for renewable energy (REScoop.EU) was legally established under Belgian national law with a European scope. This legal act is a key issue to further develop the activities of the European federation and it constitutes the base to build a strong European renewable energy cooperative alliance.&lt;ref&gt;http://rescoop.eu/european-federation&lt;/ref&gt;

''REScoop'' is a short term for Renewable Energy Source Cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable energy source cooperatives | work=University of Liege, Centre for Social Economy | year=2010|url=http://www.ces.ulg.ac.be/en_GB/research-2/social-entrepreneurship/cooperatives|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Pinus sylvestris wood ray section 1 beentree.jpg|thumb|[[Scots Pine]], a typical and well-known softwood]]

'''Softwood''' is [[wood]] from [[gymnosperm]] trees such as [[conifer]]s. The term is opposed to [[hardwood]], which is the wood from [[angiosperm]] trees.

==Characteristics==
Softwood is [[wood]] from [[gymnosperm]] trees such as [[pine]]s and [[spruce]]s. Softwoods are not necessarily softer than hardwoods.&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckley|first1=Michael|title=A basic guide to softwoods and hardwoods|url=http://www.worldhardwoods.com/files/articles_basicguide.pdf|publisher=worldhardwoods.com|date=2005|format=PDF|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, the range of density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods.  Some hardwoods (e.g. [[balsa]]) are softer than most softwoods, while the hardest hardwoods are much harder than any softwood. The woods of [[longleaf pine]], [[Douglas fir]], and [[Taxus|yew]] are much harder in the mechanical sense than several hardwoods.

Softwoods are generally most used by the construction industry and are also used to produce [[paper pulp]], and card products.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=V.|title=REVISION CARDS - SOFTWOODS |url=http://www.technologystudent.com/joints/softwoods1.html |date=2012|publisher=technologystudent.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain species of softwood are more resistant to insect attack from [[woodworm]], as certain insects prefer damp hardwood.

Softwood reproduces using [[pine cones|cones]] and occasionally [[nut (fruit)|nuts]].

==Known softwood trees and uses==
* [[Douglas fir]] - [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], doors and heavy construction
* [[Eastern white pine]] - furniture
* [[European spruce]] - used throughout construction, panelling and cladding
* [[Larch]] - used for cladding and boats
* [[Lodgepole pine]] - roofing, flooring and in making chipboard and [[particle board]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Things we make from softwood trees|url=https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-52jc96|date=11 July 2017|publisher=forestry.gov.uk|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parana pine]] - stair treads and joinery
* [[Scots pine]] - construction industry, mostly for interior work
* [[Sitka spruce]] - &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=T.|title=British Softwoods:Properties and Uses |date=1988 |format=PDF |url=https://www.forestry.gov.uk/PDF/FCBU077.pdf/$FILE/FCBU077.pdf |publisher=forestry.gov.uk|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Southern yellow pine]] - joinery, flooring and [[Deck (building)|decking]]
* [[Western hemlock]] - doors, joinery and furniture
* [[Western red cedar]] (or red cedar) - furniture, decking, [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], and [[roof shingles]] 
* [[Yew]] - interior and exterior furniture e.g. chairs, gate posts and wood turning

==Applications==
Softwood is the source of about 80% of the world's production of [[timber]],&lt;ref&gt;United Nations {{google books|jSZxq4DQjIIC|Forest Products Annual Market Review 2007-2008|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; with traditional centres of production being the [[Baltic region]] (including [[Scandinavia]] and [[Russia]]), [[North America]] and China. Softwood is typically used in construction as structural carcassing timber, as well as finishing timber.

'''Photovoltaic solar panels''' absorb [[sunlight]] as a source of energy to generate [[electricity]]. A [[photovoltaic]] (PV) module is a packaged, connected assembly of typically 6x10 photovoltaic [[solar cell]]s. Photovoltaic modules constitute the photovoltaic array of a [[photovoltaic system]] that generates and supplies [[solar electricity]] in commercial and residential applications.  

Each module is rated by its [[Direct current|DC]] output power under standard test conditions (STC), and typically ranges from 100 to 365 [[Watt|Watts (W)]]. The [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]] of a module determines the area of a module given the same rated output{{snd}} an 8% efficient 230 W module will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 230 W module. There are a few commercially available solar modules that exceed efficiency of 24%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2015/10/02/elon-musk-solarcity-new-solar-panel/#Y3BehZNL7iqr |title=Elon Musk and SolarCity unveil ‘world’s most efficient’ solar panel |last=Ulanoff |first=Lance |date=2 October 2015 |website=[[Mashable]] |publisher= |access-date=9 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160517121811.htm|title=Milestone in solar cell efficiency achieved |last=da Silva |first=Wilson |date= 17 May 2016|website=[[ScienceDaily]] |publisher= |access-date=9 September 2018 |quote=A new solar cell configuration developed by engineers at the University of New South Wales has pushed sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency to 34.5% -- establishing a new world record for unfocused sunlight and nudging closer to the theoretical limits for such a device.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

A single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for storage, interconnection wiring, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. 

The most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160–70 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The price of solar electrical power has continued to fall so that in many countries it has become cheaper than ordinary [[fossil fuel]] electricity from [[Mains electricity|the electricity grid]] since 2012, a phenomenon known as [[grid parity]].&lt;ref name=UN-Energy-2012/&gt;

[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]

[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The majority of modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can either be the top layer or the back layer. Cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells must be connected electrically in series, one to another. 

A PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and it is its output interface.Externally, most of photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s type to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. Also, USB power interface can be used.

Module electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes). The conducting wires that take the current off the modules may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.

Some special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. 

Solar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of solar cells}}

In 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This observation was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughey Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

In 1939, [[Russell Ohl]] created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. He patented his design in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ohl |first1=Russell |title=Light-sensitive electric device |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2402662 |website=Google |accessdate=7 September 2018 |date=27 May 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, this design was first used by [[Bell Labs]] to create the first commercially viable silicon solar cell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|350px|Reported timeline of [[solar cell]] energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 ([[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]])]]

Depending on construction, photovoltaic modules can produce electricity from a range of [[frequency|frequencies of light]], but usually cannot cover the entire solar range (specifically, [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]] and low or diffused light). Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. 

Scientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;KING, R.R., et al., Appl. Phys. Letters 90 (2007) 183516.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45% or even 50% in the future, with theoretical efficiencies being about 58% in cells with more than three junctions.

Currently, the best achieved sunlight conversion rate (solar module efficiency) is around 21.5% in new commercial products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SunPower e20 Module |url=http://us.sunpower.com/homes/products-services/solar-panels/e-series/}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation. The most efficient mass-produced solar modules{{disputed inline|date=January 2013}} have power density values of up to 175 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16.22 W/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIT® Photovoltaic Module |url=http://www.panasonic.com/business/pesna/includes/pdf/eco-construction-solution/HIT_Power_220A_Datasheet.pdf |publisher=Sanyo / Panasonic|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research by [[Imperial College, London]] has shown that the efficiency of a solar panel can be improved by studding the light-receiving semiconductor surface with [[aluminum]] nanocylinders similar to the [[ridges]] on [[Lego blocks]]. The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor which means that more photons can be absorbed and converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without "compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficiencies of solar panel can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels
* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing MPPT process: solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.
* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.

Micro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels which are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel (this is known as the "Christmas light effect"). Micro-inverters work independently so each panel contributes its maximum possible output given the available sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Micro Inverters for Residential Solar Arrays |url=https://www.expertsure.com/uk/home/micro-inverters-for-residential-solar-arrays/ |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
{{Main article|Crystalline silicon|Thin film solar cell}}
[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Market-share of PV technologies since 1990]]

Most solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) [[solar cells]] made of [[polycrystalline silicon|multicrystalline]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).

=== Thin film ===
In rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called "monolithic integration". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6–12%

Flexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.

== Smart solar modules ==
{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}

Several companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing [[maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.

== Performance and degradation ==
{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}

Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25°C.

Electrical characteristics include nominal power (P&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;), [[short circuit current]] (I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;MPP&lt;/sub&gt;), maximum power current (I&lt;sub&gt;MPP&lt;/sub&gt;), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), and module efficiency (%).

Nominal voltage &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. The actual voltage output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.

Open circuit voltage or V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.

The peak power rating, W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar – FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yinglisolar.com/frontend/downloads/datasheets/YGE_235_Series_US.pdf |title=YGE 235 Data sheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|[[Solar water heating|Solar water heater]]]]
The ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? — eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced, new materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of "doping" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chemicals such as Boron (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, the addition of Boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) is so low, the Boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.

== Maintenance ==
Solar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. "A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends—in about 2 ½ months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels lost a little less than 0.05% of their overall efficiency per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/cleaning_solar_panels_often_not_worth_the_cost_engineers_at_uc_san_diego_fi |title=Cleaning Solar Panels Often Not Worth the Cost, Engineers at UC San Diego Find |date=August 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |website=UC San Diego News Center |publisher=UC San Diego News Center |last=Patringenaru |first=Ioana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recycling ==
Most parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Krueger {{cite web |title=Overview of First Solar's Module Collection and Recycling Program |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 23 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/2_Krueger_IEEE-Presentation-Final.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.&lt;ref name= "Wambach"&gt; {{citeweb|title=A Voluntary Take Back Scheme and Industrial Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules |last = Wambach |first = K |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 37 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/3_4_PV-Module-RecyclingWambach.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:
* Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process. The module is then crushed in a mill and the different fractions are separated - glass, plastics and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.betterworldsolutions.eu/solar-panels-can-be-recycled/|title=Solar Panels can be recycled - BetterWorldSolutions - The Netherlands|last=Cynthia|first=Latunussa|date=2015-10-09|work=BetterWorldSolutions - The Netherlands|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to recover more than 80% of the incoming weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latunussa |first1=Cynthia E.L. |last2=Ardente |first2=Fulvio |last3=Blengini |first3=Gian Andrea |last4=Mancini |first4=Lucia |title=Life Cycle Assessment of an innovative recycling process for crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels |journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=156 |year=2016 |pages=101–11 |doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2016.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can be performed by flat glass recyclers since morphology and composition of a PV module is similar to those flat glasses used in the building and automotive industry. The recovered glass for example is readily accepted by the glass foam and glass insulation industry. 
* Non-silicon based modules: they require specific recycling technologies such as the use of chemical baths in order to separate the different semiconductor materials.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach. 1999. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; For [[cadmium telluride]] modules, the recycling process begins by crushing the module and subsequently separating the different fractions. This recycling process is designed to recover up to 90% of the glass and 95% of the semiconductor materials contained.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger. 1999. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Some commercial-scale recycling facilities have been created in recent years by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach. 1999. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; For aluminium flat plate reflector: the trendiness of the reflectors has been brought up by fabricating them using a thin layer (around 0.016 mm to 0.024 mm) of Aluminum coating present inside the non-recycled plastic food packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8226163/|title=Enhanced radiation trapping technique using low-cost aluminium flat plate reflector a performance analysis on solar PV modules|last=Sonu|first=Mishra|date=December 21, 2017|website=2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 15.9 [[GigaWatt|GW]] of solar PV system installations were completed, with solar PV pricing survey and market research company PVinsights reporting growth of 117.8% in solar PV installation on a year-on-year basis.

With over 100% year-on-year growth in PV system installation, PV module makers dramatically increased their shipments of solar modules in 2010. They actively expanded their capacity and turned themselves into gigawatt [[GigaWatt|GW]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web |url=https://www.helicalpower.com |title=Solar Power Plant Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to PVinsights, five of the top ten PV module companies in 2010 are GW players.

Average pricing information divides in three pricing categories: those buying small quantities (modules of all sizes in the kilowatt range annually), mid-range buyers (typically up to 10 [[MWp]] annually), and large quantity buyers (self-explanatory—and with access to the lowest prices). Over the long term there is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and modules. For example, in 2012 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about US$0.60, which was 250 times lower than the cost in 1970 of US$150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ENF Ltd. |url=http://www.enfsolar.com/news/Small-Chinese-Solar-Manufacturers-Decimated-in-2012 |title=Small Chinese Solar Manufacturers Decimated in 2012 &amp;#124; Solar PV Business News &amp;#124; ENF Company Directory |publisher=Enfsolar.com |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=5954 |title=Harnessing Light |publisher=National Research Council |year=1997 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study shows price/kWh dropping by 10% per year since 1980, and predicts that solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030, whereas the [[International Energy Agency]] predicts 16% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2015.11.001 |title=How predictable is technological progress? |journal=Research Policy |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=647–65 |year=2016 |last1=Farmer |first1=J. Doyne |last2=Lafond |first2=François }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real world energy production costs depend a great deal on local weather conditions. In a cloudy country such as the United Kingdom, the cost per produced kWh is higher than in sunnier countries like Spain.

Following to [[Rocky Mountain Institute|RMI]], [[balance of system|Balance-of-System]] (BoS) elements, this is, non-module cost of non-[[microinverter]] solar modules (as wiring, converters, racking systems and various components) make up about half of the total costs of installations.

For merchant solar power stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the cost of [[solar energy]] will need to match the wholesale electricity price. This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.&lt;ref name=UN-Energy-2012&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.un-energy.org/stories/2498-re-considering-the-economics-of-photovoltaic-power |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516014242/http://www.un-energy.org/stories/2498-re-considering-the-economics-of-photovoltaic-power |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-16 |title=Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author=Morgan Baziliana |work=UN-Energy |publisher=United Nations |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-11-20 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some photovoltaic systems, such as rooftop installations, can supply power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar Photovoltaics competing in the energy sector – On the road to competitiveness |url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Competing_Full_Report.pdf |publisher=EPIA |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226222413/http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Competing_Full_Report.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out by [[UN-Energy]] in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.&lt;ref name=UN-Energy-2012/&gt;

== Mounting and tracking==
{{main article|Photovoltaic mounting system|Solar tracker}}
[[File:EarthRangersCentre-ImageEnhancement.jpg|thumb|Solar modules mounted on solar trackers]]

Ground-mounted photovoltaic systems are usually large, utility-scale [[solar power plants]]. Their solar modules are held in place by racks or frames that are attached to ground-based mounting supports.&lt;ref&gt;SolarProfessional.com [http://solarprofessional.com/articles/products-equipment/racking/ground-mount-pv-racking-systems Ground-Mount PV Racking Systems] March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources [http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/renewables/solar/solar-pv-guide.pdf Ground-Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Systems], December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ground based mounting supports include:
* Pole mounts, which are driven directly into the ground or embedded in concrete.
* Foundation mounts, such as concrete slabs or poured footings
* Ballasted footing mounts, such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the solar module system in position and do not require ground penetration. This type of mounting system is well suited for sites where excavation is not possible such as capped landfills and simplifies decommissioning or relocation of solar module systems.

Roof-mounted solar power systems consist of solar modules held in place by racks or frames attached to roof-based mounting supports.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecodiy.org/california%20PV/californian%20photovoltaic%20best.htm |title=A Guide To Photovoltaic System Design And Installation |publisher=ecodiy.org |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof-based mounting supports include:
* Rail mounts, which are attached directly to the roof structure and may use additional rails for attaching the module racking or frames.
* Ballasted footing mounts, such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the panel system in position and do not require through penetration. This mounting method allows for decommissioning or relocation of solar panel systems with no adverse effect on the roof structure.
*All wiring connecting adjacent solar modules to the energy harvesting equipment must be installed according to local electrical codes and should be run in a conduit appropriate for the climate conditions

[[Solar tracker]]s increase the amount of energy produced per module at a cost of mechanical complexity and need for maintenance. They sense the direction of the Sun and tilt or rotate the modules as needed for maximum exposure to the light.&lt;ref name=NREL_tracker&gt;{{cite web |last=Shingleton |first=J |title=One-Axis Trackers – Improved Reliability, Durability, Performance, and Cost Reduction |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42769.pdf |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mousazadeh |first=Hossain |title=A review of principle and sun-tracking methods for maximizing |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/22199541/1797755549/name/A%252Breview%252Bof%252Bprinciple%252Band%252Bsun-tracking%252Bmethods%252Bfor%252Bmaximizing.pdf |work=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 13 (2009) 1800–1818 |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=2012-12-30 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, fixed racks hold modules stationary as the sun moves across the sky. The fixed rack sets the angle at which the module is held. Tilt angles equivalent to an installation's latitude are common. Most of these fixed racks are set on poles above ground.&lt;ref name=mounting_tilt&gt;{{cite web |title=Optimum Tilt of Solar Panels |url=http://www.solarpaneltilt.com/ |publisher=MACS Lab |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels that face West or East may provide slightly lower energy, but evens out the supply, and may provide more power during peak demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/solarpower/10996273/Most-solar-panels-are-facing-the-wrong-direction-say-scientists.html |title= Most solar panels are facing the wrong direction, say scientists|last=Perry |first=Keith |date= 28 July 2014|website= |publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=9 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

There are many practical applications for the use of solar panels or photovoltaics. It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:

== Limitations==

*;Pollution and Energy in Production 
Solar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations. 

*; Impact on Electricity Network
With the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example in Queensland Australia, there have been more than 30% of households with rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 duck curve appears very often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

*; Implication onto Electricity Bill Management and Energy Investment
There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;L.

In surface erosion, the material only degrades on the surface which causes the material to “shed off” its surface over time.  In bulk erosion, the material loses volume throughout equally, which is represented by the fading colors.]]
'''Surface and bulk erosion''' are two different forms of [[erosion]] that describe how a degrading [[polymer]] erodes.  In surface erosion, the polymer degrades from the exterior surface.  The inside of the material does not degrade until all the surrounding material around it has been degraded.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;Ulery, B.D., Nair, L.S., and Laurencin, C.T. (2011)  Biomedical Applications of Biodegradable Polymers. ''Journal of polymer science'', 49, 832-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  In bulk erosion, degradation occurs throughout the whole material equally. Both the surface and the inside of the material degrade.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt;  Surface erosion and bulk erosion are not exclusive, many materials undergo a combination of surface and bulk erosion.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;Uhrich, K.E., Cannizzaro, S.M., Langer, R.S., and Shakesheff, K.M. (1999) Polymeric Systems for Controlled Drug Release. ''Chem Rev'', 99, 3181−3198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, surface and bulk erosion can be thought of as a spectrum instead of two separate categories.

==Erosion Kinetics==
In surface erosion, the erosion rate is directly proportional to the surface area of the material. For very thin materials, the surface area remains relatively constant when the material degrades, which allows surface erosion to be characterized as zero order release since the rate of degradation is constant.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamada"/&gt; In bulk erosion, the erosion rate depends on the volume of the material.&lt;ref name="Tamada"/&gt;  Due to degradation, the volume of the material decreases during bulk erosion causing the erosion rate to decrease over time. Therefore, bulk erosion rates are difficult to control since it is not zero order.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt; To determine whether a polymer will undergo surface or bulk erosion, the degradation rate of the polymer in water (how fast the polymer reacts to water) and the rate of [[diffusion]] of [[water]] penetrating through the material must be considered. If the degradation process is faster than the diffusion process, surface erosion will occur since the material’s surface will quickly degrade before water has time to diffuse and penetrate through the material. If the diffusion process is faster than the degradation process bulk erosion will occur because water penetrates through the material before significant erosion occurs on the surface.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;Burkersroda, F., Schedl, L., and Göpferich, A. (2002) Why degradable polymers undergo surface erosion or bulk erosion. ''Biomaterials'',  23, 4221-4231.&lt;/ref&gt;  A kinetics of the erosion of a polymer can be modified by changing the diffusion process or the degradation process.  For example, blending a polymer with another polymer that is very reactive to water will speed up the degradation process and cause surface erosion.  On the other hand, decreasing the dimensions of a material will allow water to travel to the center of the material more quickly, which speeds up the diffusion process and causes bulk erosion.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

==Mathematical Model==
By mathematically modeling the rate of diffusion of water in the material and the rate of degradation of the material, it is possible to predict whether a certain material will undergo surface or bulk erosion by looking at the ratio between the two rates.

The rate of diffusion of water is modeled by the equation

&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{diffusion}} = \frac{&lt;x&gt;^2\pi}{4D}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

Where &lt;x&gt; is the mean length of the material and D is the [[diffusion coefficient]] of water inside the polymer.

The rate of degradation is modeled by the following equation

&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{erosion}} = \frac{\ln&lt;x&gt;-\ln\sqrt[3]{M \over N_a(N-1)*p}}{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name = "F"/&gt;

Where M= [[molecular weight]] of polymer, N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=[[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]], N=[[degree of polymerization]], p=[[density]] of polymer, k=degradation rate

The ratio between diffusion time and degradation time gives us a dimensionless parameter ε called the erosion number.&lt;ref name = "F"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Erosion Number} = \frac{t_{\text{diffusion}}}{t_{\text{erosion}}} = \frac{&lt;x&gt;^2\pi*k}{4D*(\ln&lt;x&gt;-\ln\sqrt[3]{M \over N_a(N-1)*p})}&lt;/math&gt;

If ε≫1, surface erosion occurs. If ε≪1, bulk erosion occurs.&lt;ref name = "F"/&gt;

From the model above, it is clear that certain changing certain parameters can determine what kind of erosion a polymer goes through by either increasing or decreasing the rate of the degradation process or the diffusion process.  The table below summarizes how a parameter can be modified to favor surface erosion or bulk erosion.

|-
| '''Degradation rate (k)'''|| Increase|| Decrease
|-

|}

==Applications==
Since surface erosion is easier to control than bulk erosion, surface erosion is preferred in [[drug delivery]] where the release of the drug must be constant or be controlled by changing the dimensions of the material.&lt;ref name="Tamada"&gt;Tamada, J.A. and Langer, R. (1993) Erosion kinetics of hydrolytically degradable polymers. ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'', 90, 552–556.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyu"&gt;Lyu, S. and Untereker, D. (2009) Degradability of Polymers for Implantable Biomedical Devices. ''Int J Mol Sci'', 10, 4033-4065.&lt;/ref&gt;  A zero order release of a drug can be possible with surface erosion if a very thin material is used or if surface area is kept constant.  Surface erosion is also useful for protecting water-soluble drugs until the time of desired drug release, because water will not penetrate through the polymer matrix and reach the drug until all the surrounding polymer has degraded.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;  However, bulk erosion can be useful in situations that do not require controlled release, such as plastic degradation.&lt;ref name="Tamada"/&gt;

'''Piling foundations''' support many historic structures such as canneries, wharves, and shore buildings.  The old pilings present challenging problems during restoration as they age and are destroyed by organisms and decay. Replacing the foundation entirely is possible but expensive. Regularly inspecting and maintaining timber piles may extend the life of the foundation.

== Historic use and treatment in water ==
Timber pile construction in the aquatic and marine environment has a long history in Europe dating as far back as the bronze and stone age in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keller|first1=Ferdinand|last2=Lee|first2=John Edward|title=The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland and Other Parts of Europe|date=1866|publisher=London : Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|pages=1–8, 12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swiss lake dwellers ===
During severe droughts in Switzerland in the mid-nineteenth century, lake areas that had been previously inundated with water, were exposed to reveal ancient archaeological remains of various types of timber piling support assemblies that served has foundations for both individual houses and community buildings. The design of these timber assemblies varied by the time of occupation, whether during the bronze or stone age, and also by geological conditions where the timbers rested.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The communities were called the Swiss Lake Dwellers and were located in various fresh water lakes around Zurich and other areas in Switzerland. During the archaeological excavations, many of the piles dissolved after being in contact with air.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Early building piling foundations in Venice, Italy ===
In Venice, some of the early piling foundations were built on timber piles. The early Venetian constructors used building techniques that included using impermeable stone supported by wooden rafts and timber piles.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preziuso|first1=Cecelia|title=Venice and Its Lagoons|url=http://www.venicethefuture.com/schede/uk/177?aliusid=177|website=Venice the Future|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timber piles did not rot because they were set into the mud at the bottom of the lagoon which prevented oxygen and harmful microbes from reaching them.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Historic treatment and preservation in marine waters ==
=== Treatment methods used prior to 18th century ===
Over 2,000 years ago, wood builders were aware of marine borers and decay and protected wood using crude extracts and various chemicals.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further study on how to address marine borer activity and decay accelerated in the 18th century.

=== Treatment methods revived in 18th &amp; 19th centuries ===
In the 18th and 19th centuries the study of wood preservation was revived due to the deterioration of the timber pile dikes that protected Holland as well as the high level of decay and marine borer activity in English Navy ships.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
The early dikes in Holland were supported by timber piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dike History|url=http://dutchdikes.net/history/|website=Dutch Dikes|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Creosote]] derived from coal processing, was discovered in the mid-18th century to prevent timber pile decay.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The development of [[Creosote]] pressure treatment by John Bethel was also an important advancement in timber piling construction.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Historic buildings supported by timber piles may either be either treated with Creosote or Chromated Copper Arsenate.

== Types of wood used ==
Douglas-Fir timber piles are used most often in the Pacific Northwest while Southern Pine are used most commonly on the East Coast. Douglas-Fir is used most commonly used on the west coast due to its high strength, renewability and low cost.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Piling deterioration problems ==

=== Marine borers ===
There are three groups of marine borers in West Coast waters including gribbles, shipworms, and pholads, and each differs in the type of damage it causes.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gribbles ====
A [[Gribble]] (Limnoria) is a destructive crustacean that burrows into the wood surfaces.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Unlike other marine borers, gribbles travel easily from timber to timber using the wood for food and shelter.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Gribbles burrow to a shallow depth but can still reduce pile diameter by one inch per year; a gribble infested pile typically has an hour-glass shape at the tide line.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

==== Shipworms ====
[[File:Teredolites 012416.jpg|thumb|Teredolites 012416]]
[[Shipworms]] (Teredolite) are wood-boring bivalves that burrow deeply into submerged wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasiotis|first1=Stephen|title=KU Ichnology Studying the Traces of Life|url=http://ichnology.ku.edu/invertebrate_traces/tfimages/teredolites.html|website=KU Ichnology|publisher=IBGS Research Group|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although piles attacked by shipworms may appear sound on the surface, they may be completely riddled with a maze of tunnels.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Shipworms can spread to new wood only when they are in the free-swimming larval stage.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once they attack and bore into the wood, they become imprisoned within it.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Ancient mariners, realizing that shipworms were imprisoned in the wood of their ships, would sail far up river and remain in fresh water for a number of months to kill the shipworms.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Experienced divers look for siphons that project from the wood or use sonic devices to estimate the extent of internal damage.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Shipworm and gribble attacks can also be detected
by immersing untreated wood panels and destructively sampling them at monthly intervals.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==== Pholads ====
Pholads, rock-burrowing clams, burrow into and damage untreated wood in warmer waters near Hawaii and Mexico and along Oregon beaches boring only into the surface of the wood.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Ensuring that the shell of the wood is undamaged will keep this Pholad borer at bay.

=== Insects ===
Wood above the waterline may be attacked by a number of insects, including termites, carpenter ants, and beetles.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One beetle, the wharf borer (''Nacedes melanura''), can attack untreated or damaged treated hardwoods and conifers with high moisture contents by tunneling extensively and leaving behind dark brown fecal matter that further degrades the wood.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

=== Wood decay ===
Wood decay describes wood in all stages of fungal attack, from the initial invasion of hyphae into the cell walls to the complete destruction of the wood.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood-inhabiting fungi are most common on timber piles above the water surface since the lack of oxygen below water inhibits fungal growth.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

==== Methods of detecting decay ====
Incipient decay may develop in untreated pile tops within 1 year and reach the visible, advanced stage, termed rot, within 2 to 4 years and can extend 4 feet or more from the internally rotting areas of a Douglas-fir pile.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; A triangular blade scraper, a sharp shovel, or a dull probe are useful when inspecting piles for surface deterioration or marine borer attack because they allow the inspector to estimate the depth of deterioration.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  Because untreated wood can often be exposed while these tools are being used, a preservative solution or paste should be applied to exposed areas.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

=== Cracks ===
Cracks that have developed after the wood has been treated are highly susceptible to borers, insects and decay in the right conditions. Cracks need to be evaluated during an initial pile inspection to ascertain depth, location and treatment condition.

== Decay treatment options ==
=== Liquid preservatives ===
Apply a liquid preservative to cutoff tops of piles and timbers by flooding them
with hot creosote (150 to 200&amp;nbsp;°F), pentachlorophenol in diesel oil, or copper naphthenate in mineral spirits.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solid Preservatives ===
A solid preservative, such as Fluor-Chrome-Arsenic-Phenol (FCAP), can be applied dry or as a paste where hawsers rip off caps and expose wood to moisture and decay organisms.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

== Borer attack treatment options ==
=== Creosote, CCA, and ACA ===
Creosote effectively prevents attack by marine borers in coastal waters north of San Francisco and inorganic salts [Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) or Ammoniacal Copper Arsenate (ACA) are recommended south of San Francisco because of the likelihood of attack by the wood borer that is predominantly located in warmer waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers and plastic wraps ===
Impermeable barriers can protect preservative-treated wood piles under the waterline from marine borer attack by inhibiting the entry of borers into the wood and creating anaerobic conditions that kill established borers by limiting the available oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood and concrete reinforcement ===
A heavily damaged piling structure can be reinforced by cutting out the damaged section and replacing it with preservative-treated wood.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrell|first1=Jeffery, J.|last2=Helsing|first2=Guy G.|last3=Graham|first3=Robert D.|title=Marine Wood Maintenance Manual: A Guide for Proper Use of Douglas-Fir in Marine Exposures|journal=Forest Research Lab, College of Forestry and Sea Grant Program|date=October 1984|issue=48|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrapping piles with plastic barriers can provide protection from marine borers for 25 years or more.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Pile reinforcement with concrete can be sufficient by filling the void with coarse stone and mortar.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Where damage is more severe, forms made of metal, wood, concrete, woven nylon, or pitch-impregnated fiber are attached to the pile as far down as 2 feet below the mudline.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;

== Required maintenance &amp; inspection ==
=== Inspection interval ===
In order to effectively preserve and maintain timber piles, regular inspection is required to detect deteriorating structures before replacement is necessary.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Pile inspections should take place every five years.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

== Inspect pilings removed from service ==
One of the best ways to ascertain the cause of deterioration as well as what stage the deterioration is in, is to inspect a piling that has been removed from service.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The loss of one piling used for inspection might save the remaining timber pilings and members from being replaced. In order to diagnose the problems, cut the timbers into short sections and longitudinally split each section in order to see how far the preservative has penetrated.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Reuse of any treated timber pile supplied by an outside source is not recommended. Not knowing the applied treatment, past use, or if diesel fuels have been applied to the surface used to give the appearance of a recent retreatment could decrease the life of the pile. Some unscrupulous suppliers of used timber piles should be avoided, because some contractors have applied diesel fuel to the outside of the piles to bring the embedded creosote to the surface.

[[File:Vacuum fluorescent 1.jpg|thumb|right|A full view of a typical vacuum fluorescent display used in a [[videocassette recorder]]]]
[[File:Vacuum fluorescent_2.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up of the VFD highlighting the multiple [[electrical filament|filament]]s, tensioned by the sheet metal [[spring (device)|springs]] at the right of the image]]
[[File:VFD2.jpg|thumb|right|VFD display. All segments are visible due to external ultraviolet illumination.]]

A '''vacuum fluorescent display''' ('''VFD''') is a [[display device]] used commonly on consumer electronics equipment such as [[video cassette recorder]]s, [[car audio|car radio]]s, and [[microwave oven]]s. 

A VFD operates on the principle of [[cathodoluminescence]], roughly similar to a [[cathode ray tube]], but operating at much lower voltages. Each tube in a VFD has a [[phosphor]] coated [[anode]] that is bombarded by electrons emitted from the [[thermionic cathode|cathode filament]].&lt;ref name="ShionoyaYen1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shigeo Shionoya|author2=William M. Yen|title=Phosphor Handbook|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-7560-6|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, each tube in a VFD is a [[triode]] vacuum tube because it also has a mesh control grid.&lt;ref name="ChenCranton2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janglin Chen|author2=Wayne Cranton|author3=Mark Fihn|title=Handbook of Visual Display Technology|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-79566-7|pages=1056, 1067–1068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[liquid crystal display]]s, a VFD emits a very bright light with high contrast and can support display elements of various colors. Standard illumination figures for VFDs are around 640 [[Candela per square metre|cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] with high-brightness VFDs operating at 4,000&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and experimental units as high as 35,000&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the drive voltage and its timing.&lt;ref name="ChenCranton2011"/&gt; The choice of color (which determines the nature of the phosphor) and display brightness significantly affect the lifetime of the tubes, which can range from as low as 1,500 hours for a vivid red VFD to 30,000 hours for the more common green ones.&lt;ref name="ChenCranton2011"/&gt; [[Cadmium]] was commonly used in VFDs in the past, but the current [[RoHS]]-compliant VFDs have eliminated this metal from their construction.

VFDs can display [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]] numerals, multi-segment alpha-numeric characters or can be made in a dot-matrix to display different alphanumeric characters and symbols. In practice, there is little limit to the shape of the image that can be displayed: it depends solely on the shape of phosphor on the anode(s).

The first VFD was the single indication DM160 by Philips in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_dm160.html|title=DM 160, Tube DM160; Röhre DM 160 ID19445, INDICATOR, in gene|first=Ernst Erb|last=(HB9RXQ)|website=www.radiomuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first multi-segment VFD was the 1962 Japanese single-digit, seven-segment device. The displays became common on calculators and other consumer electronics devices.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Castellano (ed), ''Handbook of display technology'' Gulf Professional Publishing, 1992 {{ISBN|0-12-163420-5}} page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1980s hundreds of millions of units were made yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Castellano (ed), ''Handbook of display technology'' Gulf Professional Publishing, 1992 {{ISBN|0-12-163420-5}} page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Vacuum Fluorescent Digit.jpg|thumb|right|[[:en:Macro photography|Macro image]] of a VFD digit with 3 horizontal tungsten wires and control grid.]]
The device consists of a [[hot cathode]] ([[electrical filament|filament]]s), [[anode]]s ([[phosphor]]) and grids encased in a [[glass]] envelope under a high [[vacuum]] condition.  The cathode is made up of fine [[tungsten]] [[wire]]s, coated by [[alkaline earth]] [[metal oxide]]s, which emit [[electron]]s when heated by an electric current.  These electrons are controlled and [[diffusion|diffused]] by the grids, which are made up of thin metal. If electrons impinge on the phosphor-coated plates, they [[fluorescence|fluoresce]], emitting light. Unlike the orange-glowing cathodes of traditional vacuum tubes, VFD cathodes are efficient emitters at much lower temperatures, and are therefore essentially invisible.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Castellano (ed), ''Handbook of display technology'', Gulf Professional Publishing, 1992 {{ISBN|0-12-163420-5}} Chapter 7 Vacuum Fluorescent Displays pp. 163 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of operation is identical to that of a vacuum tube [[triode]]. Electrons can only reach (and "illuminate") a given plate element if both the grid and the plate are at a positive potential with respect to the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Elektrotechnik Tabellen Kommunikationselektronik|date=1999|publisher=Westermann|location=Braunschweig, Germany|isbn=3142250379|page=110|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the displays to be organized as [[multiplexed display]]s where the multiple grids and plates form a matrix, minimizing the number of signal pins required. In the example of the VCR display shown to the right, the grids are arranged so that only one digit is illuminated at a time. All of the similar plates in all of the digits (for example, all of the lower-left plates in all of the digits) are connected in parallel. One by one, the [[microprocessor]] driving the display enables a digit by placing a positive voltage on that digit's grid and then placing a positive voltage on the appropriate plates. Electrons flow through that digit's grid and strike those plates that are at a positive potential. The microprocessor cycles through illuminating the digits in this way at a rate high enough to create the illusion of all digits glowing at once via [[persistence of vision]].

The extra indicators (in our example, "VCR", "Hi-Fi", "STEREO", "SAP", etc.) are arranged as if they were segments of an additional digit or two or extra segments of existing digits and are scanned using the same multiplexed strategy as the real digits. Some of these extra indicators may use a phosphor that emits a different color of light, for example, orange.

The light emitted by most VFDs contains many colors and can often be [[color filter|filtered]] to enhance the [[colorfulness|color saturation]] providing a deep green or deep blue, depending on the whims of the product's designers. Phosphors used in VFDs are different from those in cathode-ray displays since they must emit acceptable brightness with only around 50 volts of electron energy, compared to several thousand volts in a CRT.&lt;ref&gt;William M.

Besides brightness, VFDs have the advantages of being rugged, inexpensive, and easily configured to display a wide variety of customized messages, and unlike LCDs, VFDs are not limited by the response time of rearranging liquid crystals and are thus able to function normally in cold, even sub-zero, temperatures, making them ideal for outdoor devices in cold climates. Early on, the main disadvantage of such displays was their use of significantly more power (0.2 [[watt]]s) than a simple LCD. This was considered a significant drawback for battery-operated equipment like calculators, so VFDs ended up being used mainly in equipment powered by an [[alternating current|AC]] supply or heavy-duty rechargeable batteries.

During the 1980s, this display began to be used in automobiles, especially where car makers were experimenting with digital displays for vehicle instruments such as speedometers and odometers. A good example of these were the high-end [[Subaru]] cars made in the early 1980s (referred to by Subaru enthusiasts as a ''digi-dash'', or digital [[dashboard]]). The brightness of VFDs makes them well suited for use in cars. Current models of Renault MPV, Scenic and Espace use VFD panels to show all functions on the dashboard including the radio and multi message panel. They are bright enough to read in full sunlight as well as dimmable for use at night. This panel uses four colors; the usual blue/green as well as deep blue, red and yellow/orange.

This technology was also used from 1979 to the mid-1980s in portable [[electronic game]] units. These games featured bright, clear displays but the size of the largest vacuum tubes that could be manufactured inexpensively kept the size of the displays quite small, often requiring the use of magnifying [[Fresnel lens]]es.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  While later games had sophisticated multi-color displays, early games achieved color effects using transparent filters to change the color of the (usually light blue) light emitted by the phosphors. High power consumption and high manufacturing cost contributed to the demise of the VFD as a videogame display. [[LCD games]] could be manufactured for a fraction of the price, did not require frequent changes of batteries (or AC adapters) and were much more portable. Since the late 1990s, backlit color active-matrix LCD displays have been able to cheaply reproduce arbitrary images in any color, a marked advantage over fixed-color, fixed-character VFDs. This is one of the main reasons for the decline in popularity of VFDs, although they continue to be made. Many low-cost DVD players still feature VFDs.

From the mid-1980s onwards, VFDs were used for applications requiring smaller displays with high brightness specifications, though now the adoption of high-brightness [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs) is pushing VFDs out of these markets.

In addition to the widely used fixed character VFD, a graphic type made of an array of individually addressable pixels is also available. These more sophisticated displays offer the flexibility of displaying arbitrary images, and may still be a useful choice for some types of consumer equipment.

=== Use as amplifier ===

Several [[Amateur radio operator|radio amateurs]] have experimented with the possibilities of using VFDs as [[Triode|triode amplifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N9WOS|title=VFD as an audio/RF amplifier?|url=https://www.electronicspoint.com/threads/vfd-as-an-audio-rf-amplifier.29314/|website=Electronics Point forums|accessdate=11 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311174040/https://www.electronicspoint.com/threads/vfd-as-an-audio-rf-amplifier.29314/|archivedate=11 March 2018|date=29 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eham.net/articles/20582 |title=H.

== Fade ==

Fading is sometimes a problem with VFD displays. Light output drops over time due to falling emission and reduction of phosphor efficiency. How quickly and how far this falls depends on the construction and operation of the VFD. In some equipment, loss of VFD output can render the equipment inoperable.

Emission may usually be restored by raising filament voltage. Thirty-three percent voltage boost can rectify moderate fade, and 66% boost severe fade.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This can make the filaments visible in use, though the usual green-blue VFD filter helps reduce any such red or orange light from the filament.

Some researchers suggest that "zapping" the phosphor and heater(s) with selected laser wavelengths (patent pending) can restore some lost emission by annealing the phosphor and exposing fresh heater electron emitting material in some cases.
A related approach appears to also work on [[OLED]] displays by a different mechanism. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== History ==

Of the three prevalent display technologies – VFD, LCD, and LED – the VFD was the first to be developed. It was used in early handheld calculators. LED displays displaced VFDs in this use as the very small LEDs used required less power, thereby extending battery life, though early LED displays had problems achieving uniform brightness levels across all display segments. Later, LCDs displaced LEDs, offering even lower power requirements.

The first VFD was the single indication DM160 by Philips in 1959. It could easily be driven by transistors, so was aimed at computer applications as it was easier to drive than a neon and had longer life than a light bulb. This was made obsolete by LEDs. The 1962 Japanese single digit seven segment display in terms of anode was more like the Philips DM70 / DM71 Magic Eye as the DM160 has a spiral wire anode. The Japanese seven segment VFD meant that no patent royalties needed to be paid on desk calculator displays as would have been the case using [[Nixie tube|Nixies]] or Planaplex neon digits. In the UK the Philips designs were made and marketed by Mullard (almost wholly owned by Philips even before WWII).

The Russian IV-15 VFD tube is very similar to the DM160. The DM160, DM70/DM71 and Russian IV-15 can (like a VFD panel) be used as [[triode]]s. The DM160 is thus the smallest VFD and smallest triode valve. The [http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_iv-15.html IV-15] is slightly different shape (see [http://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/no_plate.html#5 photo of DM160 and IV-15] for comparison).
