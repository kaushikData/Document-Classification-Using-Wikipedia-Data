This edition of the [[Flying Broom International Women's Film Festival]], which was founded in 1997 and is organized by Flying Broom with support from the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] municipality in Ankara and accredited by [[FIPRESCI]], had the theme of ''evil'' and focused on the problems of women (including prostitutes, migrant women, poor women and lesbians). The festival opened with a ceremony at the Ankara State Opera and Ballet Hall on May 6, 2010 at which honorary awards were presented to actresses [[Lale Belkıs]] and [[Gülsen Tuncer]], and art director [[Deniz Özen]], who attended the special screening of Turkish classic ''[[Unmade Bed (film)|Unmade Bed]]'' ({{lang-tr|Dağınık Yatak}}) directed by [[Atıf Yılmaz]].

'''''A Great Wall''''' is a 1986 [[comedy-drama]] film written, directed and starring [[Peter Wang]]. It was the first American feature film shot in the [[People's Republic of China]] and was [[Kelvin Han Yee]]'s first film.

==Plot==
When a [[Silicon Valley]] [[Chinese American]] executive goes back to his homeland of China for the first time in 30 years, he and his family encounter many culture clashes between the lives that they lead in the United States and the lives of their relatives in China. The finale of the movie includes an exciting table tennis match involving the Chinese-American son played by [[Kelvin Han Yee]].

==Reception==
The film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 80% with a certified "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 5 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/great_wall/|title=A Great Wall (Beijing Story)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed film critic [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''Chicago-Sun Times'' awarded the film with 3 out of 4 stars and wrote of the film saying "A Great Wall is a human comedy about a Chinese-American family that goes to visit relatives in Peking, and within that simple premise are so many inspirations that the movie is interesting even when it's just looking at things." and went on to say "The chief pleasure of "A Great Wall" is its observation of the different attitudes toward the daily process of living in China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-great-wall-1986|title=A Great Wall, Roger Ebert Review|date=18 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apadana''' ({{lang-peo|𐎠𐎱𐎭𐎠𐎴}}) is a large [[hypostyle]] hall, best said the great audience hall and portico at [[Persepolis]] and the [[palace of Susa]]. The Persepolis Apadana belongs to the oldest building phase of the city of Persepolis, the first half of the 6th century BC, as part of the original design by [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]. Its construction completed by [[Xerxes I]]. Modern scholarships "demonstrates the metaphorical nature of the Apadana reliefs as idealised social orders".&lt;ref name=mcool&gt;[[#refmcool|M. Root (1986)]] p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "apadana"==
As a word, "apadāna" ([[Old Persian]][[wikt:𐎠𐎱𐎭𐎠𐎴|𐎠𐎱𐎭𐎠𐎴]], masc.) is used to designate a hypostyle hall, i.e., a palace or audience hall of stone construction with columns. The word is rendered in [[Elamite]] as ''ha-ha-da-na'' and in [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] ''ap-pa-da-an'' is etymologically ambiguous. It has been compared to the [[Sanskrit]] "apadana" ( आपादन) which means 'to arrive at', and also to the Sanskrit ''apa-dhā'' ( अपधा) which means "a hide-out or concealment", and the Greek ''apo-thēkē'' "storehouse". The word survived into later periods in Iran, as the Parthian 'pdn(y) or 'pdnk(y) "palace", and outside Iran it still survives in several languages as loan-words (including the Arabic ''fadan'', the Armenian ''[[wikt:ապարանք|aparan-kʿ]]'' "palace".)&lt;ref&gt;R. Schmitt, [[#refapadana-EI|Apadana]] i. Term, in ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, however, this word is the direct ancestor of the medieval and modern architectural term, ayvan/[[iwan|aywan]]. The [[Old Persian]]   term [[wikt:𐎠𐎱𐎭𐎠𐎴|𐎠𐎱𐎭𐎠𐎴]], a-pad-an, standing for "unprotected", refers to the fact that the [[veranda]]-shaped structure is open to the outside elements on one of its four sides, and thus 'unprotected' / exposed to the natural elements. This is exactly what the Apadana palace has: open (columned) verandas on three sides—a unique feature among all palace buildings at [[Persepolis]].  The [[Parthia]]n and [[Sasanian]] architects largely did away with the columns holding up the ceiling of the veranda, replacing them with a [[barrel vault]]ing, such as the famous Ayvan of Kisra at [[Ctesiphon]]. The later evolution of term into [[aywan]] in the post-Islamic architecture that evolved from the old "apadana", refers to both columned (such as the palace of [[Chehel Sotoun]], [[Isfahan]]) or barrel vaulted (all the [[four-aywan]]ed mosques). Like the old Apadana, the new aywans are also verandas: open to the natural elements on one side.

As a modern architectural and archaeological term, the word "apadana" is also used to refer to [[Urartu|Urartian]] hypostyle halls, such as those excavated at [[Altintepe]] and [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]]. These halls predate those from Persia, and it has been proposed that Urartu could be the stylistic origin of the later Persian hypostyle audience halls.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin, "Greece, from Mycenae to the Parthenon (Taschen's World Architecture)", 1997. p116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Apadana was the largest building on the Terrace at Persepolis and was excavated by the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and his assistant Friedrich Krefter, and Erich Schmidt, between 1931 and 1939. Important material relevant to the excavations are today housed in the archives of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC.

It was most likely the main hall of the kings.  The columns reached 20m high and had complex capitals in the shape of bulls or lions. Here, the great king received the tribute from all the nations in the Achaemenid Empire, and gave presents in return.

Access to the hall is given by two monumental stairways, on the north and on the east. These are decorated by reliefs, showing delegates of the 23 subject nations of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] paying tribute to [[Darius I]], who is represented seated centrally. The various delegates are shown in great detail, giving insight into the costume and equipment of the various peoples of Persia in the 5th century BC. There are inscriptions in [[Old Persian]] and [[Elamite]].

==Measurements==
The Apadana at Persepolis has a surface of 1000 square metres; its roof was supported by 72 columns, each 24 metres tall. The entire hall was destroyed in 331 BC by the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. Stones from the columns were used as building material for nearby settlements. By the start of the 20th century, only 13 of these giant columns were still standing. The re-erecting of a complete, but fallen column in the 1970s, is now the 14th standing column of the Apadana.

The [[Apadana in Susa]] was—like the city itself—largely abandoned, and pillaged for building material.

It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  The [[Lutheran]] churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches,&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; and also encouraged prints and book illustrations.  [[Calvinist]]s remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. 

In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

==Art and the Reformation==

[[File:Altaarretabel Domkerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Altar piece in [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht]], attacked by Calvinists in the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566. This [[retable]] became visible again after restoration in 1919 removed the false wall placed in front of it.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement "created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Historicist and ''Causes of the Reformation.'' New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation produced two main branches of [[Protestantism]]; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith.&lt;ref name="Picken2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Stuart D.B.|title=Historical Dictionary of Calvinism|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810872240|page=1|quote=While Germany and the Scandinavian countries adopted the Lutheran model of church and state, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, what is now the Czech Republic, and Scotland created Reformed Churches based, in varying ways, on the model Calvin set up in Geneva. Although England pursued the Reformation ideal in its own way, leading to the formation of the Anglican Communion, the theology of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were heavily influenced by Calvinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical [[Andreas Karlstadt]].  For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like [[Last Supper (Cranach)|the ''Last Supper'' by the younger Cranach]] were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional [[depiction of Jesus]]. As such, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior. This much is evident from the background of an epitaph pained in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans proudly employed the use of the [[crucifix]] as it highlighted their high view of the [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarquardtJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71|quote=In fact, Lutherans often justified their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories grew up of "indestructible" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Lutherans, "the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image."&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=C. Scott|title=Contesting the Reformation|date=9 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|language=English|isbn=9781118272305|page=146|quote=According to Koerner, who dwells on Lutheran art, the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there was a wave of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], or the destruction of religious imagery.  This began very early in the Reformation, when students in [[Erfurt]] destroyed a wooden altar in the [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] in December 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 19, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as [[idolatry]], especially [[sculpture]] and large paintings.  Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private.   Reformed leaders, especially [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Institutes, 1:11, section 7 on crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored.  It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic ''coup'', and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities{{snd}} for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland.  

But reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau Göldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise.  She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties.  Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the [[French Wars of Religion]], even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:St. Michaelis Oberkleen Blick nach Westen 02.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Daniel Hisgen]]'s paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries.  Here the Creation (left) to the [[Annunciation]] can be seen.]]

Subjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]], such as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology.  As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers.  Calvinism even objected to non-religious [[funerary art]], such as the [[heraldry]] and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there was religious art, iconic images of [[Christ]] and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy.  Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]''.  [[Daniel Hisgen]], a German [[Rococo]] painter of the 18th century in [[Upper Hesse]], specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples.  Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.

Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the "[[Second Reformation]]" of about 1560-1619.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somehwat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 84. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQjGmEUtbPMC&amp;pg=PA84 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Against the Reformed, Lutherans exclaimed: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The [[Beeldenstorm]], a large and very disorderly wave of Calvinist mob destruction of Catholic images and church fittings that spread through the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 was the largest outbreak of this sort, with drastic political repercussions.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign of Calvinist iconoclasm "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns to the German actions, but with the addition of encouragement and sometimes finance from the national government, were seen in Anglican England in the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Commonwealth]] in the next century, when more damage was done to art in medieval parish churches than during the [[English Reformation]].

A major theological difference between Protestantism and [[Catholicism]] is the question of [[transubstantiation]], or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the former as a [[sacramental union]] and the latter as a [[pneumatic presence]].&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A.

They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper.  This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the [[Eucharist]], as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.

The Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of [[printmaking]] in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.

There was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with [[popular prints]] by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines.  On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the [[Last Supper]].

== Genre and landscape ==

After the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant [[iconography]] of Bible illustration in book illustrations and [[old master print|prints]].  In the early Reformation artists, especially [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints.  Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes.  There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time.  This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.

[[Peter Bruegel]] (1525–1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons.  In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders.  Bruegel’s ''Wedding Feast'', portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1489–1533), is known mostly for his [[engraving]]s, such as ''The Milkmaid'', which depicts peasants with milk cows.  This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation,  contains no reference to religion or [[classicism]], although much of his other work features both.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Bruegel]]'s ''Peasant Wedding Feast''.]]
Bruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as ''Summer'' from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

With the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for ''The Four Winds'', a publishing house owned by [[Hieronymus Cock]]. ''The Four Winds'' provided the public with almost a thousand [[etching]]s and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.

The courtly style of [[Northern Mannerism]] in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 98-101 on Rudolf, and Strong, Pt. 2, Chapter 3 on France, especially pp. 98-101, 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging [[classical mythology]] in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.

==Council of Trent==
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1534-41) came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].]]

During the Reformation a great divergence arose between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the [[Council of Trent]] to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities.  The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Italian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of [[Venice]], developed into [[Mannerism]], a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population.  Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the  [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art.  Previous Catholic [[Church council]]s had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

Statements are often made along the lines of "The [[decrees]] of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saint’s life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage [[piety]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Art in Renaissance Italy.'' Paoletti, John T., and Gary M. Radke. Pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.

And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian [[Molanus]], Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable.  Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', chapter VIII, especially pp. 107-128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the great medievalist [[Émile Mâle]], this was "the death of medieval art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielmitsui.tripod.com/aaaaa/deathart.html The death of Medieval Art]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Extract from book by [[Émile Mâle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and the Counter-Reformation ==
[[File:Lamentation Scipione Pulzone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', a typical Counter-Reformation work.]]

While Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more "secular" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the "natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image",&lt;ref&gt;''Art of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Nosotro, Rit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Reformation]] Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content,  glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the [[sacraments]] and the [[saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Counter Reformation.'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Lamport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442271593|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the [[tabernacle]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]], who invented the term ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'', cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Sidney) Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s (1550–1598) painting of the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] which was commissioned for the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1589 is a ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'' work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.

[[File:Paolo Veronese.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Last Supper ([[The Feast in the House of Levi]])'']]
Ten years after the Council of Trent's decree [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned by the [[Inquisition]] to explain why his ''Last Supper'', a huge canvas for the [[refectory]] of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.&lt;ref name="Transcript of Veronese's testimony"&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of Veronese's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;  Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.&lt;ref name="David Rostand 1997"&gt;David Rostand, ''Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto'', 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP {{ISBN|0-521-56568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving.  The pre-existing decline in "[[donor portrait]]s" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.

[[File:Las lagrimas de san Pedro El Greco 1580.jpg|thumb|240px|''Repentance of Peter'' by [[El Greco]], 1580–1586.]]
Further waves of "Counter-Reformation art" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new [[Spanish Netherlands]] (essentially modern [[Belgium]]), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  [[Rubens]] was one of a number of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque painters]] who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  Several cities in France in the [[French wars of religion]] and in Germany, [[Bohemia]] and elsewhere in the [[Thirty Years War]] saw similar bursts of restocking.

The rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in [[Antwerp]] in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by [[Rubens]] and other Flemish artists (and in particular the [[Jesuits]] continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The ''[[Repentance of Peter]]'', showing the end of the episode of the ''[[Denial of Peter]]'', was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621).   The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes "the [[rooster|cock]]" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, [[Rome]] once again began to assert its [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] to other nations around the world. The religious order of the [[Jesuits]] or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the [[Americas]], parts of [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[eastern Asia]] and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian [[faith]]. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.

Despite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two "blocs".  Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.

In [[television studies]], '''B-television''' or '''B-TV''' is the term used as an analogy to "[[B-movie]]" to describe such traits of [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[Television#Content|television]] as shallowness, lack of originality, sensationalism, preponderance of escapist entertainment to serious news, personalization and dramatization.

==Overview==
The German media scholar [[:de:Heidemarie Schumacher|Heidemarie Schumacher]] used the term in 1985 in his article ''From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German "B-Television" programs'' to characterize the development of German commercial television, which adopted "the aesthetics of commercials" with its "inane positiveness radiated by every participant, the inclusion of clips, soft focus, catchy music" as well as "promotion of merchandise through product placement".&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monoskop.org/images/6/64/New_German_Critique_No_78_Special_Issue_on_German_Media_Studies_1999.pdf|title=From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German "B-Television" programs|publisher=Schüren Verlag, Marburg|first=Heidemarie|last=Schumacher|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized. Newly established commercial stations, operating without the burden of societal legitimacy, focused solely on profitability. To establish and maintain viewer loyalty these stations would broadcast reality shows, sensational journalism, daily soap operas, infotainment programs, talk shows, game shows and soft pornography. "Product placement series that unabashedly display" branded products "are the overt expression of a kind of television refunctionalized as a supermarket",&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"/&gt; laments Schumacher.

In his article Schumacher mentions ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by an American cultural critic [[Neil Postman]], who formulated the thesis of television programming as a derivative of advertising, creating "a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing".

Like Postman, Schumacher notes that contemporary television advertisement often chooses to reinforce brand loyalty rather than promoting product. This [[reverse marketing]] approach is used by television broadcasters to advertise the stations themselves. Schumacher lists three specific principles:  grabbing the viewers' attention, establishing emotional involvement with the audience, and maintaining the viewers' interest as the cornerstones to acquiring and maintaining market share. A commercial [[RTL Television|RTL]] station described such a building of viewers' loyalty in positive terms: "RTL has discovered something entirely new for television. The viewer".&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"/&gt;

==Daily routine==
Schumacher argues that viewer loyalty is established primarily through the representation of familiar emotional situations and the everyday problems of the viewers, which means that private stations broadcast predominantly private affairs. Further development of this approach led to creation of reality TV shows, which generate new realities by intervening directly in the actual life of its participants. Such personalisation and dramatization of television precipitated the "Fall of Public Man", in words of [[Richard Sennett]].

The strategy of creating viewer loyalty through emotional sensations is reflected in scandalous "special news" that "favor sex and crime topics and employ highly affective commentary style, a clip aesthetic as well as a musical accompaniment borrowed
from the crime film genre".&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"/&gt; As an example, Schumacher mentions ''[[Real Personal (TV series)|Real Personal]]'' talk show about human sexuality that was televised by [[NBC]] five times a week during 1990s. "The title itself encapsulates the message of 'B-TV': real people and their 'real' problems are the focus here",&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"/&gt; contemplates Schumacher.

Mentioning the highly successful entertainment programs of [[David Letterman]] and [[Jay Leno]], Schumacher proclaims that a talk show host, seen daily on the television screen, becomes almost a part of the family. "Spreading not only inanity, but also a sense of security", the host "provides a fixed portion of our daily routine" along with a daily soap opera, daily infotainment show or a daily game show.

"Appeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance the ability of 'B-TV' to exploit the market", concludes Schumacher.

==Proxy for conversation==

The concept of personalization and dramatization was not lost on the creators of [[BuzzFeed#Video|BuzzFeed]] a quarter century later, when they got interested in why some [[internet video]]s become viral. "It turned out that the valuable things did not spread, and the things that did spread were used by people as a proxy of conversation, as an extension of themselves",&lt;ref name="zefrank"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fora.tv/2015/05/14/Where_We_Have_Been_and_Where_We_Are_Going|title=Where We Have Been and Where We Are Going?|last=Frank |first=Ze|website=fora.tv|date=14 May 2015|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; says Ze Frank, president of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures.

"We looked at the things people share, and we came up with three categories that were interesting to us: first, people expressing a part of their identitity. The second is emotional gifting. The third is social information 'Hey, we were talking about this the other day'. The information is already known, it is not new, all it does it helps resurfacing a known entity inside of a social connection. ... How do you use it? If identity can be expressed with content, what kinds of identities you can come up with? ... And then you make a crapload of content ... Our studio makes almost a 100 pieces of short form videos a week. ... [In broadcast television] you have to capture as large audience as possible and program for this audience, because the number of attention slots is finite. This means that 'niche' becomes a pejorative, and many people are left out of media conversation and have no chance to say: 'oh, my god, this is totally me'. The new era [of Internet video] allows us to multiply across these different experiences".&lt;ref name="zefrank"/&gt; This approach worked and brought BuzzFeed millions of views and shares. 

Going forward, BuzzFeed realized that a shareable video carrying [[branded content|branded]] message can reach a wide audience for a fraction of advertising budget used for traditional advertising campaign. "We are applying the same general strategy: what are the values the brand is trying to communicate, and how they fit with the nearest social values that we know are fundamental to the consumer. ... We had a  campaign for new lightweight kitty litter. The national campaign shown on broadcast television had people throwing litter into each other. It was beautifully shot, but it did not align with a single social value I can think of. Throwing litter into each other has a zero chance of being used to connect to another human being. So we took a step back and made a video which is more about relationship with cats, and we used the same kind of general idea of voice-over, and the video did really well".&lt;ref name="zefrank"/&gt;

While Schumacher and Postman regret the prevalence of "advertisement television" with low informational and social value on commercial TV stations, BuzzFeed intentionally produce personalized videos with capacity for sharing. Unlike traditional television, where viewers consume the content passively, users of internet video platforms share the videos they identify with, multiplying the effect of an advertising campaign.

==Cheap escapism==

Erik Henriksen from [[The Portland Mercury]] used the term "B-TV" when he reviewed ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' television series to describe the kind of show that is not "genuinely great", but one that "just works—albeit in a vaguely embarrassing and silly way—at entertaining the audience, at stringing along the same characters from week to week, at churning out boilerplate plots that are nonetheless peppered with just enough originality and uniqueness to make them enjoyable and fun and distracting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2011/08/19/blu-ray-review-sort-of-stargate-atlantis|title=Blu-ray Review (Sort of): Stargate Atlantis|last=Henriksen |first=Erik|website=''portlandmercury.com''|date=19 August 2011|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balenciaga''' ({{IPA-es|balenˈθjaɣa}}) is a [[Luxury goods#Luxury brands|luxury]] [[fashion house]] founded in Spain by [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], a [[fashion designers|designer]] born in the Basque Country, Spain. The brand is now owned by the French [[multinational company]] [[Kering]]. Balenciaga had a reputation as a ''[[Haute couture|couturier]]'' of uncompromising standards and was referred to as "the master of us all" by [[Christian Dior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Menkes| first =Suzy| title =Miuccia Prada: 'The mistress of us all'| publisher = International Herald Tribune | date =2006-02-27| url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/26/opinion/rprada.php| accessdate = 2007-03-11 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070311030353/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/26/opinion/rprada.php| archivedate= 11 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet "modernistic silhouettes" became the trademarks of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Snodgrass |first1=Mary Ellen |title=World Clothing and Fashion: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Social Influence |date=March 17, 2015 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=1317451678 |page=54–55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO9nBwAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cristobal Balenciaga.jpg|thumb|Cristóbal Balenciaga, founder of the house in 1917]]
[[File:Balenciaga dresses museum display.jpg|thumb|Balenciaga dresses on display in Florence, Italy]]
Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]], in 1917, which expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web | last = Charleston | first =Beth Duncuff | title =Cristobal Balenciaga (1895-1972)| work=Timeline of Art History| publisher =Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=October 2004 | url =http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bale/hd_bale.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-11 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070127124703/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bale/hd_bale.htm| archivedate= 27 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the [[Spanish Civil War]] forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;&lt;ref name="va"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cristóbal Balenciaga |publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/balenciaga/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123224424/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/balenciaga/index.html |archivedate=2007-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 
1937, and his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the [[Spanish Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;  Balenciaga's success in Paris was nearly immediate.  In the period of two years, the [[France|French]] press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;  [[Carmel Snow]], the editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' was an early champion of his designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Rowlands | first =Penelope | title =A Dash of Daring: Carmel Snow and Her Life In Fashion, Art, and Letters | publisher =Atria | year =2005 | url =https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Daring-Carmel-Fashion-Letters/dp/0743480457 | page = 286 and elsewhere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers risked their safety to travel to Europe during [[World War II]] to see Balenciaga's clothing.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; During this period, he was noted for his "square coat," with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black (or black and brown) lace over bright pink fabric.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. His lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the hourglass shape popularized by [[Christian Dior]]'s "[[Christian Dior S.A.#The "New Look"|New Look]]".&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; The fluidity of his silhouettes enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; of 1958. Other contributions in the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957).&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos.  His manipulation of the waist, in particular, contributed to "what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of fashion: a new silhouette for women."&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

In the 1960s, Balenciaga was an innovator in his use of fabrics: he tended toward heavy fabrics, intricate embroidery, and bold materials.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; His trademarks included "collars that stood away from the collarbone to give a swanlike appearance" and shortened "bracelet" sleeves.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; His often spare, sculptural creations&amp;mdash;including funnel-shape gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients such as [[Pauline Fairfax Potter|Pauline de Rothschild]], [[Rachel Lambert Lloyd|Bunny Mellon]], [[Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto|Marella Agnelli]], [[Hope Portocarrero]], [[Gloria Rubio y Alatorre|Gloria Guinness]], and [[Mona von Bismarck]]&amp;mdash;were considered masterworks of haute couture in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1960, he designed the wedding dress for [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium]] made of ivory duchess satin trimmed with white mink at the collar and the hips. [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]] famously upset [[John F. Kennedy]] for buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while he was President because he feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father-in-law, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph Kennedy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== Protégés ===
Several designers who worked for Balenciaga would go on to open their own successful couture houses, notably [[Oscar de la Renta]] (1949), [[Andre Courreges]] (1950), [[Emanuel Ungaro]] (1958), but his most famous and noted [[protégé]] was [[Hubert de Givenchy]], who was the lone designer to side with Balenciaga against the [[Fédération française de la couture|Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne]] and also the press over the scheduling of his shows.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Battle against the press===
In 1957, Balenciaga famously decided to show his collection to the fashion press the day before the clothing retail delivery date, not the standard four weeks before the retail delivery date the fashion industry followed at the time. By keeping the press unaware of the design of his garments until the day before they were shipped to stores, he hoped to curtail ongoing piracy and copying of his designs. The press resisted, finding it nearly impossible to get his work into their print deadlines, but Balenciaga and protege [[Givenchy]] stood firm, seriously impacting their coverage and press of the era. His supporters would argue that rival [[Christian Dior]] would gain acclaim from copying Balenciaga's silhouettes and cuts, claiming them as his own original work; because Balenciaga was not interested in press coverage, the media, and consumers never knew.

In 1967, both designers reversed their decision and joined the traditional schedule.

===Battle against the Chambre===
Balenciaga defiantly resisted the rules, guidelines, and [[bourgeoisie]] status of the [[Fédération française de la couture|Chambre syndicale de la haute couture parisienne]], and, thus, was never a member. Although he is spoken of with immense reverence, technically, Balenciaga couture was never [[haute couture]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.jrank.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1701/Balenciaga-Crist-bal.html|title=Balenciaga, Cristóbal|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cristóbal Balenciaga closed his fashion house in 1968 and died in 1972. The house lay dormant until 1986.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

In 1986, Jacques Bogart S.A. acquired the rights to Balenciaga, and opened a new [[ready-to-wear]] line, "Le Dix". The first collection was designed by [[Michel Goma]] in October 1987, who remained at the house for the next five years to mixed reviews. He was replaced in 1992 with Dutch designer [[Josephus Thimister]] who began the restoration of Balenciaga to an elite, high-fashion status.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} During Thimister's term, [[Nicolas Ghesquière]] would join as a license designer, and eventually was promoted to head designer in 1997.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.jrank.org" /&gt;

In 1992, for the Summer Olympic Games, House of Balenciaga designed the French team's clothes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Balenciaga is now owned by [[Kering]], formerly known as PPR, and its womenswear and menswear was headed by Nicolas Ghesquière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Menkes| first =Suzy| title =Nicolas Ghesquiere, a Creative Young Spirit in the Master Class, Balenciaga: Reviving and Revering| publisher = ''International Herald Tribune'' | date =2001-11-20| url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/11/20/frevive_ed3_.php | accessdate = 2007-03-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070129102945/http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/11/20/frevive_ed3_.php |archivedate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghesquière, like Balenciaga, is a self-taught designer, and apprenticed to [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Agnes B]]. The hip, fresh interpretation of Balenciaga classics, such as the semifitted jacket and the sack dress, caught the attention of the media as well as such celebrities as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Sinéad O'Connor]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.jrank.org" /&gt;

In 2002, Balenciaga's star Nicolas Ghesquiere imitated the work of Kaisik Wong, a designer from San Francisco. Ghesquiere created a patchwork vest in his spring collection that resembled one that Wong designed in 1973. Ghesquiere admitted in an interview in Paris that he had copied the garment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

There was some conflict within the House of Balenciaga on Ghesquiere's designs, with the Gucci group saying that if Balenciaga didn't make any money within the year 2007, they would replace him.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} Ghesquière's F/W 2005 line showed that the house was not only making money, but also attracted a number of [[celebrity]] customers including [[editor-in-chief]] at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' [[Anna Wintour]].

The House of Balenciaga designed the dresses worn by [[Jennifer Connelly]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] to the 2006 [[Academy Awards]], as well as the wedding gown Kidman wore when she married [[Keith Urban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/25-07-2006/83504-Kidman_urban-0|title=Kidman and Urban: happy marriage or misalliance?|work=English pravda.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kylie Minogue]] also wore a Balenciaga dress for her "[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]" and "[[Red Blooded Woman]]" music videos and for her concert tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barco.com/corporate/en/pressreleases/show.asp?index=1003|title=Barco - Barco MiPIX and LED displays chosen for exclusive Kylie concert.|work=barco.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015003230/http://www.barco.com/corporate/en/pressreleases/show.asp?index=1003|archivedate=2006-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the brand is most famous for its line of motorcycle-inspired handbags, especially the popular "Lariat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.racked.com/2011/8/15/7754373/nicolas-ghesquiere-balenciagas-lariat-bag-almost-never-got-made |title=Nicolas Ghesquiere: Balenciaga's Lariat Bag Almost Never Got Made |website=Racked.com |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balenciaga has eight exclusive boutiques in the United States. One Balenciaga store is located on 22nd St in New York City, New York. A second store is located in Los Angeles, California, on Melrose Avenue. Recently, a third store opened at the South Coast Plaza, in Costa Mesa, California. This store is {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} and includes coffin-like inset displays. The New York and Los Angeles boutiques carry both men's and women's ready-to-wear, while the South Coast Plaza boutique carries only women's clothing. A fourth, located in Las Vegas inside [[Caesars Palace]], carries only accessories. An additional location on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], in Crystals at CityCenter, sells accessories as well as women's ready-to-wear. The boutique at [[Ala Moana Center]] in [[Honolulu]], offers men's and women's ready-to-wear and accessories. There is a store at the Bal Harbour shops in Bal Harbour, Florida. An eighth store is opening spring 2014 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], at the [[Highland Park Village]] to become the first boutique in Texas. The Highland Park Village boutique is opening next to [[Christian Dior]] and will carry men's and women's ready to wear and accessories. All of the boutiques employ spirited architecture, with white paneling, marble, and glass work as well as black leather seats and light green, black and navy carpets or white tiles, emphasizing the brand's lean toward avant-garde and the drama of fashion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Balenciaga's Fall/Winter 2007 show impressed ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Amy Astley]] so much that an entire recent spread in the magazine, titled "Global Studies" and shot in Beijing, was influenced by it. The line included skinny [[jodhpurs]], tight, fitted blazers, beaded embellished scarves, and other multicultural mixes.

Balenciaga is known for creating avant-garde structural pieces, straddling the edge of fashion and forecasting the future of women's ready-to-wear fashion.

On 24 March 2011 at San Francisco's [[De Young (museum)|M. H. de Young Museum]], House of Balenciaga celebrated the opening of '''Balenciaga and Spain''', a 120-piece fashion retrospective of [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]]'s career. The exhibition included many Balenciaga designs from the Museums' encyclopedic costume collection, which boasts impressive holdings of creations by the designer. "You can't even measure it," said [[Rodarte]] designer Laura Mulleavy of Cristóbal Balenciaga's influence.&lt;ref name="WWD.COM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/eyescoop/a-spanish-night-for-balenciaga-in-san-francisco-3565172?module=today |title=A Spanish Night for Balenciaga in San Francisco |last=WWD.COM |date=25 March 2011 |publisher=[[Women's Wear Daily]] |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $2,500-a-ticket fund-raiser for the museum drew 350 guests, including Denise Hale, [[Marissa Mayer]], Vanessa Getty, Victoria Traina, Vanessa Traina, [[Jamie Tisch]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Balthazar Getty]], [[Maggie Rizer]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Maria Bello]], and [[Mia Wasikowska]].&lt;ref name="WWD.COM"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
On April 25, 2018, a Chinese customer was allegedly assaulted by a group of other customers who refused to enter the Printemps Balenciaga store in Paris in an orderly fashion. The Chinese customer, who is an elderly lady, protested to the group of queue-jumping customers, who responded by allegedly shoving the Chinese customer. A skirmish broke out in front of the fashion house between the Chinese customer's son and the group of queue-jumping customers. Employees for the fashion house and department store security reacted quickly to contain the incident. Security guards apparently wearing Balenciaga uniform can be seen restraining the son of the Chinese customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/article-5664849/Balenciaga-apologises-racism-row-erupts-fight-Printemps-Paris.html|title=Brawl breaks out in Balenciaga as customers fight to buy new shoes|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees for the fashion house were also heard insulting the Chinese customer and her son, who were ultimately removed from the premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43925802|title=Fashion label sorry for Chinese fracas|last=Thomas|first=Daniel|date=2018-04-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A viral video of the incident quickly swept through Chinese social media website Weibo, which enraged Chinese customers, and are calling for a boycott of the fashion house.

On April 27, 2018, two days after the incident, the House of Balenciaga issued a public notice and apology concerning the April 25, 2018, incident. The fashion house apparently suspended the management staff present during the incident and is working closely with Printemps store management to investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/china/balenciaga-paris-store-apologise-over-incident-chinese-customers|title=Balenciaga, Paris store apologise over incident with Chinese customers|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users on social media are questioning the sincerity of the fashion house's public apology. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/article-5664849/Balenciaga-apologises-racism-row-erupts-fight-Printemps-Paris.html]

'''''Black Lightning''''' is an American [[superhero fiction|superhero]] television series developed by [[Salim Akil]], airing on [[The CW]]. It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Black Lightning|character of the same name]], created by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Trevor Von Eeden]]. It stars [[Cress Williams]] as the titular character alongside [[China Anne McClain]], [[Nafessa Williams]], [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]], [[Krondon|Marvin Jones III]], [[Damon Gupton]], and [[James Remar]]. The series sees the retired Black Lightning return to the hero life and its effects on his family life.

Development on the series began in September 2016 when [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] ordered a pilot production commitment for ''Black Lightning''. In February 2017, Fox passed on the series, with it being picked up by The CW with a new script for the pilot. The CW officially ordered the series in May 2017. The [[Black Lightning (season 1)|first season]] premiered on January 16, 2018, for a 13-episode run. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the show for a [[Black Lightning (season 2)|second season]], which premiered on October 9, 2018.

==Premise==
High school principal Jefferson Pierce, who retired from his superhero persona [[Black Lightning]] nine years ago after seeing the effects it had on his family, is forced to become a [[vigilante]] again when the rise of the local gang called the 100 leads to increased crime and corruption in his community of Freeland.&lt;ref name="NewPremise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/18/cw-superheroes-crossover-black-lightning-flash-arrow-legends-tomorrow/|title=The CW's Black Lightning not part of Arrowverse, crossover unlikely|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season two, as Black Lightning continues his feud with the 100's leader [[Tobias Whale]], he and his family deal with the arising anti-superhuman bigotry within their community after its metahuman members' existences are exposed.

==Connection to the Arrowverse==
{{further|Arrowverse}}

Despite airing on The CW and being created by Berlanti, Mark Pedowitz, president of The CW said in May 2017 that the series "at this time, is not part of the [[Arrowverse]]. It is a separate situation."&lt;ref name="NewPremise" /&gt; Berlanti had previously stated when the series was in development at Fox that it would not crossover with his other DC Comics television properties on The CW nor would it exist in the Arrowverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/foxs-black-lightning-show-wont-cross-over-with-the-arrowverse/|title=Fox's Black Lightning Show Won't Cross Over With The Arrowverse|last=Gerding|first=Stephen|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Akil later stated that they were not ruling out eventual crossovers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/black-lightning-tv-show-spoilers-what-eps-revealed-atx-2550641|title=‘Black Lightning’ TV Show Spoilers: What The EPs Revealed At ATX|last=Massabrook|first=Nicole|publisher=International Business Times|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, Pedowitz added, "If [the showrunners] wish to bring it in, that is their call. We had a long discussion with the studio, Mara, Salim, and myself. We were fine with them making it separate from the Arrowverse, they have a different point of view. If they end up wanting to go that way, that will be their decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/02/this-arrowverse-crossover-will-fully-take-place-across-every-show-from-supergirl-to-legends-of-tomorrow|title=This Arrowverse Crossover Will Fully Take Place Across Every Show From Supergirl To Legends of Tomorrow|last=Schwartz|first=Terri|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sXpqo5uc|archivedate=August 7, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salim Akil noted references in the first season to the Arrowverse heroes Vixen and Supergirl were a "fun" way "to tease the fans". He also further reiterated that the series existed on a separate Earth from the other Arrowverse series (like Earth-1 from ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and Earth-38 from ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'') and was hopeful that any future crossover would involve the heroes of the other series visiting the Earth that is associated with ''Black Lightning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/black-lightning-boss-addresses-arrowverse-references/|title=Black Lightning boss addresses those Arrowverse references|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 16, 2018|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bradshaw rock paintings.jpg|thumb|250px|Gwion Gwion (Tassel Bradshaw) figures wearing ornate costumes]]
'''Bradshaw rock paintings, Bradshaw rock art, Bradshaw figures''' or '''The Bradshaws,''' are terms used to describe one of the two major regional traditions of [[rock art]] found in the north-west [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;McNiven, Ian and Russell, Lynette ''Appropriated Pasts: Indigenous Peoples And The Colonial Culture Of Archaeology'' [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman Altamira]] 2005 {{ISBN|9780759109070}} p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of who painted these figures and the age of the art are contended within [[archaeology]] and amongst Australian rock art researchers.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Claire Smith|Smith]] | first = Claire | date =  November 2006 | title = The appropriation of Indigenous images: a review essay  | journal = [[Rock Art Research]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects have been debated since the works were first discovered and recorded by [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Joseph Bradshaw (pastoralist)|Joseph Bradshaw]] in 1891, after whom they were named.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Daniel Sutherland ''Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings'' [[Hesperian Press]] ([[American Philosophical Society]]) 2011 [1936] {{ISBN|9780859053754}} p. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Kimberley is home to various Aboriginal language groups, the rock art is referred to and known by many different Aboriginal names, the most common of which are ''Gwion Gwion''&lt;ref name="Doring"&gt;Doring, Jeff ''Gwion Gwion: Chemins Secrets Et Sacrés Des Ngarinyin, Aborigènes D'Australie'' (Gwion Gwion: Secret and Sacred Pathways of the Ngarinyin Aboriginal People of Australia), Könemann 2000 {{ISBN|9783829040600}} p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Giro Giro.''&lt;ref&gt;Worms, Ernest ''Contemporary and prehistoric rock paintings in Central and Northern North Kimberley'' Anthropos Switzerland 1955 p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; The art consists primarily of human figures ornamented with accessories such as bags, [[tassel]]s and headdresses.&lt;ref name="Don"&gt;Donaldson, Mike [https://www.scribd.com/doc/62208928/Bradshaw-Figures-in-Cave-Art ''The Gwion or Bradshaw art style of Australia’s Kimberley region is undoubtedly among the earliest rock art in the country –but is it Pleistocene?''] (free download) ''L’art pléistocène en Australie (Pré-Actes)'',  [[International Federation of Rock Art Organizations|IFRAO]] Congress, September 2010 p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and study==
[[File:Drawing of Bradshaw art.jpg|thumb|250px|Bradshaw figures superimposed over a kangaroo and snake. [[Prince Regent River]] area of the Kimberley. Drawn by Joseph Bradshaw in April 1891&lt;br /&gt;Backburning has since largely destroyed the original painting.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt;]]
[[File:Wandjina rock art.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Indigenous Australian rock art in the later Wandjina style]] 
Rock art in the Kimberley region was first recorded by the explorer and future South Australian governor, Sir [[George Grey]] as early as 1838.&lt;ref name="grey"&gt;{{cite book | last =Grey | first = George | year =1841  | title =  Journals of Two Expeditions | publisher =  Government Printer | location =  vol.1, p. 263| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rock art is now known as [[Wondjina|Wandjina]] style art.

While searching for suitable pastoral land in the then remote [[Roe River (Western Australia)|Roe River]] area in 1891, pastoralist Joseph Bradshaw discovered an unusual type of rock art on a [[sandstone]] escarpment.&lt;ref name="Brad"&gt;{{cite web | last =  Clement | first =  Cathie | date =  | title =  Joseph Bradshaw – Getting Lost in the Kimberley and The Art Named After Him | work = Kimberley society | url = http://www.kimberleysociety.org/oldfiles/2008/JOSEPH%20BRADSHAW%20Oct%2008.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw recognised that this style of painting was unique when compared to the Wandjina style. In a subsequent address to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] branch of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], he commented on the fine detail, the colours, such as brown, yellow and pale blue, and he compared it aesthetically to that of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="bradin"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Bradshaw | first =  Joseph | year = 2010 | title =  Lost World of the Kimberley: Extraordinary New Glimpses of Australia's Ice Age Ancestors | publisher =  Allen &amp; Unwin | location =  p. 18-19| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American archaeologist Daniel Sutherland Davidson briefly commented on Bradshaw's figures while undertaking a survey of Australian rock art that he would publish in 1936. Davidson noted that Bradshaw's encounter with this art was brief and lacked any [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] interpretations; furthermore, as Bradshaw's sketches of the art were at this time the only visual evidence, Davidson argued that they could be inaccurate and possibly drawn from a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Davidson | first =  Sutherland Daniel | year = 2011 |origyear=1936 | title =  Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings | publisher =  Hesperian Press | location =  p. 133.| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rediscovery of the original mural after more than a century has shown that Bradshaw had a remarkable gift for reproduction without photography, and that Davidson's criticisms were unfounded in the absence of the original.&lt;ref name = Rainsbury&gt;Rainsbury, Michael P  (2013) Mr Bradshaw's drawings': reassessing Joseph Bradshaw's sketches. Rock Art Research: The Journal of the Australian Rock Art Research Association (AURA) 2012  Volume 30 243-253&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw's figures and their existence as an artistic tradition was questioned; articles and books on these works were not published until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="shult"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Schultz | first =  Agnes | year =  1956 | title =  North–west Australian rock paintings | journal =  Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria | volume =  20| issue =  | pages =1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With the growth of [[Anthropology|anthropological]] interest in Peninsula region, research in the coastal area brought with it an awareness of Aboriginal art and culture.&lt;ref name="elkin"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Elkin | first =  Adolphus Peter | year =  1930| title =  Rock Paintings of North-West Australia | journal =  Oceania | volume =  1| issue =  3| pages =257–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attention to the Bradshaw art was sporadic. Several researchers who encountered the Bradshaw-type of paintings during expeditions to the region were members of the 1938 [[Frobenius Institute]] expedition. Agnes Schultz noted that unlike with Wandjina art, Aboriginal people showed little interest in the Bradshaw paintings, although they recognised them as depictions of bush [[spirit]]s or ''D’imi.''

When pressed, the expedition's Aboriginal guide explained their creation:&lt;ref name="shult"/&gt;
{{quotation|Long ago Kujon a black bird, painted on the rocks. He struck his bill against the stones so that it Bleed, and with the blood he painted. He painted no animals, only human-shaped figures which probably represent spirits”.}}

Anthropologist Robert Layton notes that researchers such as Ian Crawford, who worked in the region in 1969, and Patricia Vinnicombe, who work in the region in the 1980s, were both told similar creation stories regarding the Bradshaw-type art.&lt;ref name="layton"&gt;{{cite book | last = Layton | first = Robert | year = 1991| title = Australian Rock Art: A New Synthesis | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | location =  p. 84| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1980, more systematic work has been done in an effort to identify more Bradshaw rock art sites in the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="eds"&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawford |first= Ian |editor-first= P.J. |editor-last= Ucko |title= Form in Indigenous Art |publisher= Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies |year=1977|pages=357–369|chapter= The relationship of Bradshaw art in north-west Kimberley |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welcha"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Welch | first =  David | year = 1990 | title =  The bichrome art period in the Kimberley, Australia | journal =  Rock Art Research | volume =  7| issue =  | pages =  110–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" welchb"&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Welch | first =  David | year = 1993 | title =  Early 'naturalistic' human figures in the Kimberley Australia | journal =  Rock Art Research | volume =  10| issue = 1 | pages = 24–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Walsh | first =  Grahame | year =  1994| title =  Bradshaws: ancient rock paintings of north-west Australia | publisher =  Geneva: Édition Limitée | location =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable has been the work undertaken by amateur archaeologist [[Grahame Walsh]], who began work there in 1977 and returned to record and locate new sites up until his death in 2007. The results of this work produced a database of 1.5 million rock art images and recordings of 1,500 new rock art sites.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web | publisher =  ABC | date =  15 October 2002| title = Rock Heart | work =  Australian Story | url =  http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s696261.htm  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded his records by studying [[superimposition]] and style sequences of the paintings to establish a [[chronology]] that demonstrated that ''Bradshaw art'' is found early in the Kimberley rock art sequence. He proposed that the art dated to a period prior to the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;
Many of the ancient rock paintings maintain vivid colours because they have been colonised by bacteria and fungi, such as the black fungus, ''[[Chaetothyriales]].'' The pigments originally applied may have initiated an ongoing, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between black fungi and red bacteria.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = BBC | date = 27 December 2010| title =  Ancient rock art's colours come from microbes | work =  BBC News | url =  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12039203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bradshaw art==
Based on stylistic characteristics, Walsh categorised two individual styles of ‘Bradshaw paintings’, which he named ‘Tassel’ and ‘Sash’ for dominant clothing features. He also identified two variants, which he named ‘Elegant Action figures’ and ‘Clothes Peg figures’.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;
[[File:Bradshaw rock art traditions.jpg|right|450px|thumb|Drawings from Bradshaw rock paintings in the Kimberley region of Western Australia depicting the four traditional styles (resized for comparison).]]           
*'''Tassel figures:''' identified by their characteristic tassels hanging from their arms and waists, various other accessories can be recognised, such as arm bands, conical headdresses and [[Boomerangs]].&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; This style is the earliest, most detailed and largest.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;
*'''Sash:''' while similar in appearance to the ''Tassel'' figures, the ''Sash'' body is depicted more robustly and the accoutrements depicted are slightly different: a three-pointed sash or bags attached to the figures belts begin to be shown.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;
*'''Elegant Action Figures:''' quite different from the ''Tassel'' and ''Sash'' figures, these figures are almost always shown running, kneeling or hunting with multi-barbed [[spear]]s and boomerangs.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; These are difficult to place in the style sequence as they are the only figures that are not superimposed over a painting from another period. Also, no other style is superimposed over them and they are the only style that has not been defaced. Stylistically, they are believed to fall between the ''sash'' and ''Clothes Peg'' Figures.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;
*'''Clothes Peg Figures:''' were named by Walsh after their resemblance to old [[Clothespin|wooden clothes pegs]],&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; but they are also referred to as ''Straight Part Figures'' by Welch.&lt;ref name="welcha"/&gt; These figures are depicted in a stationary pose and painted with red pigment. Segments of their bodies are missing, such as their waists, arms and feet, the result of different colour pigments, such as whites and yellows, fading over time. The material culture depicted with these figures includes multi-barbed spears, [[spear-thrower]]s, and woven bags. This is the most recent style.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt; The anatomical detail common in the earlier styles is missing, and many of the images are shown in aggressive stances. At least one panel shows a battle with opponents arrayed in ranks opposite each other.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

The distribution and stylistic range of these paintings is quite distinctive, and contrasts with the Wandjina tradition. While more common in some areas, such as the sandstone regions of the west and central Kimberley, isolated examples have also been found in several scattered locations in the east, such as the [[Napier Range]]s, and at the far eastern border of the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; The art is primarily painted where a suitable [[rock shelter]] is found; in contrast with Wandjina art, which has a limited distribution restricted to isolated sites.&lt;ref name="eds"/&gt; Unlike Wandjina, Bradshaw art is rarely found on ceilings, rather vertical rock surfaces are used, high up in escarpments in shallower rock shelters with small overhangs and with irregular rocky floors not suitable for occupation.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;

[[File:Kimberley.png|right|250px|thumb|The Kimberley region of Western Australia.]]
The Bradshaw paintings predominantly depict human silhouette figures that appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach paunches. The question of gender representation in Bradshaw art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Virtue, L. (2012). Rock art of forgotten people. An interdisciplinary workshop about rock art in the Kimberley region, Australia: Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg, Delmenhorst, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective has been overlooked until now because of the Western bias toward images that “face out”, but also because the “facing in” perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare, Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies;&lt;ref&gt;: |url = http://bradshawrockart.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;). If one appreciates the “facing in” perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of “paunches’ by&lt;ref name = "Walsh"&gt;Walsh G.  (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly.&lt;ref name="Walsh, G."&gt;(2000) Bradshaw Art of the Kimberley. Toowong: Takarakka Nowan Kas Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as [[boomerang]]s and [[wand]]s. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between 40 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm in length with some examples up to 2 metres in height.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;

Artistically, Bradshaws are unusually advanced both in technique and style. Image processing has revealed that the outline of the Bradshaw figures are often painted first, then filled in. Engraving in the rock often follows the outlines of figures and may have served as a preliminary sketch which implies planning. Some faces of the figures are painted with anatomically correct features with enough detail to be considered portraits.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Due to the fine detail and control found in the images, such as strands of hair painted in 1-2mm thicknesses, it has been suggested that feather [[quill]]s may have been used as a technique to apply the paint to the rock walls; an imprint of a feather found at one site may support this possibility.&lt;ref name="eds"/&gt; No evidence has yet been found of any corrections or changes in composition during or after painting, while evidence of restoration have been found. In a detailed study of 66 Bradshaw panels, approximately 9% of the Bradshaw images have clearly been vandalized. Some were scratched with stones, some damaged by thrown stones, and some have been broken by hammering with large rocks.

With the exception of Elegant Action Figures which have been left undamaged for unknown reasons, all Bradshaw paintings exhibit possible vandalism, which may indicate ritual mutilation or defacing. Superpositioning of images, another form of vandalism, is common throughout the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;{{cite web | last1  = Biro | first1 = P.P.| last2  = Ebersole | first2 = T.W.| last3  = Tasja | first3 = W.| last4  = Michaelsen | first4 = P.| last5  = Smith | first5 = N.W.| date = January 2000 | title = Australian ice age rock art may depict Earth's oldest recordings of Shamanistic rituals| work = [[Mankind Quarterly]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-69880845.html| accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;{{cite web | last1  = Biro | first1 = P.P.| last2  = Ebersole | first2 = T.W.| last3  = Felder | first3 = M.A.J.| last4  = Jensen | first4 = I.B. | last5  = Michaelsen | first5 = P.| last6  = Smith | first6 = M.W.| last7  = Von Liptak | first7 = P.| date = June 2001 | title = An initial investigation into aspects of preservation potential of the Bradshaw rock-art system, Kimberley, northwestern Australia.| work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76283789.html | accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The Bradshaws are not the regions' earliest paintings. The earlier art consists of crude animal drawings that are believed to be up to 40,000 years old. The Bradshaws have nothing in common with this earlier art and first appeared following the peak of the most recent [[Last Glacial Maximum|Pleistocene glacial maximum]], which is dated between 26,500 and 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, scientific dating methods have been used to determine the ages of the Bradshaw paintings. The methods have included, [[Accelerator mass spectrometry]] radiocarbon dating (AMS) and [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL). This was used when [[Mud dauber|mud wasp]] nests have been built over paintings, and it gives a minimum age rather than an actual age of the painting. The results of this have revealed some inconsistency with Walsh's chronology. Experimental OSL dates from a wasp nest overlaying a tassel Bradshaw figure has given a Pleistocene date of 17,500±1,800 years [[Before Present|BP]]. The academic community generally accepts 5,000 BP for the end of the artistic style. If the date ranges are correct, this may demonstrate that the Bradshaw tradition was produced for many [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{Citation| last1  = Tacon | first1 = Paul| last2  = Mulvaney | first2 = Ken| last3  = Fullagar | first3 = Richard| last4  = Head | first4 = Lesley | title   = Bradshaws' – an eastern province? | journal = Rock Art Research | volume  = 16| issue   = 2| pages   = 127–129| year   = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoarchaeology|Geoarchaeologist]], Alan Watchman posits that the red paint used on a tasselled Bradshaw image near the [[Drysdale River]] is "likely to be only about 3,000 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Watchman 1997: 42&lt;/ref&gt; Using the AMS results from accreted paint layers containing carbon associated with another figure, gives a date of 3,880 BP&lt;ref&gt;1997:44; cf. Michaelson 2000&lt;/ref&gt; making Bradshaw art contemporaneous with, and no older than, Wanjina art.&lt;ref name="H3"&gt;{{cite web | last = Redmond| first = Anthony| date = 22 September 2002| title = 'Alien abductions', Kimberley Aboriginal rock-paintings, and the speculation about human origins: on some investments in cultural tourism in the northern Kimberley.| work = [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]] | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-127621957.html| accessdate = 2 January 2013 | via = [[HighBeam Research]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 15,000 years ago, the archaeological record shows that Aboriginals in the Kimberleys began using stone points in place of multi-barbed spears, but there is no record of this change of technology in the Bradshaw paintings. The most recent paintings still depict the use of multi-barbed spears.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt;

In 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a [[Thylacoleo]] was discovered on the north-western coast of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]]. This represented only the second example of megafauna depicted by the Indigenous inhabitants of Australia. The image has a "clothes peg" Bradshaw superimposed over the thorax, while a "Tassel" Bradshaw crosses the forearm of the animal.&lt;ref name="Willing"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Akerman | first1 = Kim | last2  = Willing | first2 = Tim| date = March 2009 | title = An ancient rock painting of a marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, from the Kimberley, Western Australia | work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]| url = http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman319/ | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second image was found that depicts a thylacoleo interacting with an "elegant action" Bradshaw who is in the act of spearing or fending the animal off with a multibarbed spear. Much smaller and less detailed than the 2008 find, it may depict a [[thylacine]] however, the comparative size and morphology indicates a thylacoleo is more likely, a position supported by [[palaeontology|palaeontologists]] and archaeologists who have examined the image.&lt;ref name="Akerman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Akerman | first = Kim | date = December 2009 | title = Interaction between humans and megafauna depicted in Australian rock art? | work = [[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] | url = http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman322/ | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45,000–46,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 2004&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests a similar age for the associated Bradshaw art. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in wetter areas of the continent as suggested by Wells,&lt;ref&gt;1985: 228&lt;/ref&gt; and has suggested an age of 15,000 to 22,000 years for the paintings.&lt;ref name="Akerman"/&gt;

Recent advances in dating methods may shed light on the age of the paintings and gain a more accurate result. [[Neuroscience|Neuroscientist]] [[Jack Pettigrew]] has proposed dating the art by using [[DNA sequencing]] extracted from colonies of [[microorganism]]s which have replaced the [[pigment]] in some paintings.&lt;ref name="peti"&gt;{{Citation| last1  = Pettigrew, | first1 = Jack| last2  = Callistemon | first2 = Chloe| last3  = Weiler | first3 = Astrid| last4  = Gorbushina | first4 = Anna | last5  =  Krumbein | first5 = Wolfgang | last6 =  Weiler | first6 = Reto | title   = Living Pigments in Australian Bradshaw Rock Art | journal = Antiquity | volume  = 84| issue   = |page=326| year   = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
[[Image:Sunda shelf.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Map showing the probable extent of land at the time of the last glacial maximum 25,000 to 15,000 years ago]]
The fossil record of climate and vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum is sparse, but still clear enough to provide an overview. When the Kimberley region was first occupied circa 40,000 years ago, the region consisted of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|open tropical forests]] and [[woodland]]s. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice-age. During the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level was some 140 metres below its present level, with the coastline extending 400 kilometres further to the north-west. Australia was connected to [[New Guinea]], and the Kimberley was separated from Southeast Asia (''[[Wallacea]]'') by a [[strait]] approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name="Coukell"/&gt; Rainfall decreased by 40% to 50% depending on region, while the lower CO2 levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water to [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Luly et.al [http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ch0616.pdf Last Glacial Maximum habitat change and its effects on the grey-headed flying fox] James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimberley region, including the adjacent exposed continental [[Sahul Shelf]], was covered by vast grasslands, while woodlands and semi-arid scrub covered the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia.&lt;ref name="ENSO"/&gt; Southeast of the Kimberley, from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to northern [[Tasmania]] the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered by extreme deserts and [[Dune|sand dunes]]. It is believed that no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the south/east of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah. Tasmania was covered primarily by cold [[steppe]] and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time. It appears there were scattered [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|"refugia"]] in which the modern vegetation types and human populations were able to survive.&lt;ref name="dodson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dodson | first = J.R. | date = September 2001 | title = Holocene vegetation change in the Mediterranean-type climate regions of Australia | journal = The Holocene | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 673–680 | doi=10.1191/09596830195690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Adams [http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html Australasia during The Last 150,000 Years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226170218/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html# |date=26 February 2013 }} Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.H.Monroe [http://austhrutime.com/glacial_maximum_australia.htm Last Glacial Maximum in Australia] ''Australia: The Land Where Time Began: A biography of the Australian continent''&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the ice-age, the Kimberley region settled into a [[tropical monsoon climate]] until a major [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] event in the mid Holocene caused the [[Monsoon#Australia|Australian summer monsoon]] rains to weaken or fail for some 1,500 years.&lt;ref name="ENSO"/&gt;

The discontinuity in artistic styles between the earlier Bradshaws and the current Wandjina has been attributed to the severe drought phase that followed the collapse of the wet season in 5,500 BP. The Bradshaw style art ended around this time, possibly within 500 years. The emergence of Wandjina art depicting cloud and rain spirits 3,800 to 4,000 years ago coincides with the end of the "mega-drought" and a return of the rain which gave the region its current climate. The research paper's lead author, [[Hamish McGowan]], suggests further investigation into the resulting cultural collapse and the possibility that another ethnic group supplanted the Bradshaw artists.&lt;ref name="ENSO"&gt;McGowan H, Marx S, Moss P, Hammond A. "Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia". ''GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,'' VOL. 39, L22702, 5 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2012GL053916 http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053916.shtml Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The chair in Kimberley rock art at the [[University of Western Australia]], Peter Veth, has critiqued the research paper for claiming that simultaneous changes in climate patterns and art styles indicates the collapse of a culture. Veth suggests that a climate change coinciding with the change from Bradshaw to Wandjina art is coincidence, pointing out that the [[archaeology]] of the Kimberley does not show a break in occupation, and that stylistic changes in Aboriginal art have occurred elsewhere in Australia. Additionally, the migration of a new ethnic group into the area is unsupported by the [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name="egan"&gt;{{cite web | last = Egan | first = Joanna | date = 18 December 2012 | title = Did mega-drought destroy Aboriginal culture? | work = [[Australian Geographic]] | url = http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mega-drought-caused-demise-of-aboriginal-culture-study-says.htm | accessdate = 22 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121220122109/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mega-drought-caused-demise-of-aboriginal-culture-study-says.htm | archivedate = 20 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous knowledge==
Research undertaken in relation to Aboriginal knowledge has also increased. This has primarily been seen in Aboriginal names being applied to the Bradshaw paintings, reflecting the specific Aboriginal languages used in the areas where they are found. For example, the [[Worrorran languages|Ngarinyin name]] for the art is ''Gwion Gwion''.&lt;ref name="Doring"/&gt; Other terms include ''giro giro'' used by Aboriginal people in the [[Napier Range|Napier]], [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome Bay]] and [[Prince Regent River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy | first = Frederick | title = Rock Art of the Cobar Pediplain in Central Western New South Wales | publisher = Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies | year = 1975| location = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian rock art researcher David Welch notes that these words are probably different regional [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]s of ''Kujon,'' the name of the bird found in the creation story originally heard by Schultz in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Welch |first= David |editor-first= M |editor-last= Donaldson | editor2-first= K.F.| editor2-last= Kenneally |title= Rock art of the Kimberley |publisher= Kimberley Society |year=2007|pages= 39–56 |chapter= Bradshaw art of the Kimberley |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal people are also more open in telling foreigners stories regarding the images. These stories often relate to spirits who created dances which are still performed today and feature similar apparel found in the paintings, such as headdresses, boomerangs and string.&lt;ref name="Doring"/&gt; ''Bradshaws (Gwion Gwion)'' are also depicted in contemporary art works produced for sale in the Kimberley; one notable ''Gwion Gwion'' artist is Kevin Waina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aboriginalartshop.com/artists/kevin-waina | title = Kevin Waina | publisher=Artlandish | accessdate= 4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Research concerning Bradshaw art is controversial and little consensus has been reached. Debate has primarily concerned Walsh's interpretations regarding the origins, dating and ethnicity of the Bradshaw artists, and his rejection of Aboriginal people as being their descendants.&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; The implications of his interpretations generated considerable criticism beginning in the mid 1990s due to its continuing potential to undermine [[Aboriginal title|native title]] claims in the Kimberley.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AA"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "uwa"/&gt; The ongoing disagreements regarding the age of the art and debate about whether it was created by non-Indigenous people makes Bradshaw rock art one of Australian archaeology's most contentious topics.&lt;ref name= "uwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop to address contentious rock-art|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201010142964/events/workshop-address-contentious-rock-art|website=University News|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|date = 14 October 2010 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanbury-Tenison|first1=Robin|title=Evidence of pre-aboriginal Australians?|url=http://www.dampierrockart.net/Media/2006-07-26%20Evidence%20of%20pre-aboriginal%20Australians-Times%20Online.pdf|website=Dampier Rock Art|publisher=[[The Times|Times Online]]|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic or local artists===
According to Walsh, Bradshaw art was associated with a period he called the ''Erudite Epoch'', a time before Aboriginal people populated Australia. He suggested that the art may be the product of an ethnic group who had likely arrived in Australia from [[Indonesia]], only to be displaced by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Walsh based this interpretation on the sophistication of Bradshaw art when compared to other art in the Kimberley region, such as the much later Wandjina styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Morwood | first = Mike | title = Ancient Paintings of Northwest Australia [Book Review]| journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 43 |page=47 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Media coverage has at times emphasised his claims of mysterious races. Pettigrew suggests that the Bradshaw paintings depict people with ‘peppercorn curls’ and small stature that characterise [[San people|San]] groups; he speculates that African people travelled, shortly after the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba eruption]] some 70,000 years ago, by reed boat across the Indian Ocean, provisioning themselves with the fruit of the baobab tree.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pettigrew. "Iconography in Bradshaw rock art: breaking the circularity", ''Clinical and Experimental Optometry'', Volume 94, Issue 5, pages 403–417, September 2011, first published online: 24 AUG 2011. DOI: 10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x/full]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian archaeological community has generally not accepted such claims and believes that Bradshaw are indigenous works. For example, Dr Andree Rosenfeld argued that the aesthetics of the art did not support claims for a non-Aboriginal origin when comparison is made to the aesthetic value of contemporary Aboriginal art.&lt;ref name = "AA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Minutes of the 1995 Annual General Meeting of the Australian Archaeological Association | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 42 |page=59 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Archaeological Association]] in a press release stated, "No archaeological evidence exists which suggests that the early colonisation of Australia was by anyone other than the ancestors of contemporary Aboriginal people", the release quoted [[Claire Smith]]: "such interpretations are based on and encourage [[Racism|racist]] [[stereotype]]s".&lt;ref name = "AA"/&gt;

Aboriginal people also criticised Grahame Walsh, arguing that he failed to hear their explanations of the significance that the paintings had in their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Blundell |first1= Valda |last2=Woolagoodja|first2= Donny| editor-first= J.J. |editor-last= McDonald | editor2-first= M.M.| editor2-last= Veth |title= Companion to Rock Art |publisher= Malden: Wiley Blackwell |year=2012|pages=476–477|chapter= Rock Art, Aboriginal Culture, and Identity: The Wanjina Paintings of Northwest Australia |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford records being told by an Aboriginal elder in 1969 that the Bradshaws were "rubbish paintings", a quote that Walsh would repeat continually in support of his own theory that the art was not of Aboriginal origin. In the local [[Australian Aboriginal English|Indigenous English]], ''rubbish'' is an adjective usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is ''not dangerous,'' for example, non-poisonous snakes are all considered to be ''rubbish'' while in contrast, poisonous snakes are all ''cheeky.''&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt;

Scholars have generally rejected the idea that Bradshaw art was painted by anyone other than Aboriginal people. Statistical analysis undertaken by Michael Barry has concluded that the Bradshaw art shares no stylistic attributes with prehistoric [[figurative art]] overseas. Moreover, Barry argues that stylistically, Bradshaw art has more in common with art found elsewhere in Australia, such as figures painted in [[Arnhem Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Barry |first1= Michael |last2= John Peter |first2= White | title = 'Exotic Bradshaws' or Australian 'Gwion': an archaeological test | journal = Australian Aboriginal Studies | volume = 2004 | issue = 1  |page=44 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[popular history|popular historians]] and amateur researchers have continued to suggest exotic origins for the Bradshaw rock paintings, although these interpretations are considered fringe by reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1= Hanbury-Tenison |first1= Robin| title = An earlier start – Lost World of the Kimberley [review] |newspaper= The Times Literary Supplement | volume = |page=13 | date = 28 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions of shamanistic rituals===
In many cases, Tassel and Sash figures appear to be involved in either dancing, ecstatic behaviour, or both which, according to a study by Michaelson ''et al.,'' may represent [[shaman]]istic rituals or creation ceremonies. [[Eucalyptus]] leaves (which can be used as a [[psychoactive drug]]) are commonly depicted with Tassel and Sash figures that appear to be in motion.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Michaelson ''et al.'' cited studies by [[A. P. Elkin]] in which he argued that Aboriginal and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[shamanism]] have markedly close similarities. He also noted that the worldwide pattern of shamanism suggests a common heritage that radiated outward from North Africa about 50,000 years ago; it may have originated as a woman's role which over time has been taken over by men. Aboriginal females in Australia have explicitly been recorded as saying that men had taken over roles they once performed in ceremonies. This is supported by many completely different languages having a similar word for female shamans (e.g., udaghan, udagan, utygan), while the term for male shamans is distinct in each language. Michaelson considered it significant that while few females are depicted in Bradshaw art, Tassel figures which appear to be leading ceremonies (the oldest art) clearly have breasts, in contrast to later art which depicts males in the leading roles.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Pettigrew identifies elements of Bradshaw art with symbols used by [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] artists to convey their experience with hallucinogens, and others that seem to show hallucinatory elements. From this he infers that psilocybin-induced trances were a feature of both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pettigrew. "Iconography in Bradshaw rock art: breaking the circularity". ''Clinical and Experimental Optometry'' Volume 94, Issue 5, pages 403–417, September 2011, first published online: 24 AUG 2011. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1444-0938.2011.00648.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only a small number of researchers believe that shamanism has been part of the culture of Indigenous Australians. [[George Chaloupka]], an expert on Indigenous Australian rock art, puts it bluntly, "Shamaniacs rule the world at present...It's just another orthodoxy basking in its five minutes of sunshine." Grahame Walsh considered the idea of female shamans in the Bradshaw culture "preposterous". Pointing out that female Bradshaw images tend to have extremely prominent breasts, Walsh says that the smaller breasts identified by Michaelson are probably chest-band decorations.&lt;ref name="Coukell"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Coukell | first =  Allan | date =  May 2001 | title =  Could mysterious figures lurking in Australian rock art be the world's oldest shamans? |magazine=  [[New Scientist]] | volume =  | issue =  |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction===
Aerial fire-bombing and [[Controlled burn|back burning]] by the Western Australian [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Parks and Wildlife]] and the [[Department of Fire and Emergency Services]] since 2009 as part of the government's fire prevention strategy to aid the exploitation of oil and gas reserves has caused paint to peel from over 5,000 of the 8,742 known examples of Bradshaw art. A survey by archaeologist Lee Scott-Virtue has determined that up to 30 per cent of the rock art had been completely destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Steve|title='Negligent' burning in WA's north threatening rock art, homes|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/negligent-burning-in-was-north-threatening-rock-art-homes-20141201-11xuel.html|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=WA Today|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin/&gt;

''Calendar of Regrets'' is a collage novel comprising twelve interconnected narratives, one for each month of the year, all pertaining to notions of travel—through time, space, narrative, and death.

The narratives involve: 1) the poisoning of the painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]]; 2) former CBS anchorman [[Dan Rather]]'s mysterious mugging on Park Avenue as he strolled home alone one evening; 3) a series of postcard meditations on the idea of travel from a young American journalist visiting Burma; 4) a high school teacher who videos her own auto-erotic asphyxiation and sends them to strangers across the U.S.;  5) a husband-and-wife team of fundamentalist Christian suicide bombers in London; 6) a terrorist commandeering a family's car on the Italian Autostrada; 7) the myth of [[Iphigenia]] from [[Agamemnon]]’s daughter’s point of view; 8) a series of pirate podcasts by a young drifter along the shores of the [[Salton Sea]] in southern California; 9) an interview between forensic psychiatrist [[Park Dietz]] and the man who assaulted Dan Rather; 10) an angel (based on the one appearing in symbolist [[Hugo Simberg]]'s famous painting titled ''[[The Wounded Angel]]'') discovered by two boys in the Finnish countryside; 11) a man built of borrowed organs, each with its own story; 12) a boy born as a notebook.

Each narrative is composed in a unique style and genre, breaks off in the middle, and is nested inside the one that preceded it. The twelfth forms the mid-point of the novel.  Each interrupted narrative then concludes. Reminiscent of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]'s [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|''Cloud Atlas'']], they form a mosaic, connected through a pattern of musical motifs, transposed scenes, and recurring characters. ''Calendar of Regrets'' is a narrative about narrativity itself, the human obsession with telling ourselves and our worlds over and over again in an attempt to stabilize a truth that, as [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said, should only exist within quotation marks.

==Reception==
''Review of Contemporary Fiction'' wrote "these stories explore the perplexity about ways of knowing and how knowledge is made manifest through storytelling,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar of Regrets|url=http://www.readperiodicals.com/201104/2321643991.html|accessdate=7 December 2012|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Rain Taxi]]'' said Olsen's novel "ultimately reminds us of the ways that art and narrative doggedly navigate that thin line between the drive for order and the deep-seated realization that the universe that greets us each morning has only increased its entropy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar of Regrets|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2011summer/print.shtml|accessdate=7 December 2012|journal=Rain Taxi|date=Summer 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102133249/http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2011summer/print.shtml#|archive-date=2012-11-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartographic generalization''', or map generalization, is a method for deriving a [[scale (map)|smaller-scale]] [[map]] from a larger scale map or map data&lt;ref name="Li 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhilin|title=Digital Map Generalization at the Age of the Enlightenment: A review of the First Forty Years|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=February 2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=80–93|accessdate=|doi=10.1179/000870407x173913}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Whether done manually by a [[cartographer]] or by a computer or set of [[algorithms]], [[generalization]] seeks to abstract [[geospatial information|spatial information]] at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the [[urban area|urbanized area]] of the region.

The cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.

==Methods==
There are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:

===Selection===

Map generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the [[reality|real world]] by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that [[geospatial]] data can be reduced is through the selection process.&lt;ref name="Topfer 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topfer|first1=F|last2=Pillwizer|first2=W|title=The Principles of Selection|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=1966|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.

===Simplification===
Generalization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The [[Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm]] is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.

Simplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing "rough" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.&lt;ref name="Stern, Hurni, Werner, Wiesmann 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=08–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination===

Simplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination.  Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus.  A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale.  The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.

===Smoothing===

[[Smoothing]] is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work.  Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting.  The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way.  An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.

===Enhancement===

Enhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading.  As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail.  Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out.  An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand.  Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map’s intent.

===Displacement===

Displacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.

===Exaggeration===

Exaggeration is the selection of map [[symbol]]s that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the [[visual hierarchy]]. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregation===

Aggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an "urban area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GIS and automated generalization==
As [[geographic information systems|GIS]] developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.

Several broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:

* The ''representation-oriented'' view focuses on the representation of data on different scales, which is related to the field of Multi-Representation [[Database]]s (MRDB).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''process-oriented'' view focuses on the process of generalization.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''ladder-approach'' is a stepwise generalization, in which each derived dataset is based on the other database of the next larger scale.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''star-approach'' is the derived data on all scales is based on a single (large-scale) data base.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Scaling law==
There are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity|journal=GeoJournal|date=2015a|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9537-y|arxiv=1401.5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=The fractal nature of maps and mapping|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|date=2015b|volume=29|issue=1|pages=159–174|doi=10.1080/13658816.2014.953165|arxiv=1406.5410}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by '''[[Head/tail Breaks|head/tail breaks]]''',&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015c"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics|journal=Cities|date=2015c|volume=43|issue=3|pages=69–77|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2014.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=2013|volume=65|pages=482–494|doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.700499}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace Töpfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Scaling as a design principle for cartography|journal=Annals of GIS|date=2017|volume=23|issue=1|pages=67–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2016.1251491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Baltimore Phenomenon'==
The Baltimore Phenomenon{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- NOTE: the spelling as "characterization" with "z" is intentional (see page title!). Please do not change it to "characterisation". Cf. Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Retaining_the_existing_variety  --&gt;
'''Characterization''' or '''characterisation''' is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in [[narrative]] and [[drama]]tic [[The arts|works of art]].  This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or "dramatic") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' [[Action (narrative)|action]]s, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], or appearance.  Such a personage is called a [[Character (arts)|character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character is a [[literary element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''characterization'' was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, pp. 51-2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is, a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his ''[[Poetics]]'' that tragedy "is a representation, not of men, but of action and life." This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is, a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the [[realist novel]], and increasingly later with the influential development of [[psychology]].

==Direct vs. indirect==
There are two ways  an [[author]] can convey information about a character:
;''Direct'' or ''[[wiktionary:explicit|explicit]]'' characterization: The author literally tells the audience what a character is like. This may be done via the [[narrator]], another character or by the character themselves.
;''Indirect'' or ''[[wiktionary:implicit|implicit]]'' characterization: The audience must infer for themselves what the character is like through the character's thoughts, actions, speech (choice of words, manner of speaking), physical appearance, mannerisms and interaction with other characters, including other characters' reactions to that particular person.

==In drama==
Characters in theater, television, and film differ from those in novels in that an actor may interpret the writer's description and dialogue in their own unique way to add new layers and depth to a character. This can be seen when critics compare, for example, the 'Lady Macbeths' or 'Heathcliffs' of different actors.  Another major difference in drama is that it is not possible to 'go inside the character's head' in the way possible in a novel, meaning this method of character exposition is unavailable.  Still another is that in drama, a character usually can be seen and heard and need not be described.

==Character archetypes==
The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] identified twelve primary 'original patterns' of the human psyche. He believed that these reside in the collective subconscious of people across cultural and political boundaries. These twelve archetypes are often cited in fictional characters. [[Character (arts)#Round vs. flat|'Flat' characters]] may be considered so because they stick to a single archetype without deviating, whereas 'complex' or 'realistic' characters will combine several archetypes, with some being more dominant than others – as people are in real life.
Jung's twelve archetypes are: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Hero, the Caregiver, the Explorer, the Rebel, the Lover, the Creator, the Jester, the Sage, the Magician, and the Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html | title=The 12 Common Archetypes | work=SoulCraft | accessdate=June 29, 2016 | author=Golden, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character's voice== &lt;!-- Character's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Grammatical voice|Writer's voice}}

A '''character's voice''' is his or her manner of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characters use different vocabularies and rhythms of speech.  For example, some characters are talkative, others taciturn.  The way a character speaks can be a powerful way of revealing the character’s personality.  In theory, a reader should be able to identify which character is speaking simply from the way he or she talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a character voice has been created that is rich and distinctive, the writer can get away with omitting many speech attributions (tag lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The manner of a character’s speech is to literature what an actor’s appearance and costume are to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fiction, what a character says, as well as how he or she says it, makes a strong impression on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each character should have his or her distinctive voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate characters in fiction, the writer must show them doing and saying things, but a character must be defined by more than one single topic of conversation or by the character’s accent.  The character will have other interests or personality quirks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although individual temperament is the largest determinant of what a character says, it is not the only one.  The writer can make the characters’ dialogue more realistic and interesting by considering several factors affecting how people speak:  ethnicity, family background, region, gender, education, and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|pp=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words characterize by their diction, cadence, complexity, and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerisms and catch-phrases can help too.  Considering the degree of formality in spoken language is also useful.  Characters who spend a lot of their lives in a more formal setting often use a more formal language all the time, while others never do.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tone of voice, volume, rate of delivery, vocabulary, inflection, emphasis, pitch, topics of conversation, idioms, colloquialisms, and figures of speech:  all of these are expressions of who the character is on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A character’s manner of speech must grow from the inside out.  The speaking is how his or her essential personality leaks out for the world to see; it is not the sum total of his or her personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cope and Stewardson''' (1885–1912) was a [[Philadelphia]] architecture firm founded by '''Walter Cope''' and '''John Stewardson''', and best known for its [[Collegiate Gothic]] building and campus designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/23024 Cope &amp; Stewardson (1885–1912)]&lt;/ref&gt; Cope and Stewardson established the firm in 1885, and were joined by John's brother Emlyn in 1887. It went on to become one of the most influential and prolific firms of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. They made formative additions to the campuses of [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/tour/danforth2/introduction.html Cope &amp; Stewardson at Washington University in St. Louis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527101901/http://www.wustl.edu/tour/danforth2/introduction.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also designed nine cottages and an administrative building at the Sleighton School, which showed their adaptability to other styles, because their buildings here were Colonial Revival with Federal influences. In 1912, the firm was succeeded by Stewardson and Page formed by Emlyn Stewardson and George Bispham Page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/25417 Stewardson and Page ([[floruit|fl.]] 1912–1936)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and influence ==
[[File:Harrison Building, Philadelphia HABS (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Alfred C. Harrison Building, Philadelphia (1894-95, demolished 1969).]]
Although Walter Cope and John Stewardson were major exponents of the Collegiate Gothic style which swept campuses across the country in the latter part of the nineteenth century, they were equally adept at other styles. Their first important commission was the main [[Young Men's Christian Association|YMCA]] for [[Richmond, Virginia]] (1885–87), designed in a [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style.

Their earliest major Collegiate Gothic building was Radnor Hall at [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1886), where, ironically, they replaced Cope's mentor [[Addison Hutton]] as campus architects.  Commissions shortly followed for buildings on the campuses of the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (serving as administrative buildings for the 1904 [[St. Louis World's Fair]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer04/AGloriousWorld%27sFair-np.htm A Glorious World's Fair Transforms a University Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; Although these academic buildings were their hallmark, other projects included residential, commercial, institution, and industrial buildings.

The firm designed Philadelphia buildings for the Harrison brothers, heirs to an enormous sugar-refining fortune. The Charles Custis Harrison Building (1893–94) was a Richardsonian Romanesque office building at 10th and Market Streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hh:2:./temp/~ammem_YkOH:: Charles C. Harrison Building] from HABS.&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1979 to build [[The Gallery at Market East]], an urban shopping mall. Directly north of it was the Harrison Stores (1893–94), a block-long commercial building and warehouse. This burned in 1984 during a renovation, and was demolished. The Alfred Craven Harrison Building (1894–95) was a [[chateauesque]] hotel and office tower at the southwest corner of 15th and Market Streets, opposite [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]]. Demolished in 1969, the site is now occupied by the [[Centre Square (Building)|Centre Square]] Building and [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s [[Clothespin (Oldenburg)|''Clothespin'']].

[[Charles Custis Harrison]] became [[Provost (education)|provost]] of the University of Pennsylvania in 1894, and immediately removed [[Frank Furness]] as unofficial campus architect, replacing him with Cope &amp; Stewardson.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Thomas, et al., ''Frank Furness: The Complete Works'' (Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Harrison, the university embarked on the biggest building boom in its history, with Cope &amp; Stewardson designing the mammoth Quadrangle dormitories and new buildings for the engineering school, medical school, dental school, veterinary school, law school, zoological labs and English department &amp;ndash; all clad in Collegiate Gothic. The firm also collaborated with architects [[Wilson Eyre]] and [[Frank Miles Day]] on the initial phases of the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts &amp; Crafts]]-style [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] (1895–99).

As important as their contribution to the architecture of Philadelphia and its environs is the role which Cope &amp; Stewardson played in architectural education. Great numbers of young apprentices and would-be architects passed their days of training in the office, making it a general stopping place for many architects who would later become famous in their own right. In 1923 the annual [[T-Square club]] exhibition catalog published a photograph of the Cope &amp; Stewardson office from about 1899. Included in the number of partners and younger architects are: Walter Cope; John A. MacMahon; [[James O. Betelle]] (later of Newark, NJ); Emlyn Stewardson; S. A. Cloud; Wetherill P. Trout; [[Herbert C. Wise]]; [[Jamieson and Spearl|James P. Jamieson]]; Eugene S. Powers; E. Perot Bissell; Louise Stavely; Charles H. Bauer (later in Newark, NJ); William Woodburn Potter; John Molitor, Camillo Porecca; and C. Wharton Churchman.

==Walter Cope (1860–1902)==
In 1860, Walter Cope was born in Philadelphia to Thomas P. Cope and Elizabeth Waln Stokes Cope. After graduating from the [[Germantown Friends School]], he attended classes at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in 1883. In 1885 the firm of Cope &amp; Stewardson was established.

Cope was a founding member of the T-Square Club in 1883 and later served as vice-president, secretary, treasurer, president, and as a member of the executive committee. He was also a Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania from 1892 to 1902.  After teaching at Penn, he became a Professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  He died after suffering a stroke in 1902.

Cope was also part of the investigating committee appointed to study conditions governing the new State Capitol Building competition in 1901. From 1896 to 1898 he was chairman of the committee on the restoration of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]].

==John Stewardson (1858–1896)==
John Stewardson, son of Thomas and Margaret Haines Stewardson, was born in 1858. His early education had been in private Christian schools in the Philadelphia area. He continued his studies at Adams Academy in Quincy, Massachusetts from 1873 to 1877. 
After graduation, he entered [[Harvard College]], but left in 1878. He briefly continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania and then joined the Atelier Pascal in Paris, France.  In 1882 he returned to Philadelphia, working first in [[Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr.|T. P. Chandler]]'s office and then in the office of [[Frank Furness]].

In 1884 he returned to Europe to travel through Italy and Belgium. A year later, he joined in personal practice with Walter Cope. They were joined in 1887 by John's younger brother Emlyn L. Stewardson, who had recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in [[civil engineering]].

In 1892, Stewardson joined the University of Pennsylvania as staff lecturer in their new School of Architecture. He was also one of the founding members of the [[T-Square Club]], serving in 1885 and 1891 as president of that organization. He also served as treasurer of the Philadelphia Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) in 1886.

He is credited with the taste for English [[Gothic Revival]] which Cope &amp; Stewardson used in their collegiate buildings. [[Talbot Hamlin]], in his biographical description, for the Dictionary of American Biography notes that, following Stewardson's trip to England in 1894, the buildings at the University of Pennsylvania, which were on the boards at the time, changed from stone structures to brick with stone trim.

Stewardson died in 1896 after a skating accident on the [[Schuylkill River]], where he had gone for an afternoon's outing with his friend, the architect [[Wilson Eyre]]. Following his funeral his fellow architects established a fund, now known as the prestigious Stewardson Fellowship, which is awarded annually to promising young architects from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to study architecture abroad.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery.

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf.

Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson&lt;ref name="allourfutures"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=All our futures: Creativity, culture, education|year=1998|publisher=National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education|url=http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016051449/http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Craft&lt;ref name="Craft1" /&gt; have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle.

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickerson&lt;ref name="Nickerson99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R. S.|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J. (2006). How early school experiences impact creativity. In J. C. Kaufman &amp; J. Baer (Eds.), Creativity and Reason in Cognitive Development (pp. 333–350). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson. S.|title=The creative platform: A new paradigm for teaching creativity|journal=Problems of Education in the 21st Century|year=2009|volume=18|pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E. Paul (Ellis Paul)|date=2002|publisher=Ablex Pub|isbn=978-0313011863|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=|oclc=52769638}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to [[Creativity#"Four C" model|everyday creative expression]].&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"/&gt;

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the [[Arrowverse|television programs]], was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed five films. The series has grossed over $3.7 billion at the global box office, currently making it the [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourteenth highest-grossing film franchise]].

The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]], casts. Several actors, including [[Henry Cavill]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]], and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], have appeared in numerous films of the franchise, with continued appearances in sequels planned. In May 2016, DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the [[DC Films]] division and oversee creative decisions, production and [[Story arc|story-arcs]] in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. In January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the president of DC Films, replacing Berg.

The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), and ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018). The franchise will continue with scheduled release dates for ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' in 2019, as well as ''[[DC Extended Universe#Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (2020)|Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn)]]'' and ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' scheduled for release in 2020. A multitude of other projects are in various stages of development.

== Additional materials ==

[[File:BvS Communion Scene Steppenwolf.png|thumb|right|The "Communion" scene in ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' teases the events in ''Justice League'', showing the villain [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] and the three [[Mother Box]]es.]]

In order to expand and build the universe the films are set in, some additional material has been released, such as additional scenes or bonus material included in the home releases of the films. The purpose of said material is also to set up and tease the overarching narrative that future installments of the franchise will adhere to. In the case of additional scenes, on March 28, 2016, Warner Bros. released to the public via its YouTube channel, a scene not shown in theaters from ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', titled "Communion", which teased the events that would be depicted in ''Justice League''; the scene was later integrated in the Ultimate Edition home release of the film. Similarly, in the Blu-ray disc home release of ''Wonder Woman'', an epilogue is included in the form of a [[short film|short]] titled "Etta's Mission", which details a final incident that transpired after the events of the film. Etta teases the existence of a Mother Box, which is crucial to the storyline of ''Justice League''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Jacks |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1697329/how-the-new-wonder-woman-epilogue-will-connect-to-justice-league |title=How The New Wonder Woman Epilogue Will Connect To Justice League |website=Cinemablend.com |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the Blu-ray home release of ''Justice League'', two additional scenes not shown in the theatrical cut are included, which further flesh-out the return of Superman and him joining the League.

Furthermore, the various special featurettes and documentaries included in the Blu-ray home releases of the films feature concept arts and designs, as well as background information that greatly expands the shared universe; giving detailed insight into the fictional history, technology, worlds and cultures that appear in the films.

Although not all the films in the franchise resort to this practice, some of them make use of [[post-credits scene]]s to further develop character relationships and establish the plot elements that will influence future installments, such as ''Suicide Squad'' and ''Justice League''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1898">'''De Onbekende Beeldhouwer''' (the Anonymous Sculptor) exhibited notable sculptures regularly in [[Amsterdam]] through the 1980s and 1990s. At least eight works that attracted public interest have been assigned to him or her. They include "The Violinist" (1991), which can be seen at the [[Stopera]] in Amsterdam.

==Unknown==
The sculptor's identity (or possibly identities) has remained unknown. The "suspects" have included Gene Holt, an American sculptor, who issued a denial in 2013, and the former Dutch Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]]. It has been stated by the [[Government of Amsterdam]] that the sculptor is a medical person of note, who wishes to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Depictions, text in Dutch [http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm Retrieved 23 June 2017.] See also [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Onbekende_Beeldhouwer] and [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Anonymous_sculptor?uselang=nl#mw-subcategories Retrieved 23 June 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Death of the Virgin''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]], from c. 1462–1464. 

In this picture Mantegna depicts the last moment of Mary's life within a space defined by classical architectures, with a squared pavement which leads the observer's eyes towards the bed on which the Virgin lies. In the background is a lake scene which is a detailed reproduction of the bridge and the burgh of the [[Castello di San Giorgio|Castle of St. George]] in [[Mantua]]. The work was originally part of the decoration of the Castle chapel, together with three panels now in the [[Uffizi]] of [[Florence]] (''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'','' [[The Ascension (Mantegna)|The Ascension]]'' and ''[[The Circumcision (Mantegna)|The Circumcision]]'') and one now in [[Ferrara]] (''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]'').

The unfinished appearance of the pilasters in the upper part of the picture suggests that it was once larger than it appears today. The fragment of ''Christ with the Virgin's Soul'', now in [[Ferrara]], was most likely part of the original composition.{{CN|date=February 2015}}

'''Developing Lives''' is a photography program run for residents of the [[New York City Housing Authority]] or [[New York City Housing Authority|NYCHA]], a [[government agency]] that provides [[public housing]] for low and moderate residents throughout the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Studio&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Studio NYCHA|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/|publisher=NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program provides workshops by NYCHA using privately donated film cameras and laptops along with discounted film development.&lt;ref name=Studio /&gt;  Private support of NYCHA programs is welcome given the agency experiencing huge shortfalls in operating and capital funding.&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Public Housing|title=Testimony from NYCHA Chairman John B.

== History ==

Developing Lives began in the Housing Authority’s Manhattanville Development in fall 2010 with a handful of participants.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; The program has by now included residents of 15 of the agency’s 334 developments. Meanwhile, over 10,000 viewers have seen the photographs online.&lt;ref name=Brochure&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Brochure|url=http://seeingforourselves.org/media/developing-lives-brochure.pdf|publisher=Seeing for Ourselves|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing Lives was brought to NYCHA by former [[New York City Transit Authority|MTA]] executive [[George Carrano]] of the non-profit [[Seeing For Ourselves]], which also arranged the private partnerships behind the program.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Meet the Team|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/meet-the-team/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carrano had served as curator of photography exhibits of war [[photojournalism]] and participatory photography that were lauded in the media as poignant&lt;ref name=Salamon&gt;{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Child Photographers Show Lives of Hardship and Hope|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/10/arts/child-photographers-show-lives-of-hardship-and-hope.html|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not to be missed.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite news|last=The New York Time|title=Art Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/arts/design/30art.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Chelsea Davis, founder of two participatory arts programs and with family roots in NYC public housing, directs the program. Lily Randall, former art instructor in St. Louis public housing, also helped run Developing Lives.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== Developing Lives as Photography ==

Developing Lives belongs to the school of participatory photography. This school turns the traditional photography paradigm on its head. Those whose normal role is limited to their function as objects of photography receive training to document their own lives. The movement originated in American efforts two decades ago to aid rural Chinese women, who had never used a camera, but now encompasses all efforts to take charge of one's own narrative using photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;  Milestones include the NYC exhibit Unbroken by [[Photovoice|PhotoVoice]], a group dedicated to this school of photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamon"/&gt; George Carrano served as the show’s curator.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== The Program ==

Developing Lives includes weekly sessions in which instructors present a new [[Photography|photography technique]] (light, shadow, camera language, etc.) and introduce a well-known photographer whose work exemplifies that technical style. The program distributes single-use Kodak cameras at the start of every class which are returned the following week. The [[film]] is then processed and photographs reviewed and returned. Participants are asked to bear in mind the new photography technique when documenting their lives throughout the week.&lt;ref name=Class&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Class Information|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching technical skills, Developing Lives also helps participants become [[Documentary film|documentary]] photographers. The classes discuss the art of [[storytelling]] through a photograph. All photographs are paired with handwritten captions from the photographer.&lt;ref name=Class /&gt;

The Developing Lives photographs were combined with a narrative explaining the challenges faced by residents, and published as [[Project Lives]] in April 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">'''Diction''' ({{lang-la|dictionem}} (nom. {{lang|la|dictio}}), "a saying, expression, word"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Diction&amp;searchmode=none Diction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915232638/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Diction&amp;searchmode=none |date=2011-09-15 }}, Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; in its original, primary meaning, is a writer's or speaker's distinctive [[vocabulary]] choices and style of expression in a poem or story.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/diction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crannell97p406"&gt;Crannell (1997) ''Glossary'', p.406&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary, common meaning of "diction" means the distinctiveness of [[speech]],&lt;ref name="Crannell97p406"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Littré - Diction''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Le Roy, ''Traité pratique de la diction française'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; the art of speaking so that each word is clearly heard and understood to its fullest complexity and extremity, and concerns [[pronunciation]] and tone, rather than word choice and style. This secondary sense is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term [[enunciation]], or with its synonym [[Manner of articulation|articulation]].&lt;ref name="Crannell97p84"&gt;Crannell (1997) Part II, Speech, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Diction has multiple concerns, of which [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is foremost—another way of saying this is whether words are either [[formality|formal]] or [[colloquialism|informal]] in the social context. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes [[setting tone|tone]] and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.

[[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]] (20) states that "Diction comprises eight elements: [[Phoneme]], [[Syllable]], [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]], [[Logical connective|Connective]], [[Noun]], [[Verb]], [[Inflection]], and [[Utterance]]. However, Epps states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in this passage "the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means."

==In literature==
Diction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer.

;Example : Certain writers in the modern day and age use archaic terms such as "thy", "thee", and "wherefore" to imbue a Shakespearean mood to their work.

Forms of diction include: Archaic Diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), High Diction (lofty sounding language), and Low Diction (everyday language). Each of these forms are to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author's work.

==Education==
Union Institute, BA, 1990. The University of Iowa, MFA, 1993. Two years post-graduate studies in literature, [[multiculturalism]], and criticism at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], 1994–96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html dorenrobbins.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145615/http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early influences, development of poetry==
Doren Robbins began actively publishing [[poetry]] in the 1970s. In 1969, while reading [[Henry Miller]]'s ''The Time of the Assassins'', his study of [[Arthur Rimbaud]], Robbins became aware of [[Kenneth Rexroth]]'s poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable "Memorial" for [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 poetryfoundation.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010024456/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thou Shalt Not Kill," about which Miller stated, "If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this "'Memorial.'" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with ''The Diary of Najinsky'', [[Van Gogh]]'s ''Letters'', [[Kenneth Patchen]]'s ''The Journal of Albion Moonlight'', [[Jack Hirschman]]'s ''Artaud Anthology'', and [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s ''The Murder of Christ'', making the connection to Rexroth's [[elegy]] for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted [[Social alienation|alienation]] of society with the [[vulnerability]] and ensuing [[martyrdom]] of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue "My Dylan Thomas," the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' ''Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By [[John Malcolm Brinnin]] and Leftover Life To Kill By [[Caitlin Thomas]]''. The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in general.
After a five-year period of studying many of the key books of [[Western literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]], Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become—through his essays in ''Bird in the Bush'', ''Classics Revisited'', and ''Assays''; along with his ''Collected Shorter Poems'', ''Collected Longer Poems'', and his many books of translations—his initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]]. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solt&lt;ref&gt;[http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc highmoonoon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230015338/http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc |date=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker.

==Political sensibility==
Clearly, as explored in his essay ''The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community'',&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his prose poem, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', Perivale Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  honoring the [[anarchist]] organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation.  It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as ''For [[Pablo Neruda]],'' ''Hooker with a Lily'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Roots and the Towers'', Third Rail Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''They're Honking at a Woman'', ''The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream'', ''Collecting Myself'',&lt;ref&gt;''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;/ref&gt;  or the later poems ''My Pico Boulevard'', ''Gregor Samsa's Face'', ''Her Friday'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Driving Face Down'', Eastern Washington University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his more recent poems ''Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood'', ''Latina Worker'', ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', and ''Before and After Tampico''&lt;ref&gt;From ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', Eastern Washington University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetry.la/page188.html poetry.la]&lt;/ref&gt; display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter "Alienated Labor" from the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts'', but the underlying thematics in Robbins' [[political poetry|political poems]] are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the''...Rabelais...Whitman'' essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people—aside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace—shows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, as in his ''Neruda'' poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against—de Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that ''we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are—their work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane''.&lt;ref&gt;Third Rail #4, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem "Sympathetic Manifesto" with these final lines: "I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance" (60).  And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that "To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture—is the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans."&lt;ref&gt;Notes to ''The Three Penny Opera'', Grove, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there does not appear to be a consistent "reductive" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that "Complex seeing must be practiced."  Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are "Predators' Hour2, Open All Night"&lt;ref&gt;''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (63-66).&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Ash Lands." Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com.  Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Art supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other than our own resilient skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Baroque Magazine'' Vol. 26 No. 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: "Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty.  But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing."&lt;ref&gt;See "Biography," Dorenrobbins.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural work==
Influenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as [[George Hitchcock (poet)|George Hitchcock]]'s ''Kayak'', [[Clayton Eshleman]]'s ''Caterpillar'', and [[Robert Bly]]'s ''The Seventies'' with its emphases on "wild association", political poetry, and critical [[book review]]s, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, ''Third Rail'' (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982.
The avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'', [[William Carlos Williams]]'s ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'', [[Louis Zukofsky]]'s ''"A"'', and [[Charles Olsen]]'s ''The Maximus Poems''. The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'', the French "cubist" poetry of [[Pierre Reverdy]], and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets [[George Oppen]], the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and the [[Beat Generation]] poet [[Philip Whalen]]. On the other hand, [[Beat poet]]s [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Harold Norse]], and [[Charles Bukowski]] carried on the [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] tradition of the authentic voice, "I was the man, I suffered, I was there." Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'' combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's ''Kayak'' and Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'', Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to [[surrealism]], but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of "automatic writing" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of [[language poets]]. To this end Bly emphasized the works of [[Georg Trakl]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[César Vallejo]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive [[depth psychology]] fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and [[bathos]]; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated.
For Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of ''Third Rail'' was basically connected to the paths ''Kayak'', ''Caterpillar'', and ''The Seventies'' were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as "the international idiom". From 1975–1982, ''Third Rail'' published works by [[Henry Miller]], [[Walter Lowenfels]], [[Kenneth Rexroth]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Jack Micheline]], [[Christopher Buckley (poet)|Christopher Buckley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/buckley/index.html creativewriting.ucr.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Blazek]], [[Andrea Hollander Budy]], [[Naomi Shihab Nye]], Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, [[Paul Eluard]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], [[Natalia Gorbanevskaia]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as "Poets on [[Chile]], Neruda, [[Isabel Allende|Allende]]" (1976) and "Poets Against Nuclear Power" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of ''Kayak Press'', George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker.

In 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, ''Electric Rexroth''.  His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, [[Gerald Stern]], Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, [[Ingrid Wendt]], Clayton Eshlemen, [[Marvin Bell]], and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for ''Electric Rexroth'' were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative [[lyrical poetry]]: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness  pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of cliché. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, "Someone waiting for me among the violins," Philip Levine's, "The Simple Truth," Tania Pryputneiwicz's "Labor," and Gerald Stern's "Ducks Are for Our Happiness," are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for ''Electric Rexroth'', Robert Bly's "An Open Rose," and "Grandma's Myth" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'' (Cedar Hill Press).

==Themes==
Ethnic and working-class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter.  Whether they be family members that escaped [[pogrom]]s in [[Ukraine]], deserted the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], survived [[World War I|WWI]], [[World War II|WWII]], the [[Korean War|American-Korean War]], or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the [[Vietnam War|American-Vietnam War]] or the violent conflicts in [[Latin America]], many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence.  The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of [[persecution]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems "Before and After Tampico", "Four Family", and "My Pico Boulevard". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and [[manifesto]], "Poetry is in the Streets" ("Le Poesy es en la rue"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and [[censorship]] underlying and undermining the subject.  These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of [[injustice]] and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament.  One of his more noted poems, "For Neruda",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Roots'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, [[dissidence]], and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to [[Joseph Stalin]].

Robbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, [[carpenter]]s and war [[veteran]]s making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a [[concentration camp]] working the [[delicatessen]] counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]s and [[department store]]s.  His poems "Anna", and "Dvayda", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Wife of Bath]]'' with her exceptional forthrightness or [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Emilia (Othello)|Emilia]] with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of [[B. Traven]]'s ''[[The Death Ship]]'' can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, "Before and After Tampico."

For Robbins, the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] of "Poetry is in the Streets" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]]s that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression.  Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]],&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Sympathetic'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, "Name a Dish After Me",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Donkey's'' 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure.

Robbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books ''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', (Van Nuys: Perivale Press, 1987) 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''Seduction of the Groom''.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Seduction of the Groom: Love Poems'' (Palos Verdes, Loom Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are "In-terminal Rose", "Seduction of the Groom", "Dreaming of a Daughter", and "In the Middle of a Fight". Examples from his more recent collections ''Double Muse&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Double Muse'' (Rabbel-A Press 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;'',  ''The Donkey's Tale''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren. ''The Donkey's Tale'' (Los Angeles, Red Wind Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Driving Face Down'',&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Driving Face Down'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and "My Piece of the Puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  include "You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I", "Marc Chagall and the Male Soul", "I Went Through a Box of Emily's [[Shell Jewelry]]", "The Eighties"; and from current published poems: "Pulled Over", "The Fire Petal", "The Weaving", "The Sexiest Part", "My Boat, My Waves", and "Badlands and Outlands".

While the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, "Badlands and Outlands" (''Double Muse'' 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, "Badlands and Outlands" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment.  The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self-destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces "not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops […]" And yet, there is "…the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is "crested, empathic, vulgar." The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: "momentary undermined attentions, in Florence—/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence."

==Style, form, and themes==
Many poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem.  In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, "I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[…]" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Doren Robbins, [untitled statement of prose poetry], ''Bear Flag Republic: Prose Poems and Poetics from California'', ed. Christopher Buckley and Gary Young (Santa Cruz: Greenhouse Review Press/ Alcatraz Editions, 2008) 327-28.&lt;/ref&gt;   Arguably, the collage technique of [[monologue]], short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and [[vaudeville]]-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in ''House of Fame'', Bottom's dream from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', as well Shakespeare's other "clowns" in ''[[Othello]]'' and particularly the "philosophizing" clown in ''[[King Lear]]''.

Robbins' first prose collection, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'', certainly displays an affinity with [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne's]] enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. His prose poem essay in ''Bear Flag Republic'' notes with appreciation the writings of [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]], Henry Miller, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Marguerite Young]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] Jr., [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Stephen Dixon (author)|Stephen Dixon]], and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted ''Journal of Albion Moonlight''.  Such works as "Chaucer's Quill, [[Sappho]]'s Libido, [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Eye Brows", "Dealing With the Insomnia Surf", "Pantagruel Antigruel", "As Much Sex as Elvis", "Green Torso", and "Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation", from ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'' appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry.  Whether these "omissions" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output.  Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'', such as "Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/fiction.htm 25. Robbins, Café Irreal, #29]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Nothing but an Ear",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpse.org/ See ''Exquisite Corpse'', #14 &amp; #16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir",&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hotel Amerika'', Vol.7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; from the forthcoming novella, ''Twin Extra'' (Highmoonoon 2010); and "Just My Luck", "My Defects Call Me Back", and "Night Song" from the ''Bear Flag Republic'' prose poem anthology.

[[File:Francis Burnand.png|thumb|right|250px|From ''The History of [[Punch (magazine)|"Punch"]]'']]
'''Sir Francis Cowley Burnand''' (29 November 1836 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1917), usually known as '''F. C. Burnand''', was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s opera ''[[Cox and Box]]''.

The son of a prosperous family, he was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 [[Victorian burlesque]]s, [[farces]], [[pantomime]]s and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques ''Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863) and ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'' (1866).  Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'' as a comic opera, ''Cox and Box'', with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.

By the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879). For ''Punch'', among other things, he wrote the popular column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to ''Punch'' for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] and [[Weedon Grossmith]] was a high point of his tenure in 1888–89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two [[Edmond Audran]] operettas, titled ''La Cigale'' and ''Miss Decima'' (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of ''[[Cinderella]]'' (1905) and ''Aladdin'' (1909).

Known generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary [[W. S. Gilbert]] but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US.  He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on ''Punch''.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Burnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, ''née'' Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 8 June 2014, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32183}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old [[Savoy]]ard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist [[Hannah Cowley]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Burnand was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where, aged fifteen, he wrote a [[farce]], ''Guy Fawkes Day'', played at [[William Cookesley|Cookesley]]'s house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, [[Worthing]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U194179 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], ''Who Was Who'', online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], [[Edwin Guest]], of the establishment of a [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]], with a performance of ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt; Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the [[Barrister|bar]], but the Burnands held the right to appoint the [[vicar|incumbent]] of a [[Church of England]] parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=aam&gt;Milne, A. A. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Archive, Oxford University Press, 1927, accessed 8 June 2014 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon|Cuddesdon]] theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last long. To the disappointment of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Death of Sir Francis Burnand", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 April 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860s: start of writing career===
[[File:F C Burnand Charicatures Shakespeare.png|right|thumb|upright|Burnand as Mr Punch, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'''s mascot]]
In February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]], ''Dido the Celebrated Widow'', a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', played at the [[St James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=nicoll288&gt;Nicoll, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841–1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal ''The Glow-Worm'' and then joined the staff of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', edited by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 [[burlesque (literary)|literary burlesque]] of a [[George W. M. Reynolds|Reynolds]] serial, entitled ''Mokeanna, or the White Witness''. He showed his manuscript to [[Mark Lemon]], editor of ''Punch'', who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a ''Punch'' writer for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;{{refn|[[W. S. Gilbert]], later Burnand's rival as a comic playwright, made the opposite journey, severing his connection with ''Punch'' in favour of ''Fun'' when Lemon turned down one of Gilbert's ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Great English Humorists – Gilbert and Burnand", ''The Times'', 18 November 1936, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

''Dido'' was followed by ''The Îles of St Tropez'' (1860), ''Fair Rosamond'' (1862) and ''The Deal Boatman'' (1863), among many others.&lt;ref name=Parker84&gt;Parker, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, ''[[Ixion]], or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863), starring [[Lydia Thompson]] in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For ''Ixion'' this brought him a total of around £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early works included an [[opéra bouffe]], ''Windsor Castle'' (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including ''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]], or, Taken from the Greek'', and ''[[Guy Fawkes]], or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons'', both in 1866.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', parodying the three-act melodrama by [[Douglas Jerrold]], ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'';&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ts5ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 "''The Morning Post''"], ''Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', review in ''The Morning Post'', digitized by The British Library (2013), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; the show ran for 400 nights at the [[Royalty Theatre]], was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt;

[[File:Black eyed See-Usan - Weir Collection.jpg|upright|thumb|Theatre poster for Burnard's ''Black Eyed See-Usan'']]
In 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce ''Box and Cox'' as a [[comic opera]], ''[[Cox and Box]]'', with music by the young composer [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Cox and Box" &amp;ndash; A Postscript", ''The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Journal'', 1968, volume IX, 7, pp.132–133; and "Adelphi Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 May 1867, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''Fun'' was [[W. S. Gilbert]], who wrote
{{quote|Mr Sullivan's music is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded. It is very funny, here and there, and grand or graceful when it is not funny; but the grand and the graceful have, we think, too large a share of the honours to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
''Cox and Box'' became a popular favourite and was frequently revived.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Royal Gallery of Illustration]]", ''The Times'', 30 March 1869, p. 10 "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 15 July 1880, p. 6; "Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 March 1895, p. 12; and "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 25 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15, 140–186 and xxv–xxvi; and [http://www.gloc.org/#/cox-and-box/4584711461 "Cox and Box on tour"], [[Grosvenor Light Opera Company]], accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46774. "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 8 July 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), revised and expanded as ''[[The Chieftain]]'' (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 62; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

More burlesques followed in 1868, including ''Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard'' and ''The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1869, Burnand wrote ''The Turn of the Tide'', which was a success at the [[Queen's Theatre]], and six other stage works during the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

===1870s: prolific author===
[[File:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 61.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Burnand, c. 1870s]]
Burnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp89208/rosina-nee-ranoe-lady-burnand "Rosina (née Ranoe), Lady Burnand"], National Portrait Gallery, accessed 9 July 2014. She had appeared in, among other things, Burnand's ''Black-Eyed Susan'' and Gilbert's ''[[An Old Score]]'', and had performed together with her sister and Burnand in Burnand's one-act burlesque of ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [http://www.mocavo.com/Sir-Charles-Wyndham-a-Biography-2/116574/59#62 ''Patient Penelope; or, The Return of Ulysses''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister,{{refn|This became legal in 1907 under the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].|group=n}} although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Throughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to [[pantomime]]s, farces and [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref name=nicoll289&gt;Nicoll, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with [[Thomas German Reed]], [[James Lynam Molloy|J. L. Molloy]], [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and even with H. J. Byron.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; His stage pieces of the 1870s included ''Poll and Partner Joe'' (1871),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Penelope Anne'' (1871; a sequel to ''Cox and Box''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''The Miller and His Man'' (1873; "a Christmas drawing room extravaganza" with songs by Sullivan),&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/miller/index.html ''The Miller and His Man''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artful Cards'' (1877),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Proof'' (1878),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Dora and Diplunacy'' (1878, a burlesque of [[Clement Scott]]'s ''Diplomacy'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Our Club'' (1878)&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; and another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879).&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He provided a burlesque of ''Robbing Roy'' to the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''The Times'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he "was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Burnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Edmond Audran]], [[Charles Lecocq]] and [[Robert Planquette]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of ''Punch'' under Lemon and his successors, [[Shirley Brooks]] and [[Tom Taylor]], writing a regular stream of genial articles.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; His best-known work for the magazine was the column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. [[A. A. Milne]] considered it "one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in ''Punch''"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as "The New History of Sandford and Merton" (1872) and "Strapmore" by "Weeder" (1878).&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;{{refn|These parodied ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' by [[Thomas Day]], a moralising work for children; and ''Strathmore'', a novel by [[Ouida]], in his burlesque of which Burnand parodied two genres: novels of high society and Italian peasant stories.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors whom he satirised included [[Victor Hugo]], presented in ''Punch'' as "Fictor Nogo".&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1880s: editor of ''Punch''===
[[File:J L Toole as Paw Claudian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. L. Toole]] in Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'', 1884]]
The third editor of ''Punch'', Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:
{{quote|It grew less intolerant of opinions with which it disagreed; it became more catholic in its appeal; it began to discard its air of a Family Joke and aspired to be the National Institution which it has since been proclaimed. Yet he always kept for it a note of irresponsibility.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}
A later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, "His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it."  Burnand, who declared himself "hostile to no man's religion", banned ''Punch'''s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in ''Punch'' and on stage, was satire of the [[aesthetic movement]]. His play ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'' (1881), based on ''The Serious Family'', a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. Burnand rushed ''The Colonel'' into production to make sure that it opened several months before [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s similarly themed comic opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, 2nd Edition, vol. 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Patience'' ran even longer than ''The Colonel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]], no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing ''Patience'': "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of ''The Colonel''".&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, p. 109, letter to [[George Grossmith]], April 1881&lt;/ref&gt; For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' entitled ''Ariel'' in October 1883, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], starring [[Nellie Farren]] and [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]]. ''[[The Times]]'' complained of the "flatness and insipidity" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaiety Theatre", ''The Times'', 9 October 1883, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;"At the Play", ''The Observer'', 14 October 1883, p. 7; and "Theatres", ''The Times', 8 December 1883, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Burnand wrote ''Paw Claudian'', a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama ''Claudian'' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at [[Toole's Theatre]] starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; The same year, he wrote a burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', called ''Black Eyed See-Usan'', for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5OE4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 "Dramatic Gossip"], ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]: A Journal'', 16 August 1884, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer [[Edward Solomon]], including ''Pickwick'', which was revived in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production], Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David.

===Later years===
[[File:Chieftain poster 1894.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the original production of ''[[The Chieftain]]'', 1894]]
In 1890, Burnand wrote ''Captain Therèse,'' followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, ''La cigale et la fourmi'' (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled ''La Cigale'', with additional music by [[Ivan Caryll]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lyric Theatre", ''The Times'', 10 October 1890, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's ''Miss Helyett'', retitled as ''Miss Decima''. Burnand's ''The Saucy Sally'' premiered in 1892, and ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', with music by [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], failed despite the contributions of the lyricist [[Adrian Ross]] and a [[Savoy Theatre]] cast including [[Ilka Pálmay]], [[George Grossmith]] and [[Walter Passmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html "''His Majesty''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }}, Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;"Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: ''The Chieftain'', his rewrite of ''The Contrabandista'' with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and ''His Majesty'' managed only 61 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of ''Punch'' to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas reviews in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, Harry. ''The Two Pins Club'' (1925), excerpted in ''The Gilbert Society Journal'', pp. 315–316, vol. 1, no. 10, Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1905, on a pantomime of ''[[Cinderella]]'', and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of ''Aladdin'' for the same theatre in 1909.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; His later contributions to ''Punch'' became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers George and [[Weedon Grossmith]], which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by [[Owen Seaman]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1908, Burnand became the editor of ''The Catholic Who's Who'', published by [[Burns &amp; Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecatholicuniverse.com/pdf/burnand.pdf ""Burns &amp; Oates"], ''The Universe'', January 8, 1909, accessed July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand lived for much of his life in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the [[Garrick Club]] in London.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; George Grossmith wrote:
{{quote|I think Frank Burnand is the most amusing man to meet. He is brimful of good humour. He will fire off joke after joke, and chaff you out of your life if he gets a chance. His chaff is always good-tempered. No one minds being chaffed by Burnand. I will not sing a song when he is in the room if I can possibly help it. He will sit in front of me at the piano, and either stare with a pained and puzzled look during my comic song, or he will laugh in the wrong places, or, what is worse still, take out his pocket-handkerchief and weep."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Books===
Burnand's best-known book, ''Happy Thoughts'', was originally published in ''Punch'' in 1863&amp;ndash;64 and frequently reprinted. This was followed by ''My Time and What I've Done with It'' (1874); ''Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C., Cambridge,'' (1880); ''The Incomplete Angler'' (1887); ''Very Much Abroad'' (1890); ''Rather at Sea'' (1890); ''Quite at Home'' (1890); ''The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe'' (1893); and ''Records and Reminiscences,'' in 1904.

'''Fender Katsalidis Architects''' (FKA) is an [[architecture]] firm in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Founded by [[Karl Fender]] and [[Nonda Katsalidis]], the firm has been notable since the early 1990s, producing many landmark buildings in Melbourne and other Australian cities and also in [[Southeast Asia]]. The firm was first established as Nation Fender and, since 1996, as Nation Fender Katsalidis.&lt;ref&gt;Goad, Philip: New Directions in Australian Architecture, Pesaro Publishing, Balmain, {{ISBN|0-9577560-7-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FKA buildings are distinctive, often very sculptural, they also feature a variety of materials and textures such as exposed steel, left to the weather, or rough hewn timber. Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medallist Peter Wilson has described this material palette as reminiscent of "ageing boat hulls or rough woodsheds and agricultural structures built by first settlers in the Australian landscape." &lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter: Fender Katsalidis: Working Architecture, Uro Publications, Melbourne, {{ISBN| 9780994269775}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early FKA project involved the conversion of former grain silos in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], a Melbourne suburb, into distinctive apartments featuring balconies resembling a ship's bow. FKA also designed [[Eureka Tower]] completed in June 2006 in [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], which has become Melbourne's tallest building and one of the tallest residential buildings in the world.

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

====Narrator====
The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

'''Gaius (or Caius) Fabius Pictor''' made some of the earliest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[painting]]s that have survived.  At least some of his works were painted in 304 BC.&lt;ref name="Matz2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Matz|title=Famous Firsts in the Ancient Greek and Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDjZr6NxQPMC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-0599-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt; No tradition of Roman painting exists earlier than the time of Fabius, nor does his example appear to have been followed by any of his contemporaries; for an interval of nearly a hundred and fifty years occurs before any mention is made of another Roman painter.

Fabius, called Pictor, a Roman artist, descended from the celebrated [[Fabia (gens)|family of the Fabii]], painted principally at Rome. Pictor was the grandfather of the Roman historian [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]. In 304 BC, Pictor decorated the Temple of Salus on the [[Quirinal Hill]], with a representation (presumably) of the battle gained by Bubulus over the [[Samnium|Samnites]]. His paintings were preserved until the reign of the [[Caligula|Emperor Gaius]], when the temple was destroyed by fire. They were probably held in little estimation, as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], to whom they must have been known, neither acquaints us with the subjects, nor commends the execution.

The art of painting in its rude and early forms was general in Italy, but was founded on the [[Etruscan art|Etruscan style]], which never advanced beyond a flat [[Polychrome|polychromatic]] treatment. In regards to the fine arts, Rome owes all to [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], but in painting never acquired the individuality in which it did in the other arts. Painting was then little respected by the Romans, and that the title of ''Pictor'' was not considered as an honourable distinction, but rather intended to stigmatize the illustrious character who had degraded his dignity by the practice of an art which was held in no consideration, may be inferred from a passage of [[Cicero]], in the first book of his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes|Tusculan Disputations]]'': "An censemus si Fabio nobilissimo homini laudatum esset quod pingeret, non multos etiam apud nos Polycletos et [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasios]] fuisse."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">'''Globs''' are millimeter-sized color modules  found beyond the [[Visual cortex|visual area V2]] in the [[brain]]'s color processing [[Two Streams hypothesis|ventral]] (also known as parvocellular) pathway. They are scattered throughout the posterior [[inferior temporal cortex]] in an area called the [[Visual cortex|V4 complex]]. They are clustered by color preference, and organized as color [[Cortical column|column]]s. They are the first part of the brain in which color is processed in terms of the full range of [[hue]]s found in [[color space]].&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Conway BR, Tsao DY. (2009). Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:18035-18039. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.0810943106}} {{PMID|19805195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohon, Hermann, Conway|title=Representation of perceptual color space in macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex (the V4 Complex)|journal=eNeuro|date=2016|doi=10.1523/ENEURO.0039-16.2016|url=http://eneuro.org/content/early/2016/08/11/ENEURO.0039-16.2016|accessdate=September 3, 2016|pmc=5002982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "glob" was proposed by [[Bevil Conway]] and [[Doris Tsao]]&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;Conway BR, Moeller S, Tsao DY. (2007). Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex. Neuron. 56(3):560-73. {{PMID|17988638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Conway BR, Tsao DY. (2009). Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:18035-18039. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.0810943106}} {{PMID|19805195}}&lt;/ref&gt; on an analogy with the cytochrome-oxidase
[[blob (visual system)|blob]]s of [[visual cortex|V1]], an earlier stage in the hierarchical elaboration of color.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone MS, Hubel DH. (1984). [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/4/1/309 Anatomy and physiology of a color system in the primate visual cortex.] J Neurosci. 4(1):309-56. {{PMID|6198495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also distinguishes them from other types of modules found elsewhere in the [[cerebral cortex]] such as face patches, and inferior
temporal feature columns.&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

==Properties==
Globs are found in the V4 complex, an area in the inferior temporal cortex, forward of area V3, that includes areas V4, the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] part of the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the rear part of the inferior temporal near the occipital lobe called TEO. Their neurons are not restricted to a single color preference. Neurons in adjacent glob cells  have similar color tuning and form clusters that are arranged spatially within the cortex.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt; In between them are ‘‘interglob’’ areas that were not color sensitive but respond to shape.&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;  

The color-tuned neurons are arranged in color columns that are of a finer scale than single globs. These columns are between 50 and 100 μm in size. Color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along given columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map that reflects perceptual [[color space]].&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt; 

They are studied using [[functional MRI]]&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt; and [[single-unit recording]].&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

==Color perception==
{{Main|Color vision}}
Three types of retinal [[Cone cell|cone]] create signals that get transformed in the visual pathway to create the perception of color.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conway BR. (2009). Color vision, cones, and color-coding in the cortex. Neuroscientist. 15(3):274-90. {{PMID|19436076}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the neurons processing them in the [[retina]], [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], and V1 and V2 early parts of the visual cortex  encode using the [[opponent process]] only a limited range of colors that does not reflect the dimensions of perceptual color space.&lt;ref&gt;
Conway BR. (2001). [http://www.jneurosci.org/reprint/21/8/2768 Spatial structure of cone inputs to color cells in alert macaque primary visual cortex (V-1).] J Neurosci. 21(8):2768-83. {{PMID|11306629}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only the next area where globs are found that along the visual processing hierarchy, show [[hue]] sensitivity, with the population of
neurons representing most (if not all) of perceptual color space and which the color
responses of neurons correspond to perception.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;

==Details==
The film was produced between 1966-1967 by Rinco-Film in Munich for the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|West German Federal Ministry of Health]] under health minister Käte Ströbel through the German Health Museum.&lt;ref name="MeierHäussler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Meier|author2=Thomas Häussler|title=Zwischen Masse, Markt und Macht: das Medienunternehmen Ringier im Wandel 1833-2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A11IAQAAIAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Chronos|isbn=978-3-0340-0952-2|volume=1|page=493|quote=Im Auftrag der deutschen Gesundheitsministerin Käte Ströbel produzierte sie den überaus erfolgreichen Aufklärungsfilm «Helga - Vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens»..}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents the pregnancy of a young woman from the first visit to the doctor all the way to childbirth.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MierschBroder2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Miersch|author2=Henryk M.

==Impact==
The film has been studied due to its impact on German society  involving the sociopolitical implications of the intervention by the West German federal government in matters of sexual education involving the [[mass media]] as well as the curriculum they approved regarding sexual matters. The West German federal government used the film as an educational tool but also as a means to gain influence in areas such as public health and education which were traditionally under regional jurisdiction,  possibly even bypassing constitutional issues governing the distribution of powers between the Federal government and the regions. Up to that time, regional authorities could veto Federal policies which were seen by  them as encroaching on their cultural policies.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; 

The success of the film when viewed by an audience of a wide and diverse demographic was analysed in terms of its influence on social thinking. [[Gender issues]] related to the film have been considered due to the fact that matters  traditionally concerning privacy, intimacy and femininity, up to that point in time, were made public to a wide demographic through film and the mass media. The commercial success of the film has also been examined since it was a sex-education film without any famous actors or an elaborate plot.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The film was successful in countries such as France, Italy and England which were considered "prudish" at the time.&lt;ref name="Jogschies1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rainer Jogschies|title=Wer zweimal mit derselben pennt--: die befreiten Sechziger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XthGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22&amp;dq=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22|year=1991|publisher=Ullstein|page=75|quote=So sah denn Helga - vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens (1967) auch aus - und wurde dadurch im noch prüderen Frankreich, England und Italien ein überraschender Kassenerfolg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, 1,500 catholic priests and nuns attended a private screening of the film arranged by ''centrale catholique''. The film was also extensively covered by print media such as ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Paris Match]]''.&lt;ref name="Julian2011"/&gt;

The film was a product of a political decision by the West German Federal government to educate the people regarding matters related to procreation and [[family planning]] at a time of advances in the fields of human genetics and contraception. The film gained acceptance in the young adult demographic due to their desire to be informed about issues related to family planning and childbirth as part of a consumer society in which women had to work. Educators, although worried about the impact of the violence of the scenes during childbirth upon the young, also accepted that the film could aid the understanding of husbands concerning the great pains experienced by their wives during childbirth. The film also  presented a new model of informed motherhood based on knowledge and social awareness.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews, with the conservative press leading the way. ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described the film as "enlightening in a comprehensive and rational manner, without hypocrisy and false shame".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The critic added: {{blockquote|The cell proliferation is an aesthetic pleasure, an opal-like miracle of colour with effects of light and  backlight, a piece of art from the era of [[Tachisme]]. The colours are so nice, the fast changes so wonderful that one nearly forgets the subject. Other processes [e.g. the representation of the different stages of the embryo] were still difficult to represent, some shots succeeded here for the first time; experts will rack their brains over how this was achieved}}

The conservative ''Mindener Tageblatt'' commented that "the really scientific information had been conveyed in a flawlessly proper manner without prudery and without arousing inappropriate sexual feelings".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The left-liberal press was more critical of the film. The ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' critic remarked that:&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; {{blockquote|we are at the point of wasting one of our basic rights: the right to keep silent and to privacy [verschlossene Türen] about certain aspects of life which should not be revealed to the public eye as they belong to the private sphere of human nature.}}

The press which was present at the [[sneak preview]] also criticised the film's "ridiculous frame action", "heavy didactic tone" and "lack of contraceptive information". Women correspondents also complained that Helga in "her perfect makeup" during childbirth "did not adequately depict the pain of the anonymous woman in labour".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

Other audience reactions included those of some teenage girls which were shocked by the [[placenta]] removal scenes and the subsequent revelations that the placenta was used for the production of cosmetics. The perspective and appearance of medical instruments was also criticised as reminiscent of a horror film.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The ''Protestant Film Observer'' criticised the presentation  aspects of the film and the absence of information on family planning, [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The '''Jerusalem Center for the Visual Arts''' (JCVA) is an international [[artists-in-residence]] program that hosts artists and curators in [[Israel]].

JCVA promotes cross-cultural dialogue between visiting artists and curators and their Israeli counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a platform for interaction with local artists, curators and art academies, as well as links to museums and general audiences. Visiting artists are invited to work, explore, inspire and be inspired by interactions with people and places. During their residency, the JCVA provides exposure of the artists and curators to the local public by organizing from time to time, exhibitions, screenings and lectures about their oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until 2004, resident artists stayed at the Mount Zion Artists' Residence, in a historic building known as the Rose House on [[Mount Zion]]. Today participants are hosted at the [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]] Cultural Center &amp; Guest House in [[Yemin Moshe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://81.218.229.126/culture/art/rose-house-jerusalem-center-for-visual-arts.aspx Rose House Jerusalem Center for Visual Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tel Aviv. Over the years, JCVA has collaborated with the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]],  Herzliya Museum of Art, the Israeli Center for Digital Art in [[Holon]], the Center for Contemporary Art, [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] and [[Beit Berl College]]'s [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts]].

==JCVA residency==
The JCVA residency provides an opportunity for interaction with the local art community, museums and audiences. The program is designed specially for each guest by JCVA's art director. The residency is by invitation only. The program, established in 1987 by philanthropist Francis K. Lloyd, was directed in its early years by curator Yona Fischer. Since 2002, [[Nirith Nelson]] has served as art director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Past participants in the program include [[Sophie Calle]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Guenther Uecker]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]] (2004), [[Monika Sosnowska]] (2008), [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] (2009), [[Raqs Media Collective]] (2011), [[Joe Kubert]] (2011) and [[Harun Farocki]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2002, [[Yael Bartana]] created her Kings of the Hill video, later purchased for the permanent collection of the [[Tate Modern]] in London &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bartana-kings-of-the-hill-t11804 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in NY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A34409&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2007, [[Anila Rubiku]], who often works with local embroiderers on her complex Urban Pornitecture, was introduced to a group of traditional [[Ethiopian Jew]]ish craftswomen.

[[File:john-hollingshead-1895.jpg|thumb|right|John Hollingshead in 1895]]
'''John Hollingshead''' (9 September 1827 – 9 October 1904) was an English theatrical [[impresario]], journalist and writer during the latter half of the 19th century. After a journalism career, Hollingshead managed the [[Alhambra Theatre]] and was later the first manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]]. Hollingshead also wrote several books during his life.

An innovative producer, Hollingshead brought [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] together in 1871 to produce their first joint work, a musical [[extravaganza]] called ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]''.  Among other theatrical works that he produced, he mounted a long series of popular [[Victorian burlesques]] at the Gaiety, engaging [[Meyer Lutz]] to compose original scores for them. He also produced operettas, plays and other works. These productions made stars of [[Nellie Farren]] and several others. At the Gaiety, in 1878, Hollingshead was the first theatre manager to light his auditorium with electric lights.

==Life and career==
[[File:John Hollingshead.jpg|thumb|right|Hollingshead in an 1870 cartoon]]
Hollingshead was born in [[Hoxton]], Greater London, the son of Henry Randall Hollingshead. He was educated at Homerton.&lt;ref name=Waddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|first=|others=Illustrated by [[s:Author:Frederick Waddy|Frederick Waddy]]|title=Cartoon portraits and biographical sketches of men of the day

|accessdate=6 January 2011|year=1873|publisher=Tinsley Brothers|location=London|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first worked as a bookkeeper for a soft goods company in London in the early 1850s while publishing political essays on finance and social reform.&lt;ref name=Hollingshead73&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He soon entered into a partnership as a clothing merchant.  During this time, Hollingshead and his friend [[Moy Thomas]] began publishing a penny paper called ''The Mail'' that proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, he decided to close his clothing business and begin working as a writer full-time.  By 1855, Hollingshead was married with two children.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), P. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London at the age of 77.

===Journalist and author===
Hollingshead started his journalism career in 1854 under the tutelage of [[Charles Dickens]] at ''Household Words'' magazine and then under [[W. M. Thackeray]] at ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0DE2D61230E132A25752C1A9669D946597D6CF Obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he acted as the "special correspondent" for ''[[The Morning Post]]'' during the London famine.  He also wrote essays, short stories and dramatic criticism.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=New Play at the Odeon; Said Not to Be a Good One, But to Be Interesting|date= 3 October 1892|work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E0D91E39E033A25750C0A9669D94639ED7CF |accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1864, and for several years thereafter, he contributed to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]]'', mostly writing on political topics related to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated the principles of Mill and [[Jeremy Bentham]].  One of his best-known essays was an 1857 piece called "The City of Unlimited Paper", which became famous during the monetary panic of 1857.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; In the 1860s he was on the staff of ''[[Good Words]]'' under [[Norman Macleod (1812–1872)|Norman Macleod]] as editor.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Hollingshead, John|magazine= Who's who biographies, 1901|pages=578–579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollingshead wrote a number of books from the 1850s into the 1860s, including ''On the canal: a narrative of a voyage from London to Birmingham'' (1858); ''Under Bow Bells'' (1860, a collection of some of his essays),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Bow bells |author=John Hollingshead |year=1860|publisher=Groombridge and sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSkgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22under+bow+bells%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_Z2ZbFtdi4&amp;sig=zAyJB2VoYq8ZE1lC7xCnvYt169I }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rubbing the Gilt Off'' (a collection of his early political essays (1860)&lt;ref name=Hollingshead73/&gt; ''Odd Journeys'' (1860, a collection of travels),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Odd journeys in and out of London |author=John Hollingshead |year=1860 |publisher=Groombridge |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKICAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22odd+journeys%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5S30XjAGf2&amp;sig=snXFbK3eXOFbNiNgKGjyzpWSqCY }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ways of Life'' (1861, a volume of humorous papers),&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; ''Ragged London'' (1861, a collection of his reports for the ''Morning Post''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ragged London in 1861 |author=John Hollingshead |year= |publisher= |isbn=1-4021-8921-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsz9S4a4YL4C&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22odd+journeys%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ft-1c6YG7F&amp;sig=KdWsTlRSMpHCf2GohX7kEuOglQg }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Underground London'' (1862).  Other publications included a collection of humorous stories entitled ''Rough Diamonds'' and two volumes of miscellaneous essays called ''Today''.  He also wrote plays.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;

[[File:John Hollingshead - Entr'acte.png|left|thumb|150px|Hollingshead in 1898]]
In the 1880s, Hollingshead returned to writing, producing books mostly about the theatre, including ''Plain English'' (1880),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plain English |author=John Hollingshead |year=1880 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoI0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+%22plain+english%22#PPA120,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Footlights'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footlights |author=John Hollingshead |year=1883 |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02oOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+footlights&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bQMymPBgcA&amp;sig=yrYxlnN4TpyKC_qXD57NcYvt1ts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the 1890s, he wrote a number of memoirs and more books about the theatres that he had managed.  In 1892, he also published ''The Story of Leicester Square'', tracing the history, geography and architecture of the London neighbourhood from earliest times through the date of publication.  His memoir entitled ''My Lifetime'', published in 1895, explores his life and career through that date.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

===Producer and theatre manager===

====The Alhambra Theatre and theatrical innovations====
In the 1860s, Hollingshead turned to theatre management. He helped establish the [[Alhambra Theatre]] and was the stage manager there from 1865 to 1868, in addition to producing musical pieces and ballets there.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring [[corps de ballet]] and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar, where the young ladies of the ballet hinted at more than [[terpsichorean]] pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. "The spark that lit the bonfire", in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'', The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure at the Alhambra, Hollingshead introduced London audiences to the [[Can-Can]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1895), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Hollingshead is also credited with inventing the practice of holding general matinées.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; Hollingshead was one of the first London theatre managers to eliminate fees for programmes and coat check.

He left the Alhambra to manage the newly redesigned [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]. In addition, Hollingshead managed shows at the [[Opera Comique]] from time to time. He produced a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Princess Toto]]'' there in 1881, paired with [[Rutland Barrington]]'s short play, ''Quid Pro Quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Savoy Opera |author=S.

====The Gaiety Theatre====
In 1868, Hollingshead took over the Gaiety Theatre, which had been a large [[music hall]]. The auditorium was rebuilt and, under Hollingshead, it became a venue primarily for musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], variety, continental [[operetta]], including several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]], and light comedy, under Hollingshead's management, from 1868 to 1886.  The theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with the successful ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], a burlesque of the opera ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx Digital Guide to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031152934/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx |date=31 October 2007 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert also wrote ''[[An Old Score]]'' for the theatre in 1869.  Another early production was [[Alfred Thompson (librettist)|Alfred Thompson]]'s ''Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key'' (1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030208.html Information about the ''Columbus'' burlesque]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nellie Farren]] starred in both ''Columbus'' and ''Robert the Devil''.  She continued as "Principal Boy" at the Gaiety for the next 25 years, first under Hollingshead and then under [[George Edwardes]].  Other Gaiety stalwarts were [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]], [[Kate Vaughan]] and [[Fred Leslie]].  The theatre's music director, [[Meyer Lutz]], composed or arranged the music for many of its most successful burlesques.

[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|400px|thumb|left|Illustration of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] work]]
In 1870, [[Henry James Byron]]'s ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' starred a young [[Henry Irving]].  This was the last play that theatre buff [[Charles Dickens]] saw before his death.  Other pieces at Hollingshead's Gaiety in 1870 included ''Dot'' ([[Dion Boucicault]]'s version of ''The Cricket on the Hearth''); and ''The Princess of Trebizonde'', based on the [[Jacques Offenbach]] operetta (1870).  ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first collaboration between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and [[J. L. Toole]] in the title role.  Offenbach's ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'' played in 1872, starring [[Fred Sullivan]].  This was followed by such works as ''Shilly-Shally'' (1872) by [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Charles Reade]]; ''Antony and Cleopatra'' (1873); and ''The Battle of Life'', (based on [[Charles Dickens]]'s Christmas story of that title).  Two other [[Dion Boucicault]] plays produced by Hollingshead's company in the early 1870s were ''Night and Morning'' and ''Led Astray''.  Boucicault's ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' was travestied in Byron's ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Includes a profile of the Gaiety and other Victorian theatres]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Montecristofarren.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sheet music from ''Monte Cristo, Jr.'']]
In the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its auditorium. Hollingshead's productions there included ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), Byron's farce ''Little Doctor Faust'' (1878)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information from Footlight Notes website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's ''Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle'' (1879);&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20050226home.html Information and images regarding ''Handsome Hernani, or The Fatal Penny-Whistle'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Robbing Roy'' (1879).  [[Meyer Lutz]]'s ''[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves]]'' was performed in 1880 (Hollingshead had produced a highly successful charity production called ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' at the Gaiety in 1878), and a burlesque of ''[[Aladdin]]'', by [[Robert Reece]], in 1881.  These were followed by ''Little Robin Hood'' (1882), a burlesque by Reece, ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]], based on ''[[The Tempest]]''), ''Don Yuan'', Byron's ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' (a send-up of Boucicault's play), ''Mazeppa'' (1884), ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), and dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Plarr, Victor G.

Nevertheless, burlesque and risque operettas were the normal fare at the Gaiety.  Hollingshead called himself a "licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, [[Shakespeare]], taste and musical glasses."&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date= 4 January 2008 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, George Edwards took over the lease to the Gaiety.

'''''Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage ''''' is an oil work on canvas painted in 1868 by [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman]] (1808-1873).

== Description ==
The dimensions of the painting are 75 × 105&amp;nbsp;cm. It was purchased for the collection of the [[Ateneum]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063618/FI_280_001.html|title=Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people listen to a [[kantele]] playing. This includes the mistress of the house, young women and their children. Leaning in the corner is a pipe-smoking soldier. The environment is simple, related to their everyday chores, and lit by a daylit window. The work reflects an idealized vision of the Finnish nation and its values.

== Analysis ==
[[Kreeta Haapasalo]] was a well-known folk musician who in periods of famine in the 1860s fed a family by traveling as a [[kantele]] player, singing poetry. It brought her great popularity at a time of great interest in the roots of the Finnish people. Haapasalo was seen at the time as part of an ancient tradition as an interpreter of the [[Kalevala]], through which she was able to get in touch with genuine Finnish culture.

Robert Ekman, the painter, was interested in the origins of Finnish culture. Ekman studied at the Stockholm Academy of Art. He was interested in historical development and the public life of the Finnish people. His genre paintings depicting it were well received. He returned to Finland on a permanent basis, after an Italian and French tour in 1845, after which he taught until his death in [[Turku]] drawing school, which he established in the following year.

{{nihongo|'''''Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things'''''|怪談|Kaidan|also ''Kwaidan'' (archaic)}}, often shortened to '''''Kwaidan''''' ("[[ghost story]]"), is a book by [[Lafcadio Hearn]] that features several [[kaidan|Japanese ghost stories]] and a brief non-fiction study on insects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], "Kwaidan", in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}} (pp. 859-860).&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used as the basis for a movie called ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' by [[Masaki Kobayashi]] in 1964.

==Stories==
Hearn declares in his introduction to the first edition of the book, which he wrote on January 20, 1904, shortly before his death, that most of these stories were translated from old Japanese texts. He also states that one of the stories – ''[[Yuki-onna]]'' – was told to him by a farmer in [[Musashi Province]], and his was apparently the first record of it, both by his own account and according to the research of modern folklorists. ''Riki-Baka'' is based on a personal experience of Hearn's. While he does not declare it in his introduction, ''Hi-Mawari'' – among the final narratives in the volume – seems to be a recollection of an experience in his childhood (it is, setting itself apart from almost all the others, written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and set in rural [[Wales]]).

''[[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'' (abbreviated as ''AVGN'') is an American [[web television]] series of [[comedy]]-themed [[retrogaming]] reviews, created by and starring [[James Rolfe]]. The show revolves around reviews that involve acerbic [[Monologue|rants]] about low quality video games. From the beginning of season 2, new episodes were aired first on [[GameTrailers|GameTrailers.com]], but are since now aired at Cinemassacre.com, with episodes later being [[rerun|re-aired]] on Rolfe's own [[YouTube]] channel. Episodes are usually scheduled for release on the first or second Wednesday of each month; originally, Rolfe's early work schedule allowed for two episodes per month, but other work commitments changed this to its present arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/2010/04/30/avgn-episode-90-action-52/ |title=AVGN: Episode 90 – "Action 52" |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three AVGN episodes, although still available for viewing, never officially made it to/remained on YouTube. One of these, ''Atari Porn'', was removed after the site flagged it for inappropriate content per its community guidelines, while the other two were the two part review of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3''. Two other episodes were later removed for using movie clips from copyrighted films – ''Rocky'' and ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' – but were later reuploaded to YouTube after being amended and changed to comply with the website's policies.

==History==
[[Image:Concert18.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Grote Zaal'' (Great Hall) of the [[Concertgebouw]] after which the Baltimore Lyric Opera House was modeled.]]

===Opera and music at the Lyric===
Prior to the 1909 purchase of the building on behalf of the Metropolitan Opera by [[Otto Kahn]], [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] presented an opera season and began to make plans to remodel it by enlarging the stage area.  However Kahn's purchase caused the venue's name to be changed to the Lyric Theatre.&lt;ref name=MODELL&gt;
[http://www.lyricoperahouse.com/page.php?cms_id=54 Lyric Opera House history] on lyricoperahouse.com.  Retrieved 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and firmed up the continuity of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s annual visits. In the early 20th century, the Lyric Opera featured opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] who appeared there with the Metropolitan Opera in a performance of [[Friedrich von Flotow|Flotow]]'s ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]''.

In 1950, building on earlier amateur efforts, the Baltimore Opera was formally established as the '''Baltimore Civic Opera Company''', with the famous American [[soprano]] [[Rosa Ponselle]] as its first [[artistic director]]. She brought [[Beverly Sills]] to Baltimore for a production of ''[[Manon]]'' in 1952. By 1970, the name was changed to '''Baltimore Opera Company ''' and had become firmly established at the Lyric.

Having been modeled on the Concertgebouw, the Lyric was primarily used as a concert hall. 1916 saw the founding of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] which presented performances there until 1982, while the building was purchased from Kahn in 1920 and a significant renovation created an enlarged balcony with seating capacity reaching 2,800. In March 1974, the Lyric's 75th anniversary featured the return of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and throughout these years, the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] made regular appearances in Baltimore until April 1980. A highlight was the 1934 premiere of [[Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', with the composer at the piano.

===Other events===
Many different kinds of events were presented at the Lyric, including sporting events such as the 1905 lightweight boxing fight between [[Joe Gans]], the lightweight champion, and Mike Sullivan and the 1906 wrestling bout between Gus Schoenlein and the world champion, [[George Hackenschmidt]], the world champion of the time. The first public showing of electric cooking in Baltimore took place, as well as hosting speakers like [[Aimee Semple McPherson]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]], [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Charles Lindbergh]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]].

Performers appearing at the Lyric included in April/May 1984 [[Yul Brynner]] who starred in ''[[The King and I]]'' which over 70,000 people attended in four weeks.  That same year, Patti Labelle's performances sold out five performances while, in 1987, ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' played to over 75,000 people.

===Creating an opera house===
Major renovations from 1980-1982 completed its transformation into an opera house.

'''''My Dinner with Andre''''' is a 1981 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Louis Malle]], and written by and starring [[Andre Gregory]] (Andre) and [[Wallace Shawn]] (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at [[Café des Artistes]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1999-06-20/entertainment/9906200314_1_peter-sellers-dr-strangelove-two-great-films Johnson, Malcolm, "Cinestudio Salutes Columbia", ''Hartford Courant'' (June 20, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dialogue covers such things as [[experimental theatre]], the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest [[humanism]] with Andre's spiritual experiences.

==Structure==
Andre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and a group of Polish actors in a forest in [[Poland]], his visit to [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]] in Scotland, and his trip to the [[Sahara]] to try to create a play based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|St.-Exupéry]]. He worked with a group in a small piece of [[performance art]] on [[Long Island]], which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) [[Premature burial#Voluntary burial|buried alive]] on [[Halloween]] night.

The rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnopédies|Gymnopédie No. 1]]'' plays in the background.

==Cast==
*[[Andre Gregory]] as Andre
*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Wally
*Jean Lenauer as waiter
*Roy Butler&lt;!--- not the politician ---&gt; as bartender

==Production==
The idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation.&lt;ref name="Criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2009, Shawn said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of ''me'' there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.&lt;ref name="wally"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director [[Louis Malle]]. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;

''My Dinner with Andre'' was filmed in the [[Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia)|Jefferson Hotel]], which was then vacant, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) [[Lloyd Kaufman]] was the production manager on the film, and [[Troma Entertainment]] provided production support.&lt;ref name="damn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt; The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic [[Café des Artistes]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips Taubin, Amy, "My Dinner with Andre: Long Strange Trips", ''The Criterion Collection'' (June 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave high praise to the film on ''[[Sneak Previews]]''; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year.&lt;ref name="barnes20130404"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ebert-dies-film-critic-406274 | title=Critic Roger Ebert Dies at 70 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=2013-04-04 | accessdate=April 4, 2013 | author=Barnes, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his ''Great Movies'' essay series. He said, "Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, ''My Dinner with Andre''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-my-dinner-with-andre-1981 "My Dinner with Andre."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]] ranked it as the "Best American Film" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best [[Screenplay]].

== Notes ==
Throughout the film, Andre references his wife "Chiquita"; in real life he was married to Mercedes "Chiquita" Nebelthau, who died in 1992.&lt;ref name=Chiquita&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/12/arts/mercedes-gregory-film-maker-dead-documentarian-56.html |title=Mercedes Gregory, Film Maker, Dead; Documentarian, 56 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about [[Jerzy Grotowski]], whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.&lt;ref name=Chiquita/&gt;

Throughout the film, Wally references his "girlfriend Debbie". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer [[Deborah Eisenberg]], although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips |title=My Dinner with André: Long, Strange Trips |first=Amy |last=Taubin |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The '''Princeton Triangle Club''' is a theater troupe at [[Princeton University]]. Founded in 1891, it is the oldest touring collegiate [[musical theater|musical-comedy]] troupe in the [[United States]], and the only co-ed collegiate troupe that takes an original student-written musical on a national tour every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/?p=2504 |title=PlayBlog Broadway and Theatre News |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is known for its tradition of featuring an all-male [[kickline]] in [[drag (clothing)|drag]].

The troupe presents several shows throughout the year. In September at the end of the University's Freshman Week it presents a revue of popular material from previous years. In autumn it puts on an original student-written musical comedy in [[McCarter Theatre]], then takes this show on tour over the [[Winter holiday season]]. In spring it puts on another original show in a smaller venue. During [[Princeton Reunions|reunions]] after the end of the spring semester, it relaunches the previous autumn's show at McCarter.

Among the club's notable alumni are [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Booth Tarkington]], [[Russel Wright]], [[Joshua Logan]], [[Brooks Bowman]], [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]], [[José Ferrer]], [[Wayne Rogers]], [[Clark Gesner]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[David E. Kelley]], [[Nicholas Hammond]], [[Zachary Pincus-Roth]], and [[Brooke Shields]].

==History==
The history of the Princeton Triangle Club reflects many major social, cultural, economic, political, literary and theatrical trends in the United States during the late 19th and 20th centuries. It also traces the evolution of both undergraduate life and theatrical endeavors at Princeton University. In its century-plus of productions, Triangle has commented upon Princeton-specific topics, from examinations and campus safety to the Honor Code and the eating clubs, in addition to broader movements and events, including war protests, political scandals, women’s rights, and affirmative action. Although Triangle essentially recreates itself every year with an entirely new, full-scale musical-comedy, the club remains committed to its longstanding traditions, from the annual national tour to the kickline, and perpetuates its unique spirit, blending topical humor with collegiate irreverence and outright playfulness.

Triangle’s history is documented in several ways. ''The Long Kickline: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club'', written in 1968 by Donald Marsden '64, provides a detailed chronology of the organization through the production of ''Sham on Wry'' in 1966-67. The senior thesis of Nancy Barnes ’91, ''One Hundred Years and Still Kicking: A History of the Princeton Triangle Club'', updates this written record. Finally, Triangle’s extensive archives in Princeton’s Mudd Library include playbills, musical scores, scripts, reviews, photographs, business correspondence, tour itineraries, scrapbooks, recordings, and much more.

===Beginnings===

The Triangle Club archives begin in 1883 with a production of the Princeton College Dramatic Association; during the next five years the Association presented a number of plays. In keeping with the practice of British and American all-male institutions at the time, women's roles were played by men. Entr'acte music, provided by the Instrumental or Banjo Clubs, consisted of popular dance tunes or operatic excerpts. Student theatricals were performed for the benefit of financially ailing athletic associations, and the sporadic activity of the Dramatic Association can be explained by the fluctuating fortunes of the sports teams.

In 1891 the Dramatic Association joined forces with the University Glee Club to present ''Po-ca-hon-tas'', the first show in the Triangle tradition of musicals written and produced by students. According to a New York review, the reworked John Brougham play featured "new topical songs and local hits" and was well received, both on campus and in a Trenton performance. But the faculty vetoed a proposed New York performance, and over the years, students and administrators would often be at odds over theatrical activities. Nevertheless, the Association visited Trenton once again the following year with ''Katharine'', a Shakespearean spoof marking the first appearance of [[Booth Tarkington]] 1893 in the Triangle records.

The 1893 production, ''The Honorable Julius Caesar'', was again a reworking of Shakespeare. Tarkington, a senior and president of the Dramatic Association, was prominent as both co-author of the book and as actor in the role of Cassius. The show was so successful that it was repeated the following year, with several significant changes. Most importantly, the Princeton University Dramatic Association had been renamed the Triangle Club of Princeton. According to a preview in The New York Times, "several specialties will be introduced, such as tumbling, acrobatic feats, and dancing" and "James E. Wilson of Frohman's company… will coach the club regularly four times a week." If Wilson did indeed coach, the club had its first professional director in its very first show under the name "Triangle."

===Early growth===

Financial problems caused Club members to curtail expenses in 1895. Neither the February production, ''Who's Who'', nor the May offering, ''Snowball'', were written by students, and both had relatively small casts. The following year the Club turned to a recent graduate, Post Wheeler '91, in hopes that his magic touch as co-author of ''The Honorable Julius Caesar'' could be repeated, and they were pleased with the result. ''The Mummy'' (1895–96) was also notable as the first production in Triangle's new home, the Casino, located on the lower campus near the present-day [[McCarter Theatre]] site. Yet another innovation was attempted in 1897. ''A Tiger Lily'', the first Triangle show to be based on Princeton student life, was part of a double bill with ''Lend Me Five Shillings'', a British farce. Since neither show was a great success, the Club returned to the tried and true in 1898 with a revival of ''Po-ca-hon-tas''. ''The Privateer'', presented in 1899, was originally entitled ''The Captain's Kidd Sister'', but the name was changed because the University of Pennsylvania’s [[Mask and Wig|Mask and Wig Club]] had already produced a show about Captain Kidd. The "Privateer March" was the first commercially published Triangle song.

===Traditions begin===

In 1901, with ''The King of Pomeru'', Triangle ventured for the first time to New York, and the next year the club ventured as far as Pittsburgh. After the 1901 New York performance, Franklin B. Morse 1895 proposed a meeting to organize Triangle alumni, who he believed could help promote the Club, build its reputation, arrange the annual tour, collect materials and memorabilia, and generally socialize among themselves. In June of that year, thirty-seven alumni met in Princeton, and the Triangle Board of Trustees was established.

During the first decade of the 20th century, the organization of Triangle became increasingly structured. Printed copies of the script, "for the exclusive use of candidates," first appear in the archives with ''The Man From Where'' (1903–04).

Although ''A Woodland Wedding'' (1899–1900) included a specialty [[skirt dance]], and "The Pony Ballet" was a part of ''Tabasco Land'' (1905–06), ''The Mummy Monarch'''s kickline in 1907 was the first of that tradition to be documented photographically in the Triangle Archives.

===Budding fame and higher standards===

By 1910 the tour had extended as far west as Chicago and St. Louis; printed luncheon menus and newspaper clippings provide evidence of the elaborate social functions that were becoming part of the annual trek. With ''Once in a Hundred Years'' (1912–13), Triangle moved its tour to the Christmas season, again traveling as far west as St. Louis. The following year, President and Mrs. Wilson attended ''The Pursuit of Priscilla''’s Washington matinee performance; the First Family then hosted a reception for Triangle at the White House.

''The Evil Eye'' (1915-16) had a distinguished pair of neophyte authors: Edmund Wilson '16 wrote the book, and F. Scott Fitzgerald '17 was responsible for the lyrics. Although he was never a cast member in a Triangle production, Fitzgerald wrote three shows for the Club between 1914 and 1917.

During 1917-18, a four man Triangle troupe toured Europe to entertain the soldiers stationed there for World War I. After the year hiatus, the club became active again with a revival of ''The Honorable Julius Caesar''. The first post-war tour occurred when ''The Isle of Surprise'' was taken on the road during Christmas break of 1919. This show marked a change in attitude toward Triangle productions. In the program, Club president Erdman Harris '20 described the new production: "We hope that a new day has dawned, that ‘Jazz’ will be forever relegated to a back seat, that Broadway will cease to be the idol of those who create the shows, that their staging shall be done in Princeton by Princeton men, and that the authorities and graduates will approve what is being done to elevate the standard of a society whose value in student life has been seriously questioned."

In the spring of 1922, Triangle staged George Bernard Shaw's ''The Devil's Disciple''. This production marked a milepost in the Club's history, for its three female roles were actually played by women.  Sets for this production were designed and painted by [[Russel Wright]] during his freshman year, marking one of the few times that a freshman was ever allowed to join Triangle.

===Professionalization and emerging stars===

During the early 1920s, New York performances began to be booked at the Metropolitan Opera House, although initially there was some concern whether the Club would be able to fill such a large theatre and whether the men's voices would be strong enough to be heard properly.  Late in 1923, there were negotiations concerning a possible radio broadcast, and in the same year Triangle's music publisher, J. Church Co., corresponded with the Victor Talking Machine Co. about a trial recording. But the major event during this decade was the planning and construction of McCarter Theatre for Triangle Club. The completed theatre opened on February 21, 1930, with the Triangle Club’s ''The Golden Dog''. McCarter replaced the long-controversial Casino, which burned on January 8, 1924.

Here began the Golden Period for which the Triangle Club became famous, in terms of its eventual contribution of outstanding talent to the Broadway theatre and Hollywood. Within a few years the Club would send forth into these professional realms [[Erik Barnouw]] '29; [[Norris Houghton|C. Norris Houghton]], [[Joshua Logan]], and [[Myron McCormick]], all Class of 1931; [[James Stewart]] '32; [[José Ferrer]] '33; and [[Nick Foran]] '34.

The 1935 show, ''Stags at Bay'', featured "East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)," written by [[Brooks Bowman]], which would become the most popular and longest-lasting national hit ever to come out of the Triangle Club. Recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], among many others, "East of the Sun" still provides the club with royalties.  Other songs from the same show, by Bowman, included "Love and Dime" and "Will Love find a Way?."

===Difficulties in the Depression years===

With ''The Tiger Smiles'' (1930–31), Triangle writers returned to a Princeton town and gown setting for the first time since ''When Congress Came to Princeton'' (1908–09). The production was well received, but the Club was already beginning to feel the effects of the Great Depression. In October 1930, the Program Manager reported, "Due to the financial depression, the business of getting ads is a rather difficult one just now." By the following year economic conditions had begun to affect the tour. South Orange reported poor ticket sales, and the local alumni chairman was concerned with keeping down the cost of stagehands; in Pittsburgh, a poor house and lack of entertainment were attributed to the weak stock market. ''When It's the Valet'' (1932–33) was ready to tour, local alumni groups were either unwilling to sponsor a show or unable to guarantee an adequate sum to cover expenses, let alone show a profit. The Club's Graduate Board sought aid from alumni in underwriting the show, but individual contributions were equally difficult to come by.

Throughout the mid-thirties, Triangle continued to tour in spite of the Depression, but there were rumblings of discontent from both the Graduate Board of the Club and the University administration. In a 1934 meeting with President Dodds, the Board indicated concern about the financial condition of McCarter Theatre; Triangle profits were insufficient to keep McCarter operating in the black, a situation that would become increasingly serious as the decade wore on. President Dodds had also heard alumni criticism about poor acting and an apparent lack of coaching in connection with the latest show. Yet he remained confident that Triangle could play an important role on campus. Later that year, Club Manager Stryker Warren '35 received a stern letter from Dean of the College Christian Gauss. Gauss had considered canceling the Christmas tour, first because of financial considerations, and then because of alumni criticism, which "in nearly every case… came as the result of the excessive drinking on the part of a few of your men." Nevertheless, the Dean concluded by wishing "you and all the officers and members of the Club a highly successful trip, a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year."

At a 1937 Board meeting there was discussion about the lack of good voices in Triangle. Alumni as well as Board members had noted this situation, and it was suggested that "there must be someone in the Glee Club who could at least be drafted to sing, so that a song could be heard beyond the footlights." Another complaint came from a Louisville alumnus early in 1938, who wrote, "I am not crazy about the Triangle Club bringing in certain dirty lines about ‘buying a drink’ and ‘the Knights of the Garter,’ etc.…. Personally I would prefer to see the young men get properly soused and have to be poured on the train than to use [these] lines."

Another change in tradition came during the 1941-42 academic year, when Triangle produced ''Ask Me Another'', its first show in revue format. Then, at a Board meeting in September 1943, Graduate Treasurer B. Franklin Bunn '07 announced that there would be no Triangle Club activities for the duration of the war. The University assumed control of McCarter Theatre during this period, and the building was leased by the military for trainees’ use on campus.

===Post-war comeback===

In November 1945, the University Committee on Undergraduate Activities issued a report describing Triangle as "perhaps the most controversial of all undergraduate extracurricular activities. Despite obvious shortcomings, the Club affords many valuable opportunities to the undergraduate body and plays a very real part in alumni relations. According, it should be reestablished at the first possible moment." The first post-war show, ''Clear the Track'', opened in December 1946 and even managed a seven-city tour. But Triangle was beset with problems the following year for ''All Rights Reserved'' (1947–48). The Daily Princetonian reported, "All Rights pretty nearly weren't reserved. A play by the same name had fizzled on Broadway for a bare month, in 1934, and the petulant playwright threatened to sue. Hasty consultation with a Broadway lawyer revealed that the author could not possibly win the suit and that matter was closed." The club resolved tricky labor questions by employing union stagehands and music-hirelings, putting the later to work first in Philadelphia, where they were made to earn their fee by playing with the regular orchestra, and then in Washington, where they provided the intermission music.

Despite ongoing debate in the 1950s about the club’s obligations to theatrical professionalism, as well as its questionable effect on the University’s reputation, Triangle continued to reach a wider audience through greater media exposure. In 1948, ''All in Favor'' was broadcast on WNBC-TV, becoming the first college show to appear on the new medium of television. The entire score of ''Too Hot for Toddy'' (1950–51) was recorded, and members of the cast appeared on ''The Kate Smith Show'' and ''Ed Sullivan's The Toast of the Town''. Club productions appeared on The ''Ed Sullivan Show'' from 1950 to 1957; its host wrote to Triangle President Charles Robinson, "The Princeton Triangle Club has an annual appointment on our stage, so long as I’m on TV."

Finally, in 1953, a memorandum of agreement was drawn up between Princeton University and the Trustees of the Triangle Club abrogating the McCarter agreement of the 1920s. The Club had simply been unable to cover the operating expenses and pay the taxes of the Theatre. A full-time general manager was hired for McCarter, and the University, which had been underwriting Triangle's losses, agreed to cancel the Club's debts.

===The Lyon era===

''Spree de Corps'' (1955–56) marked the debut of Milton Lyon as Triangle director. From 1955 until his death forty years later, Lyon would direct all but a handful of Triangle's original productions.

Student apathy toward extracurricular activities began to affect Triangle toward the end of the 1950s. At a meeting in October 1958, the Board noted a very small turnout for the previous month's auditions. It was decided that more on-campus publicity would help, and as part of this effort Triangle Junior was formed, a group of seven club members who performed favorite Triangle songs at various receptions and functions. Over the following years, this small group would undergo periodic name changes, being known as ''Triangle Ding!'' and ''Triangle Bit Parts'' before returning to ''Ding!'', as it is called today.

With the gradual elimination of passenger trains in the late 1950s, the club began touring by bus. Early in 1960 there was a proposal to produce a motion picture on the Triangle Club, but a Hollywood writers' strike and possible heavy expenses brought an end to this publicity idea. However, Triangle did embark on its first European tour that summer; the Club performed ''Breakfast in Bedlam'' (1959–60) at French and German bases of the American army. ''Tour de Farce'' (1961–62) became perhaps the most widely toured show: performances in Pasadena and San Francisco marked the first time the show had been seen live on both coasts, and then troupe members again went to Europe that summer to perform at US Army bases.

''Funny Side Up'' (1963–64) was billed as the 75th anniversary show in spite of the fact that number seventy was ''Tour de Farce'', produced only two years earlier. ''Funny Side Up'' did not have a smooth start: the writers were slow to produce material, and the trustees even considered the possibility that there would be no show. Because of the diamond jubilee, twenty-one songs from earlier shows were made a part of the program. The tour of ''Funny Side Up'' included several southern stops, and the Birmingham visit became problematic when Triangle was booked into a segregated theatre. After some strongly worded letters from Board members, it was determined that the performance would either be cancelled or moved to a non-segregated house.

===Coeducation and other changes===

''A Different Kick'' (1968–69) was a Triangle milestone, featuring the first female undergraduate to be cast in a Club show—Sue Jean Lee '70, a junior in the Critical Languages Program. The University's shift to coeducation the next fall would have a profound effect on Triangle. ''Call a Spade a Shovel'' (1969–1970) featured six women in a seventeen-member cast. The social and political commentary of the show, most especially its anti-Vietnam War tones, which reflected the views of the Vietnam Veteran who was President and much of the country, unleashed an unprecedented storm of alumni protest and caused a mass audience walk-out at the Grosse Pointe tour performance.

This incident, along with growing budgetary and logistical concerns, caused the Board of Trustees to revise its production schedule. As per the May 1970 Report of the Board’s New Directions Committee, there was to be neither a December show nor a Christmas tour; instead, a spring show was promised, to be followed by a short tour. ''Cracked Ice'' opened in April 1971, was repeated for alumni in June, but did finally tour the following December. To cut expenses, the cast and crew stayed in private homes rather than hotels, and non-union halls were booked.

The Princeton Triangle Workshop made its debut in November 1972 with a presentation of ''The Fantasticks'' at the Princeton Inn Theater; the following March the Workshop produced ''Transitions'', described as "five original plays and a multimedia extravaganza," in Wilcox Hall. This began a 25-year tradition of smaller fall productions to complement the full-scale, original spring shows. The fall productions of 1978, ''Happily Ever After'', and 1979, ''String of Pearls'', were both written by undergraduates. For the 1981 spring show, Triangle writers returned to the very roots of the club and based their book musical, ''Bold Type'', on Booth Tarkington's novel, ''A Gentleman from Indiana''.

The 1981 tour again returned to California, but with a revue of Triangle favorites, ''Fool's Gold'', rather than the spring show. The following year Triangle hired Miriam Fond, the first female director in the Club's history. Triangle finally found a permanent home for its fall productions when ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' opened at the Triangle Broadmead Theatre in November 1984. In the 1980s, the Club began to present produce revues of the best of Triangle early in the fall to introduce the freshman class to the organization.

===Centennial===

The Club's centennial was celebrated in 1991 with a series of campus events throughout the year, including the spring show entitled ''The Older, the Better'', a large Firestone Library exhibition of more than 850 items from the Triangle Archives, and a fall reunion weekend of parties and performances. But how could the centennial celebration be held in 1991 when the fiftieth anniversary show was ''Once Over Lightly'', produced in 1938-39? After much debate, it had been decided that the first show in the true Triangle tradition of original work was ''Po-ca-hon-tas'' in 1891; hence the choice of 1991 for the one-hundredth anniversary.

===The 2nd century===

In the late 1990s, the production schedule reverted to its original format, in which the McCarter show was presented in the fall of each academic year, followed a month later by that show’s tour. This change meant that in 1997-1998 the Club needed to generate two-full length musicals in fifteen months, almost twice the writing load of previous years. In September 1997, Triangle began a writing workshop to coordinate the efforts of the writers; this program was enormously successful, producing ''In Lava and War'' in April 1998 and ''101 Damnations'' in November 1998. By the spring of 1999, the corps of 21 writers had been so prolific that Triangle presented an extra, original spring show at [[Theatre Intime]], entitled ''The Rude Olympics''. The 1999-2000 season saw the hundredth anniversary of the kickline in ''The Blair Arch Project'' (November 1999), as well as Triangle’s return to Theatre Intime in May with ''The Rude Olympics II: American Booty''. ''Puns of Steel'' (2000–2001) became the first Club show to record its score on a CD.

===Recent developments===

Since the start of the 21st century, the Club has continued the production schedule begun in the 1990s, with a Freshman Week show in September, McCarter show in November, tour in late January to early February, spring show in late April / early May, and a reprise of the McCarter show in June.  The smaller-scale spring show has moved from Theater Intime to the Whitman Theater.  Recent years have seen the refinement of the Club's infrastructure, with continued development of the writing workshop and the shaping of a more active business team under the name "TriBiz."  The Club continues to receive a high level of regional recognition, with the 2007 fall show ''A Turnpike Runs Through It'' appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

The '''rock sculpture of  Decebalus''' is a 42.9 m in height and 31.6 m in width carving in rock of the face of [[Decebalus]], the last king of [[Dacia]], who fought against the Roman emperors [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]] to preserve the independence of his country, which corresponded to modern [[Romania]]. The sculpture was made between 1994 and 2004, on a rocky outcrop on the river [[Danube]], at the [[Iron Gates]], which form the border between Romania and Serbia. It is located near the city of [[Orșova]] in Romania. 

It is the tallest [[rock relief]] in Europe.

==Creation==
It was commissioned by Romanian businessman [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]] and it took 10 years, from 1994 to 2004, for twelve sculptors to finish it.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Schily, Matthias Eickhoff, ''Donau: von Regensburg zum Schwarzen Meer'', DuMont Reiseverlag, 2010, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Drăgan's website, the businessman purchased the rock in 1993, after which the Italian sculptor Mario Galeotti assessed the location and made an initial model. The first six years involved dynamiting the rock into the basic shape, and the remaining four years were devoted to completing the detail.&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decebalusrex.ro/en/istoricul-2.php |title=Fundatia Europeana Dragan, DECEBALUS REX DRAGAN FECIT, History of the monument |publisher=Decebalusrex.ro |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814124251/http://www.decebalusrex.ro/en/istoricul-2.php |archivedate=2014-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the face of Decebalus there is a Latin inscription which reads "DECEBALUS REX—DRAGAN FECIT" ("King Decebalus—Made by Drăgan"). The carving was placed opposite an ancient memorial plaque, carved in the rock on the [[Serbia]]n side of the river facing Romania. The plaque, known as the [[Tabula Traiana]], records the completion of Trajan's military road along the [[Danube]] and thus commemorates the final defeat of Decebalus by Trajan in 105, and the absorption of the Dacian kingdom into the [[Roman Empire]]. Drăgan wanted the Serbs to carve a giant head of a Roman Emperor, as if confronting Decebalus on the opposite side of the river, but the Serbs refused.&lt;ref name = "nick"/&gt;

==Significance==


Drăgan was a leading figure in the [[protochronism]] movement, a nationalist ideology which attempted to portray Romania as the major cradle of civilisation and which identified Romania with an ancient [[Thracian]] empire that supposedly dominated central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Verdery, National Ideology under Socialism. Identity and Cultural Politics in Ceaușescu's Romania, University of California Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In this ideology, Dacia, the pre-Roman name of Romania, was the inheritor of this Thracian culture, a view expounded by Drăgan in his book and journal ''Noì, tracii'' ("We Thracians").&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Fundatia Europeana Dragan'', Drăgan's foundation, states that "Giuseppe Costantino Dragan is a strong supporter of the theory that the original 'flame' of civilization started on the ancient territory of Romania and argues as much in his work".&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"/&gt; Drăgan saw the sculpture as a signpost to the cradle of civilisation. He is quoted saying, "Anyone travelling towards 'Decebal Rex Dragan Fecit' is also travelling towards the origins of European civilization and will discover that a United Europe represents the natural course of history".&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"/&gt;

==Descriptions==


[[Michael Palin]] in his 2007 book ''[[New Europe (book)|New Europe]]'' described the colossal head: 

{{quote|As we move into the Kazan Gorge, where a small valley enters the Danube from the Romanian shore, an enormous head is carved into the rock together with the Latin inscription 'Decebalus Rex - Dragan Fecit'. It turns out to be less ancient than I thought, in fact it dates from the 1990s. The carved figure, Decebalus, was a Dacian king who took on the armies of Emperor Trajan and is regarded as a great Romanian folk hero. Dragan, more prosaically, is a rich businessman who paid for it to be carved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9559">'''Romantic realism''' is [[art]] which combines elements of both [[romanticism]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]]. The terms "romanticism" and "realism" have been used in varied ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Joseph Conrad: His Romantic-Realism |last=Stauffer |first=Ruth M. |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |year=2006 |origyear=1922 |isbn=1-4286-5840-8 |page=13 |quote=It would be wearisome even to enumerate the books and essays that have been written in all languages to define these two terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes seen as opposed to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Romanticism |last=Abercrombie |first=Lascelles |authorlink=Lascelles Abercrombie |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York |year=1963 |origyear=1926 |page=61 |quote=For there is an element directly opposed to romanticism : it is realism. The true antithesis, then, is between romanticism and realism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Study of English Literature |last1=Cowardin Jr. |first1=Samuel Pendleton |last2=More |first2=Paul Elmer |authorlink2=Paul Elmer More |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |year=1939 |page=138 |quote=And it follows as a corollary that realism is, on the whole, the opposite of romanticism; for, as we have seen, romanticism is usually bound up with idealism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and art==
The term has long standing in literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Realism in Modern Literature |last=Becker |first=George J. |publisher=Frederick Ungar |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=0-8044-2031-9 |page=102 |quote=Essentially exhibiting a paradox, this term has come into being among critics and historians in an attempt to characterize writing of the nineteenth century which is incompletely realistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s relationship to romantic realism is analyzed in Ruth M. Stauffer's 1922 book ''Joseph Conrad: His Romantic Realism''. [[Liam O'Flaherty]]'s relationship to romantic realism is discussed in P.F. Sheeran's book ''The Novels of Liam O'Flaherty: A Study in Romantic Realism''. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] is described as a romantic realist in Donald Fanger's book, ''Dostoevsky and Romantic Realism: A Study of Dostoevsky in Relation to Balzac, Dickens, and Gogol''. Historian [[Jacques Barzun]] argued that romanticism was falsely opposed to realism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classic, Romantic, and Modern |last=Barzun |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Barzun|publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |edition=revised second |year=1975 |origyear=1943 |isbn=0-226-03852-1|page=58 |quote=I now want to argue against this postponement of the realistic label and to suggest that on the evidence just set forth, romanticism ''is'' realism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared that "...the romantic realist does not blink his weakness, but exerts his power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classic, Romantic, and Modern |last=Barzun |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Barzun|publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |edition=revised second |year=1975 |origyear=1943 |isbn=0-226-03852-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has long standing in art criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Art of Our Century |last=Goodrich |first=Lloyd |last2=Baur |first2=John I. H. |publisher=Frederick A. Praegar |location=New York |year=1961 |page=121 |quote=Romantic realism, long a powerful movement in American painting, has unquestionably waned since 1940. It has never disappeared, and some of its finest examples are recent ones, but it is significant that most of the painting reproduced here are by artist now dead or well past their middle years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art scholar John Baur described it as "a form of realism modified to express a romantic attitude or meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Art of Our Century |last=Goodrich |first=Lloyd |last2=Baur |first2=John I. H. |publisher=Frederick A. Praegar |location=New York |year=1961 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Theodor W. Adorno]], the term "romantic realism" was used by [[Joseph Goebbels]] to define the official doctrine of the [[Nazi art|art produced in Nazi Germany]], although this usage did not achieve wide currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Dahlhaus |others=trans. by Mary Whittall |title=Realism in Nineteenth-century Music |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-26115-5 |page=58 |quote=The vague universality of the term 'romantic realism', which helped it to become a catchphrase, led eventually to political misuse as well. ... T.W. Adorno, paradoxically enough, cited [[Joseph Goebbels]], who had spoken of 'romantic realism', evidently in order to signify his approval ... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] described herself as a romantic realist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Romantic Manifesto]]: A Philosophy Of Literature |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand|publisher=Signet |location=New York |year=1971 |isbn=0-451-14916-5 |edition=revised |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many followers of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] who work in the arts apply this term to themselves. As part of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments|her aesthetics]], Rand defined romantic realism as a portrayal of life "as it could be and should be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=[[Letters of Ayn Rand]] |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |editor-first=Michael S |editor-last=Berliner |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=0-525-93946-6 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote: "The method of romantic realism is to make life more beautiful and interesting than it actually is, yet give it all the reality, and even a more convincing reality than that of our everyday existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=[[Letters of Ayn Rand]] |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |editor-first=Michael S |editor-last=Berliner |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=0-525-93946-6 |pages=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
"Realism" in music is often associated with the use of music for the depiction of objects, whether they be real (as in [[Bedřich Smetana]]'s "Peasant Wedding" of ''[[Die Moldau]]'') or mythological (as in [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Ring cycle]]). [[Musicologist]] [[Richard Taruskin]] discusses what he calls the "black romanticism" of [[Niccolò Paganini]] and [[Franz Liszt]], i.e., the development and use of musical techniques that can be used to depict or suggest "grotesque" creatures or objects, such as the "laugh of the [[devil]]", to create a "frightening atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv | last=Taruskin |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |title=The Oxford History of Western Music. Volume 3: The Nineteenth Century|location= New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-516979-9 |page=255 and 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Taruskin's "black romanticism" is a form of "romantic realism" deployed by nineteenth-century virtuosi with the intent of invoking fear or "the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]."

[[File:Colantonio.jpg|thumb|350px]]
'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is a c.1445-1446 painting by [[Colantonio]], a painter active in Naples between 1440 and around 1470. It shows the strong influence of contemporary Flemish and French art on the painter and originally formed part of a multi-panel altarpiece for the church of [[San Lorenzo Maggiore, Naples|San Lorenzo Maggiore]], later split up. The work is now in the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]].

'''Saint Mary Church''', '''Holy Mother of God Church''' or '''Surp Mariam Asdvadzadzin Church''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|Թավրիժի Սուրբ Մարիամ Աստվածածին եկեղեցի}}, ''T’avrizhi Surb Mariam Astvatsatsin yekeghets’i'', [[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|fa|کلیسای مریم مقدس}}) is an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] church in [[Tabriz]], [[East Azerbaijan Province]], [[Iran]] completed in 1785. It is the largest and oldest [[Christianity in Iran|Christian]] church in Tabriz and a notable centre for Armenian national and religious ceremonies held by the [[Iranian Armenians|Armenian community]] of Tabriz.

== Location ==
The church is located at the corner of North Shariati (north Shahnaz) and Jomhuri avenues in the historical Dik Bashi neighborhood in the center of Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;Mahjubah 24 (2006), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, Saint Mary's served as the seat of the Azarbaijan Armenian archbishop. It is a handsomely built edifice, with annex buildings sprawled over a large area. A board of Armenian peers governs the well-attended church. The Tabriz Armenian Museum next to the church is run by the Armenian Prelacy of Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/News/128654.html Tabriz Armenian Museum, run by Armenian Prelacy, in Tabriz in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan, adjacent to Saint Mary Church.] 10 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
An older church was built at this site in the 12th century AD (6th century [[Islamic calendar|AH]]). In his travel chronicles, [[Marco Polo]], who traveled through Tabriz around 1275 AD, mentions this church on his way to [[China]].&lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Tucker, The Silk Road - Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran: A Travel Companion. I.B.Tauris, 2015, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest gravestone in this church dates back to the 16th century AD. The church has a stone hinge that according to the decor, the type of arch and the architectural features can be attributed to the 13th century AD (7th century AH) and the period of the Mongolian Ilkhan in Iran. According to an inscription, the church – as well as the whole city – was destroyed in a disastrous earthquake in 1780 AD, and the present building was built on its ruins from 1782 to 1785 in [[Safavid]] style.

== Architecture ==
The church is 16 meters long and 14 meters wide. The belfry standing on four square columns in the middle of the church has four arches with biblical painting between the columns.

The tabernacle of the church was built in the style of Armenian architecture, parts of which can be dated back to the 12th century AD. The base of the church was made of limestone. The walls and pillars are of stone and brick, the vault of brick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7806">Beginning in the 1970s, with the popularity of [[J.R.R.

'''Socialist realism''' is a style of idealized [[realism (arts)|realistic art]] that was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] and was imposed as the official  style in that country between 1932 and 1988, as well as in other socialist countries after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica on-line definition of Socialit Realism&lt;/ref&gt;   Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the [[proletariat]], by means of realistic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Korin, Pavel, "Thoughts on Art", ''Socialist Realism in Literature and Art''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although related, it should not be confused with [[social realism]], a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, James G. "Social Realism". Art Terms. Museum of Modern Art, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist realism was the predominant form of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|approved art in the Soviet Union]] from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica on-line definition of Socialist Realism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Valkenier, Elizabeth. ''Russian Realist Art''. Ardis, 1977, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Kulturpalast Dresden Wandbild, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|Detail, ''Der Weg der Roten Fahne'', Kulturpalast [[Dresden]], Germany]] 
Socialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the [[Peredvizhniki]]s and [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the [[Tsar]] and the rise of the Bolsheviks.

Shortly after the Bolsheviks took control, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] was appointed as head of [[Narkompros]], the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17"/&gt;  This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that "the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting "the perfect person" ([[New Soviet man]]), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"/&gt;

=== Debate within Soviet art ===
[[File:First Lenin statue in USSR 1924.jpg|thumb|First Lenin statue built by the workers in [[Noginsk]]]]
There were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]], many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"/&gt; Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life.  Under [[Lenin]]'s rule and the [[New Economic Policy]], there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term "socialist realism" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the term "socialist realism" was officially used was in 1932. The term was settled upon in meetings that included politicians of the highest level, including Stalin himself.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 37"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxim Gorky]], a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled "Socialist Realism" in 1933 and by 1934 the term's etymology was traced back to Stalin.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 37"/&gt; During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;
The work must be:
# Proletarian: art relevant to the workers and understandable to them.
# Typical: scenes of everyday life of the people.
# Realistic: in the representational sense.
# Partisan: supportive of the aims of the State and the Party.

==Characteristics==

The purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 5"&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party, "[[partiinost']]" (party-mindedness), "ideinost" (idea- or ideological-content), "klassovost" (class content), "pravdivost" (truthfulness).&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a prevailing sense of optimism, socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present gloried, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed "revolutionary romanticism."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"/&gt;

Revolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution. Art was used as educational information. By illustrating the party's success, artists were showing their viewers that sovietism was the best political system. Art was also used to show how Soviet citizens should be acting. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called "an entirely new type of human being": The ''[[New Soviet Man]]''. Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale.  Stalin described the socialist realist artists as "engineers of souls."&lt;ref name="Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354"&gt;Overy, Richard. ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Common images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"/&gt; These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: "There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys ''actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society''."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Tobia. ''The Russian Artist''. Macmillan Company, 1972, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; This was reflective of the Soviet idea that morality is simple: things are either right or wrong. This view on morality called for idealism over realism.&lt;ref name="Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354"/&gt; Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Stegelbaum, Lewis and Sokolov, Andrei. ''Stalinism As A Way Of Life''. Yale University Press, 2004, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity was not an important part of socialist realism: it was actually rejected. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of the dictator to serve [[Stalin's cult of personality|his cult of personality]]—all in the most realistic fashion possible.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 5"/&gt; The results were often sentimental kitsch.

==Important groups==

===Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR)===
The Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ([[AKhRR]]) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR. The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing "heroic realism".&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"/&gt; The term "heroic realism" was beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as [[Leon Trotsky]] and carried favor with the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"/&gt;

In 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states.  At this point the group had begun participating in state promoted mass forms of art like murals, jointly made paintings, advertisement production and textile design.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 35"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The group was disbanded April 23, 1932 by the decree "On the Reorganization of Literary and Artistic Organizations"&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 35"/&gt; serving as the nucleus for the stalinist [[USSR Union of Artists]].

===Society of Easel Painters (OSt)===
While the Society of Easel Painters (OSt) was also focused on the glorification of the revolution they, as per their name, worked individually as easel painters. The most common subjects of the OSt's works fit with the developing socialist realism trope. Their paintings consisted of sport and battle, industry and modern technology.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 93"&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSt broke up in 1931 due to some members' demand to transition to collective print and poster work.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 93"/&gt; Some prominent members include [[Aleksandr Deyneka]] (till 1928), Yuri Pimanov, Aleksandr Labas, [[Pyotr Vilyams]], all of whom were students or ex-students of Moscow's art school, [[Vkhutemas]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Warszawa-mauzoleum monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A monumental [[obelisk]] surrounded by sculptures of soldiers at the [[Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw]]]]

The impact of socialist realism art can still be seen and felt decades after it was no longer the only state supported style. Even before the end of the [[USSR]] in 1991, the government had been loosening its hold on censorship. After [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the communist party. Many socialist realism tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218"&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, many Russian artists used socialist realism characteristics in an ironic fashion.&lt;ref name="Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218"/&gt; This was a complete rupture from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realism mold there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Western cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively. Democratic countries view the art produced during this period of repression as a lie.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Marxist cultures tend to view communism as a form of totalitarianism that smothers artistic expression and therefore retards the progress of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Western cultures often look at socialist realistic works as propaganda rather than art. Artistically it could be seen as grandiose, and as sentimental kitsch.

==Notable works and artists==
[[File:«Во́ин-освободи́тель» — монумент в берлинском Трептов-парке 4 - Kopie.jpg|thumb|right|"Soldier-Liberator" by [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]]. [[Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park)|Treptower Park Memorial]], [[Berlin]] (1948-1949)]]
[[Maxim Gorky]]'s novel ''[[The Mother (Gorky novel)|Mother]]'' is usually considered{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have been the first socialist-realist novel.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Gorky was also a major factor in the school's rapid rise, and his pamphlet, ''On Socialist Realism'', essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include [[Fyodor Gladkov]]'s ''[[Cement (novel)|Cement]]'' (1925), [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s two volume epic, ''[[Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Don Flows Home to the Sea]]'' (1940). [[Yury Krymov]]'s novel ''Tanker "Derbent"'' (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the [[Stakhanovite movement]].

[[Martin Andersen Nexø]] developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel ''Pelle, the Conqueror'' is considered to be a classic of socialist realism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The novel ''Ditte, Daughter of Man'' had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books ''Two Worlds'', and ''Hands Off!''.

The novels of [[Louis Aragon]], such as ''The Real World'', depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, ''The Communist Man''. In the collection of poems ''A Knife in the Heart Again'', Aragon criticizes the penetration of American imperialism into Europe. The novel ''The Holy Week'' depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Hanns Eisler]] composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as ''Song of Solidarity'', ''Song of the United Front'', and ''Song of the Comintern''. He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as ''Requiem for Lenin''. Eisler's most important works include the cantatas ''German Symphony'', ''Serenade of the Age'' and ''Song of Peace''. Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.

Closely associated with the rise of the [[labor movement]] was the development of the [[revolutionary song]], which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are ''[[The Internationale]]'' and ''[[Whirlwinds of Danger]]''. Notable songs from Russia include ''Boldly, Comrades, in Step'', ''Workers' Marseillaise'', and ''Rage, Tyrants''. Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet [[mass song]]s. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include [[Isaak Dunayevsky|Dunaevsky's]] ''Song of the Homeland'', [[Matvey Blanter|Blanter's]] ''[[Katyusha (song)|Katiusha]]'', Novikov's ''Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World'', and [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Aleksandrov's]] ''[[Svyaschennaya Voyna|Sacred War]]''.

In the early 1930s, [[Soviet cinema|Soviet filmmakers]] applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include ''Chapaev'', which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as ''[[The Youth of Maxim]]'', by [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]], ''[[Shchors (film)|Shchors]]'' by Dovzhenko, and ''We are from Kronstadt'' by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as ''A Start Life'' by N. Ekk, ''Ivan'' by Dovzhenko, ''Valerii Chkalov'' by M. Kalatozov and the film version of ''Tanker "Derbent"'' (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: ''Alexander Nevsky'' by Eisenstein, ''Minin and Pozharsky'' by Pudvokin, and ''Bogdan Khmelnitsky'' by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as [[Sergei Yutkevich|Yutkevich]]'s trilogy of movies about Lenin.

Socialist realism was also applied to [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] of the 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These include [[Chetan Anand (producer &amp; director)|Chetan Anand]]'s ''[[Neecha Nagar]]'' (1946), which won the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prize]] at the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival|1st Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953), which won the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival|7th Cannes Film Festival]].

The painter [[Aleksandr Deineka]] provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports. [[Yuriy Pimenov]], [[Boris Ioganson]] and [[Geli Korzev]] have also been described as "unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marek |last=Bartelik, |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_4_58/ai_59552693 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041123090037/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_4_58/ai_59552693 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-11-23 |title=Concerning Socialist Realism: Recent Publications on Russian Art (book review) |journal=Art Journal |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known practitioner was [[Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov]].

Socialist realism art found acceptance in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] nations, inspiring many artists. One such artist was [[Czeslaw Znamierowski]] (23 May 1890 – 9 August 1977), a [[Soviet]] [[Lithuania]]n painter, known for his large panoramic landscapes and love of nature. Znamierowski combined these two passions to create very notable paintings in the Soviet Union, earning the prestigious title of [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Honorable Artist of LSSR]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Alekna, Romas (24 May 1975).

In conjunction with the [[Stalinist architecture|Socialist Classical]] style of architecture, socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the [[Soviet Union]] for more than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920-1970|last=Ellis|first=Andrew|publisher=Skira Editore S.p.A.|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All material goods and means of production belonged to the community as a whole; this included means of producing art, which were also seen as powerful [[propaganda]] tools.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of [[Proletkult]]. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Haftmann, ''Painting in the 20th century'', London 1965, vol.1, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; In art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] flourished. In poetry, the non-traditional and the [[avant-garde]] were often praised.

These styles of art were later rejected by members of the Communist Party who did not appreciate modern styles such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Cubism]]. Socialist realism was, to some extent, a reaction against the adoption of these "decadent" styles. It was thought by Lenin that the non-representative forms of art were not understood by the proletariat and could therefore not be used by the state for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Haftman, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] argued that the radical reformation of society to communist principles meant little if any bourgeois art would prove useful; some of his more radical followers advocated the destruction of libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p. 288, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin rejected this philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p. 289, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; deplored the rejection of the beautiful because it was old, and explicitly described art as needing to call on its heritage: "[[Proletarian culture]] must be the logical development of the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of capitalist, landowner, and bureaucratic society."&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p 6 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern art styles appeared to refuse to draw upon this heritage, thus clashing with the long realist tradition in Russia and rendering the art scene complex.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p. 21 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Lenin's time, a cultural bureaucracy began to restrain art to fit [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p283, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]]'s arguments that a "[[proletarian literature]]" was un-Marxist because the proletariat would lose its class characteristics in the transition to a classless society, however, did not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, Russian Literary Criticism p191 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist realism became state policy in 1934 when the First Congress of Soviet Writers met and Stalin's representative [[Andrei Zhdanov]] gave a speech strongly endorsing it as "the official style of Soviet culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1934: Writers' Congress|url=http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1934writers&amp;Year=1934|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|accessdate=11 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208100515/http://soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1934writers&amp;Year=1934|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enforced ruthlessly in all spheres of artistic endeavour. Form and content were often limited, with erotic, religious, abstract, surrealist, and expressionist art being forbidden. Formal experiments, including internal dialogue, stream of consciousness, nonsense, free-form association, and cut-up were also disallowed. This was either because they were "decadent", unintelligible to the proletariat, or [[counter-revolutionary]].

In response to the 1934 Congress in Russia, the most important American writers of the left gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 26–27 April 1935 in Chicago at meetings that were supported by Stalin. [[Waldo David Frank]] was the first president of the [[League of American Writers]], which was backed by the Communist Party USA. A number of novelists balked at the control, and the League broke up at the invasion of the Soviet Union by German forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The first exhibition organized by the Leningrad Union of Artists took place in 1935.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Its participants – Mikhail Avilov, [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], Nikolai Dormidontov, [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]] among them – became the founding fathers of the Leningrad school, while their works formed one of its richest layers and the basis of the largest museum collections of Soviet painting of the 1930s-1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Isaak Brodsky stalin02.jpg|thumb|225px|A portrait of Stalin by [[Isaak Brodsky]].]]
In 1932, the Leningrad Institute of Proletarian Visual Arts was transformed into the Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture (since 1944 named [[Ilya Repin]]). The fifteen-year period of constant reformation of the country's largest art institute came to an end.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Thus, basic elements of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school]] – namely, a higher art education establishment of a new type and a unified professional union of Leningrad artists, were created by the end of 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1934 [[Isaak Brodsky]], a disciple of [[Ilya Repin]], was appointed director of the National Academy of Arts and the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Brodsky invited distinguished painters and pedagogues to teach at the Academy, namely Semion Abugov, Mikhail Bernshtein, [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], Efim Cheptsov, [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], Alexander Karev, Dmitry Kiplik, Yevgeny Lansere, Alexander Lubimov, [[Matvey Manizer]], Vasily Meshkov, Pavel Naumov, [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva]], Leonid Ovsyannikov, Nikolai Petrov, Sergei Priselkov, [[Nikolay Punin]], [[Nikolai Radlov]], [[Konstantin Rudakov]], Pavel Shillingovsky, Vasily Shukhaev, Victor Sinaisky, Ivan Stepashkin, [[Konstantin Yuon]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Art exhibitions of 1935–1940 serve as counterpoint to claims that the artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called "social order". A great number of [[landscape painting|landscapes]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], and [[genre painting]]s exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus ostensibly free from any ideology. Genre painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', {{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Place and publisher needed.--&gt;: pp. 29, 32–340. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-fifties and sixties, the Leningrad school of painting was approaching its vertex.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} New generations of artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments, and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas, and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[Vladimir Gorb]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Engels Kozlov]], [[Felix Lembersky]], [[Oleg Lomakin]], [[Samuil Nevelshtein]], [[Victor Oreshnikov]], Semion Rotnitsky, [[Lev Russov]], and [[Leonid Steele]]; in landscapes by [[Nikolai Galakhov]], [[Vasily Golubev (painter)|Vasily Golubev]], [[Dmitry Maevsky]], [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[Alexander Mikhailovich Semionov|Alexander Semionov]], [[Arseny Semionov]], and [[Nikolai Timkov]]; and in genre paintings by Andrey Milnikov, Yevsey Moiseenko, [[Mikhail Natarevich]], [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[Mikhail Trufanov]], [[Yuri Tulin]], [[Nina Veselova]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad, and the provinces.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form of painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, and great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians, etc. – were made the most popular heroes of paintings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures, and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussion again. This greatly broadened artists' understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] that made this style dominate [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting, and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]], and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm Sergei V. Ivanov, ''The Leningrad School of painting 1930–1990s''. Historical outline.]{{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Place and publisher needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions were relaxed somewhat after Stalin's death in 1953, but the state still kept a tight rein on personal artistic expression.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This caused many artists to choose to go into exile, for example the [[Odessa Group]] from the city of that name.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Independent-minded artists that remained continued to feel the hostility of the state.

In 1974, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up and the artwork destroyed with a water cannon and bulldozers (see [[Bulldozer Exhibition]]). [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late 1980s, but socialist realism remained in limited force as the official state art style until as late as 1991. It was not until after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] that artists were finally freed from state censorship.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

After the Russian Revolution, socialist realism became an international literary movement. Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included [[Louis Aragon]], [[Johannes Becher]], and [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref name="cultinfo.ru"&gt;[https://archive.is/20050508193618/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/104/892.htm D.F. Markov and L.I. Timofeev, "Socialist Realism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of socialist realism in other [[People's Republic]]s, was legally enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of visual and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture, considered a key weapon in the creation of a new [[social order]], intended to help spread the communist doctrine by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as "[[engineers of the human soul]]" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.

Today, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are [[North Korea]], [[Laos]], and to some extent [[Vietnam]]. The People's Republic of China occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the [[Chinese space program]]. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinoss.net/qikan/uploadfile/2011/0708/20110708020439197.pdf Lin Jung-hua.

Р.46-53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was an important exception among the communist countries, because after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, it abandoned socialist realism along with other elements previously imported from the Soviet system and allowed greater artistic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] – [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0035) Yugoslavia: ''Introduction of Socialist Self-Management'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miroslav Krleža]], one of the leading Yugoslav intellectuals, gave a speech at the Third Congress of the Writers Alliance of Yugoslavia held in [[Ljubljana]] in 1952, which is considered a turning point in the Yugoslav denouncement of [[dogmatic]] socialist realism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts''' ('''SNBA''') was the term under which two groups of French artists united, the first for some exhibitions in the early 1860s, the second since 1890 for annual exhibitions.

==1862==
Established in 1862, the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' was first chaired by the writer [[Théophile Gautier]], with the painter [[Aimé Millet]] as deputy chairman. The committee was composed with the painters [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse|Carrier-Belleuse]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and among the exhibitors were [[Léon Bonnat]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Gustave Doré]], [[Manet]]. In 1864, just after the death of Delacroix, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs of this famous painter and step-uncle of the emperor - and ceased to mount further exhibitions.

The 19th century in French art is characterised by a continuous struggle between traditionally educated artists supported by official politics, and a growing rate of artists who preferred to work individually and at their own riscs. Reviewing the historical situation is difficult, even a century later. But evidently opponents to the official politics gained ground after the fall of the 2nd Empire, and were instrumental to redirect French cultural politics to liberal positions. Thus, the splitting-off of the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' in 1890 can be considered as the first ''[[Secessionism|Secessionist]]'' manifestation, at all.

==1890==
In 1890, the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' was re-vitalised under the rule of [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]], [[Carolus-Duran]], [[Bracquemond]] and [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse|Carrier-Belleuse]], and since then its annual exhibition was reviewed as the ''Salon de Champ-de-Mars'', traditionally opening a fortnight later than the official ''Salon de Champs-Élysées'', organised by the [[Société des artistes français]].

[[Suzanne Valadon]] became the first female painter to be admitted to the Société in 1894.

===A new way===
After World War I, in 1926, the "Puvis de Chavannes" prize was created consisting in a retrospective exhibition of the main works of the prizewinning artists, in Paris. During the twentieth century, this exhibition was located at the [[Grand Palais]] or the Musée d'Art Moderne.

Most famous awarded painters: 1941: Wilhem Van Hasselt, 1944: Jean Gabriel Domergue, 1952: [[Tristan Klingsor]], 1955: Georges Delplanque, 1957: Albert Decaris, 1958: Jean Picard Le Doux, 1963: [[Maurice Boitel]], 1966: Pierre Gaillardot, 1968: Pierre-Henry, 1969:Louis Vuillermoz, 1970: [[Daniel du Janerand]], 1971: Jean-Pierre Alaux; 1975: Jean Monneret, 1987: André Hambourg.&lt;ref&gt;Société Nationale des Beaux Arts, Biennale 1991, Grand Palais, année du centenaire, catalogue pages 8 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last decades of the 20th century, after "[[living treasure]]" [[Takanori Oguiss]], and during the rule of chairman François Baboulet, some of Japanese artists could exhibit their paintings as guests of the SNBA: [[Takaaki Matsuda]], [[Katsufumi Toyota]], [[Kazuko Kobayashi]], [[Hideo Hando]], [[Yoko Tsuishi]] and [[Noboru Sotoyama]].&lt;ref&gt;Société Nationale des Beaux Arts, Biennale 1991, Grand Palais, année du centenaire, catalogue pages 8 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Tarot Garden''''' (Italian: '''''Il Giardino dei Tarocchi''''') is a [[sculpture garden]] based on the esoteric [[tarot]], created by the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] (1930–2002) in [[Pescia Fiorentina]], [[località]] ''Garavicchio'', in the municipality of [[Capalbio]], [[province of Grosseto]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. The park was opened to the public in 1998.

Niki de Saint Phalle, inspired by [[Antoni Gaudí]]´s [[Parc Güell]] in Barcelona, and [[Parco dei Mostri]] in Bomarzo, as well as [[Palais Idéal]] by [[Ferdinand Cheval]], and [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]],  decided to make something similar in design for her monumental sculpture park based on the [[Tarot]]. In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Ruins|ruin]] in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/niki-de-saint-phalles-tarot-garden|title=The Psychedelic Garden of Tuscany|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146"&gt;Pozzana, Maria (2001).

'''''The Love Letter''''' ({{lang-nl|De liefdesbrief}}) is a 17th-century [[genre painting]] by [[Jan Vermeer]].  The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a [[cittern]].  The painting is in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

==Description==
The tied-up [[curtain]] in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene.  There is also an element of [[trompe l'oeil]] as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period.  The [[diagonal]]s on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensionality]]. The fact that it is a [[love letter]] that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a [[cittern]], a member of the lute/guitar family).  The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; ''luit'' was also a slang term for [[vagina]].  This idea is further reinforced by the [[slipper]]s at the very bottom of the picture.  The removed slipper was another symbol of sex.  The [[brush|floor brush]] would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.

The colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting - the gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace.

The two [[painting]]s on the wall are also significant.  The lower painting is of a stormy [[sea]], a clear metaphor for tempestuous love.  Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road.  This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick de Rynck, How to Read a Painting: Lessons from the Old Masters (Abrams: New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
In the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s monarch [[John III Sobieski]].&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt; The 1696 inventory of the [[Wilanów Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] lists among Dutch paintings "a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, grającej na lutni w złotej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)".&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt;

==Theft==
On September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]], where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet till the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the strip in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase.

Roymans is thought to have been motivated by news of the bloodshed, rape, and murder in the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. On October 3, 1971, using the name "Tijl van Limburg" (a character similar to [[Robin Hood]]), Roymans contacted the Brussels newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' and asked for a reporter to meet him in a forest with a camera. He drove the reporter, blindfolded, to a church and unveiled the painting from a white cloth cover. After letting the reporter take photos of the canvas in the car's headlights, he drove him back. He told the reporter that he actually loved art, but also loved humanity. After the encounter, the pictures were published, alongside Roymans' conditions: 200 million Belgian francs to be given to famine-stricken Bengali refugees in East Pakistan. Roymans also requested the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels organize campaigns in their respective countries to raise money to combat world famine. Roymans set the deadline for Wednesday, October 6.

The police took the photographs as evidence and asked an art expert to validate that they were of the actual painting. It was confirmed they were, but immediately after the confirmation, the director of the Rijksmuseum, [[Arthur van Schendel]] said that the photos were not sufficient proof of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_01.html#.WPUAG1MrLVo|title=Vermeer Thefts: The Love Letter|first=Jonathan|last=Janson|website=www.essentialvermeer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days Roymans continued to make contact with the media; when he was finally apprehended by police, on the day of his deadline, he was trying to call a news station. 

The painting was returned to the Rijksmuseum on October 8 but wasn't announced to the public until October 11. It was in very poor condition after being cut out of its stretcher bars and frame. The restoration took almost a year. Roymans was given a court fine and sentenced to two years in prison, but only served six months in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/wide-angle/vermeer-thefts-1971-the-love-letter-137680|title=Vermeer Thefts: 1971-The Love Letter|date=4 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Musician''''' (1662) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

The woman is looking at the viewer and according to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], "spills out of her dress".&lt;ref name=Liedtke&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=jtnQ7PIT8mcC&amp;pg=PA328 Cat. no. 77] in ''Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' Volume I, by [[Walter Liedtke]], Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Liedtke goes on to make this a case for considering it a genre work rather than a portrait, comparing it with other scantily clad lute players that may have influenced the painter, such as the earlier works of [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] and contemporary work such as by [[Ferdinand Bol]]:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Femme accordant son luth.JPG|Honthorst, 1624
File:Gerrit van Honthorst - Het Concert.jpg|Honthorst, 1624
File:A Lady Playing the Lute (Ferdinand Bol) - Nationalmuseum - 18433.tif|Bol, 1654
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Liedtke wonders if it could possibly a portrait of the artist's wife, as has sometimes been claimed for the female pendant of a shepherd by Van der Helst that has often been claimed to be a self-portrait:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpg|Unknown woman as ''Granida'', 1660
File:Bartholomeus van der Helst 1613-1670 - Self Portrait as Daifilo.jpg|So-called self-portrait as ''Daifilo'', 1660
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This work is the only surviving painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that was acquired before 1906 and after the initial purchase of 1871, and though it is officially recorded as entering the collection in 1873, Liedtke mentions that it was grouped as one of two paintings that came into the collection in 1872 after the initial 1871 purchase, but also via the same vice-president of the Board of Trustees [[William T. Blodgett]] and presumably therefore via his dealer Leon Gauchez.&lt;ref name=Liedtke/&gt; The other painting (accession number 73.1) was a double portrait by Carel de Moor, but it was deaccessioned in 1988.&lt;ref name=Liedtke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofpaint00metr_2#page/209/mode/1up A Burgomaster of Leyden and His Wife]'', Oval, 46 x 36 3/8 inches, in the 1914 Metropolitan Museum of Art catalog, under "Karel van Moor", with a note that "the attribution has been questioned"&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian J.J. de Gelder mentioned the lute shown in the painting is a [[theorbe]] and it rests on a [[viola de gamba]]. He found the landscape reminiscent of [[Jan Baptist Weenix]]. The Van der Helst scholar Judith van Gent dismisses both this painting and the Granida as a portrait of the artist's wife Anna du Pire based on the age of the painter and his wife at the time. She notes Liedtke's comparison to the other Dutch lute players in the MET collection, namely Vermeer's ''[[Woman with a Lute]]'', where the woman is also tuning the lute, and Gerard ter Borch's ''A Woman Playing the Theorbo-Lute and a Cavalier''. She wonders whether the act of tuning a lute used to have a meaning that is now lost on us. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:A Woman Playing the Theorbo-Lute and a Cavalier MET DP145907.jpg|Ter Borch, 1658
File:Vermeer - Woman with a Lute near a window.jpg|Vermeer, 1662
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Vermeer was donated to the MET's collection in 1900, and the Ter Borch in 1914, both of which had been recently imported to the US, probably also based on the popularity at the time of this painting.

The '''Wallace Foundation''' is a national philanthropy based in [[New York City]] that seeks to foster improvements in learning and enrichment for disadvantaged children and the vitality of the arts for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/learn-about-wallace/mission-and-vision/Pages/default.aspx "Mission"] on the Wallace Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation aims to develop knowledge about how to solve social problems, and promote widespread solutions based on that knowledge, by funding projects to test ideas, commissioning independent research to find out what works, and communicating the results to help practitioners, policymakers and leading thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;DeVita, M, Christine. [https://www.rand.org/pubs/periodicals/rand-review/issues/winter2010/perspectives2.html "Power of Ideas: How Foundations Can Generate Knowledge to Spark Change"] [[Rand Corporation]] website (Winter 2010-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Wallace Foundation began with the philanthropy of [[DeWitt Wallace|DeWitt]] and [[Lila Bell Wallace|Lila Acheson Wallace]], who together founded [[Reader's Digest Association|The Reader's Digest Association]].&lt;ref&gt;West, Melanie Grayce. [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323949404578312341097271424 "Financial Know-How for Nonprofits Online"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (February 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the money they earned from the magazine, which they launched in 1922, the Wallaces contributed to a wide assortment of artistic, cultural and youth-serving causes. They died in the 1980s (Dewitt Wallace in 1981, Lila Wallace in 1984), leaving much of their fortune to four private foundations they had created in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/learn-about-wallace/history/Pages/default.aspx "The Wallace Foundation: A Brief History"] on the Wallace Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a single national foundation, The Wallace Foundation, emerged from the consolidation of these private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial3/ll_wallacemission.html "College: Wallace Foundation Mission Statement"] on ''[[The New York Times]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major initiatives ==
The Wallace Foundation has five major initiatives underway:
* School Leadership: For more than a decade, Wallace has been working with states and school districts to develop better ways to train, hire, support and evaluate principals and other key figures in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-july-dec13-principals_08-29/ "How to Train and Retain Great Principals in Struggling Urban Schools"] ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' (August 29, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William I. [http://www.amacad.org/publications/bulletin/winter2012/induction.pdf "Why Bridges Matter"] [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|American Academy]] 2011 Induction Ceremony Presentations p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Afterschool: Wallace supports efforts in a group of cities to coordinate the work of municipal agencies, schools, youth-serving nonprofits and other institutions vital to afterschool in order to generate ideas about how to improve the quality of programs and make better use of data.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Nate [http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/06/five-ways-data-can-make-after-school-programs/2215/ "5 Ways Data Can Save After-School Programs"] ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'' City Lab (June 7, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arts Education: Since 2005, Wallace has been working with school districts and nonprofits to test ways to engage more young people in high-quality arts learning during the school day and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Drymalski, Nick. [http://youthtoday.org/2009/01/wallace-gives-18-million-for-arts-education/ "Wallace Gives $1.8 Million For Arts Education"] ''Youth Today'' (January 1, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Summer and Expanded Learning: Wallace seeks to better understand the impact of high-quality summer learning programs on disadvantaged children, as well as how to enrich and expand the school day in ways that benefit students.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Motoko.
