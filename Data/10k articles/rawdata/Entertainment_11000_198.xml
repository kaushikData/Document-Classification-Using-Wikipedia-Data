'''''Abel Cain''''' (formerly known as '''''Sons of El Topo''''') is a stalled film project written and directed by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and the sequel to Jodorowsky's classic [[acid Western]] film ''[[El Topo]]''. It was to be produced and financed by Parallel Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Rose |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/14/alejandro-jodorowosky-el-topo |title=Lennon, Manson and me: the psychedelic cinema of Alejandro Jodorowsky &amp;#124; Film |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2009-11-14|accessdate=2011-01-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Jodorowsky said that the film had "dragged a long time" and suggested that Abel Cain will not feature any "stars", adding that he would cast his son Axel Jodorowsky in the lead role just as he did in his 1989 [[cult classic]] film ''[[Santa Sangre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.fi/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.excessif.com%2Fcinema%2Factu-cinema%2Fdossiers%2Fcarte-blanche-alejandro-jodorowsky-6061921-760.html |title=Google Kääntäjä |language=fi |publisher=Translate.google.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was expected to be released sometime between late 2011 to 2012, but appears to be shelved so that he may shoot his biopic, ''[[The Dance of Reality]]'' first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/26/alejandro-jodorowsky-a-spirited-talk-with-the-santa-sangre-director/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Todd | last=Gilchrist | title=Alejandro Jodorowsky: A Spirited Talk With The 'Santa Sangre' Director | date=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 29 interview, Jodorowsky announced that he had found financing for the film and would begin shooting the project in September in Mexico after he is finished with ''[[The Dance of Reality]]''.

During an interview at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2016, Jodorowsky announced his plans to finally make ''The Son of El Topo'' as soon as financial backing is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Craig (2016). [http://www.flickreel.com/the-son-of-el-topo-or-a-sensual-travel-to-be-alejandro-jodorowskys-next-film-after-endless-poetry/ ''THE SON OF EL TOPO OR A SENSUAL TRAVEL TO BE ALEJANDRO JODOROWSKY’S NEXT FILM AFTER ENDLESS POETRY (CANNES FILM FESTIVAL BREAKING NEWS)''], Flickreel.com, 15 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016 the sequel to ''El Topo'' was released in comic book form as ''Sons of El Topo'' (the original title for the project), in a miniseries written by Jodorowsky and illustrated by [[José Ladrönn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glenatbd.com/bd/les-fils-d-el-topo-tome-1-9782344004487.htm |title=Les Fils d'El Topo - Tome 1 - Caïn par Alejandro Jodorowsky |publisher=Glenatbd.com |date=2016-06-08 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
After a [[nuclear apocalypse]], the whole landscape is a desert ruin, except for a small island paradise where El Topo is buried. Though visible and seemingly accessible, every attempt to enter this island has resulted in disaster. El Topo's sons, Cain and Abel, were separated as boys because El Topo predicted that Cain would kill Abel. But when evil marauders steal their mothers's body in an attempt to trick their way into the island, the brothers join forces to deliver their dead mother to be buried with their father. Not only must they overcome an enemy adept at technological witchery, they must overcome the curse that marks their destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0187679/ |title=IMDb Pro : Abel Cain Business Details |publisher=Pro.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parallelmediafilms.com/#/films/abelcain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Alejandro Jodorowsky began attempting to resurrect his film career in the mid-nineties after becoming disillusioned with the business during his poor experience on ''The Rainbow Thief'' and attempted to market a sequel to his classic ''[[El Topo (1970 film)|El Topo]]'', and created a teaser poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/sons.html |title=The Sons Of El Topo |publisher=Hotweird.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521175025/http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/sons.html |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally ''Sons of El Topo'' was to star [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Johnny Depp]], but the funding never materialized and Jodorowsky shortly abandoned the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.short-biographies.com/biographies/AlejandroJodorowsky.html |title=Biography of Alejandro Jodorowsky |publisher=Short-biographies.com |date=1929-02-07 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jodorowsky next attempted to make a "metaphysical gangster film" entitled ''[[King Shot]]'', which was to be produced by David Lynch and star Marilyn Manson and Nick Nolte. He drew numerous conceptual sketches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://123nonstop.com/pictures/King_Shot |title=Pictures King Shot |publisher=123nonstop.com |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technoccult.net/archives/category/alejandro-jodorowsky/ |title=Alejandro Jodorowsky |publisher=Technoccult.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heavily marketed the film to producers, but eventually he and Lynch abandoned the project after they were only able to acquire a portion of the budget necessary to shoot the film and Jodorowsky was given another opportunity to make his "dream project".

In a November 2009 interview with ''The Guardian'', Jodorowsky revealed that he had stopped trying to make ''King Shot'', but had finally been given financing for the sequel to ''El Topo'' by some "Russian producers" who own Parallel Media films.

In each level, the main character Conrad is given a series of tasks such as collecting key cards, restoring power to various systems, and clearing rooms of hazardous substances (e.g. halon gas or excess water). All tasks must be completed before finding that level's exit in the form of an elevator. Standing in his way are a variety of aliens who will attack him, usually en masse. He can also suffer damage from explosions, fires, electrical disturbances, and enemy turrets. Conrad can run and shoot in all directions, and can collect a number of different weapons and items to aid him. He can also purchase additional ammunition, items, and upgrades from shops found at computer terminals which also function as save points. The camera angle can be rotated manually in 45 degree increments. Data pads are spread throughout the game, which when collected, reveal information on the various alien species encountered throughout the game and provide back stories for the game's characters. The game features a "survival" mode in which players might survive for as long as they can against waves of aliens while using whatever weapons and items they can find around the area. This mode is available in single-player and co-op modes.

'''Australia''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' four times since their debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 contest]] in [[Vienna]]. The country's best result in the contest is a second-place finish for [[Dami Im]] in {{escyr|2016}}. Australia also finished in the top ten in two of its other appearances in the contest, with [[Guy Sebastian]] finishing fifth in 2015, and [[Isaiah Firebrace]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2017}}.

Australia's participation in the 2015 contest was set to be a one-off event, the plan being only to perform again the following year had they won, but it was confirmed in November 2015 by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that they would participate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australien är klar för Eurovision Song Contest 2016 i Stockholm|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/australien-ar-klar-for-eurovision-song-contest-2016-i-stockholm|publisher=Sveriges Television|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is the first country from the [[Oceania]] region (and the second country outside Eurasia, after [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]]) to participate in the contest.

==History==

===1983–2014===
Australian broadcaster [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) first broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] and has continued to do so every year since. The contest has attracted a strong viewing audience in Australia, primarily because a significant proportion of the population have ancestry in Europe (in particular in the [[Australia–United_Kingdom_relations|United Kingdom]]). Early broadcasts of the Contest in Australia either featured no commentary or used the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}}'s commentary as transmitted by the [[BBC]]. In {{ESCYr|2001}}, actress and comedian [[Mary Coustas]] provided commentary for the Contest performing as her comedic character [[Effie Stephanidis|Effie]].&lt;ref name="escinsight.com"/&gt; In {{ESCYr|2002}} and {{ESCYr|2003}}, SBS presenter Des Mangan provided commentary for the Australian audience. From {{ESCYr|2009}}, [[Julia Zemiro]] and [[Sam Pang]] were assigned as commentators for the competition by SBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Sarah |title=Top of the Euro pops |work=Courier Mail |publisher=news.com.au |date=2008-05-21 |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23729009-5003422,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/04/airdate-eurovision-2009.html |title=Airdate: Eurovision 2009 |last=Knox |first=David |date=2009-04-16 |publisher=''TV Tonight'' |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ESCYr|2017}} saw SBS replace the commentators with comedian [[Joel Creasey]] and TV and radio personality [[Myf Warhurst]]. In addition to broadcasting the contest, SBS has also broadcast the [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest|50th]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits|60th]] anniversary programmes.

From 2010 to 2014, SBS allowed Australian viewers to participate in their own televote for the Grand Finals.&lt;ref name="eurovision.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australian_televoters_choose_their_winner|title=Australian televoters choose their winner|work=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these votes were not counted at the actual contest and did not affect the overall result. The SBS commentary team and Australian delegation were awarded a commentary booth of their own at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 contest]] in [[Baku]]. They have been allocated a commentary booth every year since.

In the event that Australia should win the Eurovision Song Contest, the EBU had confirmed that in accordance with the rules, Australia would not host the event in the southern hemisphere, and instead would co-host the contest in Europe.&lt;ref name="Oz-Win"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=What happens if Australia wins the Eurovision Song Contest?|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/05/13/happens-australia-wins-eurovision-song-contest/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=13 May 2017|date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to the EBU's statement it was confirmed that {{Esccnty|Germany}} and their broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)]] would be the first choice, and {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}}'s broadcaster [[British Broadcasting Corporation|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]] being the back-up hosts should Germany decline.&lt;ref name="Oz-Win"/&gt;

===2015 debut===
{{main|Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015}}
SBS made the country's debut at the 2015 Contest with the song "[[Tonight Again]]" a song written and performed by [[Guy Sebastian]]. Although Australia is outside the [[European Broadcasting Area]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and Austrian host broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] decided to permit an Australian entry to commemorate the 60th Contest. The special circumstances surrounding Australia's entry and "to not reduce the chances" of the semi-final participants led the organisers to allow Australia to compete directly in the grand final without pre-qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia participate in the 60th Eurovision|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_participate_in_the_2015_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=EBU|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=11 February 2015|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Australian jury consisted of [[Amanda Pelman]] (Chair), [[Richard Wilkins (TV presenter)|Richard Wilkins]], [[Danielle Spencer (Australian actress)|Danielle Spencer]] and [[Jake Stone (singer)|Jake Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Eurovision Jury|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/eurovision/rate-and-vote/australian-eurovision-jury|website=SBS Eurovision|publisher=SBS|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===

Although Australia's participation in 2015 was announced as a one-off event, it was confirmed on 17 November 2015 that Australia would participate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. Unlike in 2015, Australia did not receive automatic qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia To Return To The Eurovision Song Contest|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_return_to_the_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=EBU|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2015, it was announced that Australia would make its debut at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015]] after SBS was invited to perform in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=australia_joins_to_make_it_super_17_at_junior_eurovision_in_sofia|title=Australia joins to make it 'Super 17' at Junior Eurovision in Sofia!|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|last=Fisher|first=Luke James|accessdate=7 October 2015|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2016 Australian jury consisted of [[Monica Trapaga]] (Chair), [[Shannon Noll]], [[Myf Warhurst]], [[James Mathison]] and [[Craig Porteils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia’s Eurovision 2016 jury and spokesperson is revealed!|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/eurovision/article/2016/04/29/australias-eurovision-2016-jury-and-spokesperson-revealed|website=SBS Eurovision|publisher=SBS|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cake &amp; Ice Cream 2''''' is the 15th studio album by American rapper [[Messy Marv]]. The 2nd album of his ''Cake &amp; Ice Cream'' trilogy, it peaked at #39 on the [[R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, #25 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and at #12 on the [[Rap Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=messy marv|chart=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most successful albums of his career. ''Cake &amp; Ice Cream 2'' includes guest appearances from [[E-40]] and [[The Jacka]], among others, and also performances by [[Gucci Mane]], [[Mistah F.A.B.]], [[Yukmouth]] &amp; [[Turf Talk]]. As of April 2009, it had sold 5,222 copies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://haziqali.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/soundscan-for-this-past-week/&lt;/ref&gt;

"Talk Baseball" and "Killa" are both diss tracks at cousin/rapper [[San Quinn]], while Quinn himself appears on ''Cake &amp; Ice Cream 2'' and disses Messy Marv in a song called "Fence Hopper".

According to [[Allmusic]], "The [[Fillmore District]]’s own Messy Marv never rests, as he gives hungry fans another taste of his unique West Coast flavor on the mixtape release ''Cake &amp; Ice Cream 2''. The album documents the beef between Marv and fellow Bay Area representative San Quinn with each rapper throwing shots on solo diss tracks (San Quinn labels Marv a “Fence Hopper” and Marv gets personal on “Killa”). A handful of respected northern Cali artists also put in guest appearances."

This novel tells the story of an ordinary young Bengali man, [[Shankar Roy Chowdhury (character)|Shankar Roy Chowdhury]], as he adventures in [[Africa]] in the years 1909 and 1910. After graduating from college at 20-years-old, his family's financial struggles almost force him take a job in a [[jute]] mill in Shyamnagar — a prospect he absolutely loathes.

Because loves the subject of geography, he wants to follow the footsteps of renowned explorers like [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]], and [[Marco Polo]]. He wants to explore the wilderness, passionate for learning about African forests and animals. By a stroke of luck, he gets a job as a clerk at the [[Uganda Railway]] and rushes to Africa without a second thought.

After a few months laying rail tracks, he encounters the first of many dangers in pre-[[World War I]] Africa: a man-eating lion. Later, he takes up a job as station-master in a desolate station amidst the [[Veldt]]s, where he to narrowly escapes a deadly [[black mamba]]. While at this post, Shankar encounters, rescues and nurses Diego Alvarez, a middle-age Portuguese explorer and gold/diamond prospector. Alvarez's arrival becomes a turning point in Shankar's life.

While recovering, Alvarez describes his exploits in Africa with his friend Jim Carter. He explains that, lured by the prosepect of a priceless yellow diamond from a Kaafi village chief, Alvarez and Carter searched for these yellow diamond caves, on the Mountain of the Moon (Chander Pahar) in the [[Richtersveld]]. Rumors suggested a mythical monster, the [[Bunyip]], guards the mine. The explorers set off into the dense jungle, much against the villagers' advice, and Carter was gruesomely killed, supposedly by the Bunyip.
 
Shankar, inspired by Alvarez's exploits, resigns from his job and accompanies Alvarez to venture again for the mines. They meet hardships, like a raging [[volcano]]. Eventually, they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by the [[Bunyip]]. Demoralised, Shankar tries to return to civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. Almost getting lost,  he finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave is in fact the diamond mine.

Leaving, he becomes lost in the deserts of [[Kalahari]] and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately, he is rescued by a survey team and taken to a hospital in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Rhodesia]], from where he sets sail for home. Before going back, he writes his account in a newspaper, earning him money. He names the volcano after Alvarez. He ends the book saying that he will return to the cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter, and Gatti.

==The Collection==

The Diaz Ayala Cuban and Latin American Popular Music Collection (DAC) is the most extensive publicly available collection of Cuban music in the [[United States]]. It was donated to [[Florida International University]] Libraries in 2001 by the Cuban discographer and Lawyer Cristobal Diaz Ayala.&lt;ref&gt;Latin music donated. (Collections). (2002, September). American Libraries, 33(8), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The archive supports the Florida International University's mission of teaching, research, and service by providing means for the discovery and the pursuit of knowledge.

==History==
This initiative was started prior to 1960 by Mr. Diaz-Ayala. The collection contains more than 150,000 items in total and is currently being expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, B. (2001, October 24). Cristobal Diaz Ayala Bequeaths His Huge Archive of Cuban Sound. New York Times, p. E1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently appraised at over one million of dollars. The materials collected include a variety of formats such as books, [[LP’s]], [[78rpm]], [[45rpm]], CDs, photos, videos, cassettes, sheet music, catalogs, [[RCA Victor]]&lt;ref&gt;http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/58&lt;/ref&gt; cards, and posters, among others. The collection does not only include materials from [[Latin America]] musicians but also from artists from all around the world that have a connection to Latin roots.

Rare and valuable items recorded during the pre-revolutionary Cuba are part of the DAC.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Ayala, C. (2007). Music and Revolution: Cultural Change in Socialist Cuba. Journal of Latin American Studies, 39(2), 431&lt;/ref&gt; Under this category, it is possible to find cylinders, pianola rolls, 78 rpm, and rare books. Fragile 78 rpm records have been digitized in order to preserve them and keep them available for academic and research purposes. At the moment, it is possible to retrieve information about all the 78 rpm records as well as part of the Cuban and Puerto Rican LPs recordings through the collection metadata available at [http://latinpop.fiu.edu DAC website].

More than 350 interviews were incorporated into the DAC collection. Renowned performers, composers, and musicians such as [[Alfredo "Chocolate" Armenteros]], [[Abelardo Barroso]], [[Bola de Nieve]], and [[Isolina Carrillo]] are part of these conversations. The interviews contain significant and non-published information about how the groups were created, when and by whom, names and history about music companies, artist’s biographical information, and others. It provides researchers with the opportunity to learn more about personal experiences and anecdotes of the artists, groups, entrepreneurs, etc.

The largest part of the [[magnetic tape]] collection corresponds to [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] made from 78’ discs that are not contained in the collection or were never recorded in any other format, not only from Cuban music&lt;ref&gt;[[Music of Cuba]]&lt;/ref&gt; but also from other Latin American countries. Today, the FIU libraries are trying to fund a project that allows the digitization of magnetic tapes, since most of the tapes have more than 40 years of existence, which places them in a dangerous situation. The risk of demagnetization increases daily, since the estimated tape life expectancy ranges from less than ten years to a couple of decades.

'''''don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story''''' is a 2011 [[indie game|indie video game]] by [[Christine Love (writer)|Christine Love]]. Intended as a spiritual sequel to Love's ''[[Digital: A Love Story]]'', the game was developed over the course of a month and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011. ''Don't take it personally'' is a [[visual novel]], with the majority of the plot taking place outside of the player's control except for key decisions. It follows a new high school literature teacher in 2027 over the course of a semester, with the ability to see private messages between students at any time without their knowledge. It deals with themes of privacy and relationships in the future. The game was received positively, with critics praising the interplay between the [[metafiction]]al elements of the story and those of the game itself, with special acknowledgment reserved for the writing.

==Gameplay==

''Don't take it personally'' is a [[visual novel]], or [[interactive fiction]] game where the majority of the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of [[anime]]-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.&lt;ref name="RPSreview"/&gt;

In a departure from most visual novels the player can also see, at any time, the equivalent of texts and [[Facebook]] postings between the students on a school [[Social networking service|social network]] called AmieConnect (often shortened to "Amie"), as well as conversation threads on a [[4chan]]-like [[imageboard]] that serve as foreshadowing for future plot points. These extra conversations take place in parallel to in-person conversations between characters, occasionally at the same time; the player is notified anytime a new text message or post is made. A single playthrough of the game takes "over an hour".&lt;ref name="PMreview"/&gt;

==Scenario==

===Setting===
The game is set in a private high school in Ontario, in 2027. The player follows a new 11th-grade literature teacher at the school, John Rook, who has recently had his second divorce and is undergoing, in his words, a "bizarre midlife crisis" that has led him to quit his career in computers and become a teacher.&lt;ref name="GAMEmidlife"/&gt; The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and all of the students have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages. Rook, and therefore the player, can see all of the messages that the students send, even the private ones; the school administration has told Rook that it is for monitoring online bullying, and that he is not to let anyone know that he can see students' private messages.&lt;ref name="GAMEspy"/&gt;

===Plot===
Soon after the game opens, the player learns that Kendall and Charlotte have just broken up out of a lesbian relationship,&lt;ref name="GAMEkcbreak"/&gt; while a few weeks prior Taylor and Nolan had broken up out of a heterosexual relationship.&lt;ref name="GAMEtnbreak"/&gt; Arianna develops a crush on the teacher, which in the player's first decision point Rook can reciprocate or not.&lt;ref name="GAMEarc1"/&gt; Akira soon comes out as gay, finding to his dismay that everyone else already knew.&lt;ref name="GAMEakgay"/&gt; He then attempts to enter into a relationship with Nolan, who is unsure how to respond;&lt;ref name="GAMEantry"/&gt; Rook can encourage him to try it out or let him decide on his own, but he enters a relationship with Akira regardless.&lt;ref name="GAMEngay"/&gt;

The next day, Isabella misses a meeting she set up with Rook, and does not return to the class. Through Amie texts and wall posts, the other students insinuate that she committed suicide,&lt;ref name="GAMEidead1"/&gt; while the school is unable to provide Rook with any contact information for her.&lt;ref name="GAMEidead2"/&gt; Class continues without her, and a little while later Arianna, if the player rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to accept or reject her again.&lt;ref name="GAMEarc2"/&gt; Through Amie, Rook learns that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try again or not, which changes whether or not they get back together.&lt;ref name="GAMEcc"/&gt; Taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge between Nolan and Akira.&lt;ref name="GAMEnabreak"/&gt;

As the end of term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, and begins seeing [[shinigami]] figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks to speak to him concerning misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations.&lt;ref name="GAMEend1"/&gt; When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even "private" messages—might be read by anyone.&lt;ref name="GAMEend2"/&gt; The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.

==Development==
''Don't take it personally'' was developed over the course of a month, and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="CLrelease"/&gt; It was written and developed by [[Christine Love (writer)|Christine Love]], with artwork made for the game by Auro-Cyanide, artwork licensed from Tokudaya and Kimagure After, and with music licensed from Rengoku Teien and propanmode.&lt;ref name="CLcredits"/&gt; It was created using the [[Ren'Py]] engine. It was Love's longest game to date, and her first attempt at a game with a branching storyline.&lt;ref name="CLrelease"/&gt; It was intended as "a spiritual sequel of sorts" to ''[[Digital: A Love Story]]'', a 2010 game by Love.&lt;ref name="CLgamemain"/&gt; The game was made for NaNoRenO (National [[Dating sim|Ren'ai]] Game Writing Month), a month-long contest in the vein of [[National Novel Writing Month]] (NaNoWriMo) where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month.&lt;ref name="CLgamemain"/&gt; Love's favorite character to write was Kendall.&lt;ref name="CLfinal"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Don't take it personally'' was chosen as a "freeware game pick" by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who said that it was worth playing through multiple times in order to see the different paths the story takes depending on the player's choices.&lt;ref name="IGreview"/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the visual novel the award for "Best Script" in its video game awards of 2011, stating that "Love's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student's worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn't dare."&lt;ref name="TDTaward"/&gt; Pete Davidson of ''[[GamePro]]'' noted the game as an example of the "creativity" missing in many large-budget titles, and praised the story, calling Love "a writer first and a game developer second."&lt;ref name="GPreview"/&gt; Alec Meer of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] described the game as "a game about love, sex and the internet" that was "capable of being profoundly moving" and was about "what it is to feel like someone's kicked me straight in the heart".&lt;ref name="RPSreview"/&gt; He praised Love's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the "12chan" threads as a [[Greek chorus]] was "perhaps a meta-layer too far".&lt;ref name="RPSreview"/&gt;

Aaron Poppleton of [[PopMatters]] called the game "a meditation on privacy in the modern age" and "one of the more thoughtful games to come out in a long time." He criticized the art direction of the game, saying that the limitation of creating the game in a month led to poor artwork and an unpolished presentation that let down the possibilities of the story. He did note that the story and writing of the game made the downsides of the game "almost entirely a moot point", and that it is a very strong game.&lt;ref name="PMreview"/&gt; Pete Davidson of ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'', in an article about the treatment of sexuality in video games, called out the game as an example of a game that used sexual themes maturely to explore love and relationships.&lt;ref name="PCWarticle"/&gt; [[Emily Short]] of [[Gamasutra]], in a discussion about the game, said that it was definitely worth playing and full of "charming characters, colorful dialogue, and important questions", but criticized the uneven exploration of issues regarding privacy versus [[personal boundaries]]. She said that the game's lack of focus on Rook's issues with [[personal boundaries|personal]] and [[professional boundaries]] was a weakness in the story, given that the distinction between boundaries and privacy was crucial to the plot.&lt;ref name="GSdiscuss"/&gt; Love collated common criticisms and reviews of the game on her blog, summarizing that while it was less praised than ''Digital: A Love Story'', most players seemed to like the way she wrote the relationships and overall story. There was a consensus, however, that her portrayal of Rook was weak and that many players seemed to miss both that he was intended to be "an absolutely awful teacher" and that the potential relationship with Arianna was intended to be creepy and make the player feel bad. She also noted that her use of licensed artwork detracted from the game's potential in comparison to the reaction to the custom works.&lt;ref name="CLreviews"/&gt;

'''''Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes''''',&lt;ref name="DE" /&gt; also known as '''''Harvey's New Eyes''''',&lt;ref name="DE" /&gt; is a [[point-and-click adventure game]] created by [[Daedalic Entertainment]]. The game was released on October 16, 2012.&lt;ref name="DE" /&gt; ''Harvey's New Eyes'' is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Edna &amp; Harvey: The Breakout]]''.

==Gameplay==
The game is set in a 2D cartoon world. The player controls Lilli. Unlike most other adventure games, there are no clickable dialogues. After the player clicks on a character, a bar appears with some symbols indicating a subject. The game neither has a list with actions such as Walk, Look, Talk, Pick up, Use. If applicable, items are automatically added to the inventory when the user clicks on them. Furthermore, the user must combine objects in his inventory in order to create new ones (or to modify existing items). Objects in the inventory can be given to other characters or can be combined with items not in the inventory.

==Plot==
The game starts in a strict boarding school led by a female convent order. The head of the convent order is [[abbess]] Ignatz. One of the pupils is Lilli, the main character. She is a shy, insecure little girl not daring to speak in public. She does not have her own opinions (or is afraid to tell them) and she executes all charged tasks. Another pupil is Edna and it is obvious she is not as crazy as in [[Edna &amp; Harvey: The Breakout|The Breakout]].

The abbess can't stand the youthful behavior anymore. That's why she wants to bring in doctor Marcel. He must brainwash the children so they will be all good and modest. When Edna hears this news she wants to escape: she pushed doctor Marcel from the stairs at the end of The Breakout and let him behind for being dead although she can't remember the reason. She is now afraid doctor Marcel wants revenge if he finds her. That's why Edna gives Lilli the task to remove all evidence of Edna's presence.

Lilli discovers that Gerret, one of the elder students, is an undercover agent. He wants to expose the malpractice of Ignatz. He also warns Lilli she might get caught by Marcel, which eventually happens. Marcel uses the ragdoll Harvey to hypnotize Lilli. The hypnosis prevents Lilli taking the following actions: playing with fire, to disobey adults, to lie, to drink alcohol, to use sharp objects, to enter dangerous places and to get angry. Each time Lilli makes a violation, the hypnosis gives her an electric shock. At such time, a demon-version of Harvey turns up and tells Lilli what she has done wrong.

Gerret gives Lilli a truth serum, which has to be drunk by Ignatz. By doing this, Gerret discovers that the misbehavior is caused by a child-hood trauma. Gerret also tells Lilli she can beat the hypnosis by fighting the prohibition-demons. This action causes her to go into trance. In these trance-worlds she is able to find solutions to get rid of the prohibitions one by one.

In meantime, Edna escaped the boarding school and Lilli and Gerret try to find her. Edna gets kidnapped by some men who work for Marcel. They take her to the asylum. Gerret seeks for help while Lilli penetrates into the asylum. Lilli eventually finds Edna in her former cell, where both Gerret and the brainwashed Ignatz are also held captive. Lilli is able to get Ignatz out of her trance. Ignatz regrets her actions and gives Lilli a knife to rescue Edna and Gerret. Marcel tries to convince Lilli she is very ill and needs therapy. Edna remembers what happened in The Breakout. As Lilli has overcome all her restrictions, she can do whatever she wants. This causes the game to have three different endings: she stabs Marcel, she confirms she is ill and goes into therapy, or she objects and leaves.

==Reception==
According to Carsten Fichtelmann of [[Daedalic Entertainment]], ''Edna &amp; Harvey'' achieved physical sales of 80,000 copies at German retailers.&lt;ref name=rqint&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306033901/https://ragequit.gr/specials/item/ragequit-gr-at-daedalic-days-2016-part-2-interviews-english-text-edition/ | url=https://ragequit.gr/specials/item/ragequit-gr-at-daedalic-days-2016-part-2-interviews-english-text-edition/ | title=Interviews with the Daedalic Entertainment team | date=February 28, 2016 | author=Karkalemis, Manos | work=Ragequit.gr | archivedate=March 6, 2016 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was awarded a score of 75/100 on Metacritic, which is better than its [[Edna &amp; Harvey: The Breakout|predecessor]], which only received 57/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/edna-harvey-harveys-new-eyes |title=Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes |publisher=Metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On AdventureGamers.com the game got a 3.5 out of 5 with the remark it is a good game with an easy interface, although not as fun as The Breakout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/games/view/17124 |title=Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes |publisher=Adventure Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN gave the game a rating of 6/10 asserting that most of the characters are underdeveloped and that the environments are banal and uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/26/edna-harvey-harveys-new-eyes-review |title=Edna and Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes |publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''El Negro Blanco''''' is an Argentine [[comic strip]] that was published by the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'' newspaper]] from 1987 to 1994. It was written by [[Carlos Trillo]], and drawn by [[Ernesto García Seijas]]. The words "Negro" and "Blanco" mean [[black]] and [[white]] in Spanish, but Blanco is simply the family name of the main character and "Negro" is a common Argentinian nickname.

==Premise==
Same as with the former comic strip [[El Loco Chávez]] that this one replaced, the main character is a fictional journalist, who works in a fictional depiction of the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín newspaper]] that published it. Most story arcs were about both some weird news report assigned to him, or trivial ones that develop an unexpected twist, and a romantic affair. The Negro Blanco develops relations with many different women, but Chispa Valdéz and Flopi Bach are recurring ones.

==Characters==
* '''Roberto "Negro" Blanco:''' It's the main character of the comic strip. He is a journalist of the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] newspaper, a [[metafiction]]al reference to the real newspaper that published the comic strip.
* '''Chispa Valdéz:''' She's the main girlfriend of the Negro. They met again after several years without contact in the beginning of the comic strip. She is an architect, and finally gets married with someone else.
* '''Flopi Bach:''' She is the second girlfriend of the Negro, introduced some time afterwards. Negro would move from one to the other, in the different story arcs. She began as a novice reporter for the newspaper, but was hired later by a [[Yellow journalism|sensacionalist news program]]. Negro left her, and she swore vengeance against him.
* '''Carlos Marcucci:''' A friend of the Negro Blanco, troubled because all women try to seduce him.
* '''Aníbal:''' The Negro's boss at [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] newspaper.
* '''Susana:''' Susana is a fellow reporter of the newspaper. She likes the Negro Blanco, but he never got interested in her.
* '''Agatha:''' Agatha is a witch that influences the other's lives. She appeared in the first story arcs.
* '''Miguel:''' Miguel is yet another friend of Negro.
* '''Melisa Caramelo:''' A psychiatrist, romantically interested in Aníbal.
* '''Roberto Blanco sr.:''' The Negro's father.
* '''Badaracco:''' Flopi's boss at the news program.
* '''Cococha Valdivia:''' Cococha Valdivia is a character from the TV channel, interested in gossip, both of close and famous people. The graphic design is similar to that of [[Olive Oyl]], and the name is also similar (Olive Oyl has been translated to Spanish audiences as "Olivia").
* '''The TV channel director:''' The TV channel is directed by a megalomaniac man, without a defined name across the stories. Other characters usually talk about him using grandiloquent names such as "the King of Kings", "Raging Zeus", "The Great Manitu", etc.

[[File:Flopi Bach.jpg|thumb|right|Cover for an Argentinian ''Playboy ''magazine featuring Flopi Bach (left) and [[Araceli González]] (right).]]
==Publication==

''El Negro Blanco'' was published by the ''Clarín newspaper'' from 1987 to 1994. It replaced ''[[El Loco Chávez]]'' at the page devoted to comic strips, being replaced at its end by [[El Nene Montanaro]]. The newspaper added extra stories at the Sunday magazine on some occasions. Ivrea republished the whole run of the comic strip in 10 comic books in [[prestige format]] in 2006, and El Globo Editor published a specific story arc in 1993.

The character Carlos Marcucci is freely based on a real man with that name, friend of the writer Carlos Trillo. According to Marcucci, [[Ernesto García Seijas]] accurately portrayed him as an ugly man, who is nevertheless successful with women (however, the comic strip took that to parodic levels).

To design the character of Flopi Bach, Seijas modeled her after [[Araceli González]], then an unknown model hired for that work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/mujeres-inolvidables_0_478152276.html Aquellas mujeres inolvidables] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was very successful, and both González and the character appeared at a 1991 issue of the Argentine edition of the'' Playboy ''magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historieteca.com.ar/Novedades/editoras/negroblanco.htm El Negro Blanco] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that ''Playboy ''published erotic images of a fictional character instead of photos of real people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtoarsenio.blogspot.com.ar/2012/04/carlos-trillo-y-ernesto-garcia-seijas.html Carlos Trillo y Ernesto García Seijas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seijas took the character for [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]], after the end of the comic strip.

Trillo and Seijas worked as well in the "Sangre de brujas" ({{lang-es|Blood of witches}}) comic book, another spin-off with the character Agatha.

'''''Electric Blue''''' was a [[softcore pornography]] show that aired mainly on the [[Playboy TV|Playboy Channel]] in the early 1980s. The show was produced in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.co.uk/entertainment/celebrities/206830/4/Page-3-The-good-old-days/|title=Playboy|work=Playboy|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many prominent porn stars performed on this show, including [[Ginger Lynn]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Sasha Gabor]], [[Traci Lords]], Blake Palmer, Janey Robbins, Rick Savage, Jay Serling, Laurie Smith, Heather Wayne, and Jessica Wylde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrity.premiere.com/movie--Electric+Blue+51 ''Electric Blue'' (1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_filmography/1078:1478/Traci_Lords.htm Biography Channel]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hustler Magazine]] Centerfold Model and 'scream queen' actress [[Gail Harris]] made appearances in many episodes. This grouping of soft core porn first started in London under the direction of [[Paul Raymond (publisher)|Paul Raymond]], famous for his 'top shelf' men's magazines including ''[[Men Only]]'' and ''[[Club International]]''. Paul Raymond also owned the [[Raymond Revuebar]], a striptease club in Soho London.  The UK saw these shows on video tape, prior to them being picked by Playboy. A film tie-in, titled '''''Electric Blue - The Movie''''', was released theatrically in the UK in 1982 and on VHS in 1983, and featured [[Marilyn Chambers]] presenting archive nude footage of celebrities including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]].

== Distribution ==
It appeared on home video releases in North America, Australia, New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s.

''Electric Blue'' was derived from the UK and were a subsidiary of the Video Classics group of labels in Australia. After that company ended, ''Electric Blue'' films were released by [[Virgin Media|Virgin Video]]. Then, in the mid-1990s, they were distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar]].

The versions released on home video in North America differed from the UK versions, adding localized content and a greater emphasis on American porn stars.

The type of films released by this company consisted of female centrefolds, nudity and sexual situations. Later on, Playboy in the USA basically copied what they did{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and aired the show on their channel.

On July 19, 2010, [[Shirley Sherrod]] was fired from her appointed position as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] State Director of [[USDA Rural Development|Rural Development]] for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html|publisher=New York Times |date=July 21, 2010 |title=With Apology, Fired Official Is Offered a New Job}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vilsack&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011263-503544.html |title=Vilsack: I Will Have to Live With Shirley Sherrod Mistake |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=July 21, 2010 | first=Brian | last=Montopoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her firing was an administration reaction to media reports on video excerpts from her address to an event of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in March 2010 and commentary posted by conservative blogger [[Andrew Breitbart]] on [[Breitbart News|his website]].&lt;ref name=Fox20100719 /&gt; Based on these excerpts, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks as racist and US government officials called on the official to resign. However, review of her full speech showed that the excerpts had been selectively edited, and that her remarks – understood in context – were about the importance of overcoming personal prejudices. The NAACP and White House officials then apologized for their earlier criticisms, and [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Tom Vilsack]] apologized for the firing and offered Sherrod a new position.

Extensive media coverage of the excerpted videos, various parties' comments, and later corrections after the full story was discovered, exacerbated the affair. The event brought to the forefront current debates regarding [[racism in the United States]], [[United States cable news|cable news]] reporting, [[political blog|ideological websites]] on the internet, and decisions made by President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]].&lt;ref name = "BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/07/shirley_sherrod_blasts_fox_new.html "Shirley Sherrod blasts Fox News as racist"], ''[[Washington Post]],'' July 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration apologized to Sherrod, and offered her a full-time, high-level internal advocacy position with the [[USDA]],&lt;ref name=LA20100722 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/21/AR2010072103871.html |title=Fired USDA official receives apologies from White House, Vilsack |work=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=July 22, 2010 | first1=Karen | last1=Tumulty | first2=Ed | last2=O'Keefe | date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="By the CNN Wire Staff"&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/22/agriculture.employee.usda/index.html?video=true&amp;hpt=T2 |title=Sherrod: Andrew Breitbart is 'a liar' |publisher=CNN.com |date= July 23, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she ultimately declined.&lt;ref name= turnsdown/&gt;  In 2011, Sherrod filed suit against Breitbart and co-defendant [[Larry O'Connor (radio host)|Larry O'Connor]] for [[defamation]].&lt;ref name = atgathering&gt;{{Cite news | last = Zeleny| first = Jeff|author2=Sarah Wheaton | title = At Gathering, Ron Paul Is No. 1 for 2012| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A21  | date = February 13, 2011| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/us/politics/13cpac.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1 | accessdate = February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, following lengthy pretrial proceedings, and efforts by Breitbart to have the suit dismissed which were rejected, the parties settled the suit on undisclosed terms.

==Before media coverage of videos==

===Shirley Sherrod aware of videos on July 14===
When Shirley Sherrod addressed the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund on August 21, 2010, she claimed to have been aware of the videos on July 14, 2010; five days before they were posted on Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website.&lt;ref name="FederationSpeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ5ygEeD47g |title= Sherrod Speech To Federation of Southern Cooperatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherrod says that she immediately notified the USDA about the videos, saying that they did not convey the entire or accurate story. She heard nothing from the USDA until Monday, July 19, 2010, when she was put on administrative leave and then asked to resign. Released White House emails show the Obama administration was aware of the situation, but there was no evidence that the dismissal of Sherrod was under orders of the White House.&lt;ref name="By the CNN Wire Staff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0308/Sherrod-firing-emails-reveal-White-House-role |title=Sherrod firing: emails reveal White House role |work=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=March 9, 2012| first1= | last1= | first2= | last2= | date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/e-mail-points-to-white-house-involvement-in-usdas-firing-of-shirley-sherrod/2014/11/03/df70188c-63a8-11e4-9fdc-d43b053ecb4d_story.html |title=E-mail points to White House involvement in USDA’s firing of Shirley Sherrod |author=Mary Clare Jalonick |date=November 3, 2014 |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excerpted video===
On July 19, 2010, two different video clips were posted by the [[conservative]] commentator [[Andrew Breitbart]] to his BigGovernment.com website, along with a nearly 1,000-word blog post in which he accused the mainstream media and the NAACP of falsely labeling the Tea Party as racist. He states in the blog post, "eventually, her basic humanity informs that this white man is poor and needs help", and that the main point of the blog post and video release was that "Sherrod's racist tale is received by the NAACP audience with nodding approval and murmurs of recognition and agreement. Hardly the behavior of the group now holding itself up as the supreme judge of another group's racial tolerance."&lt;ref name="BG20100719"/&gt;

The first video showed Sherrod describing an experience of working with a white man seeking help to save his farm. She struggled with helping him at a time when many black people were losing their land. In the excerpt, she says "So, I didn't give him the full force of what I could do." She claims to have taken him to a white lawyer, telling the audience that &amp;mdash;"his own kind would take care of him."&lt;ref name="BG20100719" /&gt;  She said she realized it was about the poor versus "those who have".&lt;ref name="BG20100719" /&gt;

Subsequent events showed that the posted video was an excerpt of broader comments that conveyed a very different meaning, in which Sherrod learned from her experience.&lt;ref name=Dodge /&gt; The excerpts posted by Breitbart ran for 2 minutes, 38 seconds in total, while the full video was 43 minutes 15 seconds long.&lt;ref name="caseshowspower"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/sherrod-case-shows-power-of-conservative-media/article_d00c6926-2c32-54c5-bcec-4c4734578373.html|title = Sherrod case shows power of conservative media|first = David|last = Bauder|date = July 21, 2010|work= St. Louis Post-Dispatch|agency = [[Associated Press]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart said he did not edit the video excerpt which he released and did not have a copy of the entire speech.&lt;ref name="TPM201007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/07/breitbart_i_did_not_edit_this_thing.php |title=Breitbart On Sherrod's NAACP Speech: 'I Did Not Edit This Thing' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full video was produced by a [[Douglas, Georgia]], company that filmed the banquet for the local Georgia chapter of the NAACP. The owner of the video company, Johnny Wilkerson, said on July 20 that he was sending the full video to the national NAACP and would post it in full once he got permission to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Slajda |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/07/usda_appointee_forced_to_resign_after_discussing_r.php |title=USDA Appointee Forced To Resign After Edited Speech Released By Breitbart |publisher=Tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com |date= July 20, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart's source for the excerpt remained confidential {{as of|2010|7|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name = "sherrod'srevenge"/&gt;

===Controversy timeline===
Much of the controversy related to the incident involved which parties took which actions and when. [[Media Matters for America]], a liberal media watchdog organization, compiled an extensive timeline of the affair. Greg Pollowitz of ''[[National Review Online]]'', a conservative publication, said that the Media Matters timeline was "as good as any I’ve seen."&lt;ref name="MMTimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NROTimeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/media-blog/231300/media-matters-timeline-sherrod-affair/greg-pollowitz |title= The Media Matters Timeline of the Sherrod Affair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial media reports===
The first news outlet to report on the Breitbart video was [[FoxNews.com]], which posted an article about the story on its website.&lt;ref name="MMTimeline" /&gt; The [[WCBS-TV|New York City affiliate for CBS]] posted a report on its website later that afternoon.&lt;ref name="MMTimeline" /&gt; The ''[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]]'' website soon picked up the story.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; In addition, the story was picked up and reported widely in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref name="MMTimeline" /&gt;

===Resignation of Sherrod===
Sherrod later said that on the afternoon of July 19, she received numerous demands from government officials to submit her resignation, demands which she characterized as harassment.&lt;ref name=CNN20100720&gt;{{cite news |url= http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/20/sherrod-white-house-worried-about-glenn-beck/?fbid=GmSiFGmDEyY |title=Sherrod: White House worried about Glenn Beck |work=cnn.com |accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a call from [[USDA]] deputy undersecretary Cheryl Cook, Sherrod submitted her resignation via email that same day. Sherrod claims that Cook told her [[Obama Administration|White House]] officials wanted her to quit immediately because the controversy was "going to be on [[Glenn Beck (TV program)|Glenn Beck]] tonight",&lt;ref name=CNN20100720/&gt; a claim disputed by White House Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]].&lt;ref name=LA20100722 /&gt;

===Official comments about Sherrod===
That same evening, the President of the NAACP, [[Benjamin Jealous]], posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying that his organization was "appalled" by Sherrod's comments.&lt;ref name="MMTimeline"/&gt; The following day, the USDA Secretary [[Tom Vilsack]] released a statement explaining his agency's actions and suggested that Sherrod's statements as shown damaged her effectiveness at a time when USDA was working to improve its previous civil rights abuses.&lt;ref name=TPM20100720&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/07/agriculture_secretary_stands_by_asking_for_sherrod.php |title=Agriculture Secretary Stands By Asking For Sherrod's Resignation}} Quote:Yesterday, I asked for and accepted Ms. Sherrod's resignation for two reasons. First, for the past 18 months, we have been working to turn the page on the sordid civil rights record at USDA and this controversy could make it more difficult to move forward on correcting injustices. Second, state rural development directors make many decisions and are often called to use their discretion. The controversy surrounding her comments would create situations where her decisions, rightly or wrongly, would be called into question making it difficult for her to bring jobs to Georgia.&lt;br&gt;Our policy is clear. There is zero tolerance for discrimination at USDA and we strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person. We have a duty to ensure that when we provide services to the American people we do so in an equitable manner. But equally important is our duty to instill confidence in the American people that we are fair service providers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial broadcast of Breitbart video===
The Breitbart video was first broadcast that evening on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', a [[talk show]] on the [[Fox News Channel]];&lt;ref name="MMTimeline"/&gt; host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] said Sherrod should resign.&lt;ref name="MMTimeline"/&gt; At the time of the taping of the show, news of Sherrod's resignation had not yet been reported, nor had the NAACP yet released the full video. But, the program was not broadcast until after Sherrod resigned and O'Reilly's staff had confirmed that fact with the USDA.&lt;ref name=finger/&gt;

[[Dana Loesch]], an organizer for the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]], mentioned the video in an appearance on ''[[Larry King Live]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.journalism.org/commentary_backgrounder/shirley_sherrod_page |title=The Reconstruction of a Media Mess &amp;#124; Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) |publisher=Journalism.org |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/19/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also shown on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'' (both on CNN).&lt;ref name=finger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/19/acd.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discussed on ''[[Hannity]]'' and ''[[On The Record with Greta Van Susteren]]'' (both on Fox) as well,&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; but notably not on ''[[Glenn Beck (TV program)|Glenn Beck]]''.&lt;ref name=HP20100727 /&gt;

===Sherrod's account===
In the full video, Sherrod related her experience in 1986 with the first white farmer to come to her for help. (On July 20 CNN received a telephone call from the farmer's wife and learned his name was Roger Spooner.&lt;ref&gt;Tommy Christopher, [http://www.mediaite.com/online/defending-shirley-sherrod-farmers-wife-calls-cnn-to-stand-up-for-fired-usda-official/ "Defending Shirley Sherrod: Farmer’s Wife Calls CNN To Stand Up For Fired USDA Official"], Mediaite.com, July 20, 2010. Retrieved July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) Sherrod said that his land was being sold, and "had in fact already been rented out from under him."&lt;ref name = "NAACP Video" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9NcCa_KjXk |title=Shirley Sherrod: the FULL video |publisher=NAACP |date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, she felt that he had a superior attitude toward her, causing her to recall harsh aspects of her life in [[Southern United States|the South]], including the murder of her father;&lt;ref name="NAACP Video"/&gt; Sherrod went on to say that she had not let that get in the way and did not discriminate against him. They became very good friends as a result of her help. She admitted thinking at the time that white people had "all the advantages" but learned that poverty affected both races.&lt;ref name="NAACP Video"/&gt;

According to Sherrod, she did her job correctly by taking the farmer to a white lawyer who she thought could help him, and she looked for another lawyer when needed.&lt;ref name = "CNN" /&gt;  Sherrod rejected claims that she was racist and said she "went all out" to help the man keep his farm. She said that the incident helped her learn to move beyond race, and she told the story to audiences to make that point.&lt;ref name = "CNN" &gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/20/agriculture.employee.naacp/#fbid=X40jhuCTauq |title=NAACP 'snookered' over video of former USDA employee - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=March 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spooner family's account===
Roger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod is not a racist, that she did everything she could for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Kurtz |url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/07/endearing_1.php |title=Endearing |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date= July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: "If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do", Roger Spooner said. "She led us right to our success."  His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that "after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some tomatoes out of her garden, and they had a good visit."&lt;ref name = "CNN" /&gt;  Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as "nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person."&lt;ref name = "CNN" /&gt; The couple were surprised by the controversy.  "I don't know what brought up the racist mess", Roger Spooner said. "They just want to stir up some trouble, it sounds to me in my opinion."   Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, "I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'"&lt;ref name = "CNN" /&gt;

===Full video===
The extended unedited video of her speech released by the NAACP&lt;ref name=AP20100722&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100722/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_usda_racism_resignation WH apologizes to fired Ag worker; she mulls return], Yahoo.com. Retrieved July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that in her full speech, Sherrod emphasized what was only touched on in the excerpt:&lt;ref name="Original"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_xCeItxbQY |title=YouTube NAACP Bigotry in their ranks }}&lt;/ref&gt; she said that she learned from the incident that [[poverty]], not [[race (classification of humans)|race]], was the key factor in rural development. She said she ultimately worked hard to save the farmer's land.&lt;ref name = "BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Connolly |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10716237 |title=BBC News - White House sorry for Shirley Sherrod 'racism' firing |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other references to race in Sherrod's speech related to a story of her more recent help of a black family to prevent forced sale of their farmland. It was a case in which distant cousins, among numerous heirs, were forcing a sale of land that the family had owned since the grandfather bought it. She noted finding some honest lawyer who happened to be white, and also that the cousins in the North had lined up a white buyer.&lt;ref name="NAACP Video" /&gt;

== Subsequent events ==

===Reactions to the incident===
Within hours of the excerpted video's being shown, [[Benjamin Jealous]], president of the NAACP, condemned Sherrod for having abused her power and criticized the apparent audience reaction as well.&lt;ref name = "CBS" &gt;{{cite news|last=Hechtkopf |first=Kevin |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011138-503544.html |title=NAACP Retracts Shirley Sherrod Statement, Says It Was "Snookered" by Fox News, Andrew Breitbart - Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date= July 20, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}} Quote: "Racism is about the abuse of power. Ms. Sherrod had it in her position at USDA. According to her remarks, she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race. We are appalled by her actions, just as we are with abuses of power against farmers of color and female farmers. Her actions were shameful. While she went on to explain in the story that she ultimately realized her mistake, as well as the common predicament of working people of all races, she gave no indication she had attempted to right the wrong she had done to this man.

After the NAACP released the entire videotape, its officials retracted their previous statement and said:&lt;ref name = "CBS" /&gt;{{quote|Having reviewed the full tape, spoken to Ms. Sherrod, and most importantly heard the testimony of the white farmers mentioned in this story, we now believe the organization that edited the documents did so with the intention of deceiving millions of Americans.&lt;ref name = "CBS" /&gt;}}

During the uproar over Sherrod's resignation, Vilsack released a statement on July 20 saying that the USDA would "conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/7117358.html |title=Sherrod says Ag secretary offers to hire her back &amp;#124; Top AP Stories &amp;#124; Chron.com - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |accessdate=July 21, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherrod said that she might not want the job any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/viral-videos-shirley-sherrod-flap-highlights-growing-political/story?id=11214756 |title=Viral Videos: Shirley Sherrod Flap Highlights Growing Political Trend - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, Fox News rejected claims that it inflamed the situation.&lt;ref name = "Fox 5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,597324,00.html |title=Andrew Breitbart on 'Hannity': 'This Is Not About Shirley Sherrod' - Hannity |publisher=FOXNews.com |date= July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}} Quote: "[The network] did not make any mention of this story yesterday on the air until after Shirley Sherrod had already lost her job after Secretary Vilsack had already drawn his own conclusions &amp;ndash; conclusions that the president apparently agreed with."&lt;/ref&gt; While the story was not mentioned on the Fox News Channel until after Sherrod's resignation, the edited video and an accompanying article had been published on the Fox News website, as well as those of several other news organizations, prior to her resignation.&lt;ref name=Fox20100719 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MMTimeline /&gt;

===Reactions from Breitbart===
Initially, Breitbart claimed Sherrod harbored racist sentiments.&lt;ref name=Politico20100720 /&gt; On July 20, 2010, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[John King (journalist)|John King]], Breitbart said that releasing the video was "...not about Shirley Sherrod. It's about the NAACP. This was about the NAACP attacking the Tea Party and this [the video of Ms. Sherrod] is showing racism at an NAACP event. I did not ask for Shirley Sherrod to be fired. I did not ask for any repercussions for Shirley Sherrod. They were the ones that took the initiative to get rid of her."&lt;ref name="CNN 2" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://johnkingusa.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/20/breitbart-this-was-not-about-shirley-sherrod/ |title=John King USA: Blog Archive - Breitbart: 'This was not about Shirley Sherrod' « - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Johnkingusa.blogs.cnn.com |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart questioned CNN's acceptance of Eloise Spooner's self-reported identity in a phone interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad Johnson |url=http://thinkprogress.org/2010/07/21/breitbart-farmers-wife-hoax/ |title=Breitbart’s New Conspiracy Theory: The ‘Purported’ Farmer’s Wife Is A Plant |publisher=Thinkprogress.org |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}} Quote: "You tell me as a reporter how CNN put on a person today who purported to be the farmer’s wife?

You’re going off of her word that the farmer’s wife is the farmer’s wife?"&lt;/ref&gt;  In a July 30 interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'', Breitbart said he would be glad to meet with Sherrod privately. He agreed that the excerpted video took her statements out of context and said that if he could do things all over again, he would not have posted the excerpted video,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Daniel Stone|date=July 30, 2010 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/07/30/breitbart-i-d-like-to-speak-with-sherrod-in-private.html?from=rss |title=Breitbart: I’d Like to Speak to Sherrod in Private |publisher=''Newsweek''|accessdate=August 1, 2010}} Quote: "I’d be more than happy to meet with her [Sherrod] in private and have a discussion with her... I’ll go wherever she wants. I’ll go to [[Albany, Georgia]] [where Sherrod resides]."&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not apologize to Sherrod.

===Reactions and subsequent statements by Sherrod===
President [[Barack Obama]] spoke to Sherrod personally in a phone call that lasted for seven minutes. Although he did not apologize personally to her, Sherrod said she was "very, very pleased with the conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/22/agriculture.employee.usda/?hpt=T1#fbid=X40jhuCTauq |title=Sherrod: Andrew Breitbart is 'a liar' - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= July 23, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, Sherrod said she planned to sue Breitbart, who published the excerpted video that led to her resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011306-503544.html|title=Sherrod: I'd Consider Legal Action against Breitbart|date=July 22, 2010|publisher=CBS News|last=Smith|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that she would like to see Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website "shut down".&lt;ref name=MSShutdown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/shirley-sherrod-wants-biggovernment-shut-down/ |author=Jon Bershad |title=Shirley Sherrod Would Like BigGovernment Shut Down|work=Mediaite |date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the CNN reporter [[Anderson Cooper]], Sherrod referred to Breitbart as "vicious" and a "racist", and said that he would "like to get us stuck back in the times of [[slavery]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/us/2010/07/23/ac.shirley.sherrod.breitbart.cnn |title=Video - Breaking News Videos from |publisher=CNN.com |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Review]]'' commentators suggested she owed Breitbart an apology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDNmYTk4ZmVjYzU0Zjk3OTU5ODNhODhjOTE4NmM1NmU= |title=Shirley Sherrod - My Take - Jonah Goldberg - The Corner on National Review Online |publisher=Corner.nationalreview.com |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Salon.com|''Salon's'']] Joan Walsh said Sherrod's assertion came from her own viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Brad |url=http://newledger.com/2010/07/shirley-sherrod-and-racial-politics/ |title=Shirley Sherrod and Racial Politics |publisher=The New Ledger |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729213139/http://newledger.com/2010/07/shirley-sherrod-and-racial-politics/# |archive-date=July 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} Quote: "She gets to say that because it’s true, and because from her vantage point it’s especially true."&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning of Breitbart's death on March 1, 2012, Sherrod released the following statement: "The news of Mr. Breitbart's death came as a surprise to me when I was informed of it this morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart's family as they cope during this very difficult time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/shirley-sherrod-reflects-on-her-link-to-andrew-breitbart/2012/03/01/gIQAgP8ykR_blog.html |title=Shirley Sherrod reflects on her link to Andrew Breitbart |publisher=The Washington Post |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Breitbart's widow has taken his place as defendant in the ongoing lawsuit.

== Selected analyses and commentary ==

=== General politics ===
Commentators attributed the rivalry between the left and the right as an important factor in the controversy. The NAACP had passed a resolution asking the Tea Party to repudiate racist language among its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naacp.org/news/entry/naacp-delegates-vote-to-repudiate-racist-elements-within-the-tea-pary/ |title=Delegates Vote to Repudiate Racist Elements Within Tea Party |publisher=NAACP |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100714171134/http://www.naacp.org/news/entry/naacp-delegates-vote-to-repudiate-racist-elements-within-the-tea-pary/# |archive-date=July 14, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitbart said he posted the videos in response.  Commentators from each side noted that racial issues were being manipulated for political gain. Imani Perry, a professor at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s Center for [[African American Studies]], said some [[conservative]]s manipulated white fears for political advantage:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think many white Americans are fearful that with Obama in the White House, and the diversity in his appointments, that the racial balance of power is shifting. And that's frightening both because people always are afraid to give up privilege, and because of the prospect of a black-and-brown backlash against a very ugly history. Some liberals have long maintained that racism requires power, and so black people can't be racist. Obama's election undercut the first argument and made the specter of black racism appear more threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JESSE WASHINGTON (AP) &amp;ndash; Jul 21, 2010 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hH57OnCmltq4jI6zGaF2FXyqXRrAD9H3NM201 |title=The Associated Press: Black racism: a real problem, or pure politics? |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reactions to incident and debate about media's role===
After the release of the full video, media outlets across the political spectrum criticized the decision to force Sherrod to resign.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/spectrum/2010/07/21/the-shirley-sherrod-scandal.html|title=The Shirley Sherrod 'Scandal'|date=July 21, 2010|work=Newsweek|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophia-a-nelson/is-shirley-sherrod-the-ro_b_655614.html|title=Is Shirley Sherrod the Rosa Parks of Our Time?|last=Nelson|first=Sophia A.|date=July 22, 2010|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/pat-buchanan-on-shirley-sherrod-white-house-threw-rosa-parks-under-the-bus/ |title=Shirley Sherrod &amp;#124; Rosa Parks &amp;#124; Pat Buchanan |publisher=Mediaite |date=July 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Greenfield]] of [[CBS News]] criticized the role of the 24-hour news, saying, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old [[United Press International]] wire service had a slogan: 'Get it first, but first get it right'. In the wake of the Shirley Sherrod story, it's worth asking whether more and more the second half of that slogan has been dumped into the trash bin.&lt;ref name="CBSGreenfield"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/21/eveningnews/main6700333.shtml|title=Sherrod Story Shows Ugly Side of 24-Hour News|last=Greenfield|first=Jeff|date=21 July 2010|work=CBS Evening News|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
The [[BBC World News|BBC]] commented about "the absurdity of the spin-cycle in which American journalists and politicians are intertwined and about the febrile atmosphere that surrounds any story about race."&lt;ref name="BBC-Connolly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10722121|title=US officials stumble on the firing of Shirley Sherrod|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|date=July 22, 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that, "Politically charged stories often take root online before being shared with a much wider audience on Fox. The television coverage, in turn, puts pressure on other news media outlets to follow up".&lt;ref name="NYT-stolberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html|title=White House Apologizes to Shirley Sherrod|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|author2=Shaila Dewan |author3=Brian Stelter |date=July 22, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mediaite]]'s Steve Krakauer reported that although [[FoxNews.com]] broke the story, it was later reported by other online sites such as the ''[[Atlanta Journal Constitution|Atlanta Journal Constitution's]],'' and that it was repeated by a number of people on various shows and networks.  He noted full coverage by other networks and channels, so Sherrod's resignation was not simply because of the Fox News coverage.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/examining-the-myth-that-fox-news-drove-shirley-sherrod-to-resign/ |title=Fox News - Shirley Sherrod &amp;#124; Coverage &amp;#124; Myth - Resigned |publisher=[[Mediaite]] |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Kurtz]] said in ''The Washington Post'' that the Fox News network, with the exception of brief comments by O'Reilly, did not discuss the story until after Sherrod's resignation was widely reported.&lt;ref name=finger&gt;{{Cite news|title=Finger-pointing at Fox in Shirley Sherrod firing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/22/AR2010072201265.html|author=[[Howard Kurtz]]|publisher=The Washington Post|date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemente of Fox News said that it was a mistake to have put the story on their website before Sherrod's resignation was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40374.html |title=Fox News admits 'a breakdown' on Shirley Sherrod story - Keach Hagey |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] of Fox News, the [[civil rights activist]] the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] said that he regretted that coverage given to the Sherrod incident had overshadowed more important federal actions that month.  The government had settled longstanding claims of racial discrimination in programs of USDA and the Department of Interior. Jackson noted the landmark nature of the national settlements of these cases and that tens of thousands of people benefited from the compensation for previous injustices. He said:
{{quote|[J]ust this past Thursday the black farmers got a [[Pigford v. Glickman|$1.2 billion settlement]], the [American] Indians a $3.2 billion settlement, for race discrimination. We're not discussing all the facts... 100,000 black farmers get no press. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s get no press. We're still arguing about how fast or slow the White House reacted. Also the Spooner's testimony – this white family farmer, Eloise and Mr. Spooner – I thought their stepping up to the plate in alliance with Sherrod was a great news story that none of us should miss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=With: Chris Wallace |url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/rev-jesse-jackson-fallout-firing-shirley-sherrod |title=Rev.

Appearing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' on July 29, President Obama characterized the controversy over Sherrod's firing as a "bogus" one generated by the media; he said his administration overreacted in forcing her out.&lt;ref name=AP20100729 /&gt;

=={{Anchor|Sherrod v. Breitbart}} Defamation lawsuit and settlement==
In February 2011, Sherrod filed a lawsuit in the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]] against Andrew Breitbart, [[Breitbart News]]' [[Larry O'Connor (radio host)|Larry O'Connor]], and a "[[John Doe]]," who, according to the complaint, is "an individual whose identity has been concealed by the other defendants and who, according to defendant Breitbart, was involved in the deceptive editing of the video clip and encouraged its publication with the intent to defame Mrs. Sherrod."&lt;ref name = atgathering/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021406070.html|publisher = [[Washington Post]]|date = February 15, 2011|title = Sherrod vs. Breitbart: Speech wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/02/16/34224.htm|publisher = [[Courthouse News Service]]|date = February 16, 2011|title = Shirley Sherrod Sues Blogger for Defamation|first = Ryan|last = Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memmott"&gt;Mark Memmott, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/02/14/133754438/shirley-sherrod-sues-andrew-breitbart-he-says-bring-it-on Shirley Sherrod Sues Andrew Breitbart; He Says 'Bring It On'], NPR (February 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[complaint (law)|complaint]], Sherrod accused Breitbart of [[defamation]], [[false light]] and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]].&lt;ref name="Memmott"/&gt;  Following Breitbart's death in 2012, Breitbart's [[Estate (law)|estate]] was substituted as a defendant.&lt;ref name="Tillman"&gt;Zoe Tillman, [http://www.nationallawjournal.com/legaltimes/id=1202738718135/Former-USDA-Official-Settles-Defamation-Suit-Against-Breitbart-Estate Former USDA Official Settles Defamation Suit Against Breitbart Estate], ''National Law Journal'' (October 1, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French playing cards''' (''jeu de cartes'') are [[playing cards|cards]] that use the French [[Suit (cards)|suits]] of {{lang|fr|trèfles}} (clovers or clubs {{Clubs}}), {{lang|fr|carreaux}} (tiles or diamonds {{Diams}}), {{lang|fr|cœurs}} (hearts {{Hearts}}), and {{lang|fr|piques}} (pikes or spades {{Spades}}).  Each suit contains three [[face cards]]; the  {{lang|fr|valet}} ([[jack (playing card)|knave or jack]]), the {{lang|fr|dame}} ([[queen (playing card)|lady or queen]]), and the {{lang|fr|roi}} ([[king (playing card)|king]]). Aside from these aspects, decks can include a wide variety of regional and national patterns which often have [[stripped deck|different deck sizes]]. In comparison to [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]], [[Italian playing cards|Italian]], [[German playing cards|German]], and [[Swiss playing cards]], French cards are the most widespread due to the geopolitical, commercial, and cultural influence of France and the United Kingdom in the past two centuries. Other reasons for their popularity were the simplicity of the suit insignia, which simplifies mass production, and the popularity of [[whist]] and [[contract bridge]].

==History==
Playing cards arrived in Europe from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] around 1370 and were already reported in France in 1377. The French suit insignia was derived from German suits around 1480. Between the transition from the suit of bells to tiles there was a suit of crescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most distinguishing features of the French cards is the queen. Mamluk cards and their derivatives, the Latin suited and German suited cards, all have three male face cards. Queens began appearing in Italian [[tarot]] decks in the mid-15th century and some German decks replaced two kings with queens. While other decks abandoned the queen in non-tarot decks, the French kept them and dropped the [[Knight (playing card)|knight]] as the middle face card. Face card design was heavily influenced by Spanish cards that used to circulate in France. One of the most obvious traits inherited from Spain are the standing kings; kings from Italian, Portuguese, or Germanic cards are seated. Spanish-suited cards are still used in France, mostly in [[Northern Catalonia]], and [[Brittany]] and the [[Vendée]] with the latter two using the archaic [[Aluette]] cards.

In the 19th century, corner indices and rounded corners were added and cards became reversible, relieving players from having to flip face cards right side up. The index for [[ace]]s and face cards usually follow the local language but many decks of the Paris pattern use the numeral "1" for aces.

==Current standard patterns==
The French suited deck has spawned many regional variations known as standard patterns based on their artwork and deck size. The Paris pattern was heavily exported throughout continental Europe which is why most French-suited patterns share a similar appearance. The English pattern, based on the extinct Rouennais pattern, is the most well known pattern in the world.

Note that patterns do not factor in [[Joker (playing card)|Jokers]] as they are a very recent addition which leads to every manufacturer making their own trademarked depiction of this card. Almost all 52-card packs produced in the present will contain at least two jokers unless otherwise noted.

===Paris pattern===

The Paris pattern came to dominate in France around 1780 and became known as the {{lang|fr|portrait officiel}}. From the 19th century to 1945, the appearance of the cards used for domestic consumption was regulated by the French government. All cards were produced on watermarked paper made by the state to show payment of the [[stamp duty|stamp tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/bgp.html Belgian-Genoese pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common deck sold in France is the 32-card deck with the 2 to 6 removed and 1s as the index for aces. 52-card decks are also popular. The French have a unique habit of associating their face cards with historic or mythical personages which survives only in the ''portrait officiel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=John|title=The History of the Paris Pattern|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1984|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgian-Genoese and Piedmontese patterns====
[[File:King of hearts (Belgian pattern).jpg|thumb|100px|Belgian pattern king of hearts]]
The '''Belgian-Genoese pattern''' is very similar to its Parisian parent and is basically an export version not subject to France's domestic stamp tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/bgp.html Belgian-Genoese pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea. [http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards21.htm Belgian and Genoese cards] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The jack of clubs has a triangular shield bearing the coat of arms of the former [[Spanish Netherlands]], face cards are unnamed, and blue is usually replaced with green in the portraits. The diagonal dividing line also lacks the beads. When the [[Ottoman Empire]] relaxed the ban against playing cards, Belgian type cards flooded their territory and is now found throughout the Balkans, North Africa, and the Middle East. They are also commonly found in France's former colonies. Within Belgium, the Francophone [[Walloons]] are the primary users of this pattern, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] prefer the Dutch pattern. This is the second most common pattern in the world after the English pattern. Belgian decks come in either 32 or 52 cards like in France. 

Genoese type cards are identical to Belgian ones but lack corner indices. They come in 36 (no 2s to 5s), 40 (no 8s to 10s), or 52 card decks. 

The '''Piedmontese pattern''' is similar to the Genoese packs but its face cards have a horizontal instead of diagonal dividing line and the aces are found in a decorative garland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altacarta.com/english/collect/suits/french/piemontesi.html The Piemont Pattern] at Alta Carta. Retrieved 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/italy/piedmont Piedmont Type] at the World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 20 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; They also come in the same number of cards as Genoese ones. The Piedmontese pattern was once used in neighboring [[Savoy]] as both were [[Savoyard state|previously united]] until France annexed the latter in 1860. A 78 card tarot version of the Piedmontese pattern, complete with knights, [[The Fool (Tarot card)|the fool]], a suit of [[Trump (card games)|trumps]] depicting flowers, and corner indices, was printed in 1902 for Savoyard players. It was discontinued some time after 1910 but reproductions have been in print since 1984. The [[Chambéry]] rules that come with the deck are similar to Piedmontese tarot games but the ace ranked between the jack and the 10 like in [[Triomphe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack Volume I|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=174-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Tarot, jeu et magie|date=1984|publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]|location=Paris|pages=125-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.trionfi.eu/WWPCM/decks05/d02108/d02108.htm "Tarot Francais des Fleurs"] at the World Web Playing Card Museum. Retrieved 20 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the Italian-suited [[Tarocco Piemontese|Piedmontese tarot]].

====Bavarian derivatives====
A Parisian variant appeared in Bavaria in the mid-18th century where the king of diamonds wore a [[turban]]. This originates from the [[German playing cards#Southern|German-suited Old Bavarian pattern]]. The king of spades, who used to represent David, no longer holds a harp. This group is closely associated with [[animal tarot]]s.

[[File:Атласная колода экстра король черви.jpg|thumb|100px|Russian pattern king of hearts]]
The '''Russian pattern''' created during the early 19th-century is based on a Baltic version of a Bavarian derivative.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Sylvia. (1990) All Cards on the Table. Leinfelden: Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum. pp. 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Adam. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/russia/ollis Russian Standard Playing Cards] at World of Playing Cards.

Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The current appearance was finalized by [[Adolf Charlemagne]]. It usually contains 52 or 36 cards, the latter lacking ranks 2 to 5. The stripped deck is used to play [[Durak]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/national/russia.html Card Games in Russia] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in many countries that were once part of the [[Russian Empire]] or [[Soviet Union]].

'''Adler-Cego''' is the last remaining [[animal tarot]] and is used in Germany's [[Black Forest]] to play [[Cego]]. The courts are based off a Frankfurt version of a Bavarian derivative.&lt;ref name="Cego"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=83, 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. Real and fictional animals are displayed on the trump suit but despite its name, eagles do not appear. Trumps have a pink panel in each end with an Arabic numeral to show its rank.

The '''[[Industrie und Glück]]''' (Industry and Luck) [[Tarot card games|tarock]] deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is organized in the same manner as the Adler-Cego decks. Its trumps abandoned the traditional allegorical motifs found in Italian tarocchi decks in favor of new, more whimsical scenes like depictions of rural life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-16.html Austrian Tarock Type C] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 20 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The turban wearing king is now in the suit of spades.

====Hamburg derivatives====
French-suited cards are popular in Central Europe and compete very well against local [[German playing cards]]. [[Hamburg]] was once a major card-producing hub where makers began revising the Paris pattern. The patterns in this family have the king of spades keeping David's harp.

[[Image:Doppelkopfblatt franzoesisches Bild.jpg|thumb|North-German pattern ([[Doppelkopf]] deck)]]
The '''North-German pattern''' was created in Stralsund from a Hamburg derivative. It is often erroneously called the Berlin pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-59.html North-German pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 10 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The crownless queens' hairstyles reflect the [[Biedermeier]] fashions of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/germany/ass/north-german-pattern North German pattern]. Retrieved 5 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually in decks of 32 cards with the twos to sixes missing since [[skat (card game)|skat]], Germany's most popular card game, does not require a full deck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altacarta.com/english/collect/suits/french/berlin.html Berlin pattern] at Alta Carta. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Decks of 36 cards (with the sixes) are for [[jass]] and [[tapp (card game)|tapp]], a game played in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Decks of 52 cards usually include three jokers but [[Zwickern]] decks have six jokers. 

The '''French-Swiss pattern''' shares the same descent from the North-German pattern's Hamburg parent but their most distinguishing characteristic is that instead of having corner indices, white Arabic numerals are found within the pips closest to the corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-60.html French-Swiss pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

[[File:4kingsPRL.png|thumb|150px|Dondorf Rhineland pattern kings]]
Around 1870, Dondorf of Frankfurt produced the Rhineland pattern. The kings have very thick beards. They have fallen out of popularity in Germany but are very common in Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the [[Baltic states]]. They come in decks of 24 (no 2s to 8s), 32 (no 2s to 6s), or 52 cards, the latter of which may have up to three jokers in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/donrhine.html Dondorf Rhineland pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

====Tarot Nouveau====
The [[Tarot Nouveau]] was designed by C.L. Wüst of Frankfurt in the mid-19th century. It is popular in Francophone Europe and Quebec and is also used in Denmark to play tarot games that require the full 78-card deck. Like the [[Industrie und Glück]], the trumps depict genre scenes but modern editions use Arabic numerals instead of Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-18.html Bourgeois Tarot] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]].

====Modern Swedish pattern====
Swedes used to use Bavarian derived patterns. In the early 20th-century, the firm Öberg &amp; Son invented a new pattern unrelated to the old ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Sylvia. (1990).

===English pattern===
[[Image:King of Hearts Ruen pattern comparison.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Evolution of the king of hearts from the Rouennais to English pattern]]
Card makers from [[Rouen]] began exporting to England around 1480.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-48.html English pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Latin-suited cards were already circulating in England, the English renamed French suits to the Latin ones with which they were familiar. Hence the clovers were called clubs and pikes were named after the swords (''spade''). The English did not start producing their own cards until a century later. In 1628, the importation of foreign playing cards was banned to protect local manufacturers. English cardmakers produced lower quality cards than their continental counterparts leading to the loss of detail from the Rouennais pattern. Today's pattern is the result of Charles Goodall and Son's reworking of the old Rouen pattern during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Adam.

The series will be produced by [[Mentorn|Mentorn Media]] and the Bikers' first interactive [[iOS]] app, also produced by Mentorn, will be released to accompany the series.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

''The evil Scylla is back and this time has found a way to make herself the most powerful witch of all time and take over the world. For this, she requires very rare black diamonds, which are to be found on the jungle island where the Kikurians live. She takes them all prisoner and forces them to work day and night in search of black diamonds. The elder King Kikurian asks Hugo the troll to liberate the slaves and stop Scylla's plot before it is too late. When Fernando arrives a letter from King Kikurian, Hugo reads it, but finds poor King Kikurian imprisoned in a cell and unable to help his people, and has absolutely no time to waste. Can Hugo free all the slaves and stop Scylla's plot?''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The '''Katherine Dunham Company''', a troupe of dancers, singers, actors and musicians, was the first African-American [[modern dance]] company. It descended from '''Ballet Nègre''', a student troupe founded in 1930 by [[Katherine Dunham]], which later became the '''Negro Dance Group'''.

The company had successful runs on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in other major American cities. In a ''[[The New York Times]]'' review on February 19, 1940, dance critic [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]] wrote: "Her performance with her group last Sunday at the Windsor Theatre may very well become a historic occasion, for certainly never before in all efforts of recent years to establish Negro dance as a serious medium has there been so convincing and authoritative an approach."&lt;ref&gt;John Martin, "The Dance: A Negro Art", ''New York Times'', February 19, 1940. Quoted in [http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/awia/chicago.pdf "City of Lake and Wind"], ''Chicago Renaissance'', p. 19. Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molly E. Christie Gonzalez, [http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=dns_theses "Katherine Dunham Technique and Philosophy: A Holistic Dance Pedagogy"] (2015). Dance Master’s Theses. Paper 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1940s Dunham took her troupe on a series of highly acclaimed world tours. The Dunham Company helped launch the career of many [[African-American]] performers of the day. Dunham alumni include [[Alvin Ailey]], [[Rosalie King]], [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Walter Nicks]]. Today you can find classes in Dunham Technique taught in [[New York City]] at both the [[92nd Street Y|92nd Street YMHA]] and at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]], by former company member Dana McBroom-Manno. McBroom-Manno was a featured dancer in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s production of ''[[Aida]]'', choreographed by Katherine Dunham, the first African-American choreographer at the Met since [[Hemsley Winfield]] set the dances for ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' in 1933. 

Successful revues included the universally acclaimed ''[[Bal Nègre]]'' (1946).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8375">The '''Macalester Plymouth United Church Hymn Contest''' is a highly regarded annual search for new [[hymns]] instituted by a leading [[Minnesota]] congregation which is a union of the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) and the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Contest At Minn. Church Brings New Hymns'', The Associated Press; Mar. 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 1996, Macalester Plymouth United Church of [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], has sponsored a hymn-writing contest seeking new hymn texts that "can motivate the church to be more actively involved in social reform."  The St. Paul contest is funded with an endowment by A.A. "Al" Heckman, a church member who was widely known as Minnesota’s “Dean of [[Philanthropy]]” who died in 1994.

The longest-running [[English language]] hymn contest attracts entries from the [[United States]] and the rest of the English-speaking world, including [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].  In church hymn circles, the hymn contest has acquired a level of importance capable of elevating a previously unknown artist to international prominence and providing deserved recognition of established hymn writers.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.macalester-plymouth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1978. He has appeared on numerous television specials and performs regularly throughout the U.S. He has appeared on the cover of [[The Linking Ring]].&lt;ref name="cover"/&gt;

==Biography==
After spending part of his early career as a close-up magician and a children's performer at a [[theme park]], Finney decided to concentrate strictly on comedy magic.

Once a comedy finalist on the television program ''[[Star Search]]'', Finney was nominated for 'Magician of the Year' by the [[Magic Castle]] nightclub in [[Los Angeles]], performed at the 2004 Inaugural Gala for President [[George W Bush]], and received the Silver Lion Head award for excellence in comedy and magic from magicians [[Siegfried and Roy]].&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===NBC===
Once a regular performer on [[NBC]]'s ''World's Greatest Magicians'' and ''World's Wildest Magic'' shows, Finney now performs primarily one day corporate events, charity events, and at [[casino]]s.

Finney is one of only a few magicians with their own foundation —- the Michael Finney Foundation to benefit firefighters and the Pappas School for homeless children. In eight years, his foundation donated over $400,000 to his causes, according to Finney's estimate. He stated in a recent interview that he is now also associated with the [[Gift of Life]], a [[Rotarian]] group that provides assistance and operations for children with heart problems.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; He is currently involved with the Wounded Warriors program, having contributed almost a million dollars through his foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Mr. Finney himself on the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''Music and political warfare''' have been used together in many different political contexts and cultures as a way to reach a targeted audience in order to deliver a specific political message. [[Political warfare]] as defined by Paul A. Smith is the "use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will... commonly through the use of words, images and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Paul A. On Political War, National Defense University Press, 1989, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music]] is useful because it creates an easily recognizable and memorable method of delivery for the desired message. Music is particularly useful medium for the delivery of [[propaganda]].  Jacques Ellul stated that for propaganda to be effective it must "fill the citizen's whole day and every day".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul. ''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes''. Vintage Books, 1965, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Since music is often viewed to be a leisure activity, it is often not considered to be as threatening as other [[propaganda techniques]], and as a result messages can often be surreptitiously communicated without being conspicuously noticed.

==American Revolution==
During the [[American Revolution]], songs and poems were a very popular form of satire and also served as a medium for sharing the news and gossip of the day. As a result, many of the battles and skirmishes between the Americans and the British were retold and celebrated in the form of songs. [[Samuel Adams]] utilized music and protest songs in the mass public demonstrations he organized to protest British practices towards the American colonists&lt;ref&gt;J.Michael Waller. ''Propaganda the American Way'' &lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:intlist-jmw-propaganda-article.pdf]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After a humiliating retreat for the British-during which time the Americans engaged in the "ungentlemanly" act of firing at the backs of their retreating enemy -the British were immortalized in song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How brave you went out with muskets all bright, 
&lt;br /&gt;And thought to befrighten the folks with the sight;
&lt;br /&gt;But when you got there how they powder’d your pums, 
&lt;br /&gt;And all the way home how they pepper’d your bums, 
&lt;br /&gt;And is it not, honies, a comical farce,
&lt;br /&gt;To be proud in the face, and be shot in the arse.&lt;ref&gt;J.Michael Waller, ''Founding Political Warfare Documents of the American Revolution'', Crossbow Press, 2009, p 297&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps the most well known song to emerge during this time was [[Yankee Doodle]]. Originally conceived by the British in an attempt to mock and demoralize the ragged American troops, it was instead adopted by the Americans as a rallying anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt; In the language of the day, "doodle" referred to a fool or simpleton while "dandy" meant a gentleman of highly exaggerated dress and manners.&lt;ref name="yankee-doodle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/music/yankee-doodle.htm |title=Yankee Doodle Dandy - The Music of Early America |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the term "macaroni" was a type of dress popular in Italy and widely imitated in England at the time.&lt;ref name="yankee-doodle"/&gt; The song mocked the American's ragged and rough style of dress in comparison to the British armies distinct formal "red coat" uniform and portrayed the Americans as backwards and ignorant, a portrayal the Americans openly accepted. Thus instead of demoralizing the Americans, Yankee Doodle instead had the opposite effect of demoralizing the British who were later defeated by this army of "backwards and ignorant" individuals.

==Nazi Germany==
One group who understood the role that music played in spreading their political message was the Nazis in Hitler's Germany. Clearly understanding the link between music and political warfare, propaganda minister Josef Goebbels once stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Music affects the heart and emotions more than the intellect.  Where then could the heart of a nation beat stronger than in the huge masses, in which the heart of a nation has found its true home?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/ |title=Music and the Holocaust: General Overview |publisher=Holocaustmusic.ort.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitler made use of music glorifying Germanic legends, such as the works of Richard Wagner. Wagner's operas employed imagery of knights which Hitler then co-opted for images of himself &lt;ref&gt;Arnold Perris. Music as Propaganda: Art to Persuade, Art to Control. Greenwood Press, 1985, p52&lt;/ref&gt;

Music was used within the Hitler Youth organization as a way to indoctrinate the youth of Germany into the Nazi's ideology. As part of their activities, group singing was a way to educate the young members of the group. According to an internal memo, songs were seen as "possess[ing] the strongest community building power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/music-hitler-youth/ |title=Music and the Holocaust: Music amongst the Hitler Youth |publisher=Holocaustmusic.ort.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communism==
Communist states such as the USSR and China have also utilized music as a way to spread their message of global communism. The [[Soviet Union]] sought to control the negative influences of music on the people and attempted to shape the messages being used in music to glorify the Soviet regime. Throughout Communist rule, the state sought to create legislation that in effect controlled the creative output of musicians and composers by limiting musical education, controlling which musicians could be employed and by only allowing "approved" musical performances-in short ensuring that all music was within keeping with Communist principles and ideology.&lt;ref name="Perris"&gt;Arnold Perris. M''usic as Propaganda: Art to Persuade, Art to Control''. Greenwood Press, 1985,72.&lt;/ref&gt; Songs were often used in the revolutionary period because they could be easily shaped to have explicit and revolutionary messages set to a simple melody.&lt;ref name="Perris"/&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] believed that it was essential to employ national music in order to "reeducate" the Chinese people and make them accept Communist reforms. Mao stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;
"in music you may apply appropriate foreign principles and use foreign musical instruments. But still there must be national characteristics...The arts are inseparable from the customs, feelings and even the language of the people, from the history of the nation"&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In China under Mao's rule it became essential to re-educate artists and composers to turn away from traditional operas that often portrayed imperial China and espoused Buddhist and Confucian morals in their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 95&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Communist Party established an academy for the arts in Yan'an in 1937 which was intended to "rectify" the people of the arts and instruct them on how to incorporate the themes and objectives of the Communist Party into their works&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

What has been seen in these countries however, does not conform with Communist views on art and artistic expression before the international Communist movement came to be under the rule of Stalinist bureaucracy.

==Other modern uses==
In [[Uzbekistan]] there has been an increase in television programming that seeks to convey the regime's political and ideological messages. As a way to counter growing [[Islamic fundamentalism]], Uzbek television programming has vilified Islamists through the use of pop videos by a group called [[Setora]], a trio dubbed the "Tashkent Spice Girls".&lt;ref name="Asian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aslan |first=Chris |url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/509 |title=MILITARY MUSIC VIDEOS AS UZBEK POP PROPAGANDA &amp;#124; Central Asia-Caucasus Institute Analyst |publisher=Cacianalyst.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setora's music video tells the story of a young soldier, the boyfriend of one of three girls, who is sent away on a military assignment away from his loved one. Intertwined with this story are scenes of a mother and her children being taken captive by a highly caricatured Islamic extremist. As the video continues the soldier sweeps in to the rescue of the family, dying a hero in the process.&lt;ref name="Asian"/&gt; The imagery of  a mother is often used as a symbol for the state and in this case the state must be protected and preserved from the threat of Islamic extremism.

The banning of music itself can also be a method of political warfare. This was the case in Afghanistan while the [[Taliban]] held power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrqUtwRti4QvO8X4_bShYsGbg2wQ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516064046/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrqUtwRti4QvO8X4_bShYsGbg2wQ |date=May 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the insurgency in southern Somalia, the Islamist group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] also banned music on radio stations it controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/somalia-rebels-clash-in-air-wars/?page=2 |title=Somalia, rebels clash in air wars |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel outfits were seeking to establish Sharia law within the country and saw eliminating music as a way to purge society of what they deemed "evil actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041604894_2.html?sid=ST2010041604944 |title=For Somalis caught between Islamists and weak government, fleeing is only option |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and public diplomacy==
Music has also been used as a successful tool for [[public diplomacy]], the so-called "softer" side of political warfare. One common technique employed by the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA), once the center of the United States' entire public diplomacy strategy, was to arrange for musical exchanges. This was often done by scheduling tours of notable American musicians to foreign countries, especially those under Communist regimes, as a way to expose the average citizen to Americans and their culture.

Another way that American music was used in public diplomacy was through radio programming on the [[Voice of America]]. Willis Conover's "Music USA" jazz programming that exposed foreign audiences to American jazz music through songs, interviews with artists and musicians as well as Conover's color commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jul03/dizard.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713045610/http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jul03/dizard.pdf |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Music USA" soon became one of VOA's most popular programs.

== History ==
New Image College was founded in 1980 by the Canadian-born husband and wife team Bill and Charlotte Dyck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taborhome.org/about-us/board-of-directors/bill-dyck.php|title=Bill Dyck {{!}} Tabor Village|website=www.taborhome.org|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were extensively trained as [[Physiology|clinical marriage and family physiologist]], with years of [[Philanthropy|philanthropy work]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yfccanada.org/|title=Youth for Christ Canada|website=yfccanada.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; within [[British Columbia|BC]] and around the world, specifically [[India]] and [[China]]. The pair conceived New Image with the goal of providing an opportunity for abused women to develop a "new image" for themselves.

Initially focusing on [[fashion design]], etiquette courses, and self-confidence seminars, the business was considerably expanded when it was taken over by their daughter, [[Charie Van Dyke]].

Under the guidance of New Image College President Van Dyke and her husband, Vice President John Craig, the business would develop into one of the most respected and successful private academies in Canada, boasting over 25,000 alumni.

As of 2016, New Image has expanded even further after acquiring their 'Creative Arts Campus' on the corner of [[Granville Street|Granville and Nelson]].

New Image College recently rebranded itself with the name "NIC" alongside the launch of its NIC Spa line.&lt;ref name="Home - NICSpa"/&gt; The NIC Spa on Granville, a private branch of Global Model &amp; Talent, provides opportunities for alumni of New Image College's [[aesthetics]] program to begin their [[small business]]es through the college's Entrepreneurial Program.

'''Nyhavn''' ({{IPA-da|ˈnyhɑwˀn}}; New Harbour) is a 17th-century waterfront, canal and entertainment district in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Stretching from [[Kongens Nytorv]] to the harbour front just south of the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]], it is lined by brightly coloured 17th and early 18th century [[townhouse]]s and bars, cafes and restaurants. The canal harbours many historical wooden ships.

==History==
Nyhavn was constructed by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]] from 1670 to 1673, dug by Swedish prisoners of war from the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–1660)|Dano-Swedish War 1658–1660]]. It is a gateway from the sea to the old inner city at [[Kongens Nytorv]] (King's Square), where ships handled cargo and fishermens' catch. It was notorious for beer, sailors, and prostitution. Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] lived at Nyhavn for some 18 years.

The first bridge across Nyhavn opened on [[1875 in Denmark|6 February 1875]].

As ocean-going ships grew larger, Nyhavn was taken over by internal Danish small vessel freight traffic. After World War II land transport took over this role and small vessel traffic disappeared from the Port of Copenhagen, leaving Nyhavn largely deserted of ships.

In the mid-1960s, the Nyhavn Society (Danish: Nyhavnsforeningen) was founded with the aim of revitalising the area. In 1977, Nyhavn was inaugurated as a veteran ship and museum harbour by Copenhagen’s Lord Mayor [[Egon Weidekamp]]. In 1980 Nyhavn quay was [[pedestrianised]]; it had been used as a parking area in the previous years which had coincided with a dwindling of harbour activities.&lt;ref name=publicspaces &gt;{{cite book |last1=Gehl |first1=Jan |last2=Gemzøe |first2=Lars |title=Public Spaces, Public Life, Copenhagen |year=1996 |isbn=877-407-305-2 |publisher=The Danish Architectural Press and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, serving the function of a square according to architects [[Jan Gehl]] and Lars Gemzøe.&lt;ref name=publicspaces /&gt;

==Buildings==
[[File:Nyhavn, Copenhagen, Denmark.jpg|thumb|600 px|Panorama of north side of Nyhavn]]
The northern side of Nyhavn is lined by brightly coloured townhouses built with wood, bricks, and plaster. The oldest house, at No. 9, dates from 1681.

Between 1845 and 1864, [[Hans Christian Andersen]] lived at No. 67, where a memorial plaque now stands. From 1871-1875 Andersen lived at Nyhavn 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visithcandersen.dk/nyhavn_18.htm/ |title=Nyhavn 18 |work=H. C. Andersen Information |accessdate=31 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416161134/http://www.visithcandersen.dk/nyhavn_18.htm |archivedate=16 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which currently houses an Andersen-themed souvenir shop.

The southern side of Nyhavn has lavish mansions lining the canal, including [[Charlottenborg Palace]] at the corner of Kongens Nytorv.

==Veteran Ship and Museum Harbour==
[[File:Nyhavn pano.jpg|thumb|600 px|Panorama looking across Nyhavn, from south side to north, with the lightship in foreground, and other museum ships]]
Nyhavn Veteran Ship and Museum Harbour, occupying the inner section of Nyhavn, between the Nyhavn Bridge and Kongens Nytorv, is lined with old ships. From the foundation of the heritage harbour in 1977, the south side of the canal has been reserved for museum ships owned by the [[National Museum of Denmark|Danish National Museum]], which received a donation of carefully restored ships from [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|A. P. Møller]], while the northern side of the canal was put at the disposal of the Nyhavn Society and privately owned, still usable wooden ships.
Harbor ships include:
* ''[[Lightvessel Gedser Rev|Lightvessel XVII Gedser Rev]]'' – [[lightvessel]] built in [[Odense]] in 1895, in operation until 1972, then acquired by the National Museum and now serving as a museum ship.
* ''Svalan af Nyhavn'' – galease built in Jungfrusund in 1924
* ''Anna Møller'' – galease built in [[Randers]] in 1906
* ''MA-RI'' – purpose-built smuggling ship built in 1920; [[Boarding (attack)|boarded]] by custom authorities off [[Helsingør|Elsinore]] with smuggling goods aboard in 1923, then confiscated and sold on auction, then operated both as a fishing vessel and as a ferry between [[Poland]] and [[Bornholm]], again as a smuggling vessel.
* ''Mira'' – two-masted [[schooner]] built in [[Fåborg]] in 1898, considered one of the finest ships of the Danish small vessel traffic of the time. For many years it transported [[chalk]] from [[Stevns Peninsula|Stevns]]. The first ship on the north side of Nyhavn, coming from Kongens Nytorv.
* ''[[Bådteatret|The Boat Theatre]]'' - a [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]]-type [[barge]] built in Copenhagen in 1898, since 1972 operated as a theatre boat.

==The Memorial Anchor==
[[Image:Anker Nyhavn.jpg|right|thumb|The Memorial Anchor at the end of Nyhavn]]
The great Memorial Anchor (Danish: Mindeankeret) at the end of Nyhavn, where it meets Kongens Nytorv, is a monument commemorating the more than 1,700 Danish officers and sailors in service for the [[Royal Danish Navy|Navy]], merchant fleet or [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], who sacrificed their lives during [[World War II]]. The Anchor was inaugurated in 1951, replacing a temporary wooden cross erected on the spot in 1945, and has a plaque with a monogram of King [[Frederik VII of Denmark|Frederik VII]] on it. The Memorial Anchor is from 1872 and was used on the Frigate Fyn (Funen), which was docked at [[Holmen naval base|Holmen Naval Base]] during the Second World War. Every year on May 5 – Denmark’s Liberation day 1945 – an official ceremony is held to honour and commemorate the fallen at the Memorial Anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-Nyhavn.htm |title=Nyhavn |work=Copenhagen Portal |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bars and restaurants==
[[Image:Nyhavn 24-6-2003.JPG|right|thumb|Bars and restaurants lining the northern, sunny side of Nyhavn]]
Along its northern, sunnier side, Nyhavn is lined with bars and restaurants facing the harbor.  Nyhavn serves as a hub of canal tours.

==Transport==
[[Kongens Nytorv station|Kongens Nytorv metro station]] is located at the end of Nyhavn, though situated at the far end of the namesake square outside [[Magasin du Nord]]. The station is served by both lines [[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]] and [[M2 (Copenhagen)|M2]] of the [[Copenhagen Metro]].

The [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses]] has a stop at the mouth of Nyhavn. All four routes of the harbour buses, [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#901 &amp; 902|Routes 901, 902]], [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#903|903]] and [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#904|904]], stop at the bus stop next to the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]].

In 2016 the [[Inderhavnsbroen|Inner Harbor Bridge]] (Inderhavnsbro) connecting Nyhavn and Christianshavn was opened after years of setbacks and delays. The 180 m cycling and pedestrian [[drawbridge]] has been nicknamed the Kissing Bridge because its contour resembles two tongues meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Surprise!

{{see also|Political theatre}}
A '''political drama''' can describe a [[Theatre|play]], [[film]] or [[TV program]] that has a [[politics|political]] component, whether reflecting the author's political opinion, or describing a [[politician]] or series of political events.

[[Dramatist]]s who have written political dramas include [[Aaron Sorkin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/bio|title=Aaron Sorkin|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/dramatist-aaron-sorkin-1012873/|title=The Dramatist: How Aaron Sorkin Made Politics Entertaining|date=2009-12-07|work=TVGuide.com|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Caryl Churchill]], and [[Federico García Lorca]].

==Television==
[[Television series]] that have been classified as political dramas include ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]'', ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]'', ''[[Jack and Bobby]]'', ''[[The Bold Ones: The Senator]]'', ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'', ''House of Cards'' ([[House of Cards (UK TV series)|UK]] and [[House of Cards (US TV series)|US]] versions), ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'' and ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]''.

''[[The Good Wife]]'' can also be considered a political drama, especially in its critically acclaimed [[The Good Wife (season 2)|second season]] and [[The Good Wife (season 5)|fifth season]]. Races for political office, including [[state's attorney]], [[Governor (United States)|governor]], and even a Presidential run, move in and out of the show's narrative and the story of its main character, Alicia Florrick. However, Alicia's primary profession as a litigator for the most part takes precedence in the narrative, and so the show more often focuses on her cases and related office politics, making it primarily a [[legal drama]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Film==
There have been notables films that have been labeled as political dramas such as ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]''. A famous literary political drama which later made the transition to film was Robert Penn Warren's ''[[All the King's Men]]''.

The '''Pripyat amusement park''' is an [[abandonment (legal)|abandoned]] [[amusement park]] located in [[Pripyat]], [[Ukraine]]. It was to be opened for the first time on 1 May 1986, in time for the [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/17/pripyat-chernobyl-30th-anniversary/82897578/|title=Pillaged and peeling, radiation-ravaged Pripyat welcomes 'extreme' tourists|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pacific Standard |url=https://psmag.com/chernobyl-in-spring-c02246829e3c#.kjqfe07e7 |title=Chernobyl in Spring — Pacific Standard |publisher=Psmag.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these plans were cancelled on 26 April, when the [[Chernobyl disaster]] occurred a few kilometers away. Several sources report that the park was opened for a short time on 27 April before the announcement to evacuate the city was made,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= |title=Bioterrorism with CD-ROM: Psychological and Public Health Interventions|authors=Robert J.

Retrieved 1 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;). In any case, the park—and its [[Ferris wheel]] in particular—have become a symbol of the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJhKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA226|title=Why We Need Nuclear Power: The Environmental Case|first=Michael H.|last=Fox|date=2014|publisher=OUP USA|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractions ==
Constructed under the [[Soviet Union]] as a "[[:ru:Парк культуры и отдыха|Парк культуры и отдыха]]" (Park of Culture and Rest) typical of many large cities in the then Soviet Union, the amusement park's attractions were manufactured by the [[Yeysk]]-based firm "[[:ru:Аттракцион (завод)|Аттракцион]]" (Attraction), who were responsible for the construction of many of the amusement parks which remain to be seen around the former Soviet Union today in various states of repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Аттракцион_(завод)|title=Аттракцион (завод)|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

Located north-west to the Palace of Culture in the center of Pripyat, the park had five attractions:
* The iconic 26m [[Ferris wheel]] "Круговой обзор" ('Circular Overview')
* [[Bumper cars]] "Автодром" ('Autodrome')
* [[paratrooper (ride)|Paratrooper ride]] "Ромашка" ('Chamomile')
* [[Swing boats]] "Русские качели" ('Russian Swing')
* The park also contains a carnival shooting game{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;br&gt;
The successor to the original company are still manufacturing the Ferris wheel, paratrooper and bumper cars to largely unaltered designs as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attractions.ru|title=Аттракцион - Инвест: аттракционы.|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiation ==
Radiation levels around the park vary. The liquidators washed radiation into the soil after the helicopters carrying radioactive materials used the grounds as a landing strip, so concreted areas are relatively safe. However, areas where moss has built can emit up to 25000 µSv/h, among the highest level of radiation in the whole of Pripyat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grahamgilmore.com/chernobyl/ Article on Chernobyl by Graham Gilmore]. Retrieved 31 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films, games, media and literature ==
The park plays significant roles in the video games ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', and the film ''[[Chernobyl Diaries]]''.

The park plays significant roles too in the [[Markiyan Kamysh]] novel about [[Disaster tourism|Chernobyl illegal trips]], ''A Stroll to the Zone''.

The Ferris wheel made news in September 2017 when Polish tourists turned it mechanically for the first time since 1986, later returning it to its original position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tsn.ua/video/video-novini/v-pokinutiy-prip-yati-bilya-chornobilya-zapustili-koleso-oglyadu.html|title=В покинутій Прип'яті біля Чорнобиля запустили колесо огляду|author=|date=14 September 2017|publisher=TCH|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park appeared in [[Suede (band)|Suede]]'s music video clip, "[[The Blue Hour (album)|Life Is Golden]]".

==Procedure==
Although psychic surgery varies by region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without the use of a surgical instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of his/her fingers against the patient's skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner's hands appear to penetrate into the patient's body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient's body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient's skin showing no wounds or scars.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;

Most cases do not involve actual surgery although some practitioners make real incisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Spence| first = Lewis | title = Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology Vol. 2| publisher = Kessinger Publishing Co| year = 2003| pages = 750| isbn = 978-0-7661-2817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of the world where belief in evil spirits is prevalent, practitioners will sometimes exhibit objects, such as glass, explaining that the foreign bodies were placed in the patient's body by evil spirits.&lt;ref name="pmid2110023" /&gt;

==History==
Accounts of [[psychic]] surgery started to  appear in the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] communities of the [[Philippines]] and [[Brazil]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nevill Drury|Drury, Nevill]]. (2002). ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: Over 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions''. Watkins Publishing. p. 259. {{ISBN|1-84293-041-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the procedure was first noticed in the 1940s, when performed routinely by [[Eleuterio Terte]]. Terte and his pupil [[Tony Agpaoa]], who was apparently associated with the ''[[Union Espiritista Christiana de Filipinas]]'' (The Christian Spiritist Union of the Philippines), trained others in this procedure.&lt;ref name="pmid2110023" /&gt;

In 1959, the procedure came to the attention of the  U. S. public after the publication of ''[[Into the Strange Unknown]]'' by [[Ron Ormond]] and [[Ormond McGill]]. The authors called the practice "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]al surgery,"  and wrote "[we] still don’t know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn’t the work of any normal magician, and could very well be just what the Filipinos said it was — a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon."&lt;ref name="ISU"&gt;{{Cite book

In "...1973, a group of medical doctors, scientists, and parapsychologists visited the Philippine Islands to study a phenomenon that was causing increased furor amongst health professionals ... Filipino psychic surgeons, also known as spiritual/magnetic healers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Stephen H.|last2=Malony|first2=H.

[[Alex Orbito]], who became well known in the United States through his association with actress [[Shirley MacLaine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Filipino psychic takes Indians for a ride - By N. Bhanutej|publisher=The Week (India)|date=September 8, 2002|accessdate=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one said practitioner of the procedure. On June 14, 2005, Orbito was  arrested by Canadian authorities and indicted for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filipinoreporter.com/archive/3327/headline03.htm |title=The Filipino Reporter |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Jan 20, 2006, the charges were dropped as it then seemed unlikely that Orbito would be convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filipinoreporter.com/archive/3424/headline05.htm |title=The Filipino Reporter |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychic surgery made U.S. [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines in March 1984 when entertainer [[Andy Kaufman]], diagnosed with [[large cell]] [[carcinoma]] (a rare [[lung cancer]]), traveled to the Philippines for a six-week course of psychic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.benatural.org/psychic-surgery.html |title= Psychic Surgery |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioner Jun Labo claimed to have removed large cancerous tumors and Kaufman declared he believed this cancer had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2000). ''From the Wandering Jew to William F. Buckley Jr: On Science, Literature, and Religion''. Prometheus Books. pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman died from renal failure as consequence of a [[metastasis|metastatic]] lung cancer, on May 16, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.com/ca/death/search.cgi California Death Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The origins of the practice in [[Brazil]] are obscure; but by the late 1950s "[[Energy medicine|spiritual healers]]" were practicing in the country. Many of them were associated with [[Spiritism]], a major [[spiritualism|spiritualistic]] movement in [[Brazil]] and claimed to be performing their operations merely as [[Mediumship|channels]] for spirits of deceased medical doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Stemman, Roy. (1976). ''The Supernatural''. Danbury Press. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YO" /&gt;

A known Brazilian psychic healer who routinely practiced psychic surgery was [[Zé Arigó]], who claimed to be channeling for a deceased medical doctor of name [[Dr. Fritz]]. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare-handed, Arigó used a non-surgical blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Arigo,%20Jose.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711050748/http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Arigo,%20Jose.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-11 |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — Arigó, José |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychic healers who claimed to channel for Dr. Fritz were [[Edson Queiroz]] and [[Rubens Farias Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E1DD1039F931A25752C0A960958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Rio Journal;Live, in Brazil (Again): The Reincarnated Dr. Fritz - New York Times |accessdate=2007-08-19 |format= |work=The New York Times | date=1996-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular today (especially abroad) is João de Faria, also known as [[João de Deus (medium)|João de Deus]], a [[Quackery|quack]] operating in [[Abadiânia]], state of [[Goiás]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/johnofgod.html |title=John of God |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the descriptions of [[BDORT|Yoshiaki Omura]], Brazilian psychic surgery appears to be different from that practiced in the Philippines. Omura calls attention to the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling [[Qigong]], [[Shiatsu]] massage, and [[chiropractic]] manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed.&lt;ref&gt;Omura Y. Impression on observing psychic surgery and healing in Brazil which appear to incorporate (+) qi gong energy &amp; the use of acupuncture points. [[Acupunct Electrother Res]] 1997;22(1):17-33. {{PMID|9188913}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.&lt;ref name="YO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aegis.com/aidsline/1997/oct/M97A0099.html |title=Yoshiaki Omura on psychic surgery in Brazil |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

In the 1970s a specific form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. [[Willard Fuller]] was the most well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause [[Dental restoration|dental filling]]s to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings turned out to be [[tobacco]] stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-142. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Kurt. (1999).

Health Wise Productions. pp. 100-101. {{ISBN|978-0967328102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical and legal criticism==
In 1975, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] declared that "'psychic surgery' "is nothing but a total [[hoax]]"."&lt;ref name=FTC1 /&gt; Judge Daniel H. Hanscom, when granting the FTC an injunction against travel agencies promoting psychic surgery tours, declared: "Psychic surgery is pure and unmitigated fakery. The 'surgical operations' of psychic surgeons ... with their bare hands are simply phony."&lt;ref&gt;"F.T.C. Curbs Philippines Flights For Cures by 'Psychic Surgery'"; New York Times March 15, 1975, p. 11 (Judge Hanscom: "pure and unmitigated fakery... simply phony")&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the FTC stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been found that "psychic surgery" is pure fakery. The body is not opened, no "surgery" is performed with the bare hands or with anything else, and nothing is removed from the body. The entire "operation" is an egregious fraud perpetrated by sleight-of-hand and similar tricks and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/commission_decision_volumes/volume-86/ftc_volume_decision_86_july_-_december_1975pages_715-825.pdf#page=43|title=Federal Trade Commission Decisions, Volume 86, 1975, p. 757|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1990, the [[American Cancer Society]] stated that it "found no evidence that "psychic surgery" results in objective benefit in the treatment of any medical condition," and strongly urged individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid2110023" /&gt;

The [[BC Cancer Agency|British Columbia Cancer Agency]] "strongly urges individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgeon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/PsychicSurgery.htm |title=Unconventional therapies--Psychic surgery |publisher=British Columbia Cancer Agency |date=February 2000 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-04-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202112741/http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/PsychicSurgery.htm |archivedate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not directly hazardous to the patient, the belief in the alleged benefits of psychic surgery may carry considerable risk for individuals with diagnosed medical conditions, as they may delay or forgo conventional medical help, sometimes with fatal consequences.&lt;ref name="pmid2110023" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/faith.html |title=NCAHF Statements on Faith Healing and Psychic Surgery |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of fraud==
The physician [[William A. Nolen|William Nolen]] investigated psychic surgery and his book ''Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle'' (1974) uncovered many cases of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[William A. Nolen|Nolen, William]]. (1974). ''Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-49095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Agpaoa]] a famous psychic surgeon was several times detected in trickery.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 171. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage magician [[James Randi]] says psychic surgery is a [[sleight of hand]] confidence trick. He has said that in personal observations of the procedure, and in movies showing the procedures, he can spot sleight-of-hand moves that are evident to experienced stage magicians, but might deceive a casual observer. Randi has replicated the appearance of psychic surgery himself through the use of  sleight-of-hand.&lt;ref name="Randi1982"&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]]. (1982). ''[[Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions]]''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-198-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u14JFjF9jBg James Randi Replicating Psychic Surgery]&lt;/ref&gt; Professional magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] also investigated psychic surgeons at work, and observed sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1975). ''Mediums, Mystics &amp; the Occult''. Thomas Y. Crowell. {{ISBN|0-690-00476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his A&amp;E show ''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak|Mindfreak]]'' in the episode "Sucker," illusionist [[Criss Angel]] performed "Psychic Surgery," showing first-hand how it may be done (fake blood, plastic bags and chicken livers were used).

Randi says the healer would slightly roll or pinch the skin over the area to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient's body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand  or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the "diseased" tissue that the healer would claim to be removing.  If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might squeeze a bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly,  this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some "psychic surgery" procedures do not rely solely on the "sleight of hand" described, as at least one [[João de Deus (medium)|Brazilian "surgeon"]] also cuts his victims' skin with an unsterilized scalpel to heighten the illusion.&lt;ref name="Randi1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]]. (1995). [http://randi.org/encyclopedia/psychic%20surgery.html ''Psychic surgery''] in ''[[An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural]]''. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-15119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]] has written there is no real case for psychic surgery as the explanation of fraud is highly likely in all the operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Taylor|Taylor, John]]. (1980). ''Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician''. Temple Smith. pp. 31-36. {{ISBN|0-85117-191-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioners use [[sleight of hand]] techniques to produce [[blood]] or blood-like fluids, animal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a [[confidence trick]] for financial benefit.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;

Science writer [[Terence Hines]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "operation" starts as the hand appears to enter the patient’s belly. This is accomplished by creating an impression in the belly by pushing down and flexing the fingers slowly into a fist—the fingers thus appear to be moving into the belly, but are really simply hidden behind the hand. The blood that further disguises the true movement of the fingers and adds drama to the proceedings can come from two sources. One is a fake thumb, worn over the real thumb and filled with a red liquid. Such a fake thumb is a common magician’s implement. Blood can also be passed to the surgeon in red balloons hidden in cotton the psychic surgeon is using, the cotton and its hidden contents being passed to him by an "assistant." The bits of “tumor” can also be passed to the psychic surgeon this way, or hidden in the false thumb... the "tumor" material turns out to be chicken intestines or similar animal remains. The blood is either animal blood or red dye.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two "psychic surgeons" provided testimony in a [[Federal Trade Commission]] trial that, to their knowledge, the organic matter supposedly removed from the patients usually consists of animal tissue and clotted blood.&lt;ref name="pmid2110023"/&gt;

*In the 1989 film ''[[Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed]]'', comedic magicians [[Penn and Teller]] demonstrate how to perform the illusion of psychic surgery.
*A 1989 episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' featured a police officer whose mother claimed to have been cured by psychic surgery, only to die shortly thereafter; her autopsy revealed several tumors. The policeman described himself going undercover to feign illness and pretended to desire psychic surgery, having the feeling of the practitioner using sleight of hand to supposedly dig into his tissue, as well as suspecting that the "cysts" and "tumors" being removed from his body were actually ready-made chicken parts.
*In the TV show ''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak]]'', Season 2 Episode "Sucker", Criss explains psychic surgery as a deception.
*In the 1999 movie ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', a movie based on the life of [[Andy Kaufman]], Kaufman receives psychic surgery and notices the "sleight of hand". He is next seen dead, with his funeral being conducted.
*In the television show ''[[1000 Ways to Die]]'', a con artist was using this to scam poor country people, only to lead to his death when he used it on a [[leper]] from whom he caught the disease.
*[[Milagro (The X-Files)|"Milagro"]], a sixth season episode from ''[[The X-Files]]'', features a killer accused of using psychic surgery on his victims, killing them in the process.

*In the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Full Circle with Michael Palin]]'', [[Michael Palin]] witnesses two separate instances of psychic surgery in the [[Baguio]] district of the Philippines. On raising his suspicion with the medic that it seemed a sleight of hand to him, the medic told him he was a westerner and could only understand the surgery if he had a [[third eye]]. Palin assists another medic in a surgery and was told that no contamination happens in this procedure because of the use of [[garlic]].
*In the 1998 Christmas Special of the [[BBC1]] series ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'', entitled "[[List of Jonathan Creek episodes#Christmas Special .281998.29|Black Canary]]", the husband of the illusionist known as Black Canary undergoes psychic surgery at the start of the episode and this form of surgery forms a plot device throughout the special.
*In a deleted scene from the 2016 movie ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', Wade Wilson ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) visits a psychic surgery clinic in an attempt to cure his cancer, but upon realizing the clinic is scamming innocent clients into spending their life-savings on simple sleight of hand, he attacks and murders the head surgeon in front of the staff.

The term names the interdisciplinary academic field that studies those who do. Areas of research include interventions to increase health for older adults, programs for stimulating children’s creativity, [[dance movement therapy]], mate selection and emotional responses.

== Audience perception ==

Continuous response data provide [[choreographers]] information about audiences' perception of their dance material. Matches and mismatches between the choreographer's intention and the audience's response were found by continuously judging the emotions expressed when audience members watched Sue Haeley's ''Fine Line Terrain''. Key moments and intended structural changes described by the choreographer were mapped onto the continuous response data to compare the choreographer's intent and the audience's perception.&lt;ref name=Stevens2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Catherine J.|author2=Schubert, Emery |author3=Morris, Rua Haszard |author4=Frear, Matt |author5=Chen, Johnson |author6=Healey, Sue |author7=Schoknecht, Colin |author8= Hansen, Stephen |title=Cognition and the temporal arts: Investigating audience response to dance using PDAs that record continuous data during live performance|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|year=2009|volume=67|issue=9|pages=800–813|doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface features of dance contribute to audience [[arousal]]. Audience members continuously indicated their arousal and [[valence (psychology)|valence]] while viewing the Quantum Leap Youth Choreographic Ensemble's ''Landscape: time, place, and identity'' by continuously judging [[valence (psychology)|valence]] and emotion portrayed by the dance. Researchers compared this to choreographic notes about emotions expressed during the piece and found that arousal was related to changes in music and dancer activity.&lt;ref name=Stevens2 /&gt;

== Recognizing emotion ==

=== Adults ===

[[Laban Movement Analysis]] categorizes human movement based on the duration of time and [[tempo]] changes, the contraction and expansion of limbs and the tension and dynamics of movement. In an experiment, subjects viewed 20 videos of dancers performing the same dance attempting to convey anger, fear, grief or joy. Viewers performed at an above-chance level for all but one performance of grief. The highest recognition rate was for grief, followed by anger, then joy. An automated recognition system attempted to find movement cues for different emotions. Fear was expressed with low fluency and many contractions in toward the body, joy with very fluent motion, and grief with frequent transitions between motion and pauses, reducing fluency. The extracted cues were validated by the spectators' recognition of the different emotions in movement and the dancers' performing the emotions similarly.&lt;ref name=Camurri&gt;{{cite journal|last=Camurri|first=Antonio|author2=Lagerlöf, Ingrid |author3=Volpe, Gualtiero |title=Recognizing emotion from dance movement: Comparison of spectator recognition and automated techniques|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|year=2003|volume=59|pages=213–225|doi=10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers picked up emotion even without facial expressions. Raters with no dance experience watched videos of a dancer performing movement with seven different motives and six [[emotions]], but with a neutral face. Raters employed a list of motive terms including happy, lonely, sharp, natural, solemn, dynamic and flowing. They assessed emotional intensity on a scale of one to four concerning happiness, surprise, loneliness, fear, anger and disgust. All the intended emotions and motives were perceived, showing that attempts to communicate emotion and motivation via movement can succeed.&lt;ref name=Sakata&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakata|first=Mamiko|author2=Mariko Shiba |author3=Kiyoshi Maiya |author4=Makoto Tadenuma |title=Human body as the medium in dance movement|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|year=2004|volume=17|issue=3|pages=427–444|doi=10.1207/s15327590ijhc1703_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals participating in dance therapy identify feelings similar to those observing the activity. Participants attempted each posture after viewing a photograph or a model in the posture. Participants noted the emotion they associated with each posture. Responses were the same whether the subject was observing or embodying the posture, except for anger. Movers noted an anger response more often than observers.&lt;ref name=Winters&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winters|first=Allison F.|title=Emotion, embodiment, and mirror neurons in dance/movement therapy: A connection across disciplines|journal=American Journal of Dance Therapy|year=2008|volume=30|issue=2|pages=84–105|doi=10.1007/s10465-008-9054-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children ===

Four-, five-, and eight-year-old children and adults watched videos of movement expressing joy, anger, fear and sadness and indicated which emotions they perceived in each video. All age groups achieved recognition scores above chance level. The four-year-olds had the lowest scores, while the five-year-olds achieved levels close to the eight-year-olds' and the adults' scores.&lt;ref name=Lagerlof&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lagerlöf|first=Ingrid|author2=Djerf, Marie |title=Children's understanding of emotion in dance|journal=European Journal of Developmental Psychology|year=2009|volume=6|issue=4|pages=409–431|doi=10.1080/17405620701438475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expertise ==

=== Ballet and Indian dance ===



Untrained, frequent spectators and novices of ballet or Indian dance watched videos of ballet, Indian dance, and non-dance soloists. Motor-[[potential]]s (MEPs) in their hands and arms were used to measure [[corticospinal]] excitability. In ballet, the arms are used frequently, while the hands are used in Indian dance. Participants had higher MEPs in their arms when watching ballet compared to Indian dance. Ballet spectators' visual experience, not motor experience, drove motor resonance.&lt;ref name=Jola&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jola|first=Corinne|author2=Abedian-Amiri, Ali |author3=Kuppuswamy, Annapoorna |author4=Pollick, Frank E. |author5=Grosbras, Marie-Hélène |author6= Holmes, Nicholas P. |title=Motor simulation without motor expertise: Enhanced corticospinal excitability in visually experienced dance spectators|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e33343|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033343 |pmid=22457754 |pmc=3310063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Position sense ===

Dancers have more accurate [[Proprioception|position sense]] than non-dancers allowing them to rely more on position sense than vision.&lt;ref name=Blasing1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bläsing|first=Bettina|author2=Calvo-Merino, Beatriz |author3=Cross, Emily S. |author4=Jola, Corinne |author5=Honisch, Juliane |author6= Stevens, Catherine J. |title=Neurocognitive control in dance perception and performance|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2011|volume=139|issue=2|pages=300–308|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2011.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts, amateurs and novices differ in their mental representations based on spatial parameters. Subjects in each group viewed clips of basic [[classical ballet]] steps and noted the spatial parameters of basic action concepts (BACs), which are mental representations of each part of a movement. For the [[pas assemblé]], amateurs and experts clustered the movement into functional phases, but for the [[pirouette]], only experts had adequate spatial parameters. This suggests that experts retain spatial parameters in their long-term memory and that dancers use mental imagery to memorize long complex phrases.&lt;ref name=Blasing2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bläsing|first=Bettina|author2=Schack, Thomas |title=Mental representation of spatial movement parameters in dance|journal=Spatial Cognition &amp; Computation|year=2012|volume=12|pages=111–132|doi=10.1080/13875868.2011.626095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participating in dance ==

Dancers think in different modes, remember complex movement and respond to the other dancers. Communication between dancers occurs through direct perception of motion, recognition of structure and neural mirroring. Dancers' memory includes [[procedural knowledge]] of how to move their bodies and [[declarative knowledge]] of specific combinations. Thus, dance is similar to language, where grammar depends on procedural memory and memory of words depends on declarative memory. Dance also involves feelings and personal experience.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Catherine|author2=McKechnie, Shirley |title=Thinking in action: Thought made visible in contemporary dance|journal=Cognitive Processing|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|pages=243–252|doi=10.1007/s10339-005-0014-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each contemporary dancer has a moving identity as a result of a collection of choreographic and training influences that reveals a personal narrative.&lt;ref name=Roche&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roche|first=Jenny|title=Embodying multiplicity: The independent contemporary dancer’s moving identity|journal=Research in Dance Education|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|pages=105–118|doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.575222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[Duke University]] study found that dancers learn routines in different ways, whether by dancing at half speed or in their minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.dancehub.com/psychological-studies-dancing/ | title=5 Interesting Psychological Studies That Involve Dancing | publisher=DanceHub | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/10/31/research-investigates-science-behind-dance | title=Research investigates the science behind dance | publisher=The Chronicle | date=31 October 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2014 | author=Shulklapper, Kali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study has found that participating in synchronised dancing facilitates group bonding and higher pain thresholds more so than participating in unsynchronised dancing together.&lt;ref&gt;https://theconversation.com/lets-dance-synchronised-movement-helps-us-tolerate-pain-and-foster-friendship-49835&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==

[[File:CIJam.jpg|thumb|Dance Improvisation]]

=== Empathy ===

[[Empathy]] mediates cognition in [[dance improvisation]]. Through understanding others' emotions and intentions, dancers make affective motor decisions. Improvised movement is based on [[embodied cognition]], the theory that the body reveals the nature of the mind, [[motor cognition]], that cognition is embodied in action, [[social cognition]], dancers' understanding of others' actions and emotions, and [[situated cognition]], that knowing is inseparable from action. [[Mirror neurons]] underlie many movements, allowing dancers to subconsciously respond to stimuli from the other dancers. Empathy provides temporary structuring of movements, which allows contact improvisation to be a kind of choreography.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Mônica M.|author2=Fonseca, Agar |title=The empathy and the structuring sharing modes of movement sequences in the improvisation of contemporary dance|journal=Research in Dance Education|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|pages=71–85|doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.575220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creativity ===

Emotions were shown to affect creativity through arousal and valence interactions for subjects playing the [[video game]] ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Participants were randomly assigned to three different levels of exertion, representing levels of arousal. While the participants danced, an experimenter randomly gave them either a very bad grade or a very good grade, attempting to affect the subject's mood. After dancing, the participants were tested on valence, mood, arousal, creativity and level of physical and mental energy. Lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when a negative mood was induced. With higher arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creativity than a negative mood.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutton|first=Elizabeth|author2=Sundar, S. Shyam |title=Can video games enhance creativity? Effects of emotion generated by Dance Dance Revolution|journal=Creativity Research Journal|year=2010|volume=22|issue=3|pages=294–303|doi=10.1080/10400419.2010.503540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
Dance employs emotion, creativity, cultural influence and symbolism to convey meaning. Dance resembles verbal language because it has a [[vocabulary]] (dance movements) and [[grammar]] (system for combining movements).&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt; Dance increases connectedness among students and between students and teachers in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Melchior&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melchior|first=Elizabeth|title=Culturally responsive dance pedagogy in the primary classroom|journal=Research in Dance Education|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|pages=119–135|doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.575223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools students can enhance [[theory of multiple intelligences|bodily-kinesthetic intelligence]], reorganize neural pathways to improve learning, and express knowledge through dance.&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanna|first=J. L.|title=A nonverbal language for imagining and learning: Dance education in K-12 curriculum|journal=Educational Researcher|year=2008|volume=37|issue=8|pages=491–506|doi=10.3102/0013189X08326032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance helps students to develop a sense of self as an emotional and social being. In [[preschool]], children developed language, movement and collaborative skills to express their ideas. They created and named poses, learned ways of breathing to apply in different emotional situations, mirrored others' movements, incorporated emotions into their movement and participated in free movement. Children enhanced their social cognition and raised their awareness of their bodies.&lt;ref name=Thom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thom|first=Lily|title=From simple line to expressive movement: The use of creative movement to enhance socio-emotional development in the preschool curriculum|journal=American Journal of Dance Therapy|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=100–112|doi=10.1007/s10465-010-9090-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapy ==

=== Dance movement therapy ===

[[Dementia]] patients who participated in a [[dance therapy|dance movement therapy]] (DMT) intervention showed improved cognition compared to a control group. The intervention group participated in nine thirty- to forty-minute sessions of dance movement therapy. The control and intervention groups completed the [[Mini–mental state examination|Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)]], the Word List savings score, the [[Activities of daily living#Instrumental ADLs|instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)]] and the [[Executive dysfunction#Clock drawing test|Clock Drawing Test]] a week before, immediately before, at week five, at week nine and four weeks after the intervention. MMSE scores improved in the DMT group at follow-up and IADL scores improved in the DMT group at week 9. The changes were small, but intervention-related improvements in visuospatial ability were found.&lt;ref name=Hokkanen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hokkanen|first=Laura |author2=Rantala, Leena |author3=Remes, Anne |author4=Harkonen, Birgitta |author5=Viramo, Petteri |author6=Winblad, Ilkka|title=Dance and movement therapeutic methods in management of dementia: A randomized, controlled study|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|year=2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=771–772|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01611.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aerobic dance ===
An aerobic dance program improved older adults' [[Executive functions|executive function]]. Participants were assigned to a freestyle workout, which involved patterns of movement, or a combination style workout, in which they learned a long choreographic routine. Their cognitive function was tested immediately before and after the forty-minute dance class with a [[Task switching (psychology)|task-switching reaction time test]]. Performance improved in the combination group after the program, while there was no change in the freestyle group.&lt;ref name=Kimura&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Ken|author2=Hozumi, Noriko |title=Investigating the acute effect of an aerobic dance exercise program on neuro-cognitive function in the elderly|journal=Psychology of Sport and Exercise|year=2012|volume=13|issue=5|pages=623–629|doi=10.1016/j.psychsport.2012.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jazz dance ===

A [[jazz dance]] class study was conducted to improve older adults' balance, cognition and mood. These were measured with the MMSE, [[Geriatric Depression Scale]] (GDS), and Sensory Organization Test (SOT), respectively before (time 1), at the midpoint (time 2), and after (time 3) the class. Differences in MMSE and GDS scores were not significant, but SOT scores increased from time 1 to time 2 and from time 2 to time 3.&lt;ref name=Alpert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpert|first=Patricia T|author2=Miller, Sally K |author3=Wallmann, Harvey |author4=Havey, Richard |author5=Cross, Chad |author6=Chevalia, Theresa |author7=Gillis, Carrie B |author8= Kodandapari, Keshavan |title=The effect of modified jazz dance on balance, cognition, and mood in older adults|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners|year=2009|volume=21|issue=2|pages=108–115|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications about mate selection ==

=== Symmetry ===

[[Charles Darwin]] suggested that dance is a signal for [[natural selection]] in courtship. [[Fluctuating asymmetry]] (FA) measures quality of dancing, where higher scores indicate lower quality. Higher FA individuals are less attractive. They are more likely to engage with other FA individuals. A [[motion capture]] study of videos of Jamaican dancers, altered to make the dancers unrecognizable used FA ratings to categorize the dancers. Male and female subjects assessed dancing ability and identified the dancer's sex. Symmetrical dancers were rated as significantly better than others, but female symmetry accounted for less than it did in males. Female evaluators more strongly preferred symmetrical male dancers than male evaluators, while there was no gender difference in ratings of female dancers. Lower FA male evaluators were less likely to prefer dances performed by symmetrical females.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=William M.|author2=Cronk, Lee |author3=Grochow, Keith |author4=Jacobson, Amy |author5=Liu, C. Karen |author6=Popović, Zoran |author7= Trivers, Robert |title=Dance reveals symmetry especially in young men|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=438|issue=7071|pages=1148–1150|doi=10.1038/nature04344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk-taking ===

[[Sexual selection|Mate preference]] occurs when women perceive risk-taking in men from motion cues in dance. Non-professional heterosexual male dancers completed the [[Sensation seeking|Sensation Seeking]] Scale (SSS-V) assessing their attitudes towards risky activities, thrill-seeking, partying and sexual activities. Women viewed videos of them dancing alone in a room and rated them on perceived risk-taking and perceived attractiveness. Mean attractiveness ratings of the dancers correlated positively with their mean risk-taking and sensation seeking ratings.{{clarify|date=January 2013|reason=Did they correlate with the women's ratings of perceived risk-taking or the men's self-ratings?}}&lt;ref name=Hugill&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hugill|first=Nadine|author2=Fink, Bernhard |author3=Neave, Nick |author4=Besson, Anna |author5= Bunse, Laurel |title=Women’s perception of men’s sensation seeking propensity from their dance movements|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=51|issue=4|pages=483–487|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Roundabout''''' is an [[open-world]] [[indie video game|indie]] [[Racing video game|driving]] video game developed and published by American indie studio No Goblin LLC. It was released for [[Windows]], [[Mac OS|Mac]] and [[Linux]] on September 18, 2014, for [[Xbox One]] on February 20, 2015, and for [[PlayStation 4]] on May 26, 2015. A [[PlayStation Vita]] port was released on June 26, 2018, as a cross-buy title with the PlayStation 4 version.

The game involves a constantly-rotating [[limousine]] which the player has to drive around an open world while completing miscellaneous objectives such as pick up and dropping people off or finding collectible items. The gameplay has been described as inspired by ''[[Kuru Kuru Kururin]]'' (where you also control a constantly-rotating vehicle), and ''[[Crazy Taxi (video game)|Crazy Taxi]]'' (where the goal of the game is to drive [[Non-player character|NPCs]] from one location to another).

==Plot==
Roundabout is set in 1977 and follows the adventures of Georgio Manos; the world's first revolving limousine driver who drives around the citizens of the city of Roundabout on their daily needs. Though most of the jobs are unrelated and commuters are only seen once or twice, frequent passenger Elizabeth earns Georgio's deep admiration, and a romance begins to develop between the two.

Eventually Georgio develops a rivalry with another revolving limousine driver, Ronaldo, whom Georgio unknowingly taught everything they knew and allowed Ronaldo to overtake Georgio as the #1 revolving limousine driver in the city. Desperate to defeat Ronaldo, Georgio acquires some candy dots with the help of Mickey the mechanic, which allows Georgio to see Jeffrey the Skeleton. Guided by Jeffrey in a candy-dot fuelled frenzy, Georgio goes on a murderous rampage through the city. Georgio then challenges Ronaldo again, spurred on by Elizabeth, and as they race through the city streets Georgio runs Ronaldo off the road, destroying his car and killing him.

Six months later, Georgio has retreated to the mountains in the north out of shame, as destroying someone else's car is akin to treason in Roundabout. Having lost Elizabeth and running low on candy dots, Jeffrey urges Georgio to get their act back together and win back Elizabeth's heart. At the same time, Georgio is hounded by Ge-op (Georgio Operations), a police squad tasked with hunting down Georgio after they killed Ronaldo. In the end, Georgio and Elizabeth are reunited, and Elizabeth explains that she is tired of Georgio's constant spinning, pleading Georgio to drive straight for even a little while. After Georgio awkwardly attempts to drive straight, Elizabeth decides that she shouldn't force Georgio to be someone they're not, and the two drive off into the sunset together.

[[File:S.H. Dudley.jpg|thumb|Portrait of recording pioneer Samuel H. Rous, who performed as S.H. Dudley.]]

'''Samuel Holland Rous''' (15 January 1864 &amp;ndash; 6 June 1947), who recorded using the name '''S. H. Dudley''', and less frequently as '''Frank Kernell''', was an [[United States|American]] singer, pioneer recording artist, and music business executive.  He was unrelated to the black [[vaudeville]] performer and impresario [[Sherman Houston Dudley]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], the son of a music teacher.&lt;ref name=fma&gt;[http://freemusicarchive.org/member/JoeMc/blog/Couldnt_Hardly_Notice_It Free Music Archive, ''Moonlighter's Serenade'', 25 March 2010].

Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving school he found work as a [[baritone]] in touring [[light opera]] companies,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-k9ysIaaEUC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;lpg=PA520&amp;dq=%22S.+H.+Dudley%22+rous&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T55nxQ6aeP&amp;sig=UMP1sNy0oYsC31uzM4IsTjQYHvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vCOeUdK4CM-EhQfTmYCIAw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22S.%20H.%20Dudley%22%20rous&amp;f=false  Tim Brooks, ''Lost Sounds: Blacks and the Birth of the Recording Industry, 1890-1919'', University of Illinois Press, 2004, p.520]&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mid 1880s &amp;mdash; with his wife, Sofia Romani, a [[soprano]] &amp;mdash; toured the US, [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] as a member of the [[Emma Juch]] and Marie Tavary operatic ensembles.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WQwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22S.+H.+Dudley%22+rous&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qeKoJKSZW&amp;sig=VhrWa115i7bS-GaqIEOa3DmgLEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fiSeUa6WAcWJhQeWyYDQAQ&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22S.%20H.%20Dudley%22%20rous&amp;f=false  ''Billboard'' obituary, Sam H.

He continued to perform opera until 1896, when he began recording for the [[Berliner Records|Berliner]] and [[Edison Records|Edison]] companies, both as a solo performer and as a member of [[vocal group]]s.  On recordings he used the pseudonym S. H. Dudley, perhaps deliberately using the name of the black vaudeville performer [[Sherman H. Dudley]] who was becoming popular at that time. Rous later claimed he was ignorant of the "real" S. H. Dudley's existence.&lt;ref name=sutton&gt;[http://www.mainspringpress.com/macdonough.html Allan Sutton, ''Harry Macdonough - Victor's Singing Executive'', Mainspring Press]. Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He principally recorded for [[Victor Records]].  As a solo singer, using the name Dudley, he often recorded "[[coon songs]]" and other stereotypical [[minstrel show]] material.&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;&lt;ref name=sutton/&gt;  One of his biggest commercial successes was his recording of "When Reuben Comes To Town" in 1901.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  He recorded the song "Whistling", [[whistling|a skill]] for which he was noted, and comic songs such as "Miss Helen Hunt", with the mildly risqué line "Go to Helen Hunt for it".&lt;ref name=fma/&gt;  He also recorded as a duo with [[Harry Macdonough]].&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;

He was an integral member of the Edison Male Quartet, which became [[The Haydn Quartet]], along with Harry Macdonough, [[John Bieling]], and [[William F. Hooley]].&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/5042/  Library of Congress: S. H. Dudley]. Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was one of the most popular of the period, and had a number of successes including "[[In the Good Old Summer Time]]" (1903), "Bedelia" (1904), "[[Sweet Adeline (song)|Sweet Adeline (You're the Flower of My Heart)]]" (1904), "How'd You Like To Spoon With Me" (with [[Corinne Morgan]], 1906), "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" (with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], 1908), "Sunbonnet Sue" (1908), "Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet" (1909), and "[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (song)|By the Light of the Silv'ry Moon]]" (with Murray, 1910).  On some of the group's later recordings, he was replaced by [[Reinald Werrenrath]].&lt;ref name="whitburn 2"&gt;Whitburn, ''Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music'' pp. 201-203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Sam Rous, using his real name, was appointed as assistant manager of Victor Records' [[artists and repertoire]] division.  He gave the company's star singer Billy Murray the [[sobriquet]] "The Denver Nightingale".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denvernightingale.com/ "The Denver Nightingale", Billy Murray fan site]. Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rous continued to record for several years, both as Dudley and using the pseudonym Frank Kernell, but at a much reduced level.&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;  He was also the first editor of Victor's record catalog,  the ''Victor Book of the Opera'' (or ''Victrola Book of the Opera''), first published in 1912.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;  This contained illustrated details of the plots and production histories of [[opera]]s, and cataloged available Victor recordings of them.  The book went through many editions, and remained in print until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/victor-book-of-the-opera  Library of Congress National Jukebox: Victrola Book of the Opera]. Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1919, and with his wife went to live in [[France]].  They returned to the US shortly before [[World War Two]], and lived in [[California]].  Rous died in [[Los Angeles]] in 1947, at the age of 83; his wife, who had been paralysed for several years, died the next day.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt;

'''''Scarlet Heart 2''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 步步惊情) is a 2014 Chinese television series. It is the sequel to ''[[Scarlet Heart]]'' (2011), and continues the story after the [[time travel]]ing protagonist, Zhang Xiao ([[Cecilia Liu]]), returns to her own time following the death of Ma'ertai Ruoxi. The story is not considered to be canon to [[Tong Hua (writer)|Tong Hua]]'s novel ''[[Bu Bu Jing Xin]]'' because the author never wrote a sequel, although some of the cast members from the first series have returned. Unlike its predecessor, the series does not involve time traveling and will be set in the present, resolving the loose ends left by the [[cliffhanger]].

It began filming in [[Tianjin]], China on March 2013 and ended in [[Hong Kong]] on June 2013.&lt;ref name="Yahoo News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/bu-bu-jing-qing-begins-filming-090400840.html|work=Yahoo!

==Synopsis==
It has been three months since Zhang Xiao woke up from a coma and she can't forget about the Fourth Prince. One day, at the museum, she meets a man identical to him; He is Yin Zheng, the stepson of Zhentian Corporation's chairman. To find out his connection with the Fourth Prince, Zhang Xiao becomes a designer at Zhentian. Shortly after, however, an accident occurs and she loses her memories as Ruoxi. She starts to date a kind man named Kang Sihan, Yin Zheng's stepbrother; meanwhile, the latter dates Lan Lan, a model identical to Zhang Xiao who hides a mysterious past. Helped by his uncle, Yin Zheng wants to revenge the death of his biological father by ruining Kang Zhentian. Due to her connection with Sihan, Zhang Xiao finds herself unwittingly caught in the center of a power struggle.

'''''Snake Tales''''' (also known as simply '''''Snake''''', after the main character) is a [[gag-a-day]] [[comic strip]] written by [[Australia]]n [[cartoonist]] [[Sols|Allan Salisbury (aka Sols)]].

== Publication history ==
''Snake Tales'' was originally titled ''The Old Timer'' and was first published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' on 25 April 1974.  The initial group of characters featured: The Old Timer, an elderly bloke with a long thirst and a reluctance to [[Round of drinks|shout]] for [[beer]]s; The Con Man; The [[Kangaroo]], who constantly avoids being killed for food; the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|Flyin' Doc]]; and The Last Lost Tribesman and his Wife, who are determined to stay lost.

In July 1975 ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'' published the strip as a replacement for [[Les Dixon]]'s ''[[Bluey and Curley]]''. Sols gradually added characters including Crazy [[Saltwater Crocodile|Croc]], Lillie (the Old Timer's distant admirer), a devious butcher, a group of duck hunters, the comic strip didn't make a great impression until the introduction of the character ''Snake''. Snake was first introduced in 1975&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snakecartoons.com/school.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://visualhumor.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/best-of-intro-cartoons-02.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and gradually gained greater prominence to the point where the name of the strip was changed to ''Snake Tales'' in 1978.  The strip has now been internationally [[print syndication|syndicated]] and appears in over 450 [[newspaper]]s (both daily and Sunday editions) worldwide.

When it was syndicated in the United States (through the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Australian Strip From N.E.A.," ''The Comics Journal'' #73 (July 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Sols was asked to re-draw Lady Snake, as her "two lumps" were said to be offensive. He drew her with a bikini top instead.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, Daniel. "Snake's still after his buxom lady", ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'', 15 March 2008, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story and characters ==
The strip is set in an unspecified location in the Australian outback.  Occasionally a shot of a traditional outback [[public house|pub]] by itself on a lone road is seen.

The principal characters include: 
* '''Snake''': a not very smart poisonous snake.
* '''Lady Snake''': the Snake's girlfriend.
* '''The Flyin' Doc''': a pilot with the [[Royal Flying Doctors|Australian Royal Flying Doctors Service]]

'''''Sunken Plum''''' (Original {{zh|s= 沉李|t=沉李|p='''Chen Li'''|l=sunken plum}}) is a Spanish [[drama]] short film, with social realism elements, produced with the collaboration of Chinese companies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rodaje Gijonés en China (filming of an asturian director in China)|url=http://www.elcomercio.es/gente-estilo/201610/10/rodaje-gijones-china-20161010011527-v.html|accessdate=26 December 2016|publisher=El Comercio (Newspaper)|date=10 October 2016|language=Spanish|quote="Comedia melodramática con tintes de misterio y realismo social"}}&lt;/ref&gt; written and directed by [[Roberto F.

== Pre-Production ==

The films start the pre-production process in summer 2016. The directors mention that "The production process was very complicated because it was not possible to obtain help from official institutions, neither from private funds because this type of works cannot have a normal distribution in China". It was partially financed by a crowdfunding project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support Chengdu Art LGBT film|url=http://zaomengshe.com/c/318220|website=Zaomongshe|accessdate=26 December 2016|language=English and Chinese|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many people collaborate, knowing that our intention was to bring attention towards the difficulties and the injustice that the LGBT community and in special the trans community suffer in the Chinese society. For that reason, this project is very special for us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Sunken Plum", form the Asturias filmmaker Roberto F.

Produced by Almost Red Productions in association with Arkadin Ed (Spain), the filming took place in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support Chengdu Art LGBT film|url=http://zaomengshe.com/c/318220|website=Zaomongshe|accessdate=26 December 2016|language=English and Chinese|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a co-production, in the practice, it is just a Spanish film, not only because the main founds of the film came from Spain, but also because the film cannot be distributed in China, due to the strict censorship of the audiovisual exhibition in the country.

===Writing===

The script was written by the directors, [[Roberto F. Canuto]] and [[Xu Xiaoxi]]. The idea behind the story came after the directors view some videos that were shared in social networks in China, but that was censored in a few hours. The videos portray the physical and psychological abuse of some transgender women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=(An Astur-Chinese coproduction, selected in Raindance |url=http://agencias.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=2898472 |website=abc.es |publisher=Abc newpaper |accessdate=30 August 2018 |language=Spanish |quote=La idea de esta coproducción surgió cuando los cineastas vieron unos vídeos que se difundieron en las redes sociales en China, y fueron censurados en pocas horas, donde se podían ver maltratos físicos y psicológicos a mujeres transgénero por parte de autoridades.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directors mention: "''we were surprided that these videos were shared in a playful and entertaining manner. Knowing the great difficulties that this community must face to have a dignified life, lacking legal protection and suffering the contempt of a good part of society, we decided to write this story to draw attention to this unfair situation''".

According to the directors, they ''"try to create a story with a simple and direct narrative, but with an important emotional charge, so that the viewer feels empathy with the main character and understands her inner world. Our wish would be that this short film could be seen both by the kind of people who shared those videos for fun, as well as by the archetype of people who are represented in the village, who are completely unaware of the existence of transsexuality and, therefore, they can not accept it"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=NBNoticias |title="Sunken Plum" selected in the Raindance of London |url=https://www.eldigitaldeasturias.com/noticias/ciruela-de-agua-dulce-seleccionada-en-el-raindance-de-londres/ |website=www.eldigitaldeasturias.com |publisher=El digital de Asturias |accessdate=30 August 2018 |language=Spanish |quote=Según el cineasta, “intentamos crear una historia con una narrativa sencilla y directa, pero con una importante carga emocional, para que el espectador sienta empatía con el personaje principal y entienda su mundo interior. Nuestro deseo sería que este corto pudiera ser visto tanto por el tipo de personas que compartían esos videos por diversión, al igual que por el arquetipo de personas que aparecen representados en la aldea, que desconocen por completo la existencia de la transexualidad y, por ello, no la pueden aceptar”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Sunken Plum (Dir. Roberto F. Canuto &amp; Xu Xiaoxi) Behind the Scene picture with actor Gu Xiang.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of Sunken Plum (Chen Li) with main actor Gu Xiang]]

The village that was use, "Bai Ta", is located five hours from Chengdu city, in the mountains, and the team needed to drive dangerous roads to reach the remote place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peláez|first1=I|title=Roberto F.

Regarding the casting process, the director Roberto F. Canuto mention that they “''try to find a transgender actress to perform the main role, but it was not possible.

Finalmente optamos por un actor no profesional, ya que poseía las cualidades y la pasión que buscábamos, y le daría viveza y espontaneidad al personaje”.  Según afirma el realizador, para darle credibilidad, Gu Xiang se entrevistó con varias mujeres transgénero y ensayó las escenas durante varios meses con los directores, hasta sentirse preparado para afrontar el rodaje.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 60006559 Tableau vivant voorstellende de Goudd.jpg|thumb|Outdoor tableau vivant about [[gold mining]] in [[Paramaribo]], 1892]]
A '''{{lang|fr|tableau vivant}}''' (often shortened to '''{{lang|fr|tableau}}''', plural: '''{{lang|fr|tableaux vivants}}'''), [[French language|French]] for 'living picture', is a static scene containing one or more actors or models. They are stationary and silent, usually in costume, carefully posed, with props and/or scenery, and may be [[Theatre|theatrically]] lit. It thus combines aspects of theatre and the visual arts.

A tableau may either be 'performed' live, or depicted in [[painting]], [[photography]] and [[sculpture]], such as in many works of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]], [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Pre-Raphaelite]], and [[Art Nouveau]] movements.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tableaux sometimes featured {{lang|fr|poses plastiques}} ('flexible poses') by virtually nude models, providing a form of [[Erotica|erotic]] entertainment, both on stage and in print.

Tableaux continue to the present day in the form of [[living statues]], street performers who busk by posing in costume.

== Origin ==
Occasionally, a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was punctuated with short dramatic scenes and painting-like {{lang|fr|tableaux}}. They were a major feature of festivities for royal weddings, coronations and [[royal entries]] into cities.  Often the actors imitated statues or paintings, much in the manner of modern street entertainers, but in larger groups, and mounted on elaborate temporary stands along the path of the main procession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/valois.html Festivals in Valois France] British Library, accessed September 24th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Western visual arts in general, until the modern era, has had a focus on symbolic, arranged presentation, and (aside from direct personal portraiture) was heavily dependent on stationary artists' models in costume – essentially small-scale {{lang|fr|tableaux vivants}} with the artist as temporary audience. The [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] movement, with more [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] depictions, did not begin until the mid-19th century, a direct reaction against Romanticism and its heavy dependence on stylized {{lang|fr|tableau}} format.

Before [[radio]], [[film]] and [[television]], {{lang|fr|tableaux vivants}} were popular forms of entertainment, even in frontier towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Tom|title=Cowtown : an album of early Calgary|year=1975|publisher=City of Calgary Electric System, McClelland and Stewart West|location=Calgary|isbn=0-7712-1012-4|page=444|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3562126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the age of color reproduction of images, the {{lang|fr|tableau}} was sometimes used to recreate artworks on stage, based on an etching or sketch of a painting. This could be done as an amateur venture in a drawing room, or as a more professionally produced series of {{lang|fr|tableaux}} presented on a theatre stage, one following another, usually to tell a story without requiring all the usual trappings and production of a full theatre performance. They thus influenced the form taken by later [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]] [[magic lantern]] shows, and perhaps also sequential narrative [[comic strip]]s (which first appeared in modern form in the late 1890s).

{{lang|fr|Tableaux vivants}} were often performed as the basis for school [[Nativity play]]s in England during the Victorian period; the custom is still practiced at [[Loughborough High School]] (believed to be one of England's oldest grammar schools for girls). Several {{lang|fr|tableaux}} are performed each year at the school carol service, including the depiction of an engraving {{lang|fr|[[Grisaille|en grisaille]]}} (in which the subjects are painted and dressed completely grey).

Theatrical censorship in Britain and the United States forbade actresses to move when nude or semi-nude on stage, so {{lang|fr|tableaux vivants}} had a place in risqué entertainment for many years. In the early 1900s, German dancer [[Olga Desmond]] appeared in ''Schönheitsabende'' ('Evenings of Beauty') in which she posed nude in "living pictures", imitating classical works of art.

In the nineteenth century, {{lang|fr|tableaux vivants}} took such titles as "Nymphs Bathing" and "Diana the Huntress" and were to be found at such places as the Hall of Rome in [[Great Windmill Street]], London. Other venues were the [[Coal Hole, Strand|Coal Hole]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and the Cyder Cellar in [[Maiden Lane (London)|Maiden Lane]]. Nude and semi-nude {{lang|fr|poses plastiques}} were also a frequent feature of variety shows in the US: first [[Broadway theatre|on Broadway]] in [[New York City]], then elsewhere in the country. The [[Ziegfeld Follies]] featured such {{lang|fr|tableaux}} from 1917. The [[Windmill Theatre]] in London (1932–1964) featured nude {{lang|fr|poses plastiques}} on stage; it was the first, and for many years the only, venue for them in 20th-century London.

{{lang|fr|Tableaux vivants}} were often included in fairground sideshows (as seen in the 1961 film ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]''). Such shows had largely died out by the 1970s. {{lang|fr|Tableaux}} remain a major attraction at the annual [[Pageant of the Masters]] in [[Laguna Beach, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Navarro |first=Mireya |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/arts/design/01mast.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=The Tableau Vivant Is Alive and Well and Living in Laguna Beach |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 1, 2006 |accessdate=2014-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photographic tableaux==
[[Jean-François Chevrier]] was the first to use the term {{lang|fr|tableau}} in relation to a form of art photography, which began in the 1970s and 1980s in an essay titled "The Adventures of the Picture Form in the History of Photography" in 1989.&lt;ref name="chevrier89"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chevrier |first=Jean-François |origyear=1989 |chapter=The Adventures of the Picture Form in the History of Photography |editor=Fogle, D. |year=2003 |title=The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography 1960-1982 |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Walker Art Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial translation of this text substitutes the English word ''picture'' for the French word {{lang|fr|tableau}}. However [[Michael Fried]] retains the French term when referring to Chevrier's essay, because according to Fried (2008), there is no direct translation into English for {{lang|fr|tableau}} in this sense. While ''picture'' is similar, "... it lacks the connotations of constructedness, of being the product of an intellectual act that the French word carries." (p.&amp;nbsp;146)&lt;ref name="fried08"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fried |first=M. |year=2008 |title=Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before |location=New Haven/London |publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other texts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chevrier |first=Jean-François |year=2006 |chapter=The Tableau and The Document of Experience |editor=Weski, T. |title=Click Double Click: The Documentary Factor |publisher=Munich: Haus Der Kunst and Brussels: Centre for Fine Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wall98"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wall |first=Jeff |year=1998 |chapter=Marks of Indifference: Aspects of Photography in, or as, Conceptual Art |editor=Janus, E. |title=Veronica's Revenge: Contemporary Perspectives on Photography |location= Zurich |publisher=Scalo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clement Greenberg|Clement Greenberg's]] theory of medium specificity also cover this topic.

The key characteristics of the contemporary photographic {{lang|fr|tableau}} according to Chevrier are, firstly:

::"They are designed and produced for the wall. summoning a confrontational experience on the part of the spectator that sharply contrasts with the habitual processes of appropriation and projection whereby photographic images are normally received and "consumed" (p.&amp;nbsp;116)&lt;ref name="chevrier89" /&gt;

By this, Chevrier notes that scale and size is obviously important if the pictures are to "hold the wall". But size has another function; it distances the viewer from the object, requiring one to stand back from the picture to take it all in.  This "confrontational" experience, Fried notes,&lt;ref name="fried08" /&gt; is actually quite a large break from the conventional reception of photography, which up to that point was often consumed in books or magazines.

The photographic {{lang|fr|tableau}} has its roots not in the theatrical {{lang|fr|tableau vivant}}, but in [[Pictorialism|pictorialist]] photography, such as that of [[Alfred Stieglitz]], a movement with its roots in [[Aestheticism]], which already made heavy use of the {{lang|fr|tableau}} as a non-theatrical visual art style.  Pictorialism, according to [[Jeff Wall]]&lt;ref name="wall98" /&gt; could be seen as an attempt by photographers to imitate painting (perhaps unsuccessfully):

::"Pictorialist photography was dazzled by the spectacle of Western painting and attempted, to some extent, to imitate it in acts of pure composition. Lacking the means to make the surface of its pictures unpredictable and important, the first phase of Pictorialism, Stieglitz's phase, emulated the fine graphic arts, re-invented the beautiful look, set standards for gorgeousness of composition, and faded." (p.&amp;nbsp;75)&lt;ref name="wall98" /&gt;

However photography did have the ability to {{em|become}} unpredictable and spontaneous. This was achieved by making photographs related to the inherent capabilities of the camera itself.  And this, Wall argues,&lt;ref name="wall98" /&gt; was a direct result of [[photojournalism]], and the [[mass media]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] industries. "By divesting itself of the encumbrances and advantages inherited from older art forms, reportage, or the spontaneous fleeting aspect of the photographic image pushes toward a discovery of qualities apparently intrinsic to the medium, qualities that must necessarily distinguish the medium from others and through the self-examination of which it can emerge as a modernist art on a plane with others." (p.&amp;nbsp;76-78)&lt;ref name="wall98" /&gt;

The argument is that, unlike most other art forms, photography can profit from the capture of chance occurrences.  Through this process – the snapshot, the "accidental" image – photography invents its own concept of the picture. A hybrid form of the "Western picture" (pictorialist photography) and the spontaneous snapshot.  This is the stage whereby Wall&lt;ref name="wall98" /&gt; argues that photography enters a "modernist dialectic". Wall claims that unpredictability is key to modern aesthetics. This new concept of the picture, which Wall proposes, with the compositional aspects of the Western picture combined with the unpredictability that the camera affords through its shutter, can be seen in the work of many contemporary photographic artists including [[Luc Delahaye]], [[Andreas Gursky]], [[Thomas Struth]], [[Irene Caesar]], and [[Philip-Lorca diCorcia]].

The tableau as a form still dominates the art photography market. As Fried notes: "Arguably the most decisive development in the rise of the new art photography has been the emergence, starting in the late 1970s and gaining impetus in the 1980s and after, of what the French critic Jean-François Chevrier has called the "tableau form" (p.&amp;nbsp;143)&lt;ref name="fried08" /&gt;

However, there appears to be only a handful of young, emerging artists working within the tableau form.  Examples include [[Florian Maier Aichen]], Matthew Porter and [[Peter Funch]]. More recently, Canadian artist, [[Sylvia Grace Borda]], has worked since 2013 to continue to stage tableaux for the camera within the Google Street View engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.photomonitor.co.uk/2016/07/sylvia-grace-borda-farm-tableaux/|title=Farm Tableaux|last=Parhar|first=Katherine|date=July 2016|website=Photomonitor UK|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sshop.org.uk/project/rebecca-travis/|title=The only thing that’s changed is everything: An essay by Rebecca Travis on Sylvia Grace Borda: Camera Histories|last=Travis|first=Rebecca|date=July 2016|website=Scottish Society for the History of Photography|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work creates 360' immersive tableaux vivant images for the viewer to explore.

=== Film ===
The 2013 film, ''[[A Field in England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRvzjkzu2U''|title=A Field in England - Official UK Trailer|last=|first=|date=21 May 2013|work=Youtube|via=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes use of the effect to add to the general occult look of the film.

There is a 2014 feature film produced entirely in tableau format titled ''[[In the Crosswind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6q1OWCxxpQ|title=''In the Crosswind'' Trailer |work=Festival 2014 |via=YouTube |access-date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Captain &amp; the Kid''''' is the twenty-eighth [[studio album]] by British singer-songwriter [[Elton John]], released in 2006. It is his second autobiographical album with lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]], picking up where 1975's ''[[Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy]]'' left off. ''The Captain &amp; the Kid'' chronicles the events in their lives over those subsequent 30 years.

''The Captain &amp; the Kid'' reached No. 6 in the UK, a considerable improvement over the performance of John's preceding ''[[Peachtree Road (album)|Peachtree Road]]'' in 2004, which peaked at No. 21. It reached No. 18 in the US, before quickly falling off the charts. At concerts in early 2007, John made clear his dissatisfaction with Interscope's promotion for the album, having threatened to terminate his contract with the label.

==Background==
[[Interscope Records]] announced that there would be no physical single released from this album as the emphasis is on presenting the album as a [[concept album|body of work]]. However, a [[promotional recording|radio single]] would be released in "[[The Bridge (Elton John song)|The Bridge]]". The album's booklet has photos of John and Taupin all throughout their career, and in the lyrics section, two songs are included, "Across the River Thames" and "12", which do not appear on the music album. "Across the River Thames" was available as a free download to anyone inserting the CD into their computer. This is the first album created by John and Taupin to have them both together on the cover. This was the last studio album to feature [[Guy Babylon]] on keyboards; he died in 2009 and was replaced by Kim Bullard. This was also [[Bob Birch]]'s last appearance on any of John's solo studio albums before his own death in August 2012 (Birch last appeared on the [[Gnomeo &amp; Juliet (soundtrack)|''Gnomeo and Juliet'' soundtrack]]).

Producer Matt Still noted during an interview that in "Just Like Noah's Ark", Elton's black and white spaniel dog Arthur "barked in the middle of [the recording], because John Mahon was playing a cowbell, and the cowbell freaked him out. So he ran over to John and started barking at him right in the middle of a take. It's funny, just randomly he happened to hit the beats and he barked in time. So I recorded it and we actually kept him in there."

The sampled "woof-bells" can be heard in place of the cowbell on the track.

'''The Generating Company''' is a touring circus company producing large shows and events around the world. Most recent shows include 'Voyage de la Vie' at [[Resorts World Sentosa]] in [[Singapore]] and 'Aqua' the world's largest water show located in Shenzhen southern China. The company also
produces events and runs training programmes for artists and young people.The company is based in London, England and [[Le Buisson-de-Cadouin]], [[France]].

==History==

===Formation===
The Generating Company founder, Paul Cockle, was Production Manager for the Millennium Dome Show directed by Peter Gabriel, Mark Fisher and Micha Bergese, in 1998 to create a [[Millennium Dome Show|show]] for the [[Millennium Dome#Millennium Experience|Millennium Experience]], a exhibition hosted at the Millennium Dome to welcome the [[third millennium]].&lt;ref name="tait"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article396669.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |title=Life After The Dome: The Show Goes On |accessdate=2010-03-06 |last=Tait |first=Simon |date=2004-11-29 |work=Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team turned to [[The Circus Space|Circus Space]], now the National Centre for Circus Arts, which was the first centre in the UK to offer a degree in circus arts. With little more than a year until opening night, Circus Space formed an accredited programme and trained 87 aerial performers for the Dome show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/apr/17/furthereducation.uk2 |title=The High Flyers |accessdate=2010-03-06 |last=Crace |first=John |date=2001-04-17 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dome show premiered on New Year's Eve, 1999.&lt;ref name="tait" /&gt; While the Dome itself was mired in controversy and financial woes, the show opened to critical success.&lt;ref name="dessau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/theatre-in-birmingham/2009/09/25/high-flying-investment-65233-24781456/ |title=Dance Group The Generating Company Backed by Dragons |accessdate=2010-03-06 |last=Laws |first=Roz |date=2009-09-25 |work=The Birmingham Post |publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; With only a year-long contract at the Dome,&lt;ref name="dessau"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-371980-walking-the-circus-tightrope.do |title=Walking The Circus Tightrope |accessdate=2010-03-07 |last=Dessau |first=Brian |date=2002-03-28 |work=London Evening Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of the show's performers considered a return to Circus Space to continue their careers. When the show closed at the end of 2000, about 20 of the performers returned to Circus Space to form The Generation Company, a small traveling company that retained many of the characteristics of the original Dome performance.

===Financing and schools===
Following their success at the Dome and Circus Space, The Generating Company received a £70,000 grant from the [[NESTA|National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts]] and grants from the [[Arts Council England]] to begin a touring company.&lt;ref name="tait" /&gt; After a local show, Storm, performed at Circus Space in Hoxton, The Generating Company began pursuing a "fusion of professional training with an extended performance contract linked to future touring opportunities."&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/documents/publications/phpoaGCXW.doc |title=Circus Healthcheck |accessdate=2010-03-06 |last=Micklem |first=David |date=2006-10-01 |work=Art Council England }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened its first school in 2002, offering summer courses devised for children interested in circus skills. It also hosted programs at [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/6543637/New-not-for-profit-private-school-chain-is-a-class-apart.html |title=New Not-For-Profit Private School Chain Is a Class Apart |accessdate=2010-03-06 |date=2009-11-12 |work=Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, The Generating Company moved the majority of its professional schooling and develop a creative centre at Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, France. Paul Cockle explained that setting up the company in France offered the chance to develop a residential centre where artists can live and work together.. The Generating Company still has administration offices in London but its core operation is based in France.

'''''The Problem with Apu''''' is a 2017 documentary film written by and starring comedian [[Hari Kondabolu]] and produced and directed by Michael Melamedoff. The film focuses on the character [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], an Indian immigrant in the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' who, for a period, was the only figure of [[South Asia|South Asian]] heritage to appear regularly on mainstream U.S. television. The film explores encounters with negative [[stereotype]]s, [[racial microaggression]]s and [[racism|slurs]] against people of Indian and South Asian heritage disseminated through the character.

==Background==
[[File:Hari Kondabolu.png|thumb|left|Documentary writer Hari Kondabolu]]
Kondabolu grew up watching ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and cites it as a major influence on his comedy and cultural savvy. Initially he liked the character [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] because the character was the only representation of his family's culture regularly aired on television in the United States. Kondabolu told the [[BBC]], "Apu was the only Indian we had on TV at all so I was happy for any representation as a kid." As he grew older, Kondabolu became more critical of Apu, saying, "he's funny, but that doesn’t mean this representation is accurate or right or righteous. It gets to the insidiousness of racism, though, because you don’t even notice it when it’s right in front of you."&lt;ref name="Blauvelt, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blauvelt|first1=Christian|title=The Simpsons’ Apu: ‘A stereotype hiding in plain sight’|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171027-the-simpsons-apu-a-stereotype-hiding-in-plain-sight|accessdate=10 November 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hankazaria05.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Azaria, voice of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and several other characters on ''The Simpsons'']]
According to Kondabolu, his mother taught him that "you can criticize something you love because you expect more from it."&lt;ref name="Leight, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title='Simpsons' Doc 'The Problem with Apu' Confronts South Asian Stereotypes|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/new-simpsons-doc-explores-legacy-of-apu-caricature-w505935|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first public critique of ''The Simpsons'' character came at the insistence of [[W. Kamau Bell]] during the first season of his [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] television show ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell|Totally Biased]]''.&lt;ref name="Rao, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rao|first1=Mallika|title=Is It Time To Retire Apu?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/20/the-simpsons-apu-racist_n_3956603.html|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Kondabolu worked as a writer on the show, and Bell heard him railing against Apu for fomenting [[racial stereotype]]s about Indians. Bell then told Kondabolu that if he did not write it into a [[stand up comedy]] routine and perform it on the show, Bell would fire him.&lt;ref name="Official Site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hari Takes Aim at a Beloved Stereotype|url=http://www.trutv.com/shows/the-problem-with-apu/videos/hari-takes-aim-at-a-beloved-stereotype.html|website=truTV|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his bit, Kondabolu criticizes voice actor [[Hank Azaria]] (who is of [[Sephardic Jewish]] descent), calling him "a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father." Kondabolu went on to cite other portrayals of South Asians in mainstream television and film—such as a man eating monkey brains in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' and an actor petting a stuffed [[mongoose]] in a [[metroPCS]] commercial—as racist.&lt;ref name="Kondabolu, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kondabolu|first1=Hari|title=Mindy Kaling, Apu &amp; Indian Americans|work=Totally Biased|publisher=[[FX (TV channel)|FX]]|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondabolu eventually decided to expand the one-minute segment about Apu into an hour-long documentary.&lt;ref name="Ito, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ito|first1=Robert|title=You Love ‘The Simpsons’?

''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] named Apu after the protagonist of [[Bengal]]i filmmaker [[Satyajit Ray]]'s acclaimed ''[[Apu Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name="Blauvelt, 2017" /&gt; Hank Azaria based his voice characterization of Apu on a clerk who worked at a [[7-Eleven]] near his home in Los Angeles as well as on [[Peter Sellers]]' character Hrundi V.

He agreed to have a discussion facilitated either by [[Terry Gross]] on the public radio program ''[[Fresh Air]]'' or on [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast ''[[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF]]'' but according to Kondabolu rescinded his offer once it was accepted.&lt;ref name="Meraji and Demby, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meraji|first1=Shereen Marisol|last2=Demby|first2=Gene|title=Live From Chicago...It's Code Switch!|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=564162692|accessdate=19 November 2017|work=NPR.org|publisher=National Public Radio|date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

In the film Kondabolu speaks with other South Asian-American entertainers about the impact of Apu on their lives. Actors [[Aziz Ansari]], [[Kal Penn]], [[Maulik Pancholy]], [[Utkarsh Ambudkar]], [[Samrat Chakrabarti]], [[Sakina Jaffrey]], [[Aasif Mandvi]] and [[Hasan Minhaj]]&lt;ref name="Credits" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ito, 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Page-Kirby, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Page-Kirby|first1=Kristen|title=See ‘The Problem with Apu,’ Netflix hit ‘Okja’ and the Alexandria Film Festival|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2017/11/09/see-the-problem-with-apu-netflix-hit-okja-and-the-alexandria-film-festival/|accessdate=10 November 2017|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; relate childhood anecdotes of being called "Apu" by other children or having the character's catchphrases from the show said to them by strangers because of their perceived heritage.&lt;ref name="Blauvelt, 2017" /&gt; They also relate stories of becoming trained professional actors and being asked to deliver lines in the style of Apu.&lt;ref name="Ito, 2017" /&gt;

Kondabolu compares this instance of Azaria portraying a caricature of an Indian shopkeeper to [[blackface]] and interviews African-American actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] who is a longtime collector of racist [[ephemera]] from the 20th and 21st centuries. Goldberg agrees with the interpretation of Apu as a form of [[Blackface|brownface]].&lt;ref name="Ramanathan, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramanathan|first1=Lavanya|title=He loved ‘The Simpsons.’ But Hari Kondabolu has a problem with Apu.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/he-loved-the-simpsons-but-hari-kondabolu-has-a-problem-with-apu/2017/11/08/b37c2426-bdac-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html|accessdate=10 November 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondabolu traces the origins of ''The Simpsons'' character to a legacy of brownface performance by actors such as [[Peter Sellers]] in ''The Party''.

In parts of the documentary, Kondabolu expresses his appreciation for ''The Simpsons'' as a subversive and culturally astute institution on the landscape of mainstream North American media.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Don|title=‘The Problem with Apu’ Explores Ethnic Issues in ‘The Simpsons’|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-problem-with-apu-explores-ethnic-issues-in-the-simpsons-1510160479|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he draws out a range of opinions from his peers; for instance, while Kondabolu said that despite Apu he still loved ''The Simpsons'', Kal Penn said the character ruined the show for him.&lt;ref name="Ito, 2017" /&gt; Kondabolu said, "I made this film to not only talk about the origin of Apu and highlight the impact of such images in media, but also to celebrate the diversity and complexity of my community."&lt;ref name="Leight, 2017" /&gt;

==Production and release==
Filming for ''The Problem with Apu'' began in April 2016.&lt;ref name="Ito, 2017" /&gt; The film was given special screenings featuring live appearances and talkback with Hari Kondabolu in the fall of 2017, preceding its release on the [[truTV]] network on November 19.&lt;ref name="Page-Kirby, 2017" /&gt;

Kondabolu appeared on ''[[The Daily Show with Trevor Noah]]'' to promote the film. He argued that the Apu character had had a serious and insidious effect, and that the use of humor in the portrayal is an artful way of making racism more appealing; this would hypothetically be relieved by the introduction of a range of brown characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=November 13, 2017 – Hari Kondabolu |work=The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Season 3 |url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/1xp96j/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-november-13--2017---hari-kondabolu-season-23-ep-23021 |type=Television program |format=Video |publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |date=November 13, 2017 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The documentary received mostly positive reviews from critics, with [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ranking the film at 88% out of 17 reviews, with an average critical score of 8/10,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_problem_with_apu/|title=The Problem with Apu (2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Metacritic]] assigning a score of 77/100 based on four reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-problem-with-apu|title=The Problem With Apu|last=|first=|date=|website=Metacritic|access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Fienberg, writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', praised the documentary for providing "its thesis against the character's acceptability ... with such clarity, it's hard to imagine it generating an adversarial response more cogent than that hoary classic 'It's a joke, stop taking it so seriously,' which is no response at all.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; However, Feinberg criticized it as being "half a documentary", saying "it becomes disingenuous when Kondabolu declares, 'I realize some of you think I'm some annoying PC social-justice warrior' and then calculatedly skips those voices, and disappointing when Kondabolu and friends wonder what can be done about Apu now and there's nobody around to make it into a real conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/problem-apu-review-1059649|title='The Problem With Apu': TV Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scott Pierce of ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' found the documentary "thought-provoking and entertaining", and concluded that "Kondabolu raises some troubling questions. I’ll never be able to watch ''The Simpsons'' without thinking about this again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/tv/2017/11/19/ay-caramba-is-the-simpsons-really-racist-consider-the-problem-with-apu/|title=Ay caramba! Is ‘The Simpsons’ really racist? Consider ‘The Problem With Apu’|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meenasarani Linde Murugan, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', contrasted the documentary's progressive advocacy with the view of media diversity promulgated by [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] Chairman [[Ajit Pai]]: "In celebrating how far we have come, we should not only remember how brownface and brown voice persist on contemporary television, but also call out those public South Asian figures who would use this same history of ridicule to leverage a vision of the future wholly run by corporations that would further racial and economic inequity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-problem-with-apu-and-the-fcc/|title="The Problem with Apu" and the FCC - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Charity, writing for [[The Ringer (website)|''The Ringer'']], agreed with the film's argument, but found the pursuit of Azaria to appear in the film "a prevailing distraction from more ambitious consideration of the ideal future of ''The Simpsons'' and the cultural shifts that have rendered Apu increasingly unpalatable." He also found the documentary lacked imagination in finding a solution to creating a more nuanced portrayal of Apu: "that lapse of Kondabolu’s imagination is the documentary’s real waste."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/11/16/16666564/the-problem-with-apu-simpsons-hari-kondabolu|title=Hari Kondabolu Doesn’t Know How to Solve ‘The Problem With Apu’|work=The Ringer|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neal Justin of ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' noted "any criticism directed at the show’s portrayal of the convenience-store owner in his documentary...is drowned out by frustration that he can’t land an interview with the character’s voice actor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/tv-picks-for-nov-19-23-the-problem-with-apu-godless-anne-of-green-gables/458092733/|title=TV picks for Nov. 19-23: 'The Problem With Apu,' 'Godless,' 'Anne of Green Gables'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buenos Aires]] is one of the world's great capitals of theater.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;Wilson, Jason. ''Cultural Guide to the City of Buenos Aires'. Oxford, England: Signal Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Teatro Colón]] is a national landmark for [[opera]] and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world,&lt;ref name=frommer&gt;Luongo, Michael. ''Frommer's Argentina''. Wiley Publishing, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theatre scene of national and international caliber, [[Corrientes Avenue]] is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as ''the street that never sleeps'', and sometimes referred to as the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Fiona.|title=Culture Shock Argentina|publisher=Graphic Arts Center Publishing Company|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=1-55868-529-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The ''[[Teatro General San Martín]]'' is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the ''[[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Teatro Nacional Cervantes]]'' functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The ''[[Teatro Argentino de La Plata]]'', ''[[Teatro El Círculo|El Círculo]]'' in [[Rosario]], ''[[Teatro Independencia|Independencia]]'' in Mendoza, and ''[[Libertador Theatre|Libertador]]'' in [[Córdoba (Argentina)|Córdoba]] are also prominent. [[Griselda Gambaro]], [[Copi]], [[Roberto Cossa]], [[Marco Denevi]], [[Carlos Gorostiza]], [[Alberto Vaccarezza]] and [[w:es:Mauricio Kartun|Mauricio Kartun]] are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. [[Julio Bocca]], [[Jorge Donn]], [[José Neglia]], and [[Norma Fontenla]] are some of the great [[ballet dancers]] of the modern era.

==History==
Argentine theatre traces its origins to Viceroy [[Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo]]'s creation of the colony's first theatre, ''La Ranchería'', in 1783. In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel José de Lavardén, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[Río de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Ranchería'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Colón Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina. 

The 1874 murder of [[Juan Moreira]], a persecuted [[troubadour]], provided dramatists with a new hero. Possessing all the elements of [[tragedy]], the anecdote inspired [[Eduardo Gutiérrez]]'s 1884 play ''Juan Moreira'', and the work made the [[gaucho]], the inspiration for the Argentine stage in subsequent years. [[Spanish literature]] began to overtake the gaucho, following the 1897 relocation to Argentina of Spanish theatre producer [[María Guerrero]], and her company, who popularized professional stage theatre in the country. Making the [[Teatro Odeón]] a nerve center for the medium, her evolved [[stagecraft]] led to the creation of the national stage, the [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes Theatre]], in 1921. 
[[File:Teatro del Picadero - Teatro Abierto - 1981.jpg|thumb|The "[[Argentine Open Theatre|Open Theatre]]".]]
The wave of European [[Immigration in Argentina]] created a need for a cultural shift in theatre addressed by [[Florencio Sánchez]], a pioneer in professional theater locally, and in [[Uruguay]]. Local color became the primary inspiration for [[Roberto Arlt]], [[Gregorio de Laferrère]], [[Armando Discépolo]], [[Antonio Cunill Cabanellas]], and [[Roberto Payró]] during the 1920s and 1930s, while also helping [[amateur theatre]] revive locally. The ''Teatro Independiente'' movement created a counterwight to professional theatre, and inspired a new generation of young dramatists in this vein such as [[Copi]], [[Agustín Cuzzani]], [[Osvaldo Dragún]], and [[Carlos Gorostiza]]. 

Gorostiza and other self-trained dramatists also popularized [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]] in the Argentine theatre after 1950, a genre advanced by Ricardo Halac, [[Roberto Cossa]], and among others. [[Griselda Gambaro]] and [[w:es:Eduardo Pavlovsky|Eduardo Pavlovsky]] popularized the [[theatre of the absurd]] in Argentina after 1960, a genre that found local variant in the [[grotesque]] works of Julio Mauricio and Roberto Cossa, whose ''La Nona'' became an iconic character in the Argentine theatre in 1977.

Argentina's [[National Reorganization Process]] posed the greatest challenge to the development of local theatre since the Rosas era of the mid-19th century. Numerous actors, playwrights and technicians emigrated after 1976, though the pressures on artists were loosen around 1980. Seizing the opportunity, playwright [[Osvaldo Dragún]] marshalled colleagues to restore an abandoned sparkplug factory to organize the improvisational [[Argentine Open Theatre]] in 1981, a triumph dampened by their Picadero Theatre's fire-bombing a week later.

The theatre thrived before and after the 1983 [[Argentine general election, 1983|return to democracy]]. Established playwrights and directors such as [[Norman Briski]], Roberto Cossa, [[Lito Cruz]], [[Carlos Gorostiza]], [[Pacho O'Donnell]], and [[Pepe Soriano]], and younger dramatists such as [[w:es:Luis Agostoni|Luis Agostoni]], [[w:es:Carlos María Alsina|Carlos María Alsina]], [[w:es:Eduardo Rovner|Eduardo Rovner]], and [[w:es:Rafael Spregelburd|Rafael Spregelburd]]. Works by these and other local authors, as well as local productions of international works, are among the over 80 theater works presented every weekend in Buenos Aires, alone. The stage also plays host to well-known comedy acts, such as those of satirist [[Enrique Pinti]], female impersonator [[Antonio Gasalla]], storyteller [[Luis Landriscina]], and the musical comedy troupe, [[Les Luthiers]].

'''''Theocracy''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] game for the [[Personal computer|PC]] developed by [[Philos Laboratories]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]]. The game takes place in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] in the 15th century. The player controls a tribe in this region, and has 100 years to prepare for a [[Spain|Spanish]] invasion by expanding their territory across the Central American map, by conquest, or by allying and trading with other tribes.

==Story==
In ''Theocracy'', the player is the leader of the Atlan tribe (a fictional tribe), who has escaped from oppression under the Axocopans, and now must improve his/her tribe in order to survive in Central America. As the player's empire's borders expands, the player is able to conduct diplomacy with other tribes. The player must also eventually defend themself from the invading Spanish.

The game also allows players to play through several "Chronicles", a set of objective-based missions detailing supposed heroes of Aztec history. These mostly serve for tutorial purposes rather than being a serious part of the game however.

==Gameplay==
There are two modes of playing: province view, and realm view.  
In province view, the player view a particular province under their control/attack.  Here they assign tasks to their persons, however time stands still here, and the player must go to realm view for time to move and his/her actions to take effect.  There is a time-scale in realm view, along with a hand-drawn map of Central America, showing all the province borders, and using colour-code to show which of the eight factions controls it.
The player's tribe is represented by the colour blue, while other tribes are red, yellow, green, purple and cobalt. Provinces under control from a random tribe with no possible relations to others are paper-coloured, and provinces controlled by the Spanish (once the Spanish arrive to invade) are grey. Each tribe has a unique 'personality' dictated by its AI; the red tribe the Izhuacans for example are an 'aggressive and warlike theocracy'  and will generally be the first tribe to make an aggressive move in the game. The green tribe, the Huaputecs, are more peaceful and will never attack the player unless the player has already initiated hostilities.&lt;ref name="Theocracy Adobe Game Manual"&gt;Theocracy Adobe Game Manual&lt;/ref&gt; Tribes also have varying military tactics and units, the Yellow Tribe has an army consisting of almost entirely sword units supported by spearmen, jaguars and nature priests, while the Cyan tribe, the Teotitlans, have enormous crossbow units known as Wonderbows and soul priests supporting their warriors.
 
Players can also build Aztec-style pyramids to harness the power of magic from the five spheres of Magic: Sun, Star, Moon, Nature and Soul. The amount of magic available to the player is limited and measured in "Mana", Mana is used by Priests to cast spells, this Mana can be recharged by performing sacrifices at the Pyramids where priests are trained, the amount of Mana per unit depends on the Unit type. Each sphere of magic has different spells available with a vague focus on a specific type. Sun Priests specialise in attack spells, Moon in defensive ones, Nature Priests in Healing, Star Priests in 'debuff' or distraction and while Soul Priests are equally skilled in all fields.&lt;ref name="Theocracy Adobe Game Manual"/&gt;

The time scale can be used to determine how fast time passes.  It can be paused to make time stand still, and at slowest rate, a year passes in approximately 10 or so minutes, and at fastest rate, a year passes in approximately 20 seconds.

==Province View==
[[File:Theocracy-Province.png|right|thumb|200px|''Theocracy'' in Province View mode]]
Each region can be closely managed in the province view. Here activities can be undertaken such as construction, training and allocation of slaves.

The majority of the population of each realm is made up of slaves, basic worker units who can undertake any task except fight and transport resources between realms. There are a certain number of new slaves born each year depending on the level of health in the province, how much food the province has and what the current population of the province is.

===Food===
As a bare minimum, each province must produce enough food to feed the entire population of the realm. There are two types of food, corn and meat. Corn is produced from small and large farms, and is produced faster and in greater quantity than meat, and is also required to feed llamas. Meat, while taking longer to produce, requires less slaves and is more nutritious than corn, meaning it can feed more people than the same amount of corn. It is therefore more economic to produce meat in a province than corn. Meat is also required to feed tamed jaguars.

===Resources and storage===

There are a number of different resources that can be used in different ways. The most basic are meat and corn, used to feed people and tamed animals. Next is wood, which every building uses in construction, and is also used to create Wonderbows (similar to ballistas). Also used in construction is stone, which is used to build more advanced buildings. Finally, there is Gold, Jade, and Jewels. Jewels are used as a currency, and to decorate the most advanced buildings. It is made out of Jade and Gold. Either one can be used to create jewels separately, but used together they produce a much greater quantity than when used separately. Corn is produced from small and large farms, meat from ranches (pig farms) and fishing huts. Wood is produced from lumberyards and stone, gold and jade are mined from quarries. Jewels are produced in a workshop from gold and/or jade. There is also mana, however it functions differently from the other resources in that it is used to cast spells, can be accessed anywhere, and is generated from temples in a small continuous trickle. Sacrificing slaves will generate much more and faster, but slaves are the only means of production so they must be sacrificed carefully so as not to ruin the economy of a region. There is a different stockpile of mana for each sphere of magic. 
Note: resources are stored in stockpiles in each region, thus resources for one realm can be used anywhere in that region no matter where they are stored, but must be manually transported to another region in order to be used there. The exceptions are jewels and mana.

==Buildings==
[[File:Theocracy-Pyramids.png|right|thumb|200px|''Theocracy'' showing an Aztec town]]
There are a number of different buildings, which can all be broadly categorised into three main types:

===Production Buildings===
These buildings produce resources, but must be manned to do so. These include ranches and fishing huts, which produce meat, small and large farms, which produce corn, quarries and mines which produce stone, gold and jade and lumberyards, which produce wood.

===Training Buildings===
These buildings train new types of workers and warriors from slave recruits. They include schools (small, medium and large) which train workers, who speed up production of a particular resource but specialise in that resource. Small schools can train only basic workers, medium schools can train most types of workers and large schools can train any, and train them faster. Small and medium schools can only train one type of worker, but large schools can train every type, but only one at a time. Another type of training building is the barracks: small, medium and large. The small and medium barracks produce warriors from slaves, but can only produce one type of warrior. The medium barracks takes less time to train warriors than the small barracks. The large barracks can produce any of the three types of warriors, but only one at a time. They also train warriors much faster than the small or medium barracks.

===Storage Buildings===
These buildings store all resources except mana and jewels. There are four types, in order of size and cost to produce they are: provision stores, small stores, medium stores and large stores.

===Construction===
To construct a building, slaves must be sent into an unfinished building. They will build it automatically, using the resources that realm has stored. If the realm does not have enough of one or more particular resource, they will use whatever there is stored, then wait until new resources are delivered to the realm, which must be done manually.

==Development==
The development on ''Theocracy'' began when developer [[Philos Laboratories]] hired several new employees who had previous experience developing the game ''[[Perihelion: The Prophecy]]''. It was decided that they would develop a new strategy title, with the goal of merging aspects of the games ''[[Command &amp; Conquer]]'' and ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]''. The setting was decided by the game's graphic artists, deciding on an [[Aztec]] theme. Development continued for two years, with a planned release in spring 1999.&lt;ref name="ZsoltVamosiInterview"&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/philos Zsolt Vamosi of Philos Labs Interview - Eurogamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in March 1999 publisher [[Interactive Magic]] had decided to abandon boxed releases for their future titles, putting ''Theocracy'' in jeopardy. Philos eventually managed to buy back the publishing rights, and started updating the game to allow for a future release. These changes included redrawing most of the games graphics, switching the game resolution to 800x600, and the addition of "chronicles". The [[France|French]] publisher [[Ubisoft]] picked up the publishing rights, and work began on finishing the game for release.&lt;ref name="ZsoltVamosiInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.game-over.com/reviews/pc/Theocracy.html Game Over Online ~ Theocracy]&lt;/ref&gt; The game was finally released for both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]] on March 30, 2000. There was consideration towards a follow up, focusing on as then undecided new [[civilization]] and using features thought up after the original game's development entered feature freeze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/philos  Zsolt Vamosi of Philos Labs Interview - Eurogamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Theocracy'' received mixed reviews upon its release. Its strongest praise came from [[Eurogamer]], with one reviewer stating that the game's "mix of real time and turn based strategy means that ''Theocracy'' takes place on a far larger canvas than a purely real time game ever could." The reviewer praised its wide scope and original ideas, separating it from many of its contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/theocracy Theocracy Review - Eurogamer]&lt;/ref&gt; The British publication [[PC Zone]] was also impressed with the games originality, describing it as being "as refreshing as a pint of [[lager]] after a [[chicken vindaloo]], and definitely worth shouting about."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=3547 PC Zone Review]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the press were less impressed, causing the game to only score a 72 on [[MobyGames]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/theocracy/mobyrank Theocracy MobyRank]&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers criticized the game as being simple and archaic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ru/reviews/theocracy Absolute Games (AG.ru) Review]&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time others thought that the interface was cumbersome and the learning curve was too steep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0000/00000592_test.htm Jeuxvideo.com Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it was mostly unknown outside of Europe, the game managed to sell well enough, especially on [[Linux]] where it became a best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/2705614.html Escape from Alcatraz Q&amp;A] [[Gamespot]]&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of the game's Linux port stated that "the game is a world apart from a lot of the linux games I've been playing lately. It's solid and feels nice to use - the buttons click with a satisfying sound played at the right moment, and it feels... professional."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080531071635/http://www.mrsneeze.com/games/reviews/theocracy/index.html Detailed Theocracy Review (Linux)] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; The port was also plagued with negative comments however, with many complaining about installation problems and about various technical faults (such as only being able to play the game in 16 bit colours and the lack of a proper full-screen mode).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxgames.com/archives/2226 Theocracy Retail Linux Client / Demo] - [[LinuxGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these problems, it still holds an average of four out of five stars at [[The Linux Game Tome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happypenguin.org/show?Theocracy Theocracy at The Linux Game Tome]&lt;/ref&gt; A review in German print magazine [[LinuxUser]] was mostly positive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-community.de/Internal/Artikel/Print-Artikel/LinuxUser/2000/09/Linux-Games Theocracy] in [[LinuxUser]] (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On September 10, 1993, the [[Universidad de Los Andes (Venezuela)|Universidad de Los Andes]] proposed to [[CONATEL]] to create a television station to broadcast on UHF to serve the city of Mérida.  On October 19, 1993, CONATEL temporarily reserved UHF channel 22 for the Universidad de Los Andes and gave them a 60-day period to meet administrative and technical requirements.  On January 19, 1994 the ULA has met the requirements of CONATEL.  On February 3, 1994, CONATEL authorized the ULA to begin setting up their installations for channel 22.  CONATEL gives them a time period of 6 months to do this.  On October 2, 1999, channel 22 begins their transmission, first with a [[test pattern]] and 23 days later, with video. The station's studios were originally located in las Residencias Los Caciques and their transmittor is located near the Estación La Aguada.  On January 17, 2000, the stations studio moves to the Centro Comercial Alto Chama.  On February 25, 2000, the company, TV Canal UHF-22 C.A., was created and university professor José Luis Bendito was its first president.  On April 13, 2000 CONATEL inspects the channel's installations.  On October 13, 2000, the ULA presents before CONATEL its plans to move its transmittor and studios to their current locations.  Between February 25, 2000 and April 2, 2001, José Luis Bendito serves as president of the board of directors of the company.  Under his leadership, the channel is defined as an education television network.  Between April 2, 2001 and February 7, 2002, Tarick Souki Farías serves as president of the channel.  On February 7, 2002, the company's investors designate Pedro Quesada Estévez, coordinator of politica communications of the university, to be interim president of the company during its reorganization.  During the months between March and July 2002, the channel was under the conduction of Nereida Pacheco, who was hired half time and was under the supervision of Professor Adelis Graterol.  In this time period, the station added 2 extra hours to its broadcast day, raising it to 10 hours (10:00am to 8:00pm), and entered a partnership with the Venezuelan cable company, [[Net-Uno]].
