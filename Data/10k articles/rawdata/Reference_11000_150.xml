'''[[ARINC]] 661''' is a standard which aims to normalize the definition of a '''C'''ockpit '''D'''isplay '''S'''ystem (CDS), and the communication between the CDS and User Applications (UA) which manage aircraft [[avionics]] functions. The [[GUI]] definition is completely defined in binary '''D'''efinition '''F'''iles (DF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| first=Paul|last=Eden
| accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDS software is constituted of a kernel which is able to create the [[GUI]] hierarchy specified in the DF during initialization, thus not needing to be recompiled if the [[GUI]] definition changes.

== History and adoption in industry ==
The first version of the standard was adopted in 2001. Its first use was for [[Airbus A380]] CDS development.
The first supplement was adopted in 2003, and added new widgets.
The second supplement was adopted in June 2005, and added supplementary widgets. Third supplement has been adopted in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Technical overview ==
The standard normalizes :
* the [[GUI]] definition of the CDS interface, in a binary file called DF (Definition File) defining the structure of the graphical interface tree. The [[GUI]] tree is instantiated at initialization time (called the Definition Phase in the standard) in the CDS, using the definition contained in the DF.
* the communication at runtime between the User Applications (UA) and the CDS. This communication protocol is typically used for UAs to send widgets modifications to the CDS, and return user events (such as buttons selection) from CDS to UA.

In order to be compliant with the standard, a CDS must have a kernel that can create the [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] tree during CDS initialization, using the Definition File, and communicate with UA in both ways using the runtime protocol.

ARINC 661 does not imply the use of a particular Data bus structure to perform the low-level communication between CDS and UA. For example, an [[ARINC 429]] or  [[ethernet]] protocol can be used, but it is not mandatory.

== GUI definition ==
Each DF binary file specifies the GUI definition for one User Application (UA) User interface. Several UA user interface trees can be combined to constitute the CDS display definition.

A DF is composed of two parts : an optional symbol definition, and a widgets definition. The widget library is similar to [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]] used in computing. There are [[Container (data_structure)#Graphic containers|Containers]], [[List box|Lists]], ScrollPanes, [[Button (computing)|Buttons]], [[Menu bar|Menus]], [[Label (control)|Labels]], [[Text box|EditBoxes]], etc...

Although the DF File is binary, the standard has also defined an associated XML definition, which is easier to manipulate in tools.

== Relationship with other UI languages ==
The concepts used by ARINC 661 are close to those used in [[User interface markup language]]s, except that the UI language is binary and not [[XML]] based.&lt;ref&gt;The standard also specifies an XML format for the UI language, but it is mainly used to ease DF production by specification tools. The kernel is initialized with the binary version of DFs&lt;/ref&gt;

Main similarities from other [[User interface markup language]]s:
* The interface definition is not hard-coded in the CDS. Instead, the CDS use a kernel which instantiate the widget tree at initialization, using a predefined widget library
* The widget list and the structure of the widget tree are similar to what can be found in common [[Widget toolkit]]s
* The [[Look and feel]] is separated from the definition of the interface

Main differences from other [[User interface markup language]]s :
* The widget library defined in the standard does not really take advantage of its object nature, contrary to other [[User interface markup language]]s. For example, there is no notion of inheritance in the standard, although the same properties can be used more than once for several widgets.
* Some [[Widget toolkit]]s or [[User interface markup language]]s have the ability to lay out widgets automatically in a container (see for example the box model in [[XUL]], or the layouts in [[Swing (Java)|Java Swing]]). Widgets position and size in their container must always be defined exactly in an ARINC 661 definition. However, the supplement 3 of the standard has added a limited sort of "relative" layout capability between widgets (see [[Layout manager]]).
* There is no mechanism for defining the presentation and interactive behavior of elements equivalent to [[XBL]] used in [[XUL]] (or [[sXBL]] used in [[SVG]]). There are symbols that can be reused, but they are mainly shapes that cannot have behaviors (apart from defining their position, rotation, and color), or specific bindings.
* There is no equivalent of [[CSS]], as they are used in [[XUL]] or [[SVG]] for example. Instead, the [[Look and feel]] of the interface is hard-coded in the ARINC 661 kernel. However, supplement 5 introduced a way to specify the Look of widgets.
* The standard does not have an equivalent of [[Javascript]], as used in [[SVG]] and [[XUL]], so all specific behavior associated with the widgets must be performed by the UAs.
* The standard has defined specific "Map" widgets which allows to present elements such as [[Flight plan]]s in CDS.

==Example==
The following example presents the XML Definition File for a Layer containing a [[Panel (computer software)|panel]] enclosing a [[Label (control)|label]], which shows the text "Hello World!". Note that contrary to most [[widget toolkit]]s, ARINC 661 [[GUI widget|widgets]] origins are relative to the lower left-hand corner of their parent [[Container (data structure)#Graphic_containers|container]], and screen units are not in [[pixel]] but in 1/100 of millimeters.

  &lt;/a661_df&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Development and tools support==
ARINC 661 [[GUI]] development includes tools for the specification of definition files and the kernel that use these files:
* Thanks to ARINC 661 concepts, the specification tools have no dependency on the execution platform,
* The kernel itself depends on the execution platform.

[[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] specification tools for DF specification currently include SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 Compliant Systems, DiSTI's GL Studio ARINC 661 Toolkit and Presagis VAPS XT 661 Toolkit.

There is a great deal of research on the factors that lead to the formation of prejudiced attitudes and beliefs. There is also a lot of research on the consequences of holding prejudiced beliefs and being the target of such beliefs. It is true that advances have been made in understanding the nature of [[prejudice]]. A consensus on how to end prejudice has yet to be established, but there are a number of scientifically examined strategies that have been developed in attempt to solve this social issue.

==Intergroup interaction approaches==

Intergroup interaction approaches to prejudice reduction refer to strategies in which members of one group are put in situations where they have to interact with members of another group that they may hold prejudiced beliefs about. For example, if people from Group X are prejudiced towards people from Group Y or vice versa, an intergroup approach would require at least one person from Group X to interact with at least one person from Group Y. The expectation is that prejudice will decrease following a specified type of interaction. Intergroup approaches to prejudice reduction have been studied a great deal in laboratory settings, as well as outside of the laboratory, particularly in schools.&lt;ref name="paluck"&gt;[[Betsy Levy Paluck|Paluck, E. L.]], &amp; Green, D. P. (2009). Prejudice reduction: What works? A review and assessment of research and practice. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 60,'' 339-367.&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of intergroup prejudice reduction approaches are grounded in one of 3 main theoretical perspectives: interdependence,&lt;ref name="deutschT"&gt;Deutsch, M. (1949). A theory of cooperation and competition. ''Human Relations, 2,'' 129-152.&lt;/ref&gt; intergroup contact,&lt;ref name="allport"&gt;Allport, G.W. (1954). ''The nature of prejudice.'' Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and social identity.&lt;ref name="t&amp;t"&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. (1979). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 33-47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdependence approaches===
Interdependence approaches to prejudice reduction are based on psychologist, Mark Deutsch’s, theory of interdependence.&lt;ref name="deutschT" /&gt; According to this theory, when two groups realize that they have a common issue that can only be solved by pooling their resources together, they are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors. Cooperation then results in friendliness during discussion and positive evaluations of the individuals from the opposite group.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M. (1949). An experimental study of the effects of co-operation and competition upon group process. ''Human Relations, 2,'' 199-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cooperative learning''' is an interdependence approach originally developed for the purpose of reducing racial prejudice in schools. It is most frequently examined in school settings, and studies testing this approach often occur across weeks. 

This approach is most frequently associated with the “jigsaw method” created by social psychologist, Elliot Aronson. With this method, students are put into diverse teams of 5 or 6 people and assigned to complete a task. Each person is given a unique part of the total material necessary for solving the task. Thus, in order to complete the task, team members have to work together, each sharing their unique information with the others.&lt;ref name="aronson"&gt;Aronson, E., Blaney, N., Stephan, C., Sikes, J., &amp; Snapp, M. (1978). ''The jigsaw classroom''. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The jigsaw method has been shown to actually reduce prejudice toward members of the stigmatized group. A stigmatized group is a group that “has an attribute that marks them as different and leads them to be devalued in the eyes of others”.&lt;ref&gt;Major, B., &amp; O'Brien, L. T. (2005). The social psychology of stigma. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 56,'' 393-421.&lt;/ref&gt; The stigmatized group in the context of the jigsaw method is typically a racial minority group. Getting members of the non-stigmatized group to engage in cooperative behaviors with members of the stigmatized group results in increased liking, increased perspective taking, and increased helping behaviors between the different group members.&lt;ref name="aronson" /&gt;

Another variation of cooperative learning is the competitive-cooperation method.&lt;ref&gt;Sharan, S. (1980). Cooperative learning in small groups: Recent methods and effects on achievement, attitudes, and ethnic relations. ''Review of Educational Research'', 50(2), 241-271.&lt;/ref&gt; With this method, the learning environment is set up such that students are assigned to diverse groups of 4-5 people and the diverse groups compete with each other in a weekly learning game tournament. Thus, group members are dependent on one another and cooperation is necessary in order for them to do well and outperform the other groups in the tournament. The same outcomes of liking, perspective taking and helping behavior are expected with this type of cooperative learning strategy.

Overall, cooperative learning strategies have been quite effective in reducing prejudice. However, as cooperative learning is generally studied with children in school settings, it is not clear what its impact is on adults. Also, there is little research on whether or not the reduction of prejudice that students experience as a result of cooperative learning extends to their perceptions of the stigmatized group as a whole or just to those members that are part of their assigned cooperative learning group.&lt;ref&gt;Warring, D., Johnson, D. W., Maruyama, G., &amp; Johnson, R. T. (1985). Impact of different types of cooperative learning on cross-ethnic and cross-sex relationships. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 77(1)'', 53-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergroup contact approaches===
Contact approaches to prejudice reduction are based on prominent social psychologist, Gordon Allport’s, contact hypothesis.&lt;ref name="allport" /&gt; According to this hypothesis, prejudice is best reduced under optimal conditions of contact between those who hold prejudiced beliefs and those who are the targets of prejudiced beliefs. The optimal conditions include equal status between groups in the context of the given situation, shared goals, authority support, and cooperation as opposed to competition.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2006). A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90(5),'' 751-783.&lt;/ref&gt; (This does overlap with the cooperative learning strategy discussed above.)  Stuart Cook’s “railroad studies” &lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. W. (1971). The effect of unintended interracial contact upon racial interaction and attitude change. Project No. 5–1320, Final Report. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. W. (1978). Interpersonal and attitudinal outcomes in cooperating interracial groups. ''Journal of Research &amp; Development in Education, 12(1),'' 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  are classic examples of the contact hypothesis put into practice. These railroad studies took place in the American South during the 1960s, an especially challenging time and place with respect to interracial relations. In these studies, racially prejudiced white adults were hired to perform a railroad management task with two coworkers under the guise that they were employed at a real part-time job. Unbeknownst to them, the two coworkers – one White and one Black – were research assistants. After working with the two coworkers for over a month under optimal conditions, the initially prejudiced white participants rated their coworkers highly in attractiveness, likeability, and competence. Moreover, several months later, participants still expressed lower prejudice than prejudiced whites that did not have the intergroup contact experience.

===Social identity approaches===
According to social identity theory,&lt;ref name="t&amp;t" /&gt; people are biased to favor their ingroup – the group that they identify as belonging to – at the expense of the outgroup – the group that they do not identify with. Social identity-based approaches to prejudice reduction attempt to make a particular group-based identity, such as race or gender, less salient to individuals from different groups by emphasizing alternative ways of categorizing people.

One way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through '''decategorization'''. Decategorization involves teaching people from different social groups to focus on a person’s unique individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Ensari, N., &amp; Miller, N. (2001). Decategorization and the reduction of bias in the crossed categorization paradigm. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 31(2),'' 193-216.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as individuation, and helps to draw attention away from group differences and toward individual differences. Decategorization often causes ingroup members to perceive fewer similarities among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bettencourt, B., Brewer, M. B., Croak, M. R., &amp; Miller, N. (1992). Cooperation and the reduction of intergroup bias: The role of reward structure and social orientation. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 28(4),'' 301-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through '''recategorization'''. Here, individuals with different group-based identities are made aware of the fact that the groups to which they belong are part of an overarching group. The salience of their membership in the overarching group is emphasized over their exclusive group based identities.&lt;ref name="g&amp;d"&gt;Gaertner, S. L., &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (2000). ''Reducing intergroup bias: The common ingroup identity model.'' Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, membership in the group “student” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major”.

Similar to recategorization, '''crossed categorization''' is when individuals from opposing groups are made aware of the fact that they both simultaneously belong to a third separate group, and membership in this third group is emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp, R. J., &amp; Hewstone, M. (1999). Differential evaluation of crossed category groups: Patterns, processes, and reducing intergroup bias. ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations, 2(4),'' 307-333.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, membership the group “military veteran” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major ”.

'''Integrative models''' acknowledge the coexistence of separate group-based identities within a common group identity.&lt;ref name="g&amp;d" /&gt; This is in alignment with multicultural ideologies that emphasize appreciation for racial and ethnic diversity while still emphasizing a common national identity.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt;

Because divisive group membership is deemphasized in these categorization strategies, people from opposing groups express less ingroup favoritism. However, they do not necessarily show a reduction of bias against the outgroup.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt; This approach has primarily been studied in laboratory settings and often with arbitrarily assigned group categories.&lt;ref&gt;Tajfel, H. (1970). Experiments in intergroup discrimination. ''Scientific American, 223(5),'' 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely clear how these results translate when considering existing social groups in real-world settings.

===Disclosure approaches===
Disclosure approaches rely  on self-disclosure of personal information. Here, two individuals from different social groups would each reveal a piece of personal information about themselves. The act of disclosure signals vulnerability. This increases trust and liking, and that then results in a decrease of prejudiced beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ensari, N., &amp; Miller, N. (2002). The out-group must not be so bad after all: the effects of disclosure, typicality, and salience on intergroup bias. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(2),'' 313.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the decrease in prejudice extends beyond the disclosing individual to the social group to which that person belongs.

==Individual approaches==

Individual approaches to prejudice reduction are not dependent on intergroup interaction. These approaches only require that an individual be exposed to some relevant information and/or engage in an activity intended to reduce prejudice. There are two main types of individual approaches to prejudice reduction: affective strategies that target what and how you feel, and cognitive strategies that target what and how you think. A lot of the evidence on the effectiveness of affective and cognitive strategies is based on laboratory findings.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt; As most of these studies consist of one-time sessions, it is unclear how long the positive effects of the strategies last. Also, there is not much knowledge about the extent to which these strategies are effective in situations outside of the laboratory.

===Affective approaches===

'''''Perspective taking'''''.
Taking the perspective of an individual from a stigmatized group has been shown to be effective in reducing prejudice &lt;ref name="g&amp;m"&gt;Galinsky, A. D., &amp; Moskowitz, G. B. (2000). Perspective-taking: decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78(4),'' 708-724.&lt;/ref&gt; because it evokes feelings of similarity and affinity toward the other person.  Evidence from laboratory studies suggests that perspective taking specifically leads to a decrease in the use of stereotypes when categorizing or evaluating a member of a stigmatized group.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m" /&gt;

'''''Empathy'''''.
Encouraging individuals to be empathetic towards stigmatized groups is another feeling-based strategy. Being instructed to be empathetic after reading about &lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G., &amp; Finlay, K. (1999). The role of empathy in improving intergroup relations. ''Journal of Social Issues, 55(4),'' 729-743.&lt;/ref&gt; or watching videos of discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;Esses, V. M., &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (2002). The role of emotions in determining willingness to engage in intergroup contact. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28(9),'' 1202-1214.&lt;/ref&gt; against a stigmatized group, such as African Americans, results in decreased expressions of prejudice, and a stronger willingness to engage in contact with members of the stigmatized group.

===Cognitive approaches===

'''''Thought awareness and suppression'''''.
Increasing a person’s awareness of his or her prejudiced thoughts and instructing that person to actively suppress those thoughts is a form of prejudice reduction that has been frequently studied in laboratory settings.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, I. V. (2002). The malleability of automatic stereotypes and prejudice. ''Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6(3),'' 242-261.&lt;/ref&gt; However, suppression does not always reduce prejudice and sometimes has the opposite effect of increasing it.&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, C. T., Perry, E. L., &amp; Bourhis, A. C. 2000. Ironic evaluation processes: effects of thought suppression on evaluations of older job applicants. ''Journal of Organizational Behavior, 21(6),'' 689–711.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Attitude reconditioning'''''.
There are several strategies that attempt to recondition or retrain implicit prejudiced attitudes – attitudes that exist outside of a person’s conscious awareness. One way of reconditioning implicit attitudes is through classical conditioning, whereby you pair a representation of a stigmatized group with positive images or positive words.&lt;ref&gt;Kawakami, K., Dovidio, J. F., Moll, J., Hermsen, S., &amp; Russin, A. (2000). Just say no (to stereotyping): effects of training in the negation of stereotypic associations on stereotype activation. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78(5),'' 871-888.&lt;/ref&gt; While this is helpful in reducing implicit prejudice, it is not necessarily successful at changing conscious attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, N., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (2001). On the malleability of automatic attitudes: combating automatic prejudice with images of admired and disliked individuals. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81(5),'' 800-814.&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of reconditioning is known as Situational Attribution Training.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, T. L., Latu, I. M., Kawakami, K., &amp; Myers, A. C. (2010). Consider the situation: Reducing automatic stereotyping through Situational Attribution Training. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46(1),'' 221-225.&lt;/ref&gt; This training, based on the [[ultimate attribution error]], reduces implicit prejudice by getting people to focus on situational explanations for negative behaviors displayed by members of stigmatized groups. Again, it is unclear if this leads to a decrease in conscious prejudiced attitudes.

'''''Thought process reconditioning'''''.
Some research suggests that teaching people how to engage in more complex thinking elicits less biased evaluations of outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, G. S. (1972). Complexity training and prejudice reduction. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 2(4),'' 326-342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schaller"&gt;Schaller, M., Asp, C. H., Roseil, M. C., &amp; Heim, S. J. (1996). Training in statistical reasoning inhibits the formation of erroneous group stereotypes. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22(8),'' 829-844.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instructing people on how to apply statistical reasoning to everyday judgments leads people to make more accurate assessments of outgroup members.&lt;ref name="schaller" /&gt;  

'''''Experts and norms'''''.
When people are told that experts believe personality traits are changeable and learned, they decrease in their stereotyping of stigmatized groups.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. R., Stroessner, S. J., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (1998). Stereotype formation and endorsement: The role of implicit theories. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(6),'' 1421-1436.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, stereotyping decreases when people are told that stereotyping of a particular stigmatized group is not the norm for their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C., Sechrist, G. B., &amp; Jost, J. T. (2001). Changing racial beliefs by providing consensus information. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27(4),'' 486-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Accountability and value consistency'''''.
Some prejudice reduction strategies rely on creating a sense of internal conflict. One such strategy involves holding people accountable for their prejudice. Prejudice has been shown to decrease when people are asked to provide concrete reasons for prejudiced beliefs. The process of generating these reasons gets people to consider the irrational nature of their prejudiced beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhausen, G. V., Kramer, G. P., &amp; Süsser, K. (1994). Happiness and stereotypic thinking in social judgment. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66(4),'' 621-632.&lt;/ref&gt; Another strategy is to get people to view prejudice as being inconsistent with their behaviors or valued attitudes. This creates [[cognitive dissonance]], and people attempt to resolve this tension by reducing expressions of prejudice. For example, after agreeing to write a public statement advocating a policy that is beneficial to racial minorities but costly to whites, whites report more personal support for this policy than before being asked to write the public statement.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt, D., Leippe, M. R., Rivers, J. A., &amp; Stambush, M. (2003). Counterattitudinal Advocacy on a Matter of Prejudice: Effects of Distraction, Commitment, and Personal Importance1. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 33(10),'' 2123-2152.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Self-affirmation'''''.
People are also less likely to endorse prejudiced beliefs when their own self-worth is affirmed. After being made to feel good about themselves, people are more likely to positively rate job candidates from stigmatized groups &lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1),'' 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt; and less likely to negatively stereotype people from stigmatized groups.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, L., &amp; Kunda, Z. (1999). Reactions to a black professional: motivated inhibition and activation of conflicting stereotypes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(5),'' 885-904.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrated approaches==
Integrated approaches to prejudice reduction include both intergroup and individual components, such as vicarious intergroup contact, perspective taking, and empathy. Many of these integrated approaches involve some form of entertainment.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt; After cooperative learning, entertainment-based interventions are the second most popular prejudice reduction strategy tested in non-laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt; Reading interventions are particularly popular.

'''Reading interventions'''.
Reading interventions typically take place in schools and last an average of 5 weeks. They attempt to influence prejudiced beliefs through the use of engaging stories.&lt;ref name="paluck" /&gt; Often these stories highlight positive interactions between children who are similar to those receiving the intervention and children who differ from them based on their membership in a stigmatized group. Furthermore, when an emphasis is placed on individual characteristics as opposed to group membership, an experience of vicarious intergroup friendship occurs, and this leads to more positive attitudes toward children from stigmatized groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, L., &amp; Rutland, A. (2006). Extended contact through story reading in school: Reducing children's prejudice toward the disabled.'' Journal of Social Issues, 62(3),'' 469-488.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little knowledge, however, of how such interventions influence children’s behavior in actual intergroup interactions.

==Prejudice reduction strategies not often studied==

Despite the fact that billions of dollars are spent on diversity training a year,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, F. (2003). Diversity's business case doesn't add up. ''Workforce, 82(4),'' 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt; workplace diversity training is not necessarily informed by prejudice reduction research, and its effectiveness in reducing prejudice has rarely been examined.&lt;ref&gt;Paluck, E. L. (2006). Diversity training and intergroup contact: A call to action research. ''Journal of Social Issues, 62(3),'' 577-595.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Banamex v. Narco News''''', 2001 603429/00, was a [[New York Supreme Court]] case that extended the findings of [[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]], that freedom of the press applied to an [[online newspaper]]'s reporting.

The court found that: "Narco News, its website, and the writers who post information, are entitled to all the First Amendment protections accorded a newspaper-magazine or journalist... Furthermore, the nature of the articles printed on the website and Mr. Giordano's statements at Columbia University constitute matters of public concern because the information disseminated relates to the drug trade and its affect{{sic}} on people living in this hemisphere..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/Censorship/SLAPP/Forum_shopping/BNM_v_Narco_News/20011205_decision.html|title=Text of the decision|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Narco News]] published a series of articles relating to the operation of [[Banamex]], one of the largest banks in [[Mexico]], and revealed a pattern of illegal and narcotics-related activity by those at the bank.  [[Banamex]] filed suit charging that they "have maliciously smeared Banamex with accusations that, among other things, it is controlled and operated by narcotics traffickers and has engaged in illegal activity."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5523">"'''Beautiful England'''" was the title of a series of short, illustrated travel/guide books first published in Britain by [[Blackie and Son Limited|Blackie &amp; Son]] around 1910 and continuing in print until the 1950s. Each title featured a particular region, town or city in [[England]] and was illustrated by watercolour landscape painter, [[E. W. Haslehust]].

Blackie &amp; Son also published other related series: "Beautiful Scotland" (4 vols. or 4 pts. in 1 vol.), "Beautiful Ireland" (Leinster, Ulster, Munster, Connaught; painted by Alex. Williams; described by Stephen Gwynn; 4 vols. or 4 pts. in 1) and "Beautiful Switzerland" (Chamonix; Lausanne and its Environs; Lucerne; Villars and its Environs: all pictured and described by George Flemwell).

'''Blake Snyder''' (October 3, 1957 – August 4, 2009) was an American [[screenwriter]], [[consultant]], [[author]] and [[educator]] based in Los Angeles who, through his ''Save The Cat'' trilogy of books on screenwriting and story structures, became one of the most popular writing mentors in the film industry. Snyder led international seminars and workshops for writers in various disciplines, as well as consultation sessions for some of Hollywood's largest studios.

Snyder died unexpectedly August 4, 2009, of what was characterized as either a [[pulmonary embolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles: Blake Snyder|url=http://www.storylink.com/profile/blakesnyder|website=ScriptMag.Com (was Storylink.Com)|publisher=The Writers Store|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Jay A.|title=Scribe Blake Snyder dies at 51|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scribe-blake-snyder-dies-51-87395|accessdate=January 5, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]/[[Associated Press]]|date=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finke|first1=Nikki|title=R.I.P.

== Early life ==
Snyder's father, Kenneth C. T. Snyder, was an [[Emmy]]-winning TV producer of many children's shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them were ''The Funny Company'', ''Hot Wheels'', animated segments on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Big Blue Marble'' and the cult classic ''[[Roger Ramjet]]''.

At the age of eight, Snyder was hired by his father as a voice talent for an animated special starring [[Sterling Holloway]]. Snyder continued doing children's voices alongside [[Gary Owens]], [[June Foray]] and others until his voice changed and he was fired by his producer father.

Snyder went on to earn a B.A. degree in English from [[Georgetown University]], and returned to Los Angeles where he began his career writing for the [[Disney]] TV series ''[[Kids Incorporated]]''. Snyder began writing full-time as a screenwriter in 1987. He was a member of the [[Writers Guild of America]] for over 20 years.

Snyder's first [[Spec script|spec]] screenplay sale was in 1989 for the script ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'', which sold for $500,000 in a bidding war.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;''Variety'', page 6, Nov. 1989 "First Time Writers Fare Well at W &amp; A" – ''Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot'' script sale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;''The Hollywood Reporter'', Cover Story, October 3, 1990 – "Fierce Bidding War".&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to sell 12 more original screenplays and was named "one of Hollywood's most successful spec screenwriters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersupercenter.com/studionotes/columns/column43.htm Screenwriter Blake Snyder], Hollywoodlitsales/StudioNotes&lt;/ref&gt; Million dollar script sales include ''[[Blank Check (film)|Blank Check]]'', co-written with Colby Carr for Walt Disney Pictures, and ''Nuclear Family'', co-written with James Haggin for [[Steven Spielberg]]/Amblin Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Variety2"&gt;''Variety'', page 5, April 12, 1993 – Blank Check script sale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR2"&gt;''The Hollywood Reporter'', page 4, April 12, 1993 – Blank Check and Nuclear Family script sales.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Save the Cat!'' ==
Snyder's nonfiction book ''Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need'' was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and in 2018 is on its 34th printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blake Snyder|url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Snyder/e/B00LWI2JXA|website=Amazon.Com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book describes in detail the structure of the [[monomyth]] or ''hero's journey'', providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Movie! |author=Peter Suderman | publisher=[[Slate.com]] |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/07/hollywood_and_blake_snyder_s_screenwriting_book_save_the_cat.single.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of the title ===
The title ''Save The Cat!'' was coined by Snyder to describe a decisive moment when the protagonist does something nice—like, literally, saving a cat.  Snyder writes that, "it's the scene where we [first] meet the hero," in order to gain audience favor and support for the main character right from the start.  In the opening scene of the movie, ''Frequency'', for example, Frank Sullivan, played by Dennis Quaid, is the veteran firefighter that jumps into a manhole to save two workers from a gas explosion.  Prior to his death-defying rescue, his chief warns, "Frank, you're not going to make it.  There's not enough time."  Frank, a true hero, doesn't seem overly alarmed.  This is what he does. His concern is primarily for the men below as he confidently jokes, "What, miss the World Series? Not a chance."  From this moment on, the audience is fully invested in Frank's wellbeing and rooting for him to succeed.

According to Snyder, this crucial element is missing from many of today's movies.  He referenced ''Lara Croft Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle of Life'' (2003) - as being a film that focused on making the character Lara Croft "cool" and sexy (via a "new latex body suit for Angelina Jolie") instead of likable.  An estimated $95 million was spent on this film, and it only grossed $156.5 worldwide ($65.6 million in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325703/business&lt;/ref&gt;  This sequel did not lose money, but it earned considerably less than the original ''Lara Croft Tomb Raider'' (2001), which grossed $274.7 million worldwide ($131.1 million in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146316/business&lt;/ref&gt;

His inspiration for this was the movie ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', where [[Sigourney Weaver]]'s character [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] saves a cat named Jones.

In his book, Snyder gave greatest emphasis on the importance of [[structure]] through his Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or the "BS2" which includes the 15 essential "beats" or plot points that all stories should contain.

Snyder's method expanded the 15 beats further into 40 beats, which are laid out on "The Board." The Board is divided into 4 rows, with each row representing a quarter of the story, namely the 1st Act, the 1st half of the 2nd Act, the 2nd half of the 2nd Act, and the 3rd Act.

Snyder also introduced 10 [[genres]] in his book that distinguished how stories are structured. According to Snyder, standard genre types such as Romantic Comedy, Epic or Biography did not say much about the story, only the type of movie it is. Snyder's system explored genre more fully, with categories such as "Monster in the House", "Golden Fleece", "Buddy Love" and others.

===Book series===
In 2007, Snyder wrote ''Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies''. The second book took 50 landmark movies, identified their specific genres, and broke them down into the 15 beats of the BS2.

The third book of Snyder's series, ''Save the Cat! Strikes Back: More Trouble For Screenwriters To Get Into… and Out Of'', was published in November, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suderman|first=Pete|title=Save the Movie!|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/07/hollywood_and_blake_snyder_s_screenwriting_book_save_the_cat.single.html|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last book in the series to be authored by Snyder himself.

The fourth book was a compliation of Blake's blogs and other writings on the subject of screenwriting, titled "Save the Cat! Blake's Blogs: More Information and Inspiration for Writers", (published in 2016).

The fifth book was written by his student, Spanish screenwriter and novelist [[Salva Rubio]]. It is titled "Save the Cat! Goes to the Indies" and features the analysis of 50 independent, European, auteur and cult films (published in April, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Cat|url=https://store.savethecat.com/collections/products/products/save-the-cat-goes-to-the-indies-the-screenwriters-guide-to-50-films-from-the-masters|publisher=Savethecat.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth is the first non-screenwriting book, ''Save the Cat! Writes a Novel: The Last Book On Novel Writing That You'll Ever Need'', written by student and YA novelist Jessica Brody, (published on October 9, 2018).

===Software===
As a companion to his books, Snyder developed a story structure [https://store.savethecat.com/products/save-the-cat-story-structure-software software] product called ''Save the Cat! The Last Story Structure Software You'll Ever Need''. The software places Snyder's ''Beat Sheet and Board'' on an [[end user]]'s desktop, phone, or tablet. In 2008, Snyder and software company [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]], Inc. specializing in script formatting, became partners in building import/export functions between the two programs.&lt;ref name="Final Draft"&gt;''Final Draft'' Press Release March 24, 2008 ''Final Draft Introduces Two New Development Software Partners''.&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder's company, Blake Snyder Enterprises, LLC, released an iPhone app of the software in November, 2009 and an Android app in 2016. Version 4 of the software and apps, which includes new templates for novelists and tv writers, will be released in the 4th quarter of 2018.

=== Workshops and consultations ===
Snyder developed two weekend workshops for writers, filmmakers and executives. The introductory class, ''The Beat Sheet Workshop'', helped participants come up with the solid structure of the 15 beats, before they embark on the actual writing of the script. In addition, The Beat Sheet Workshop was expanded to be led internationally.

The second workshop, a continuation of the first, called ''The Board Workshop'', had participants take their 15 beats and expand them into 40 cards for a more detailed story structure. Snyder held his workshops all over the United States, Europe and Asia. The workshops were run year round.  Snyder also taught his method in such universities as [[UCLA]], [[Chapman University]], [[Vanderbilt University]] and the [[Beijing Film Academy]].

The in-person Beat Sheet Workshops continue, taught by "Master Cats" who were mentored by Snyder. The Beat Sheet Workshops expanded with [http://www.savethecatu.com online courses] in 2017.

Following the release of his first book, Snyder provided script analysis to studios such as [[Disney]], [[DreamWorks]], [[Laika]] and [[Nelvana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethecat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Citizens Rule Book.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The cover of ''The Citizens Rule Book'']]

'''''Citizens Rule Book''''' is a handbook written to educate American citizens regarding their rights and responsibilities. It is a compilation of quotes from founders of the United States of America and select government documents, including information on the rights of a jury to "[[Jury nullification|nullify bad law]]" and acquit people on trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/militias.asp | title=Militias and 'Common Law Courts': 'Patriots' of the Web | publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |year= 2001 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the ''Rule Book'' says that jurors have the right to nullify a trial if the law is unconstitutional or is being used in an unconstitutional manner. Originally published anonymously, the ''Citizens Rule Book'' is now known to have been written by Charles R. Olsen, a World War II Marine veteran and printer from Boston.&lt;ref name="hsp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.homeschoolpatriot.com/citizens_rule_book.html |title=Citizens Rule Book &amp; Jury Handbook |publisher=[[Homeschool Patriot]] |year=2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205002543/http://www.homeschoolpatriot.com/Citizens_Rule_Book.html |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed by the [[Fully Informed Jury Association]], among other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fija.org/media-catalog/broc-pubs/|title=Brochures &amp; Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Citizens Rule Book'' is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the rights of juries, the second section discusses the views of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founders]] regarding jury trials, and the third section summarizes important founding documents of the United States.

===Section 1: A Handbook for Jurors===

The ''Citizens Rule Book'' claims that citizens are "[[wikt:above the law|above the law]]" and may nullify any law which is unconstitutional. It says that a citizen's power comes directly from [[God]], therefore jurors are not beholden to decisions made by [[judge]]s or other government agents. According to the book, "each JUROR has MORE POWER than the President, all of Congress, and all of the judges combined!"&lt;ref name=patriotnetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotnetwork.info/Citizens_rule_book.htm|title=Citizens Rule Book|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By issuing a [[verdict]] of "not guilty", even against the wishes of all other jurors, a single juror may [[hung jury|"hang"]] a trial, resulting in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]. The ''Rule Book'' advocates the use of this tactic to overturn cases in which a person is guilty of a [[crime]], but the law in question is [[unconstitutional]].

This section also says that the [[United States Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] are based on the [[Holy Bible|Biblical]] [[Ten Commandments]]. In contrast, "many of the planks of the [[Communist Manifesto]] are now represented by law in the U.S."&lt;ref name=patriotnetwork/&gt;

===Section 2: Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death!===

In this section, the ''Citizens Rule Book'' says that the founders of the United States believed all juries should be composed of people who personally know the accused. It quotes [[Patrick Henry]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John Holmes (U.S. politician)|John Holmes]], and [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] signatory [[James Wilson]] to the effect that jurors should be familiar with the "character" of the defendant on trial.

===Section 3: Index to the Original Documents===

In this section, the ''Citizens Rule Book'' provides summaries and commentaries on three important founding documents of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.

==Distribution==
The printers claim that over three million copies of the ''Citizens Rule Book'' have been published.&lt;ref name="hsp" /&gt; Family-owned and operated Whitten Printers continues to print and distribute this booklet. The ''Citizens Rule Book'' is available in single or bulk quantities direct from the publisher and online through Homeschool Patriot. The book is given away free through such sources as radio-host and filmmaker [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] with every order from his Infowars Shop, he also offers bulk-order options. Creationist [[Kent Hovind]] sold the book online through his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=485 | title=When Giants Roamed: A Florida theme park sells creationism — with an antigovernment twist| publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date= Summer 2004 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would appear that the ''Citizens Rule Book'' was prepared after 1971 but not revised since then, because every edition found includes the 26th Amendment (voting age of 18 years), adopted in July 1971, but not the 27th Amendment (limiting Congressional pay increases) which was adopted in May 1992.

==Notable events==
The ''Citizens Rule Book'' had a significant role in the 1997 [[Idaho]] trials of three [[Christian Identity]] militants and members of the Idaho Militia, who identified themselves as "[[Phineas Priesthood|Phinehas Priests]]". The three - Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Verne Jay Merrell - were charged with bombing a [[Planned Parenthood]] [[abortion clinic]], the [[Spokane Valley]] office of ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', and with twice robbing a [[U.S. Bank]] branch (April 1 and July 12, 1996).&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1396385/Al-Qaeda_and_the_Phinehas_priesthood_terrorist_groups_with_a_common_enemy_and_similar_justifications_for_terror_tactics |title=Al-Qaeda and the Phinehas Priesthood Terrorist Groups with a Common Enemy and Similar Justifications for Terror Tactics, A Dissertation |author=Danny Wayne Davis |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |date=December 2003 |page=117 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was mentioned in the opening statement for the defense in the trial of [[Timothy McVeigh]] as being possessed by one of the alternative suspects proposed by the defense.&lt;ref name=McVeigh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/Ftrials/mcveigh/defenseopen.html|title=Opening statement of defense attorney Steven Jones in the Timothy McVeigh trial|first=Prof.|last=Linder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mapp shows the [[parasite universe]] of [[List of dimensions of the Discworld#Death's Domain|Death's Domain]]. The accompanying booklet provides various details of the Domain, both as portrayed in the [[Discworld]] books and newly revealed.

In ''Death's Domain'', the concept of steam locomotives on Discworld is introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Death's Domain, p. 21 (last page with text)&lt;/ref&gt; which became the main theme of Pratchett's Discworld novel ''[[Raising Steam]]'' fourteen years later.

'''Digital Scriptorium (DS)''' is a non-profit, tax-exempt consortium of American libraries with collections of pre-modern manuscripts, or manuscripts made in the tradition of books before printing.&lt;ref name=IntroManuscriptStudies-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clemens|first1=Raymond|last2=Graham|first2=Timothy|title=Introduction to Manuscript Studies|date=2007|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0-80-143863-9|OCLC=487164034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryIlluminatedManuscripts-1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Hamel|first1=Christopher|title=A History of Illuminated Manuscripts|date=1997|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-71-483452-8|edition=2nd, revised and enlarged|OCLC=883857406}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DS database represents these manuscript collections in a web-based union catalog for teaching and scholarly research in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] studies. It provides access to illuminated and textual manuscripts through online cataloging records, supported by high resolution digital images, retrievable by various topic searches. The DS database is an open access resource that enables users to study rare and valuable materials of academic, research, and public libraries. It makes available collections that are often restricted from public access and includes not only famous masterpieces of book illumination but also understudied manuscripts that have been previously overlooked for publication or study.

==Background and membership==
[[File:BANCMSUCB147.jpg|thumb|Glossed Psalter, Paris, c. 1140-60; Berkeley, CA, U.C. Berkeley Bancroft Library, MS UCB 147, fol. 46v-47r.]]

Funded by grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, DS at its inception in 1997 was a joint project of the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (under Prof. Charles Faulhaber) and the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library of [[Columbia University]] (under Dr. Consuelo W. Dutschke). The plan was to digitize and make available on the World Wide Web catalog records and selected images from the two universities' [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] manuscript collections. The decision in favor of sample images rather than the complete imaging of manuscripts was originally practical, but today DS includes some records with sample and some with complete imaging. Records with sample images offer various pathways of entrance to the growing corpus of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts now available online. Because of patterns of collecting in the 19th and early 20th century, moreover, many manuscripts in American collections comprise partial texts or detached single leaves.&lt;ref name=ManuscriptIlluminationModernAge-2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hindman|first1=Sandra|last2=Rowe|first2=Nina Ariadne|last3=Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University|title=Manuscript Illumination in the Modern Age: Recovery and Reconstruction|date=2001|publisher=Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University|location=Evanston, Ill.|format=Exhibition catalog from 11 January – 4 March 2001|isbn=978-0-94-168021-9|OCLC=469528994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cataloging as many of these fragmentary works as possible increases the chance that some manuscripts could be reconstituted, if only virtually. Thus as a philosophical principle, DS includes large and small collections, complete bound books and single leaves.{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}

Between 1999 and 2002, additional holdings from [[Huntington Library]], the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and the [[New York Public Library]] were incorporated, along with those of a number of smaller collections. The database has continued to grow and represents the collections of over thirty member institutions, including not only those with substantial repositories, such as [[Harvard University]]'s [[Houghton Library]], [[Yale University]]'s [[Beinecke Library]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], but also libraries with few but rare works such as the Providence Public Library, which owns an unusual 15th century Bible (Wetmore Ms 1) in [[rebus]] format. As of September 2015, DS counts catalog records for 8,390 manuscripts and 47,624 digitized images.&lt;ref name=DigitalScriptorium-Institutions&gt;{{cite web|title=Participating Institutions and Contacts|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/digitalscriptorium/about/contact.html|website=Digital Scriptorium|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DigitalScriptorium-Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/ds/DS_STATS.html|website=Digital Scriptorium|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Scriptorium database enables public viewing of non-circulating materials normally available only to specialists with restricted access. As a visual catalog, DS allows scholars to verify cataloguing information about places and dates of origin, scripts, artists, and quality. Special emphasis is placed on touchstone materials such as manuscripts signed and dated by scribes, thus beginning the American contribution to the goal established in 1953 by the ''Comité international de paléographie latine'' (International Committee of Latin Paleography): to document photographically the proportionately small number of codices of certain origin that will serve stylistically to localize and date the vast quantities of unsigned manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Paleographia-Comite&gt;{{cite web|title=Comité international de paléographie latine|url=http://www.palaeographia.org/cipl/cipl.htm|website=Paléographia|accessdate=8 June 2016|quote=See the ''Comité'' website for the list of catalogues of dated and datable manuscripts published to date}}&lt;/ref&gt; DS publishes not only manuscripts of firm attribution but also ones that need the attention of further scholarship that traditionally would have been unlikely candidates for reproduction. Because it is web-based, it also allows for updates and corrections, and as a matter of form individual records in DS acknowledge contributions from outside scholars. Because the DS consortium consists of academic, public, and rare book libraries, it encourages a broad audience that benefits from a reciprocally beneficial body of knowledge. While attending to the needs of community of specialists: medievalists, classicists, musicologists, paleographers, diplomatists, literary scholars and art historians, DS also recognizes a public user community that values rare and unique works of historical, literary and artistic significance.{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}

==Bibliographic cataloging standard==
Working together the DS consortium has expanded the resources of libraries to manage collections of rare materials by providing a digital cataloging standard for pre-modern manuscripts. A DS record includes extensive and granular descriptive metadata supported by high resolution digital images. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts are best served by format-specific cataloging that is sensitive to their complexity as hand-made books and historical artifacts. They differ from modern manuscripts, such as letters or personal records, because although they are unique objects, they are usually not unique texts. They may be written, bound, and decorated by hand but most pre-modern manuscripts are books. The text of a fourteenth-century missal, for example, can be identified using an early twentieth-century printed version of the same text. Or several collections may own more than one manuscript of St. Augustine’s [[De Civitate Dei]] (The City of God). A DS search by title in fact retrieves fourteen copies of this work, all unique manuscripts dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries, owned by eight different libraries. The potential for relationships among manuscripts means that item-level, bibliographic cataloging rather than collection-based, archival cataloging best identifies and describes the content of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts.&lt;ref name=AHREMM-2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pass|first1=Gregory A.|title=AHREMM: Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts|date=2003|publisher=Bibliographic Standards Committee, Rare Books and Manuscripts Section, Association of College and Research Libraries, American Library Association|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-83-898218-1|OCLC=61659735}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi-xiii}} But these works also have historical and artifactual significance, so catalog records for [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts need to describe not only their contents but also the complete provenance (chain of ownership), binding (which may be from a later period than the rest of the book), marks of ownership (such as coats-of-arms), physical condition, material support (usually parchment), foliation and construction of the book, layout of the text, attribution of script, date (often estimated), style and localization of decoration and painted illustration, and names, not just of authors, but craftsmen, scribes, artists and owners.

[[File:HoughtonMSTyp0228.jpg|thumb|left|De Civitate Dei, France, c. 1300-1399; Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University, Houghton Library MS Typ 0228, fol. 1v]]

Some scholars of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts are less interested in the text of the manuscript than in some other aspect of its production.  The field of art history offers the most striking example; a scholar studying the art of the illuminator Mariano del Buono will care equally for the Harvard manuscript (a copy of Plato) and for the manuscript held by New York Public Library (a copy of Livy).  DS records factor for such interests and allow for searching on physical features only, whether by artist name (such as in the above example) or by place and date of origin ("Italy," and "1450-1499" would produce the same result).&lt;ref&gt;A DS Browse by artist, "Mariano del Buono," will retrieve four manuscripts: Cambridge, [[Harvard University]], [[Houghton Library]], MS Typ 0178; New York, [[New York Public Library]], NYPL Spencer 027 and NYPL Spencer 050; New Haven, [[Yale University]], [[Beinecke Library]], Beinecke MS 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before digitization, most records of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts were excluded from library public access catalogs but instead were published in printed books written by scholar-specialists for a similarly trained audience.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the book catalogs by C.W. Dutschke ([[Huntington Library]]), Laura Light ([[Houghton Library]]),  Lilian Randall ([[Walters Art Museum]]), Paul Saenger ([[Newberry Library]]), Savato Schutzner ([[Library of Congress]]), and Barbara Shailor ([[Beinecke Library]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to these DS records are similar to library cataloging records in that they are simplified, standardized and concise. Specialists may notice that a DS record omits some information (such as collation) available in scholarly catalogs, in order to avoid descriptions that would take too much time and discourage library catalogers from attempting the task.   In agreement with Green and Meisner, the goal has been "[[More Product, Less Process|more product, less process]]," or as the Spanish proverb goes, "lo mejor es enemigo de lo bueno."&lt;ref name=AmericanArchivist-MoreProductLessProcess-2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Mark A.|last2=Meissner|first2=Dennis E.|title=More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing|journal=American Archivist|date=Fall 2005|volume=68|issue=2|pages=208–263|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/pre-readings/IMPLP/AA68.2.MeissnerGreene.pdf|oclc=75268754|doi=10.17723/aarc.68.2.c741823776k65863}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DS record is thus not intended to serve as the ideal and thorough description of a manuscript, but rather a practical surrogate that still provides a better representation of it than a typical content-based OPAC ([[online public access catalog]]) record.

Compared to MARC ([[MARC standards]] are the bibliographic standards used by most American libraries), DS is better designed to describe not only the content but also the historical context and physical characteristics, while using sample images to support these descriptions. The sample images contain inherently descriptive information, and most DS records include digital images, although there are some exceptions. Although DS records can be adapted to MARC formats, DS better captures the complexity of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts than MARC.&lt;ref name=Storicamente-10YearsYoung-2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutschke|first1=Consuelo W.|title=Digital Scriptorium: Ten Years Young, and Working on Survival|journal=Storicamente|date=15 May 2008|volume=4|doi=10.1473/stor298|url=http://storicamente.org/dutschke|accessdate=8 June 2016|language=Italian|issn=1825-411X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, DS nests the sections of descriptive metadata in order to catalog a manuscript with multiple texts of multiple origins all in one binding, while MARC provides a flat file that can only deal with a coterminous text + physical unit. DS also indexes specific information pertinent to this format, with a separate field for "Artist," for example, rather than one for "personal names." DS also creates more focused records compared to archival cataloging based on EAD ([[Encoded Archival Description]]), because the latter is collections-based and not designed to be descriptive and searched at the item level. Thus the DS cataloging method has become the unofficial library standard for the online cataloging of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] manuscripts in the United States.

==Digital preservation and access==
[[File:BANCUBCMS150.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Hours]], England, c. 1440-1460; Berkeley, CA, U.C. Berkeley, Bancroft Library, UCB MS 150, fol. 9v-10r]]

The [[University of California, Berkeley]] provided the first home to the DS database, both in terms of managing the project and devising its initial technology. For an interim period of time (2003–2011) DS was hosted at [[Columbia University]] but is now returned to its original home at Berkeley. The technical innovations produced by the teams of both originating universities created a digital product based on a progressive, standards-based digitization policy.&lt;ref&gt;The technical development staff at Columbia included:  Terry Catapano, Joanna Dipasquale,  Dmitri Laury, Stuart Marquis, Leslie Myrick and Dave Ortiz; at Berkeley the technical staff includes (or included):  Mary Elings, John Hassan, Giulia Hill, Lynne Grigsby, Alvin Pollock and Merrilee Proffitt.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally using [[Microsoft Access]] to serve as a cross-institutional data collection tool, the DS database used SGML and later XML to aggregate and query the combined information.  The present platform managed by U.C. Berkeley depends upon software known as WebGenDB. WebGenDB is a non-proprietary, web-based interface for the underlying control database GenDB.&lt;ref name=WGDB-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Content Management System (WGDB)|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/LSO/digital_wgdb|website=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDLGuidelines-2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=CDL Guidelines for Digital Objects (CDL GDO)|url=http://www.cdlib.org/services/access_publishing/dsc/contribute/docs/GDO.pdf|website=[[California Digital Library]]|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GenDB houses the descriptive, structural and administrative metadata for the materials being digitized for web presentation, and outputs the metadata using the [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard]] (METS) format. METS provides an XML schema-based specification for encoding "hub" documents for materials whose content is digital.&lt;ref name=LC-METS&gt;{{cite web|title=METS: Metadata encoding and transmission standard|date=4 March 2011|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url= https://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "hub" document draws together potentially dispersed but related files and data. METS uses [[XML]] to provide a flexible vocabulary and syntax for identifying the digital components that together comprise a digital object, for specifying the location of these components, and for expressing their structural relationships. The digital components comprising a digital object could include the content files, the descriptive metadata, and the administrative metadata. METS can be used for the transfer, dissemination and/or archiving of digital objects, all in compliance with the [[OAIS]] (Open Archival Information System) reference model developed at [[OCLC]].&lt;ref name=OAIS-2004&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavoie|first1=Brian F.|title=The Open Archival Information System Reference Model: Introductory Guide|url=http://www.dpconline.org/docs/lavoie_OAIS.pdf|website=Digital Preservation Coalition|publisher=Office of Research, OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.|accessdate=8 June 2016|location=Dublin, OH|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DS reliance on [[OAIS]] (ISO 14721: 2003) promises secure digital preservation policy, supported by the [[California Digital Library]] digital curation services and the CDL "Merritt" digital archive.&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt|date=24 March 2011|publisher=[[California Digital Library]]|url=http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/merritt/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drik Picture Library''' is a picture library based in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh.

==Background==
Drik Picture Library was set up by Bangladeshi writer and photographer [[Shahidul Alam]] and Bangladeshi writer and anthropologist Rahnuma Ahmed{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} that has been awarded a grant by the [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Fund]].&lt;ref name="claus"&gt;"Network partnerships: Drik Picture Library, Dhaka, Bangladesh", Prince Claus Fund. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100704191141/http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/network_partnerships/drik.shtml Archived] by the Wayback Machine on 4 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency was set up in 1989{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} to provide a platform for local photographers in the majority world.&lt;ref name="claus" /&gt; ''Drik'' is [[Sanskrit]] for vision.&lt;ref name="claus" /&gt; Drik has gone on to provide media services that include web development, video production, print production and exhibitions. In 1998 it set up [[Pathshala]], the South Asian Institute of Photography, and [[Chobi Mela]], the first festival of photography in Asia. Drik uses new media extensively in its activism and introduced email to Bangladesh in the early nineties. It also set up Banglarights, the Bangladesh Human Rights Network, and DrikNEWS, independent news that extensively uses [[citizen journalism]]. Drik has also set up [[Majority World]], an unprecedented photo library and agency set up to promote the work of photographers from the [[Global South]] and to promote Fair Trade Photography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/17636/fair-trade-photography Fair Trade Photography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621105148/http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/17636/fair-trade-photography |date=21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is headquartered in [[Dhaka]], the capital of [[Bangladesh]], but also has branch offices in India and the UK.

==Pathshala South Asian Media Institute==
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=April 2015}}
'''Pathshala''', the ''South Asian Media Institute'' was set up in 1998 by the [[Bangladesh]] photographer, writer and activist Shahidul Alam, as "Pathshala South Asian Institute of Photography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesouthasian.org/archives/2008/ten_years_of_pathshala.html |title=Ten Years of Pathshala |last=Alam |first=Shahidul |date=3 February 2008 |website=The South Asian |type=Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706112030/http://www.thesouthasian.org/archives/2008/ten_years_of_pathshala.html |archivedate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is affiliated to [[Sunderland University]] and [[Bolton University]] in the UK; [[Oslo University College]] in Norway; [[Edith Cowan University]] in Australia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecu.edu.au/community-engagement/partnerships/arts/photomedia-summer-school-in-international-photo-journalism-and-documentary-photography |title=Photomedia Summer School in international photo journalism and documentary photography |website=Edith Cowan University |access-date=16 June 2015 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Danish School of Media and Journalism. It provides a Bachelors degree in photography which is, however, not recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC) or National University&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newagebd.com/2009/sep/14/time.html{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. {{broken citation|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 August 2009 |title=Pathshala graduates get certificates, chief airs anger |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2009/08/07/pathshala-graduates-get-certificates-chief-airs-anger |newspaper=bdnews24.com |access-date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliation with the country's oldest university, Dhaka University, is in process.

The school has however received death threats by fundamentalists claiming photography is un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/70969 |title=Bangladesh: Photography students receive death threats |last=Shah |first=Angilee |date=29 May 2007 |website=AsiaMedia |publisher=Asia Institute, UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students have been active in social movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thechobimelafiles.blogspot.com/2006/11/tuesday-7-november-portfolios-at.html |title=Portfolios at Pathshala |date=7 November 2006 |website=The Chobi Mela Files |type=Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have organised exhibitions addressing social concerns at overseas events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.lk/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/SRILANKAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21465611~menuPK:232812~pagePK:2865066~piPK:2865079~theSitePK:233047,00.html |title=Mobile Photography Exhibition Spreads Message in Sri Lanka |website=World Bank Sri Lanka |access-date=4 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616123209/http://www.worldbank.lk/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/SRILANKAEXTN/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A21465611~menuPK%3A232812~pagePK%3A2865066~piPK%3A2865079~theSitePK%3A233047%2C00.html |archivedate=16 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathshala, after consultations with international and local experts and local stakeholders, has now been set up as a media academy, to help strengthen other fields of media.

===Students===
Student awards have included first prize in [[World Press Photo]] Contest, The National Geographic All Roads Awards, and the [[Prix Pictet]]. Several students have made it to the [[Photo District News]]' 'PDN's 30 2008'&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pdngallery.com/gallery/pdns30/2008/ PDN's 30] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422065447/http://www.pdngallery.com/gallery/pdns30/2008/ |date=22 April 2015 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Alumna [[Taslima Akhter]] has won several awards, including the Best Photographer Award from the 5th Dali International Photography Exhibition in China.&lt;ref name="WPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/taslima-akhter |title=Taslima Akhter |publisher=World Press Photo |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Diccionario Heráldico y Genealógico de Apellidos Españoles y Americanos'' redirects here.

The '''''Enciclopedia Heráldica Hispano-Americana''''' (1919-1963) — in English, the '''''Encyclopedia of Spanish-American Heraldry''''' — is a massive work of genealogy and heraldry by two brothers — [[Alberto García Carraffa]] (1882-19??) and [[Arturo García Carraffa]] (20 Jan 1885-27 Jan 1963) — from [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]].

==The Work==
In 1919, the García Carraffas began their ''Enciclopedia'' and publication continued until 1963 when the last volume encompassing the letter "U" (surname “Urriza”) was published as a tribute to her late husband by [[Margarita Prendes Carraffa]]. The 88 volumes of this work are indebted to the work of many indefatigable genealogists and contain more than 15,000 genealogies and coats of arms. The work treats Spanish heraldry in the first two volumes, and with volume three begins the ''Diccionario Heráldico y Genealógico de Apellidos Españoles y Americanos'' ("Heraldic and Genealogical Dictionary of Spanish and American Surnames"), which is a listing of over 15,000 names with their respective genealogical histories (with color illustrations of representative crests) of Spanish and Spanish-American families.&lt;ref&gt;NB: On the spine one finds two numbers, the ''Enciclopedia'' number followed by the ''Diccionario'' number, i.e., there is a two volume difference in numbering.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the work has been continued by [[Endika de Mogrobejo]] bringing the total to 17,000 surnames.

==Editions==
*In 1952, a reprinting of the earlier volumes began. The alphabet covered by the work goes from "A" through "U".
*In 2010, an automated index created by the [[Library of Congress]], compiled all the names mentioned in the respective indices and allows a comprehensive search of all volumes at one time. (Previously, the structure of the work provided an index in each volume. As the work progressed, supplemental names were added, breaking the alphabetical continuum. Without perusing all the volumes one could never be sure that an article may not have been missed.)

The '''Epistle to the Easterners''' is an [[apostolic letter]] sent by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1848 to the [[bishop]]s and [[clergy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Churches]] not in full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Pope]], urging them to resume communion. 

The Epistle is the first of a series of apostolic letters and [[encyclical]]s published by Pius IX defining the terms and conditions for a reunification between the Roman Church and the Orthodox Churches, after the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054. The Pope's attitudes were later confirmed by the [[First Vatican Council]], over which he presided.

The letter was answered the same year by several leading members of the Orthodox Church, in the [[Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs]], which restated the [[theology|theological]] controversies between the two Churches, most notably the dispute over the addition of the [[Filioque]] to the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[papal supremacy]].

[[File:Fratelli alinari.jpg|thumb|Fratelli Alinari]]

'''Fratelli Alinari''' is the world's oldest [[photography|photographic]] firm, founded in [[Florence, Italy]] in 1852. Its archives contains 5.5 million photographs, ranging from [[daguerreotype]]s to modern digital photos from around the world.

== Founding ==
In 1852, Leopoldo Alinari founded a photographic studio. His brothers Giuseppe and Romualdo joined him two years later to establish Fratelli Alinari Fotografi Editori, a photographic workshop dedicated initially to the documentation of notable Italian paintings, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/1224/fratelli-alinari-italian-founded-1852/ Fratelli Alinari - The J. Paul Getty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently expanded the scope of their photographic project to include the towns and landscapes of Italy,&lt;ref name="Getty"/&gt; as well as [[portrait photography]] and images of national costume. The brothers achieved recognition for the quality of their work, and by 1860 their portrait subjects included the Italian royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yVFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25 Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography]''. Routledge. p. 25. {{ISBN|1135873267}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
It is the oldest foundation in the world still active in the field of photography, and more generally in the sphere of the image and communication.
Today Alinari is the guardian of a photographic ''corpus'' which includes a patrimony of its own of over 5,500,000 pictures, historical and contemporary, ranging from vintage prints, glass plate negatives to film and fotocolors, and is responsible for the management of an ongoing program of exhibitions and publishing. It can supply iconographical research services and manages both Italian and foreign photographic archives, constantly increasing its "image-bank", in part already on [[microfiche]]s and now also on digital supports which will be available for consultation on-line. Alinari also provides photographic publishing and its Art Printworks still uses the artisan technique of [[collotype]] on paper and silver plates from photographic images.

From 2007, the Museum of Multimedia and History of Photography (MNAF) is open to the public in [[Florence, Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnaf.it/ Museo Nazionale Alinari della Fotografia]&lt;/ref&gt; providing a special service on photographic exhibitions, permanent show of material about the history of photography, and education/training services for students and people with disabilities (there is a section with 3D images where blind people can touch 3D artifacts and understand the images in a unique way).

===Alinari on-line and the restoration laboratory===
In order to make the images available to a greater number of persons, Alinari has established an on-line search system of its photographic archives, employing a system of iconographic classification produced in collaboration with the [[University of Florence]] with over 330,000 images. 400 new images are added online daily. The digitization process is done using a Kodak EverSmart Supreme flatbed scanner and a Leaf/Mamiya 80 megapixels Aptus II 12 80 digital camera back. Color correction is done using Eizo monitors through a fully calibrated system. Color profiling is done using Adobe '98 color space.

===European projects===
In 1994 the firm began numerous initiatives for collaboration in technological and cultural projects in Europe. Among the most important are Aquarelle, Artline, Victor, Imprimatur, aceMedia, Euridice, 2Kan, Orpheus, Ermione, RegNet, TNT, Migrator 2000, eCHASE, aceMedia, Multimatch and today: MILE, Tripod, Eurogene, Fotomemoria, CITER and today GLOCAL, VisitoTuscany, CONVERGENCE, Paths, Decipher, Glocal and today BBinding, EuropeanaPhotography and Ambrosia. The Archive is active in Italy and Europe in several research and education research and marketing validation project, providing contribution mainly in  the following domains: [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]], [[digital rights management]], [[content provider]], 2D-3D applications, [[image enhancement]], intelligent content retrieval, web semantic and ontologies, [[distance learning]], preservation and [[image restoration]], validation, testing, mobile .app, exploitation, multimedia content supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.alinari.it/ Photolibrary Educational]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GoCompare''' is a British [[price comparison|financial services comparison]] website, established in Wales in 2006. It provides comparison details for financial products including car insurance, home and pet insurance and breakdown cover. Since 2009 its adverts have featured a fictional Italian tenor named Gio Compario (played by Welsh tenor [[Wynne Evans]]), which have been voted "most irritating advertisement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burn |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11359924/The-most-annoying-adverts-from-the-past-15-years.html |title=The most annoying adverts from the past 15 years |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

==History==
GoCompare was established in November 2006 and is based in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Wales]]. The company's founder was [[Hayley Parsons]], who worked for [[Admiral Insurance]] for 14 years,&lt;ref name=T0712 /&gt; and was formerly head of business development at [[Confused.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Start-up compares well for ex-Admiral worker |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/tm_headline=start-up-compares-well-for-ex-admiral-worker&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18653451&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=21 February 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons was replaced as CEO by Jon Morrell following a takeover by insurance company [[esure]] in March 2015 &lt;ref name="T0712" /&gt;

It was the first comparison site to focus on features of insurance products rather than just listing prices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2009/09/12/best-business-brains-receive-their-awards-at-celebration-of-local-talent-91466-24668772/|title=Best business brains receive their awards at celebration of local talent|author=Sion Barry|date=11 September 2009|work=walesonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the company being invited to become a member of the British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biba.org.uk/MediaCenterContentDetails.aspx?ContentID=987|title=Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company, which is 49% owned by esure, posted a pre-tax profit of £34.7 million for 2011, up 15% on the previous year.&lt;ref name=T0712 /&gt;

On 8 December 2014, [[esure]], the insurance company, acquired Gocompare.com in a deal worth £95 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Newport-based Gocompare.com in £95m takeover deal|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-30374855|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 the company was the subject of a demerger from esure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ican.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/alliance-news/gocomparecom-shares-begin-trading-after-esure-demerger-allipo-03-11-2016/|title=Gocompare.com Shares Begin Trading After esure Demerger|date=3 November 2016|publisher=TD Direct Investing|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[ZPG plc|ZPG's]] offer to buy the company for £460 million was rejected.&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a8b0afb8-983b-3417-a062-1ee6b2bc14d7 |title=ZPG confirms failed £460m bid for GoCompare.com |author=Aime Williams, Oliver Ralph |publisher=Financial Times |date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 GoCompare announced the acquisition of [[MyVoucherCodes]], one of the UK's largest online voucher code sites, in a £36.5m deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gocompare-myvouchercodes-takover-deal-buy-36-million-internet-comparison-websites-a8117701.html|title=GoCompare to buy MyVoucherCodes in £36.5m deal|date=19 December 2017|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
GoCompare provides a comparison service for [[vehicle insurance|vehicle]], [[home insurance|home]] and [[pet insurance]], and [[breakdown cover]]. It also provides comparison services for [[travel insurance]], gas and electricity, [[broadband internet access|broadband]], [[loan]]s, [[credit card]]s, mortgages and other financial products through preferred providers such as Energylinx and [[Experian]]. On 14 August 2012, the company launched "Covered mag", an online magazine that claims to be "unlike any other financial publication you've ever read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocompare.com/covered/|title=Covered mag, presented by Gocompare.com|work=gocompare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
In June 2009 the company launched an advertising campaign featuring a fictional Italian [[tenor]] called Gio Compario (pronounced: Jeo Campario) played by [[Wynne Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/927523/GoCompare-creates-opera-singer-Comparethemarkets-meerkat/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|title=GoCompare creates opera singer to take on Comparethemarket's meerkat|work=marketingmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements feature 'Gio' singing the 'Go Compare' tune (inspired by [[Over There]]) in various locations, and was voted as the most irritating advertisement of both 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/977046/irritating-ads-2009/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|title=The most irritating ads of 2009|work=marketingmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tellymix.co.uk/2011/news/25252-gocompare-car-insurance-telly-ad-named-most-annoying-of-2010.html|title='GoCompare' car insurance telly ad named most annoying of 2010|work=tellymix.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct response to this reaction, Go Compare deliberately subverted the campaign in July 2012 by running a series of adverts where celebrity guests such as [[Sue Barker]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Stuart Pearce]], [[Ray Mears]], [[Louie Spence]] and [[Stephen Hawking]] lined up to "silence" the character of Gio Compario. Marketing officer Kevin Hughes said "It was risky, but a brand has to listen to its customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postonline.co.uk/post/feature/2234998/marketing-and-advertising-small-screen-big-rewards|title=Marketing and advertising: Small screen, big rewards?|work=www.postonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character returned in July 2015 after an 18-month break, singing as part of what Evans called a "much calmer performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/go-compare-most-annoying-man-9723580|title=Go Compare: The most annoying man on telly is back|author=Karen Price|date=26 July 2015|work=walesonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The company won the 'One to Watch' category at the Fast Growth Business Awards 2008, with the judges complementing the management team for 'an extremely well-executed business with a clear [[Unique selling proposition|USP]] and strong brand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/fast-growth-business-awards/one-to-watch-2008/|title=One to Watch 2008|work=Fast Growth Business Awards by Startups.co.uk: Start up a successful business}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 it achieved the [[Investors in People]] award.&lt;ref name=WesternMail20100129&gt;{{cite news |title=Gocompare Hayley’s in a league of her own |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/television-in-wales/2010/01/29/gocompare-hayley-s-in-a-league-of-her-own-91466-25713058/ |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's founder, Hayley Parsons, was winner of the 'Woman in Business' award at the South Wales Chamber of Commerce Business Awards 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best business brains receive their awards at celebration of local talent |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2009/09/12/best-business-brains-receive-their-awards-at-celebration-of-local-talent-91466-24668772/ |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=12 September 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'s'' 'Welsh Woman in Innovation Award' in 2008, and the 'Business Leader' category in the Inspire Wales Awards 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/06/16/awards-recognise-active-citizenship-91466-26659882/|title=Awards recognise active citizenship|date=15 June 2010|work=walesonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards, which are organised by the [[Institute of Welsh Affairs]], recognise the role that Welsh residents play in encouraging active citizenship and in promoting their communities on a local, regional, national and global scale. In January 2012, Parsons was awarded an [[OBE]] for services to the economy.&lt;ref name=T0712&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
In September 2007 the company admitted that, on one occasion, an unlawful breach of privacy had taken place with regard to the passing on of data provided by customers. It said that this was the result of a breach of contract by a sub-contractor, Performance Direct, and stated that it would take immediate action to prevent it happening again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Personal details at risk on comparison websites |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article2499743.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |work=[[The Times]] |date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 the site was blacklisted for a time by [[Google]] due to "irregular inbound links". This resulted in its share of search traffic for the term "car insurance" reducing from 17.49% to 2.31%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Personal Reputation Management - Making The Internet Work For You |last=Halpern |first=Louis |author2=Roy Murphy |pages=162–163 |year=2009 |publisher=Halpern Cowan Publishing |isbn=978-0-9562892-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gocompare.com was blacklisted again in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GoCompare Car Insurance - www.gocompare.com - Go Compare Ban? |url=http://www.mns.co.uk/01212237.html |work=Money News Shopping |publisher=ASAP Ventures |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Square''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''المربع الذهبي''') was a group of four officers of the [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraqi]] armed forces who played a part in Iraqi politics throughout the 1930s and early 1940s.  The activities of the Golden Square culminated in supporting [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] in his [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|overthrow of government in 1941]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Time Magazine]], ''Trouble in Paradise''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The "Golden Square" included the four most important leaders of the "Circle of Seven." The Circle of Seven was a group of [[Sunni]] [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] military officers who were greatly influenced by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Ambassador]] [[Fritz Grobba]] and, in turn, greatly influenced politics in Iraq during the 1930s and early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Golden Square were [[Colonel]] [[Salah al-Din al-Sabbagh]], Colonel [[Kamil Shabib]], Colonel [[Fahmi Said]], and Colonel [[Mahmud Salman]]. During the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], the four members of the Golden Square commanded units located in the [[Baghdad]] area.  Salah ad-Din al-Sabbagh was commander of the Iraqi 3rd Infantry Division. Kamal Shabib commanded the 1st Infantry Division.  Fahmi Said commanded the Independent Mechanized Brigade.  Mahmud Salman, the one non-[[Iraqi Army|Army]] officer, was the Chief of the [[Iraqi Air Force|Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Golden Square were virulently anti-[[United Kingdom|British]].  In time, these men represented real power as successive Iraqi governments sought the support of the military for survival.  The members of the Golden Square looked to Germany to support them and, for his part, Grobba enthusiastically encouraged them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali and the Golden Square launched a [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|''coup d'etat'' to topple the government of the Regent, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah]].  The subsequent [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] ended disastrously for Rashid Ali and the members of the Golden Square who, for the most part, fled Iraq as the British closed in on [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, ''Everybody Loses''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guerrilla Warfare''''' ({{lang-es|La Guerra de Guerrillas}}) is a book by [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] that was written right after the [[Cuban Revolution]] and published in 1961. It soon became the guidebook for thousands of guerrilla fighters in various countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernesto "Che" Guevara  (World Leaders Past &amp; Present)'', by Douglas Kellner, 1989, Chelsea House Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55546-835-7}}, pg 81&lt;/ref&gt;

After his success in the Cuban Revolution, [[Che Guevara]] gained a global reputation as a rising revolutionary figure, which eventually led him to write ''Guerilla Warfare.'' In the manual, Guevara espouses three reasons for revolution: a lack of legitimacy by the incumbent elite to govern the country, the existence of tensions that cannot be addressed by regular channels, and all legal avenues to change the situation are perceived as closed.&lt;ref&gt;“Che Guevara on Guerrilla Warfare: Doctrine, Practice and Evaluation”, by Jose A. Moreno, 1970, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 12, No. 2. Cambridge University Press, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Although providing enough evidence and support for his ideas and tactics, Guevara on multiple occasions states that, while these tactics were effective for him and his men in Cuba, they will not necessarily be successful in other regions{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

==Synopsis==
''Guerrilla Warfare'' is a manual for the left-wing insurgency that draws on Guevara's experience as a participant in the Cuban revolution. It elaborates the [[foco theory]] (''foquismo''), for which the guerrilla operates as a vanguard even before the development of the "objective" conditions for a popular uprising.

While many draw parallels with [[Mao Zedong]]'s ''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'', Guevara claimed he had not read Mao's book. Instead it draws on the lessons of fighting during the [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban Revolutionary War]], which in turn were informed by two books from the [[Spanish Civil War]], ''Nuevas guerras'' and ''Medicina contra invasión'', stressing the need for an underpinning political motivation to guerrilla methods, organisation and supply.

Guevara divides the book into three different Chapters, each entailing their own perspectives on the roles of those who belong to a revolutionary cause. The first chapter labeled “General Principles of Guerrilla Warfare”, discusses the basics of what it means to be part of a Guerrilla War; the topics range from the essences of Guerrilla Warfare to tactics, strategies, and suburban warfare. Chapter two, labeled “The Guerrilla Band”, talks about the roles that a Guerrilla fighter must take on while being part of a revolution, things ranging from being a social reformer to being a combatant, to even the organization and development of the band before and after the war. Chapter three, labeled “Organization of Guerilla Front”, focuses more on the logistics of a Guerrilla War, ranging from supplies to training. It is an all aspects sort of chapter which goes into further detail than the previous two chapters.&lt;ref&gt;“Guerrilla Warfare”, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the manual is devoted to matters of a practical nature, such as the type of armaments best suited to guerrilla forces, and the optimum size of a given guerrilla band.

Guevara emphasizes that guerrilla warfare is a favorable method only against totalitarian regimes, (such as the revolutionary war against the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista dictatorship]] in Cuba), where political opposition and legal civil struggle is impossible to conduct. South African revolutionaries read the work in the early 1960s; former Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils notes that the Apartheid regime's police questioned his late wife about an order of "Che Guevara's book on guerrilla warfare."&lt;ref&gt;Kasrils, Ronnie. ''The Unlikely Secret Agent''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1583672778}}. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara dedicated the book to his recently deceased comrade [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], "who should have read and corrected it, but whose fate prevented him from carrying out the task."

==Themes==

=== Pro-Guerrilla ===
Guevara states that the "three fundamental lessons" of the Cuban revolutions are:

"1) Popular forces can win a war against the army. 2) It is not necessary to wait until all conditions for making revolution exist; the insurrection can create them. 3) In underdeveloped America, the countryside is the basic area for armed fighting."&lt;ref&gt;''Guerrilla Warfare'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

This book can be seen as an example of how to continue the Guerrilla front in a struggling revolution. By providing tactics and strategies to other fighters this book serves as a guidebook for future revolutionaries.

Even though the role of a guerrilla fighter is to fight any life with their life on the line, it is seen as though the fighter is the core strength of the revolution. Without any fighter willing to lay their life on the line for the concept of the revolution, a revolution can not occur. The vanguard of the fighters is seen as the driving force of not only the bands power but also the driving force in the reform of society and the spreading of revolutionary ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;“Che Guevara on Guerrilla Warfare: Doctrine, Practice and Evaluation”, by Jose A. Moreno, 1970, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 12, No. 2. Cambridge University Press, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Reform ===

In the book, Guevara talks about how in addition to being a Guerrilla fighter, they must also be social reformists. They must live through example, they must live an ascetic life with impeccable morality with strict self-control, so that they may always stay on the right path.&lt;ref&gt;“Che Guevara on Guerrilla Warfare: Doctrine, Practice and Evaluation”, by Jose A. Moreno, 1970, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 12, No. 2. Cambridge University Press, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; With the vanguard of the Guerrilla front being a central focal point for social reform, through their lives and examples society as a whole will reform to revolutionary ideals.

Guevara also talks about the need to protect civilians, "a peasant must always be helped technically, economically, morally, and culturally, the guerrilla fighter will be a sort of guardian angel" by saving and helping the peasants the process of social reform will increase.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Warfare, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat ===

Guevara discusses different combat themes throughout the book, each one focusing mostly on combat between organized military groups versus Guerrilla fronts. Strategies ranged from extremely organized strikes against fortified  military strongholds, sabotage, to hit and run tactics. Most of these strategies were focused on fighting on uneven grounds since it can be assumed that the Guerrilla front will be undermanned and under supplied.

Even though tactics and combat are discussed throughout the book, these tactics should be taken as mere examples of effective ways to combat an opposing force. Tactics should be taken and applied to an appropriate situation, but if a fighter finds that the tactic does not serve its intended function they must be able to adapt and find ways to continue. Even though all fighters are expected to lay down their life for the cause of the revolution, it is made clear that human life is the most precious of resources and that if possible a fighter must aim to preserve their life as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Guerrilla Warfare'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism  ==

=== Foreign Military Involvement ===
While the book was intended for other revolutionary movements in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], it was also studied by [[counter-revolutionary]] military schools.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc (1986), p.380&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of Che's military campaign in Cuba and the spreading of the communism in [[Latin America]], the rise of US military involvement increased throughout the region following their success.

=== Reviews ===

Although the book received an overwhelmingly positive acceptance by Left-wing individuals, the Right-wing did not agree with the publishing of the book. Even though it was accepted by the Left, even they think that Che depicts the process of a Guerrilla war as overly simple and somewhat based on chance. For instance {{Quote|"The basic and final thesis is that guerrilla warfare can be successful only when the population is in favour of the guerrilleros and is willing to aid and shelter them." | Renzo, Sereno &lt;ref&gt;Sereno R. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science: GUEVARA, CHE. "Guerrilla Warfare" (Book Review). Published by A.L. Hummel for the American Academy of Political and Social Science; 03/01/1962;340:132.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{Quote| "Aside from Che's own compelling rhetoric, each of the case histories demonstrates his influence and the application of his analysis in very specific terms." | Wayne, Clegern &lt;ref&gt;Clegern WM. The Hispanic American historical review: "Guerrilla Warfare", by Che Guevara (Book Review). Board of Editors of the Hispanic American Review; 05/01/1986;66:392.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Chris Messina - South by Southwest 2010 (1).jpg|alt=Chris Messina proposed the use of hashtags in his famous 2007 tweet. |thumb|Chris Messina, the inventor of the hashtag. |440x440px]]A '''hashtag''' is a type of [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tag]] used on [[Social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Twitter]] and other [[microblogging]] services, allowing users to apply [[wikt:dynamic#Adjective|dynamic]], [[user-generated content|user-generated]] tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores.&lt;ref name="charset"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/what-characters-can-a-hashtag-include/|title=What Characters Can A Hashtag Include?|author=|date=|website=hashtags.org|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsia-Ching|last2=Iyer|first2=Hemalata|title=Trends in Twitter - Hashtag Applications: Design Features for Value-Added Dimensions to Future Library Catalogues|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/485537|journal=Library Trends|volume=61|issue=1|pages=248–258|doi=10.1353/lib.2012.0024|issn=1559-0682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on the [[photo sharing|photo-sharing]] service [[Instagram]], the hashtag ''#bluesky'' allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag.  

The use of hashtags was first proposed by [[Chris Messina (open-source advocate)|Chris Messina]] in a 2007 tweet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412|title=🅲🅷🆁🅸🆂 🅼🅴🆂🆂🅸🅽🅰︎ on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, although initially decried by Twitter as a "thing for nerds"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/decade-ago-hashtag-reshaped-internet-180964605/|title=A Decade Ago, the Hashtag Reshaped the Internet|last=Panko|first=Ben|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eventually led to their use spreading like wild-fire through the platform.

So much so that Instagram had to officially place a "30 hashtags" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.instagram.com/351460621611097|title=How do I use hashtags? {{!}} Instagram Help Center|website=help.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a limit which [[Instagrammer|Instagrammers]] eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itchban.com/blog/2017/1/7/instagram-max-hashtags-how-to-post-up-to-60|title=Instagram Max Hashtags: How to post up to 60|work=itchban|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites|title=Website Ranking: Top Websites Rank In The World - SimilarWeb|website=www.similarweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is highly common with [[millennials]], [[Generation Z|Gen Z]], politicians, [[Influencer marketing|influencers]], and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, ''hashtag'' was added to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/13/hashtag_added_to_the_oed/|title='Hashtag' added to the OED – but # isn't a hash, pound, nor number sign|date=June 13, 2014|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|title=New words notes June 2014|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007085108/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|archivedate=October 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''hashtag'' is also sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/389023#eid301493073|title=Oxford English Dictionary – Hash|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] by the markup that hashtags provide; this process is called [[folksonomy]].
== Origin and use ==
The [[Number sign|US pound sign, number sign or hash symbol]] "#" is often used in [[information technology]] to highlight a special meaning. ("Pound sign" in the UK means "[[£]]"; "#" is called hash, gate, and occasionally [[octothorpe]].) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the assembly language of the [[PDP-11]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] used ''#'' in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] for special keywords that had to be processed first by the [[C preprocessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The C Programming Language]]|authors=B.W. Kernighan &amp; d. Ritchie|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1978|pages=86 and 207|isbn=0-13-110163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 [[SGML]] standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data.[[File:Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (14203190979).jpg|thumb|A sign suggesting the use of a #TimeToAct hashtag at a 2014 conference|alt=|440x440px]]

The International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pound sign was adopted for use within [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.&lt;ref&gt;"Channel Scope". Section 2.2. {{IETF RFC|2811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an [[ampersand]] '&amp;').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Internet Relay Chat Protocol |rfc=1459 |sectionname=Channels |section=1.3 |page= |last1=Oikarinen |first1=Jarkko |authorlink1=Jarkko Oikarinen |last2=Reed |first2=Darren |authorlink2= |year=1993 |month=May |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the pound sign in IRC inspired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/summer/originstory.shtml |title=#OriginStory|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Messina (open source advocate)|Chris Messina]] to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/fashion/hashtags-a-new-way-for-tweets-cultural-studies.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Twitter's Secret Handshake | work=The New York Times | date=June 10, 2011 | accessdate=July 26, 2011 | author=Parker, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted the first hashtag on Twitter:
{{quote |1=How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? |author = Chris Messina |source = ("factoryjoe"), August 23, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/223115412|title = Twitter post|author = Chris Messina ("factoryjoe")|date = August 23, 2007&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 50% |align  = center }}
Messina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the [[2007 California wildfires#San Diego County|2007 San Diego forest fires]] in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ What is hashtag?"], Mashable, 8 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factoryjoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factoryjoe.com/2007/10/22/twitter-hashtags-for-emergency-coordination-and-disaster-relief/|title=Twitter hashtags for emergency coordination and disaster relief|website=Factory Joe|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for "lay" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag "was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Kate|date=May 1, 2015|title=The pragmatics of hashtags: Inference and conversational style on Twitter|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821661500096X|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=81|pages=8–20|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2015.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.

Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-language hashtags in communications during the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The story of the hashtag began with Iranians|url=http://www.dw.de/حکایت-هشتگی-که-ایرانیان-آغاز-کردند/g-18012627|accessdate=March 12, 2015|publisher=Deutsche Welle Persian|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stoweboyd.com/post/39877198249/hash-tags-twitter-groupings |title=Stowe Boyd, Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings |publisher=Stoweboyd.com |date= |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]], chair of the [[American Dialect Society]]'s New Words Committee.

Beginning July 2, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter Makes Hashtags More #Useful|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/twitter-makes-hashtags-more-useful/|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to [[spamming|spam]] the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |title=The Secret of Twitter's Trending Hashtags With Insight and Tips |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/12/tech/social-media/facebook-hashtags/index.html|title=Facebook finally gets #hashtags - CNN.com|last=Mashable|first=By Christina Warren|website=CNN|access-date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
A hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space, or end of message. It is always safe to precede the “#” with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases other characters are also allowed, in particular accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another, and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&amp;Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&amp;, or #Romeo&amp;Juliet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtags are not case sensitive; a search for “#hashtag” will find “#HashTag”. The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases readability and avoids confusion; a (real) pen shop would be advised to use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penisland.net/ |title=Pen Island Pens - Home |website=Penisland.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g. “It is #sunny today”).

Languages which do not use letters are handled slightly differently. In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我&amp;#8204;#爱&amp;#8204;你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the "absolute maximum", and any contribution exceeding this risks "raising the ire of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a (#) Hashtag?|url=http://www.hashtags.org/how-to/history/what-is-a-hashtag/|publisher=Hashtags.org|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=September 22, 2017|quote=if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA |title="#Hashtag" with Jimmy Fallon &amp; Justin Timberlake (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Hashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can "trend" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the "Trending Topics" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be "retired" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.

Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.

Hashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and "follow" (subscribe) or "list" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.

Television broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.

Hashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Olszanowski, M. (2014). "Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83–95. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous Youtube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.

Hashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikström|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. "My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with "It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, "BREAKING: US GDP growth is back! #kidding". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: "Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility," where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skase.sk/Volumes/JTL28/pdf_doc/05.pdf|title=The ‘hashtag’: A new word or a new rule?|last=Caleffi|first=Paola-Maria|date=|website=Skase Journal of Theoretical Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on [[YouTube]] and [[Gawker Media]]. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gawker.com/5382267/anarchy-in-the-machine-welcome-to-gawkers-open-forums|title = Anarchy in the Machine: Welcome to Gawker's Open Forums|author = Gabriel Snyder|publisher = Gawker|date = October 15, 2009&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/got-a-tip-gawker-media-opens-tag-pages-to-masses-expecting-chaos/|title = Got a #tip?

Seward|publisher = Nieman Journalism Lab|date = October 15, 2009 &lt;!-- 8 a.m. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time search aggregators such as the former [[Google Real-Time Search]] also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the "river" of Twitter posts that can result from search terms or hashtags.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Uses ==

=== Broadcast media ===

The use of hashtags has extended to [[television]]{{nsmdns}}a concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;|author = Michael Schneider|publisher = TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or "branded" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as [[Ed Schultz|@edshow]]) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to "trend" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, "temporary" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|publisher = Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of trending "temporary" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called "Tonight Show Hashtags," which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the "Tonight Show Hashtags" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "[[Index term|keywords]]" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords — But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled "Hashtag Wars," in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.

Some hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan "''[[Je suis Charlie]],''" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.

=== Purchasing ===

Since February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Event promotion ===

[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights|alt=|440x440px]]

Organized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.

Companies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.

Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] as the "#HELSINKI2018 Meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumer complaints ===
Hashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term "bashtag" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentiment analysis ===
The use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets? Investigating the impact of sarcasm on sentiment analysis|journal=Proceedings of the Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a difficult [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] problem.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/power-yourself-with-viral-marketing-become-a-hashtag_us_57bf13e6e4b06384eb3e7f1d?dxrywr9zcw30rizfr|title=Power yourself with viral marketing - become a HashTag Genius &amp;#124; HuffPost|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
The YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, [[Hashtag United F.C.]].

Since the 2012–13 season, the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/11/15/2014-nba-all-star-ballot-official-release/|title=NBA and Sprint tip off NBA All-Star Balloting 2014|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
During the [[2011 Canadian leaders debates|April 2011 Canadian party leader debate]], [[Jack Layton]], then-leader of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], referred to [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s crime policies as "a hashtag fail" (presumably #fail).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jack-laytons-debatable-hashtag-fail/article576224/|title = Jack Layton's debatable 'hashtag' #fail|author = Anna Mehler Paperny|publisher = The Globe and Mail|date = April 13, 2011 &lt;!-- , 6:00 AM EDT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/13/cv-debate-twitter.html|title = Canadians atwitter throughout debate|date = April 13, 2011&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;|publisher = CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "hashtag [[Hip hop music|rap]]", coined by [[Kanye West]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/11/the_ten_best_qu.php|title = The Ten Best Quotes From Kanye West's Epic Hot 97 Interview With Funkmaster Flex|author = Zach Baron|publisher = The Village Voice|date = November 3, 2010|access-date = July 22, 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130722084923/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/11/the_ten_best_qu.php|archive-date = July 22, 2013|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in the 2010s to describe a style of rapping which, according to Rizoh of the ''[[Houston Press]],'' uses "three main ingredients: a metaphor, a pause, and a one-word [[punch line]], often placed at the end of a rhyme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2011/07/a_brief_history_of_hashtag_rap.php|title = A Brief History Of Hashtag Rap|author = Rizoh|publisher = Houston Press|date = July 7, 2011 &lt;!-- at 9:00 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappers [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Big Sean]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], and [[Lil Wayne]] are credited with the popularization of hashtag rap, while the style has been criticized by [[Ludacris]], [[The Lonely Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2013/05/22/the-lonely-island-puts-hashtag-rap-in-its-place-looking-at-you-drake|title = The Lonely Island Puts Hashtag Rap In Its Place (Looking at You, Drake)|author = David Mendez|date = May 22, 2013 &lt;!-- AT 11:43 AM --&gt; |publisher = Tucson Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various music writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joplinglobe.com/enjoy/x1666506743/Jeremiah-Tucker-Hashtag-rap-is-2010s-lamest-trend|title = Jeremiah Tucker: Hashtag rap is 2010's lamest trend|author = Jeremiah Tucker|date = December 17, 2010|publisher = Joplin Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2013, a hashtag, #TwitterIPO, appeared in the headline of a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' front-page article regarding Twitter's [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Bird's Eye]] foods released in 2014 a shaped [[mashed potato]] food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called "Mashtags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds Eye launches Mashtags – social media potato shapes|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fmcg/birds-eye-launches-mashtags-potato-shapes/354514.article|work=The Grocer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations,&lt;ref name="macmillandictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/hashtag|title=hashtag (noun) definition and synonyms|website=Macmillan Dictionary|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "I’m hashtag confused!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about a new [[hand gesture]] that mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the "finger hashtag", in which both hands form a [[Peace sign#The V sign|peace sign]], and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2012/aug/01/how-to-say-hashtag-fingers |title=How to say 'hashtag' with your fingers |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Tom Meltzer |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging gesture was reported about in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' by [[Nimrod Kamer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/06/hashtags |title=Finger-Hashtags |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=March 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by [[Jimmy Fallon]], and on ''[[The Colbert Report]],'' among other programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/finger-hashtag-jimmy-fallon-twitter/ |title=I invented finger hashtags—and I regret nothing |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a [[fad]], but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Adaptations ===
*Hashflags: In 2010, Twitter introduced "hashflags" during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |title=Twitter Supports World Cup Fever with Hashflags |publisher=Ryanseacrest.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129201517/http://ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |archivedate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reintroduced the feature on June 10, 2014, in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howto.digidefen.se/twitter/What-are-hashflags.php |title=What are Hashflags? |publisher=Howto.digidefen.se |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Woods |url=https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2014/06/10/twitter-brings-back-hashflags-just-time-world-cup-2014-kick/ |title=Twitter brings back hashflags just in time for World Cup 2014 kick-off |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again on April 10, 2015, with UK political party logos for the 2015 UK General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter just launched election hashflags|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32249518/twitter-just-launched-election-hashflags|website=BBC News|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a user tweets a hashtag consisting of the three letter country code of any of the 32 countries represented in the tournament, Twitter automatically embeds a flag emoticon for that country. A similar system was implemented for the 2015 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Twitter hashflags go live!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_twitter_hashflags_go_live|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cashtags: In 2009, [[StockTwits]] used [[ticker symbol]]s preceded by the [[dollar sign]] to create "cashtags".&lt;ref name=Wong2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wong, Matthew |title=VCs and Start-Ups Pin Their Hopes on Pinterest |date=August 17, 2012 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/08/17/vcs-and-start-ups-pin-their-hopes-on-pinterest/ |accessdate=May 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, Colleen |title=Howard Lindzon on Why He Sold His Twitter Stock, And The 'Hijack' Of StockTwits’ Cashtags [TCTV] |date=July 1, 2012 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/howard-lindzon-on-why-he-sold-his-twitter-stock-and-the-hijack-of-stocktwits-cashtags-tctv/ |accessdate=May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Twitter adapted the hashtag style to make company ticker symbols preceded by the dollar sign clickable (as in [[Apple, Inc.|$AAPL]]), a method that Twitter dubbed the "cashtag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim |first=Erin |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/31/technology/twitter-cashtag/ |title=Twitter unveils 'cashtags' to track stock symbols – Jul. 31, 2012 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/30/3205284/twitter-stock-ticker-cashtag-links-official |title=Twitter makes stock symbol $ 'cashtag' links official, following # and @ |publisher=The Verge |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to allow users to search posts discussing companies and their stocks. This is also used for discussion of currency pairings on Twitter, e.g. using #USDGBP or $USDGBP,  when mentioning the US Dollar's level expressed in Pounds Sterling.

'''Heidi Lee Morgan''' (born June 29, 1967) is a retired American [[professional wrestler]] who competed in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], [[International World Class Championship Wrestling]], [[Ladies Pro Wrestling Association]], and [[National Wrestling Federation]]. She was also a member of the wrestling stable [[Team America (wrestling)|Team America]].&lt;ref name=bodyslam/&gt;

==Career==
Morgan began her career at the age of ten, under the name Daisy Mae, as the valet for her father Les Morgan.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/morgans.html|title=It's a family affair for the Morgans|author=Rick Bauer|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-16|date=January 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, Morgan pursued a career as a [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]] and was approached at an exhibition by [[Vince McMahon]] about a wrestling career.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; After deciding to join the family business, she was trained by [[The Fabulous Moolah]], [[Wolfgang Von Heller]] and [[Johnny Rodz]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; After working on the independent circuit in North and South Carolina, she joined the [[National Wrestling Federation]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; As part of the Federation, Morgan [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with [[Wendi Richter]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; She battled Richter, the NWF Women's Champion, in a first ever women's [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] in May 1987.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Morgan later held the LPWA Tag Team Championship with [[Misty Blue Simmes]] and the WWWA Ladies Championship during her career.

She also appeared in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in late 1993 and into 1994, losing to [[Debrah Miceli|Alundra Blayze]] in the finals of the tournament to determine a new WWF Women's Champion on December 13, 1993. During this match, Heidi Lee Morgan was wearing  spandex tights.  In subsequent rematches, Blayze defended the title against her in [[house shows]] before Morgan and Blayze later teamed up to face [[Keiko Nakano|Bull Nakano]] and [[Luna Vachon]] on ''[[WWF Sunday Night Slam]]'' and other televised shows.

After giving birth to her daughter, Morgan wanted to revive her wrestling career in 1997, but she broke her back in her first match back in the ring.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; She attempted an [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuver]], but she and her opponent lost their balance, which resulted in the break.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

==Personal life==
She married a man named Archie and had a daughter named Adrianna.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Her family owns a professional wrestling school called Ringmasters Wrestling School.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

A '''historical atlas''' is an [[atlas]] that includes historical [[map]]s and charts depicting the evolving [[geopolitical]] landscape. They are helpful in understanding historical context, the scope and scale of historical events and historical subjects (such as the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]), and [[macro-history]]. Some historical atlases try to present the entire history of the world, such as the ''[[Historical Atlas of the World]]'', while others are more specialised, for only one time period or location, such as the ''[[Historical Atlas of the American West]]'' or ''[[The Historical Atlas of China]]''. They may also include historical photographs and explanatory text or essays.

The first known historical atlas was the ''Parergon'' by [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1579, which was a supplement to the [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]. [[William R. Shepherd]] produced a well-known Historical Atlas in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/history_shepherd_1911.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Colin McEvedy]] was one of the first to produce historical atlases using the same base map throughout many time periods, in his Penguin atlas of history series, which has become common in modern atlases. Recently, historical atlases have been made available online.

[[File:20-21 Portman Square.jpg|thumb]]
'''Home House''' is a [[Georgian_architecture|Georgian]] [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|town house]] at 20 [[Portman Square]], London.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1227105 |desc=Home House (Courtauld Institute) |access-date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Wyatt]] was appointed to design it by [[Elizabeth, Countess of Home]] in 1776, but by 1777 he had been dismissed and replaced by [[Robert Adam]].  Elizabeth left the completed house on her death in 1784 to her nephew William Gale, who in turn left it to one of his aunts, Mrs Walsh, in 1785.  Its later occupants included the [[Anne-César, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Marquis de la Luzerne]] during his time as French ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]] (1788 to 1791), the [[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl|4th Duke of Atholl]] (1798 to 1808), [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|the Duke of Newcastle]] (1820 to 1861), Sir [[Francis Henry Goldsmid]] (1862 to 1919), and [[John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington|Lord and Lady Islington]] (1919 to 1926).

In 1926, it was leased by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] to house his growing art collection.  On his wife's death in 1931, he gave the house and the collection to the fledgling [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] (which he had played a major part in founding) as temporary accommodation. A permanent accommodation was not forthcoming, and the Institute remained in the building until 1989, when it moved to its present home of [[Somerset House]]. Home House was appointed a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I]] listed building in 1954.&lt;ref name='EngHet'/&gt; Home House then remained vacant for seven years, until it was acquired by Berkeley Adam Ltd.  

It is home to artwork by [[Zaha Hadid]] in the form of a Cocktail Bar, this bar contains her signature sweeping lines and located in No. 21.

[[File:SirJohnStainer.JPG|thumb|Sir John Stainer]]
'''Sir John Stainer''' (6 June 1840&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 1901) was an English composer and organist whose music, though not generally much performed today (except for ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'', still heard at [[Passiontide]] in many churches of the [[Anglican Communion]]), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for [[Anglican church music]] that are still influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather Professor of Music at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

Stainer was born in [[Southwark]], London, in 1840, the son of a [[Cabinetry|cabinet maker]]. He became a [[Choir|chorister]] at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] when aged ten and was appointed to the position of organist at [[St Michael's College, Tenbury]] at the age of sixteen. He later became organist at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], and subsequently organist at St Paul's Cathedral. When he retired due to his poor eyesight and deteriorating health, he returned to Oxford to become Professor of Music at the university. He died unexpectedly while on holiday in Italy in 1901.

==Early years==
John Stainer was the eighth of nine children born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary.&lt;ref name= Dibble6&gt;Dibble, pps. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in [[Southwark]], London, where his father was a cabinet maker and later a [[vestry]] clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and [[flute]]. He built a small [[Chamber organ#Chamber organs|chamber organ]] at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at [[Magdalene asylum|Magdalen Hospital]], [[Streatham]]. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders.&lt;ref name= Dibble6&gt;Dibble, pps. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was precocious and could play [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Prelude (Toccata) and Fugue in E major, BWV 566|Fugue in E major]] at the age of seven.&lt;ref name= Bumpus175&gt;Bumpus, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer became a chorister at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He was already an accomplished player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch and a fine treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 he was invited to sing in the first English performance of Bach's [[St Matthew Passion]] under [[William Sterndale Bennett]] at the [[Hanover Square Rooms]]. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by [[steamboat]]. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school.&lt;ref name= Dibble12&gt;Dibble, pps. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate|St. Sepulchre's]] Church, [[Holborn]] from [[George Cooper (organist)|George Cooper]], assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under [[John Goss (composer)|John Goss]]. He may have met future composer [[Arthur Sullivan]], his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays.&lt;ref name= Dibble34&gt;Dibble, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at [[St Benet Paul's Wharf|St Benet's, Paul's Wharf]]. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.&lt;ref name= Dibble36&gt;Dibble, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Michael's College, Tenbury - geograph.org.uk - 842021.jpg|thumb|left|St Michael's College, Tenbury]]
At the age of sixteen, he was appointed by Sir [[Frederick Ouseley]] to the post of organist at the newly founded [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury]]. At that time Ouseley was [[Heather Professor of Music]] at [[Oxford University]] and had recently become vicar of St Michael's College on the outskirts of [[Tenbury Wells]], a choir school with a church that he had founded and endowed and which was intended to serve as a model for Anglican church music.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenbury Wells and the Teme Valley'', 2007, p10&lt;/ref&gt; Although not much older than they were, Stainer was in charge of the choir and choristers, and one of his duties was to give piano lessons to the boys for two hours a day.&lt;ref name= Dibble42&gt;Dibble, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Ouseley was an antiquarian and had an extensive library. He was much interested in the history of music and acted as Stainer's mentor. Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the [[Bachelor of Music]] degree at Oxford.&lt;ref name= Dibble52&gt;Dibble, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Stainer wrote a [[cantata]], "''Praise the Lord, O my soul''", with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works.&lt;ref name= Dibble52&gt;Dibble, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; About this time he wrote several anthems, the most successful of which was "''I saw the Lord''", a bolder and more original work in a more contemporary style.&lt;ref name= Dibble62&gt;Dibble, pps. 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magdalen College==
In 1860 he became organist at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], initially for a period of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose to do so in the expectation that it would raise his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his [[Doctor of Music|Mus Doc]], which would raise his standing within the university.&lt;ref name= Dibble104&gt;Dibble, pps. 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magdalen College Chapel Interior, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of Magdalen College Chapel]]
Unfailingly conscientious as a choirmaster, Stainer introduced new anthems and service music, bringing the choir to a higher level of attainment than it had previously seen.&lt;ref name= Bumpus176&gt;Bumpus, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been the custom for the adult choir members, the lay clerks, not to attend practice at all; but Stainer had a magnetic personality and persuaded them to come. Their more regular attendance enabled the repertoire to be enlarged. Stainer's skill on the organ was much respected, and he was regarded as "the finest organist Oxford had seen in many generations".&lt;ref name= Dibble73&gt;Dibble, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The vice chancellor, [[Francis Jeune|Dr Francis Jeune]], was an admirer and in 1861 appointed Stainer to the prestigious post of University Organist at the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]]. Here he was expected to play for a service every Sunday (at a later time in the morning than the Magdalen service).&lt;ref name= Dibble73&gt;Dibble, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time he was composing liturgical music and developing his musical style. There were several [[anthem]]s and two more technically assured multi-sectioned verse anthems, "Drop down, ye heavens from above" and "They were lovely and pleasant in their lives". His routine included two services daily, rehearsals, lectures, tutorials, attendance at Ouseley's lectures, and visits home to Southwark in the vacations. He must have performed his duties with diligence as his salary was raised by £10 a year and after 1862 he received an allowance towards his rent.&lt;ref name= Dibble85&gt;Dibble, pps. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stainer was also conductor of the Magdalen Madrigal Society, which gave concerts in the College Hall, and the Magdalen Vagabonds, which performed during vacations. The latter gave concerts in various towns and cities and raised money for church restoration. He wrote some [[madrigal]]s himself, which were published by [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]], a company with which he was to do much future business. He also wrote an oratorio, ''Gideon'', as the exercise for his doctorate and it was performed in November 1865. It was well received on the day and was sufficient to gain him his doctorate but has not been performed since.&lt;ref name= Dibble105&gt;Dibble, pps. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stainer had obtained his doctorate, Ouseley enrolled him as an examiner for Oxford musical degrees. In this capacity Stainer met and later became friends with [[Hubert Parry]]. Attending at evensong at Magdalen College in 1866, Parry wrote in his diary "Stainer played the last 3 movements of the [[Organ Sonatas, Op. 65 (Mendelssohn)|Sonata in B-flat]] ([[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]) afterwards most gloriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35393 |title=Parry, Sir (Charles) Hubert Hastings, baronet (1848–1918) |author=Dibble, Jeremy |year=2004 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He examined [[William Pole]] and [[Frederick Bridge]] and became involved in organ and music tuition and wider musical activities. He had considerable influence on sacred music in Oxford and his reputation spread beyond the confines of the city. He was employed to play solo organ works at weekly concerts at [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] and took part regularly in the [[Three Choirs Festival]].&lt;ref name= Dibble115&gt;Dibble, pps. 109–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stainer was interested in the history of music and traditional folk songs. There was a revived interest in carols at the time, and he rediscovered old carols, provided new settings for others and introduced contemporary works. Many of his harmonisations are still in use today. He published a volume ''Christmas Carols New and Old'' which was a considerable success, with thousands of copies sold. He followed this up with another edition the following year to which he persuaded Arthur Sullivan to contribute. He also composed several hymn tunes, and some of these are still to be found in Anglican hymnals, with "Love divine, all loves excelling" being popular at wedding services.&lt;ref name= Dibble119&gt;Dibble, pps. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parish music followed with a congregational ''Te Deum in C'' which was regularly sung at Magdalen on Sundays and a verse anthem "Sing a song of praise". Two more substantial anthems, intended for use in cathedrals, were "Lead kindly light" composed in 1868, followed by "Awake, awake, put on thy strength" in 1871. He also produced two evening canticles and a comprehensive set of music for morning, communion and evening services. He had also been working for a long time on his first theoretical work, ''A Theory of Harmony Founded on the Tempered Scale'', published by Novello in 1871.&lt;ref name= Dibble129&gt;Dibble, pps. 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==St Paul's Cathedral==
[[File:On the rooftops of London.jpg|thumb|left|St Paul's Cathedral at about the time Stainer was organist]]
[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 080 - St Paul's Cathedral (tone).jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral]]
In 1871, Goss resigned as organist of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and Stainer was appointed to the position early in 1872 at a salary of £400 per annum. By this time he had been married for seven years and had five children with another due shortly. The organ was in the process of being rebuilt, by the organ builder [[Henry Willis]] to Stainer's design, with portions on either side of the entrance to the choir stalls.&lt;ref name= Bumpus59&gt;Bumpus, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was asked to help revise ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', a task he did with enthusiasm.&lt;ref name= Dibble138&gt;Dibble, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; At St Paul's, he soon set about reinvigorating the choir. The appointment of vicars choral was for life, and the tenor and bass voices saw no need for rehearsal, meaning that the repertoire was static. Stainer was able to change their attitude, and new anthems and liturgies were introduced, a choir school built, and the number of choristers increased from twelve to thirty-five. When William Sparrow Simpson was appointed [[Succentor]], the raising of standards continued, and St Paul's Cathedral became the focus of religious ceremony in the capital, including state occasions, ceremonial events, memorial services and the funerals of the great and famous.&lt;ref name= Dibble194&gt;Dibble, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; A peal of twelve bells was installed in 1878.&lt;ref name= Dibble196&gt;Dibble, p. 196, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further appointments followed. Stainer became an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured to be asked to be a juror at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|French Exhibition in Paris]] in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh [[Eisteddfod]] at [[Caernarfon|Caernarvon]].&lt;ref name= Dibble201&gt;Dibble, pps. 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt; He was made [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier of the Legion of Honour]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Stainer, Sir John |magazine= Who's who biographies, 1901|page=1054|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Stainer was offered the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a position he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and [[tonic sol-fa]] rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition.&lt;ref name= Dibble238&gt;Dibble, pps. 214–238.&lt;/ref&gt; The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio ''Mary Magdalen''. This was followed in 1887 by ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'', the work for which he is most remembered.&lt;ref name= Bumpus178&gt;Bumpus, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, he was awarded an honorary degree by [[Durham University]], and he became Heather Professor at Oxford in 1889 following the death of Ouseley. He conducted pioneering research into [[Medieval European music|early music]], notably the output of [[Low Countries|Netherlandish]] [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] composer [[Guillaume Dufay]], then scarcely known even among experts. He also contributed a small treatise, ''Harmony'', and another, ''Composition'', to the famous series of Novello musical primers. For budding organists he wrote a primer called, simply, ''The Organ'', which continues to have a following. In recognition of his services to British music, he received a knighthood from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1888.&lt;ref name= Dibble247&gt;Dibble, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
[[File:John Stainer Vanity Fair 29 August 1891.jpg|thumb|Caricature published in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1891]]
Following a childhood accident, Stainer had lost the use of one eye. There is some confusion about this and he may merely have had a [[Strabismus|lazy eye]], but for a brief period in 1875 he feared he was losing the sight of the other eye. This proved not to be the case, but he suffered from eye strain and impairment to his vision for much of his life. This was a major reason for his decision to retire from St Paul's Cathedral in 1888,&lt;ref name= Dibble109&gt;Dibble, pps. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; while still in his forties. As Bumpus was to write, "Such honours as are at the disposal of his fellow musicians have been freely showered upon him, for he is universally beloved and esteemed, but his many onerous duties, his organistship of this, his presidency of that, and his incessant hard work as an examiner, have all involved responsibility and constant application, and the result is that his sight and general health have given way under the severe strain of sheer hard work."&lt;ref name= Bumpus180&gt;Bumpus, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, he and his wife took to travelling to the [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]], [[Florence]] or [[Menton]]e each year for him to relax and recuperate. It was on such a visit to [[Verona]], Italy that on [[Palm Sunday]], 31 March 1901 he felt unwell and retired to his room. Later that afternoon he died of a [[heart attack]]. He was sixty. His body was taken back to England, and his funeral service was held on 6 April at [[St Cross Church, Oxford]] with a large number of friends and colleagues present,&lt;ref name= Dibble308&gt;Dibble, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by burial in adjacent [[Holywell Cemetery]].

Lady Stainer was devastated by his death and went into mourning for a year, but as she confided to a friend, the pianist [[Francesco Berger]], "I am thankful he has been spared long illness and the weariness of old age, which he always dreaded".&lt;ref name= Dibble310&gt;Dibble, pps. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt; She gave a memorial stained glass window to St Cross Church and arranged for a monument to be erected at Magdalen College. Her husband's valuable library of antiquarian music books passed to his elder son, J F R Stainer, who allowed its use for study and research purposes. The collection was sold to an American collector in 1932 who, on his death in 1973, had it bequeathed to the [[Bodleian Library]], where it remains. Lady Stainer died in 1916 leaving six children. She is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford beside her husband.&lt;ref name= Dibble310&gt;Dibble, pps. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Stainer's output of sacred music was extensive, including the [[Passion cantata]] or [[oratorio]] ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), the ''Sevenfold Amen'' (this latter piece was especially admired by the lexicographer Sir [[George Grove]]), and numerous [[hymn tune]]s, including "Cross of Jesus", "All for Jesus" (both from ''The Crucifixion''), and "Love Divine".&lt;ref name= Bumpus178&gt;Bumpus, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; His settings for the ''[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]]'' and ''[[Sanctus]]'' were sung at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of [[Edward VII]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Cowgill, Rachel and [[Rushton, Julian]] (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gFWVWesJcTIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22I+was+glad%22+edward+Vii&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pOCRUoagM6eS7Ab46YCwCA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20was%20glad%22%20edward%20Vii&amp;f=false ''Europe, Empire, and Spectacle in Nineteenth-century British Music''], Ashgate Publishing Limited, {{ISBN|0-7546-5208-4}} (p. 129)&lt;/ref&gt;

His work as a composer was much esteemed during his lifetime but is not well known today. ''The Crucifixion'' is one of the few major works of his that is still regularly performed. It is often given in Anglican churches during [[Holy Week]] and forms part of the repertoire of numerous choirs. He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his ''Christmas Carols New and Old'' (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. [[Henry Ramsden Bramley|H. R. Bramley]], which marked an important stage in the revival of the [[Christmas carol]]. The book includes Stainer's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of "[[What Child Is This]]", "[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]", "[[Good King Wenceslas]]", "[[The First Nowell]]", and "[[I Saw Three Ships]]", among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Book of Carols |last=Dearmer |first=Percy |last2=Vaughan Williams |first2=Ralph |last3=Shaw |first3=Martin |year=1918 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-353315-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a skilled musician and accompanist and [[Walter Galpin Alcock]], who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the [[National Training School for Music]], recalls Sullivan saying "I was at St Paul's yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising. My dear young friends, he is a genius, and I hope you will miss no chance of hearing him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=John Stainer and the musical life of Victorian Britain |last=Charlton |first=Peter |year=1984 |publisher=David &amp; Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=K2RqUoajGsyrhAeXh4HACw&amp;id=kl0IAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=stainer+sullivan+%22he+is+a+gyenius%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22training+school+for+music%22 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-7153-8387-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Stainer was also a close friend of [[Edmund Hart Turpin]], the later Hon. Secr. of the [[Royal College of Organists]] for more than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Charles William Pearc, ''A Biographical Sketch of Edmund Hart Turpin'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lebor Bretnach''''', [[Irish orthography|formerly spelled]] '''''Leabhar Breathnach''''' and sometimes known as the '''Irish Nennius''', is an 11th-century historical work in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]], largely consisting of a translation of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. It may have originated in Scotland, although it has traditionally been attributed to the Irish poet [[Gilla_Cómáin_mac_Gilla_Samthainde|Gilla Cóemáin]].

==Manuscripts==

''Lebor Bretnach'' exists in five manuscripts:

'''U'''.  Dublin, [[Royal Irish Academy]], MS 23 E 25 (1229).  A 12th-century fragment in the ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]''.

'''B'''.  Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 P 12 (536).  A 14th-century manuscript known as the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]''.

'''H'''.  Dublin, [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], MS H. 3. 17.  Probably written in the 14th or early 15th century.

'''M'''.  Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS Stowe D ii 1.  Known as the ''[[Leabhar Ua Maine|Book of Uí Maine]]'', written before 1423.

'''L'''.  Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 P 2 (535) and Dublin, Trinity College, MS H. 2. 17, Vol. 2 (1319).  Known as the ''[[Great Book of Lecan|Book of Lecan]]'', written c. 1417.{{sfn|Todd|1848|p=viii}}

==Sources==

''Lebor Bretnach'' is a translation of a 9th-century historical collection purportedly written by Nennius, the ''Historia Brittonum'', but not an entirely literal one. It only summarises the ''Historia Brittonum'' where that work deals with specifically Gaelic matters already familiar to  scholars in Ireland and Scotland, and in some other passages it includes additional material taken from, for example, the ''[[Irish Sex Aetates Mundi|Sex Aetates Mundi]]'', [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum]]'', and a [[Picts|Pictish]] king-list.{{sfn|Dooley|2004|p=13}}{{sfn|Fitzpatrick-Matthews|2007–2015}}

==Authorship and date==

In two manuscripts of ''Lebor Bretnach'', '''H''' and '''M''', the translation is ascribed to the poet Gilla Cóemáin (fl. 1071/2).{{sfn|Dooley|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Fitzpatrick-Matthews|2007–2015}}  This ascription is now in doubt,{{sfn|Dooley|2004|p=11}} and the historian [[Thomas Owen Clancy]] has suggested that ''Lebor Bretnach'' was instead only intended to be dedicated to Gilla Cóemáin.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick-Matthews|2007–2015}} Traditionally there had been an assumption that the translation had been an Irish work, but Clancy has argued for a Scottish provenance, suggesting an origin at [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]], though probably intended for an Irish readership that had perhaps become interested in Scottish literature and history as a result of the military success and prestige of the [[Kingdom of Alba]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=700}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clancy |first1=Thomas Owen |year=2000 |chapter=Scotland, the "Nennian" recension of the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Lebor Bretnach'' |editor1-last=Taylor |editor1-first=Simon |title=Kings, Clerics and Chronicles in Scotland 500–1297: Essays in Honour of Marjorie Ogilvie Anderson on the Occasion of her Ninetieth Birthday |url= |location=Dublin |publisher=Four Courts Press |pages=87–107 |isbn=1851825169  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that ''Lebor Bretnach'' dates to the mid or late 11th century.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=11}}{{sfn|Dooley|2004|p=11}}

The film received largely negative reviews.  While some commended the cinematography, it was seen to be an exploitive hardcore film with repetitive and meaningless depravity communicating its nihilistic message.

==Synopsis==
The film opens with a woman named Katja giving birth to an infant which is immediately beheaded by two mysterious figures. Depressed, feeling his mortality, and fearing he is reaching the end of his life, Katze decides to meet his old friend Brauth, who has a [[Jesus|Christ-like]] appearance, at an old house in which they used to delve into dark pleasures. They meet two sixteen-year-old girls, Melanie and Bianca. Together they enter a bar where a woman, Anja, joins the group. Katze also finds two other old acquaintances of his are attending: Heinrich, an elderly artist who claims to be a dead man, accompanied by a young woman named Clarissa who is tied to a wheelchair. Clarissa can only excrete through a urine bag or artificial bowel outlet.

The group decide to allow Katze to go out in style as their fun turns increasingly more depraved and horrific. The film contains explicit representations of coprophilic and urophilic actions: one scene involves a man defecating on a woman while taking her panties off, wiping himself, and shoving the pair in her mouth, all the while gesturing harshly to put her finger in his soiled anus.

During the same evening, the protagonists begin to consume alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine, and to think about different philosophical approaches. Katze, Brauth, and Anja reveal their nihilistic nature to the two girls, claiming they do not believe in heaven, and they will not be missed after dying. Then Katze, using a scalpel, deals cuts on Anja's breast as she vomits semen while cutting herself under the enthusiastic look of Brauth and the perplexed look of Melanie and Bianca.

The following morning the group travels to a pond near a factory: here Brauth reveals that Katze does not have much time to live. Melanie and Katze move away from the others. Near a farm, he meets a nun (Martina Adora) who leads him to a neighboring church. The nun begins to pray and then undresses and masturbates while Katze enters the crypts, watching the tombs with morbid curiosity; at the same time Melanie assists hunting and slaughtering a pig and Brauth rapes Anja. Several newts, frogs, rats, cats, and snails are also killed throughout the film.

That night Katze has an illness whose cause is attributed by Heinrich to the indifference of God towards him. Brauth becomes tired of Clarissa's laments, slams her into a basement and tortures her by ripping her colostomy device off and jabs his fingers into the hole, then throws her down from her wheelchair and abandons her. During the night Bianca awakens and says she "heard the voice of the dead." Katze checks and finds nothing but a rabbit hanged by Heinrich, beheaded and thrown by Katze himself.

The next day Brauth connects with Melanie and Blanca and locks them in a stable before sending Heinrich to abuse them. However, the two girls succeed in escaping from him: Heinrich later abuses Clarissa. The girl commits suicide the next morning, throwing herself off a cliff; at the same time Anja finds the remains of the pig discarded by the butchers and is sexually excited by touching them while having a goat lick between her legs.

Young Bianca, derisively called [[Snow White]], is also murdered by the group. After her womb has been removed with a knife, her skull is thrown. Heinrich is murdered by Katze and Brauth by having his entrails stabbed out of him. Afterward, an orgy takes place in which the four remaining members of the group burn Heinrich, still alive, at a pyre while the participants engage in sexual acts and urinate into the fire.

Anja finds Katze in a confused state, bruised and pained. Bianca comes crawling from the old house, while Melanie looks at a tiny skull inside a pendulum clock and finds a tape containing the scene shown at the beginning of the film; the figures who killed the infant are shown to be Katze and Brauth, and the skull found in the clock is that of the infant itself. Melanie crushes the cassette and uses the tape to masturbate while Bianca is reached and beaten by Anja, Heinrich, Katze, and Brauth. The latter then knocks her with a knife and abandons her to death. From the flames there is a flash that hits Katze's face, blinding him permanently. There are only a few hours left to live and the following afternoon Anja accompanies him to his tomb where he speaks. Anja honors Katze by ornamenting his tomb before reuniting with the nun and walking away silently.&lt;ref name="Cornett et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWCM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt;

==Commentaries==
Two direct-to-video films were released as a diptych, intended as commentary on ''Melancholie der Engel''.  The first, ''Reise nach Agatis'' ({{lang-en|Voyage to Agatis|italic=yes}}), is a 74-minute film produced by Engelfilm.  It was shot between 27 and 29 May 2008 in Croatia, on a budget of [[€]]10,000.  It premiered at Weekend of Fear on 2 December 2010, and was released on DVD on 16 April 2014 in the United States.  It was nominated for the BUT Award at BUT (B-Movies, Underground, and Trash) Film Festival in Breda, Breda, North Brabant, Netherlands, on 8 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Cornett et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWCM/&gt;

The second, ''Debris documentar'', is a 75-minute film released on 28 September 2012 in Germany, produced by Buna Films and distributed by ''Werkmann Filmverlag''. This film deals with the everyday life of a man, Carsten ([[Carsten Frank]]), who works on the set of the 2004 film ''[[Zombie Nation (film)|Zombie Nation]]'' for [[Ulli Lommel]], and was filmed at the time Dora worked there as assistant, producer, actor, and technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Höltgen, Prof. Dr. Stefan|de|Stefan Höltgen}}. {{cite web|url=http://heise.de/-3403734|script-title=Hat nicht so gut geschmeckt|date=4 December 2005|website=[[Telepolis]]|publisher=Hanover: [[Heinz Heise]]|access-date=17 September 2017|language=German}} »Ulli-Lommel-Mitarbeiters Marian Dora.«&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hess]] composed most of this film's score (the rest is by Sebastian Veelbehr).

===''Reise nach Agatis''===
The film opens with a scene of a woman tortured and killed on a beach.  This is followed by a seemingly innocent and pleasant yachting cruise under the sun: an attractive couple, Rafael (Thomas Goersch) and Isabell (Tatjana Lommel), entice young prostitute Lisa (Janna Lisa Dombrowsky) to a dreamy vacation. Before the end of the day, she is running for her life as they reveal their psychopathic and violent nature, hoping to wake up from a demented nightmare. [[Charles Berlitz]]'s 1974 book ''[[The Bermuda Triangle (book)|The Bermuda Triangle]]'', [[René Cardona Jr.]]'s 1978 film ''[[The Bermuda Triangle (film)|The Bermuda Triangle]]'', [[Tonino Ricci]]'s 1978 film ''[[Bermuda: Cave of the Sharks]]'', and David D. Osborn's 1974 novel ''Open Season'' are mentioned and the film ends with Lisa being stabbed multiple times in extremely graphic detail. Blood splatters onto Rafael, killing her. He then proceeds to ram a knife into her vagina, followed by disemboweling.

===''Debris documentar''===
The man working on the set of a zombie film is planning to realize his own film, a task he finds extremely difficult. First, the man tries to place casting ads in a supermarket. During his daily work on the film set, the man seems frustrated. Also, he is isolated in his private life, and spends his time by watching and masturbating to his opulent VHS film collection of homosexual rape pornography and films such as [[Cesare Canevari]]'s 1977 ''[[Last Orgy of the Third Reich]]'', Dennis Donnelly's 1978 ''[[The Toolbox Murders]]'', [[Peter Schamoni]]'s 1976 ''Potato Fritz'', and [[Rino Di Silvestro]]'s 1976 ''[[Werewolf Woman]]'', and tinkering with props for his own planned film.

In his spare time, he shoots photos of animal cadavers while playing with them. He also collects them as he seems to have a sexual attraction to them. He rapes a woman (Carina Palmer) in the woods while she urinates. He indulges in several disturbing sexual fetishes including defecating, urinating, necrophilia, bestiality, anal fisting, rape and murder. He has regular contact with a prostitute, Patrizia (Patrizia Johann), who puts an enema into her anus, and defecates into a bucket while placing the man onto a table, and shoving her fist into his anus, pulling out feces while he is putting the bucket to his face. He also engages by telephone with [[Jesús Franco]], Katja Bienert, [[Peter Martell]], and [[David Hess]], playing fictionalized versions of themselves.

After a while he contacts a woman, Franziska (Alexandra Dumas), who read his advertisement in the supermarket, and meets him at his house. When he tells her what he is supposed to do in his film, the woman becomes scared. The man overwhelms the woman and kills her by strangling her with a telephone cord and beating her head. Afterwards he films himself as he is sexually aroused by her corpse. He cuts her nipples off in graphic detail and uses his scalpel to cut the dead woman's clitoris off. He then takes the scalpel and peels the skin off one of her fingers and eats the pieces of dismembered skin. [[Astrid Proll]]'s 1998 book ''Baader-Meinhof: Pictures on the Run, 67–77'' about Andreas Baader and [[Ulrike Meinhof]] and Eduard Mörike are mentioned, and the film ends with the fact that the man burns the same woman's body and goes jogging as in the first shot of this film. Other cast members include Martina Adora and Stefanie Müller.&lt;ref name="Cornett et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWCM/&gt;

=={{Anchor|Background}}Production==
{{example farm|section|date=July 2018}}
To maximize the authenticity, the director was the only one with access to the script during the shooting. The film was shot for a period of three weeks around Eselsburg Valley, near Herbrechtingen, Heidenheim, Ostwürttemberg, and Dornhaldenfriedhof, Degerloch, Filder, Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, and Bogenhausener Friedhof, St. George, Bogenhausen, Bogenhausen, Munich, Upper Bavaria, and Nördlinger Ries, near Nördlingen, Donau-Ries, Swabia, Bavaria, Germany, and Auschwitz, Oświęcim, Gmina Oświęcim, Oświęcim County, Lesser Poland, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland.  Dora described the shoot as nightmarish due to drug abuse and violence on set. The dialogue was mainly spoken in poetic verses.

==Themes==
{{example farm|section|date=July 2018}}
At the center of the film is Katze, whose thoughts and feelings are revealed to the audience ''via'' voiceover. Often, different philosophers and poets are quoted ''e.g.'' [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Lord Byron]]'s 1816 poem ''[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]'', [[Marquis de Sade]]'s 1791 novel ''[[Justine (de Sade novel)|Justine]]'' and 1782 short story ''[[Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man]]'', [[Eduard Mörike]]'s 1838 poem ''Am Walde'' and 1832 poem ''Verborgenheit'', [[Georg Büchner]]'s 1828 poem ''[[:s:de:Die Nacht (Büchner)|Die Nacht]]'' and 1836 short story ''[[Lenz (fragment)|Lenz]]'', [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s 1832 poem ''[[Faust, Part Two]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1975 film ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', the 1600 song ''Sorrow, Sorrow, Stay, Lend True Repentant Tears'' by [[John Dowland]], [[Wolfgang Koeppen]]'s 1954 novel ''[[Death in Rome]]'' (the book Katze is shown reading and being buried with, itself referencing [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1912 novel ''[[Death in Venice]]'' and [[Dante Alighieri]]'s 1321 poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''), or [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], in addition to [[Psalm 23|''Psalms'' 23]] and [[Books of Chronicles|''1 Chronicles'' 22:1]], while [[Frederick Eckstein]]'s 1936 book ''Alte, unnennbare Tage: Erinnerungen aus siebzig Lehr- und Wanderjahren'' about [[Empedocles]], Ray Hoekstra's and [[Tex Watson]]'s 1978 book ''Will You Die For Me? The Man Who Killed For [[Charles Manson]] Tells His Own Story'', and Elly-Leonore Henkel-Michel's paintings of [[Gudrun Ensslin]], [[Jan-Carl Raspe]], and [[Andreas Baader]] are also mentioned. Dora received several death threats as a result of making this film.&lt;ref name="Cornett et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWCM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt;

==Reception==
The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre panned the film, writing:{{quote|There is no plot or comprehensible meaning to speak of, there is no rationale, philosophy or understandable characters, just very broken people doing disgusting things in an 'artistic' movie pretentiously pretending to be exploring the German psyche. I would have liked to say that the movie merely depicts very disturbed people, cruelty and vileness, but the movie actually revels in it and seems to think of this as art and emotional pathos.&lt;ref name=TWCM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelastexit.net/cinema/dora.html|script-title=Marian Dora|publisher=''The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre''|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Melancholie der Engel'' was referred to as "the most notorious, undeniably hardcore German release to date" by Severed Cinema, which said that while it could be annoying and suffered from dullness and repetition due to its length, the film was beautifully shot, possessing haunting and nightmarish cinematography with lyrical quality to it. The website concluded its review by stating: "Filled with unspeakable atrocities, ''Melancholie der Engel'' is completely devoid of morality. It is a depraved, perverse and nihilistic endurance test."&lt;ref name=Casta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://severed-cinema.com/m-reviews/melancholie-der-engel-shock-dvd-entertainment|script-title=''Melancholie der Engel'' – Shock DVD Entertainment|last=Casta|first=Ray|publisher=''Severed Cinem''a|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horror News similarly commended the cinematography and acting, however, it also said of the film, "There is talk of spirits and demons and ghosts, there is talk of a mysterious event from the past, there is talk of a change for the future, but the story itself is lost amongst everything else and we find ourselves watching disgusting and/or horrifying scenes but not sure what it all means."&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/99757/film-review-melancholie-der-engel-2009|script-title=Film Review: ''Melancholie der Engel'' (2009)|publisher=''Horror News''|date=29 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015|last=Leonard|first=Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The film won the Best International Feature Film – Arthouse Genre Award at [[New York International Independent Film and Video Festival]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Cornett et al."/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4863">'''mysqlBind/unxsBind''' is a [[DNS management software]] system. It supports [[Internet Systems Consortium|ISC]] [[BIND]] [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and is distributed as [[open source software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]].

mysqlBind/unxsBind has been in use since the late 1990s. It initially was designed to replace [[perl]]/[[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] based sets of maintenance scripts that made deployment and upkeep of large DNS systems time consuming and prone to human error.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Wallis, Website, April 2004, "[http://venus.openisp.net/openisp/unxsVZ/browser/trunk/unxsBind unxsBind]", May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
mysqlBind (now unxsBind) centralizes all data in a replicated [[SQL]] database and limits any DNS configuration errors to one [[Reliability engineering|software package failure point]]. unxsBind is a BIND9+ server management system only, not a DNS server, and generates DNS server specific configuration files so that the DNS server does not have to rely on a live SQL database. The unxsBind used SQL server is only needed to be operational for administration and deployment of new [[DNS zone|zone]]s, new [[resource record]]s, resource records changes and zone [[List of DNS record types#SOA|SOA]] changes. This non-reliance on a live SQL database has been a major point for reliable deployment of large scale DNS services.&lt;ref&gt;Dilva Garmendia, Website, May 2008, "[http://unixservice.com/?gcPage=Content&amp;uContentType=1&amp;uContent=21 unixservice.com]", May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

unxsBind is based on a "Company/Organization-Contact-Role" login and permissions model, such that end user organization contacts can manage their own DNS data from a shared infrastructure. This unxsBind shared infrastructure supports an unlimited number of organizations that can then administrate their own DNS resources, such as [[IP address|IP]] blocks, [[DNS zone|zone]]s and [[resource record]]s. unxsBind provides for the centralized management of multiple independent name servers across data center boundaries. 

The unxsBind system consists of a back end (unxsBind/iDNS) interface, and several example end user interfaces: The idnsAdmin admin interface, and the end user idnsOrg and vdnsOrg interfaces.  All provided interfaces run on SQL originated [[HTML]]/[[CSS]]/[[JavaScript]] templates organized in types and sets for on the fly interface "skin" changes and new interfaces. This along with the backend/DNS-configuration-engine and front-end interface model used in unxsBind is meant to provide the DNS service provider with a simple path to provision their own custom interfaces with advanced functionality. For example, a DNS service provider branded [[AJAX]] based interface with [[punycode]] hostname conversion for [[IDNA]] support.

Secondary and master zones, secondary-only zones, forward zones, hidden masters and hidden external master zones are all supported. Recent versions allow unlimited [[Split-horizon DNS|split horizon]] configurations (multiple BIND 9.3+ views). [[NAPTR]], [[AAAA record|AAAA]], and many other complex resource records are supported with input validation and contextual glossary based help. Wizards are provided for error prone complex DNS configuration management operations, e.g. in-addr.arpa reverse dns NS delegation using [[CIDR]] and $GENERATE directives. [[LDAP]] login support is provided for the vdnsOrg interface.

A [[CentOS]] 5.2+ [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]] installable version is available. Advanced features such as [[High availability|HA]] and LDAP single sign-on require that the system be configured and installed from source.

The main building was originally the residence of the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese Royal Family]] between 1808 and 1821 and was later used to house the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] between 1822 and 1889. After the monarchy was deposed, it hosted the Republican Constituent Assembly from 1889 to 1891 before being assigned to the use of the museum in 1892. The building was listed as Brazilian National Heritage in 1938.&lt;ref name="Museus do Rio - MNRJ"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Museu Nacional – UFRJ| publisher=Museus do Rio| year=| url=http://www.museusdorio.com.br/joomla/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=12:museu-nacional| accessdate=15 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215122231/http://www.museusdorio.com.br/joomla/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=12:museu-nacional| archive-date=15 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[João VI of Portugal|King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] on 6 June 1818, under the name of "Royal Museum", the institution was initially housed at the [[Campo de Santana (park)|Campo de Santana park]], where it exhibited the collections incorporated from the former House of Natural History, popularly known as ''Casa dos Pássaros'' ("House of the Birds"), created in 1784 by the Viceroy of Brazil, {{ill|Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 4th Count of Figueiró|pt|Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 4.º Conde de Figueiró}}, as well as collections of [[mineralogy]] and zoology. The museum foundation was intended to address the interests of promoting the [[socioeconomic development]] of the country by the diffusion of education, culture, and science. In the 19th century, the institution was already established as the most important South American museum of its type. In 1946, it was incorporated into the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Larousse 4132"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=Grande Enciclopédia Larousse Cultural|year=1998|publisher=Banco Safra|location=Santana de Parnaíba|pages=4132|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Museus do Rio - MNRJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN UFRJ O Museu"&gt;{{Cite document| title=O Museu| publisher=Museu Nacional - UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/omuseu/omuseu.html| accessdate=15 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215124011/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/omuseu/omuseu.html| archive-date=15 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Museum held a vast collection with more than 20 million objects, one of the largest collections of [[natural history]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] artifacts in the world, encompassing some of the most important material records regarding [[natural science]] and anthropology in Brazil, as well as numerous items that came from other regions of the world and were produced by several cultures and ancient civilizations. Formed along more than two centuries through expeditions, excavations, acquisitions, donations and exchanges, the collection was subdivided into seven main nuclei: [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[ethnology]]. The collection was the principal basis for the research conducted by the academic departments of the museum{{snd}}which are responsible for carrying out activities in all the regions of the Brazilian territory and several places of the world, including the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]]. The museum held one of the largest scientific [[library|libraries]] of Brazil, with over 470,000 volumes and 2,400 rare works.&lt;ref name="Museus do Rio - MNRJ"/&gt;

In the area of education, the museum offers [[Academic specialization|specialization]]s, [[Continuing education|extension]] and post-graduation courses in several fields of the knowledge, in addition to hosting temporary and permanent exhibitions and educational activities open to the general public.&lt;ref name="Museus do Rio - MNRJ"/&gt; The museum manages the ''Horto Botânico'' (Botanical Garden), adjacent to the ''Paço de São Cristóvão'', as well as an advanced campus in the city of [[Santa Teresa, Espírito Santo|Santa Teresa]], in [[Espírito Santo]]{{snd}}the Santa Lúcia Biological Station, jointly managed with the Museum of Biology Prof. Mello Leitão. A third site, located in the city of [[Saquarema]], is used as a support and logistics center for field activities.

== History ==
[[File:Quinta da Boa Vista 10.jpg|left|thumb|The former [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Imperial Palace]] that housed the National Museum]]

The National Museum was officially established by [[Majesty|His Majesty]] [[João VI of Portugal|King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1769–1826) in 1818 with the name of ''Royal Museum'', in an initiative to stimulate scientific research in the [[Kingdom of Brazil]], then a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. Initially the Museum sheltered [[botanical]] and [[animal]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s, especially [[bird]]s, what caused the old building where it was located in center of Rio de Janeiro, to be known by the population as the "House of the Birds".

After that, with the marriage of King João VI's eldest son and Brazil's first Emperor, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (1798–1834), with [[Her Imperial and Royal Highness|H.I. &amp; R.H.]] [[Archduchess]] [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria]] (1797-1826), the Museum started to attract the greatest [[Europe]]an [[natural history|naturalist]]s of the 19th century, such as [[Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied]] (1782–1867), [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] (1781–1826) and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] (1794–1868). Other European researchers who explored the country, such as [[Augustin Saint-Hilaire]] (1799–1853) and the [[Baron von Langsdorff]] (1774–1891), contributed to the collections of the Royal Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmrviVAKB4UC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=Langsdorff+museu+nacional+brazil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OoDhjOJm05&amp;sig=GQYQyaNVKOdO0FWVsqdyuAPkEGc&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHp9n-_ajdAhWIJlAKHRyWAiMQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Langsdorff%20museu%20nacional%20brazil&amp;f=false|title=Space for Science: The Development of the Scientific Community in Brazil|author=Simon Schwartzman|publisher=Penn State Press|page=53|accessdate=2018-09-07|language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, reflecting the personal preferences of [[His Imperial Majesty]] [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] (1825–1891), the National Museum started to invest in the areas of the [[anthropology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]]. The Emperor himself, who was an avid amateur [[scientist]] and enthusiastic supporter of all branches of science, contributed with several of the collections of the [[art of Ancient Egypt]], [[botany|botanical]] [[fossil]]s, etc., which he acquired during many of his trips abroad. In this way, the National Museum was modernized and became the most important museum of Natural History and Human Sciences of [[South America]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited the museum in 1832, noting that the museum only had three open rooms at that time, and that the closed rooms were "sadly plundered of its contents by Don Pedro."&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|page=25|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/25/|access-date=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610213410/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/25/|archive-date=10 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MuseuNacional1870.jpg|thumb|303px|right|The National Museum at its first location in Campo de Sant'Anna, today's Praça da República, ca. 1870]]
[[File:1905 Sala Spix Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro.png|thumb|left|Sala Spix, {{circa|1905}}]]

D. Pedro II was well aware of the shortage of true scientists and naturalists in Brazil. He fixed this problem by inviting foreign scientists to come to work at the Museum. The first to come was [[Ludwig Riedel]] (1761–1861), a German botanist who had participated in Baron von Langsdorff's famed expedition to [[Mato Grosso]] from 1826 to 1828. Other scientists to come were: German chemist [[Theodor Peckolt]] and American geologist and paleontologist [[Charles Frederick Hartt]] (1840–1878). In the following years the Museum gradually became known so it continued to attract several foreign scientists who wished to achieve scientific stature with their work in Brazil, such as [[Fritz Müller]] (1821–1897), [[Hermann von Ihering]] (1850–1930), [[Carl August Wilhelm Schwacke]] (1848–1894), [[Orville Adalbert Derby]] (1851–1915), [[Émil August Goeldi]] (1859–1917), [[Louis Couty]] (1854–1884) and others, all fired by museum director [[Ladislau Netto]] when the Emperor was deposed.

The Emperor was still a very popular figure when he was deposed by a military coup in 1889, so the republicans tried to erase the symbols of the Empire. One of these symbols, the [[Paço de São Cristóvão]], the official residence of the emperors in the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], became vacant; therefore, in 1892, the National Museum, with all its collections, valuables and researchers, was transferred to this palace, where it stays until today.

In 1946, the Museum’s management was passed to the [[University of Brazil]], currently the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. The researchers and their offices and laboratories occupy a good part of the Palace and other buildings erected at Botanical Gardens (Horto Florestal), in the Quinta da Boa Vista park. There, one can find one of the largest scientific libraries of Rio. Currently, the National Museum offers graduate courses in the following areas: [[Anthropology]] and [[Sociology]], [[Botany]], [[Geology]] and [[Paleontology]], and [[Zoology]].

One of the meteorites that was on display is the [[Bendegó meteorite]], which weighs over {{convert|5000|kg|lb}} and was discovered in 1784.&lt;ref name="Sears"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sears|first1=P M|title=Recovery of the Bendego Meteorite|journal=Meteoritics|date=1963|volume=2|issue=1|pages=22–23|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1963Metic...2...22S|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeology ===
The collection of archaeology of the National Museum comprised more than 100,000 objects, covering distinct several civilizations that lived in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Middle East, since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]] until the 19th century. The collection is subdivided into four main segments: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean cultures]], [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] archaeology, and Pre-Columbian Brazil{{snd}} last nucleus, systematically gathered since 1867, is the largest segment of the archaeological collection, as well as the most important collection of its typology in the world, covering the history of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Pre-Cabraline]] Brazil in a very comprehensive manner and sheltering some of the most important material records related to Brazilian archaeology. It was, therefore, a collection of considerable scientific value, and object of several works of basic research, theses, dissertations, and monographs.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 45"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=45|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MNRJ Arqueologia Dep"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Departamento de Antropologia| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/pesquisa/antropologia| accessdate=13 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102631/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/pesquisa/antropologia| archive-date=14 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Egypt ====
{{see also|Collection of mummies in the National Museum of Brazil|Collection of funerary steles in the National Museum of Brazil}}

With more than 700 items, the collection of [[Egyptology|Egyptian archaeology]] of the National Museum was one of the largest of Latin America and one of the oldest in the Americas. Most part of the objects entered the museum collection in 1826, when the tradesman Nicolau Fiengo brought from [[Marseille]] an assemblage of Egyptian antiquities that belonged to the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]], who had been in charge of excavating the [[Theban Necropolis]] (modern-day [[Luxor]]) and the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]].&lt;ref name="Guia MN-UFRJ Egito 1"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional – Egito Antigo (I)| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/4/princ9.htm| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315063145/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/4/princ9.htm| archive-date=15 March 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collection had [[Argentina]] as initial destination, and had probably been ordered by the president of that country, [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], creator of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and a noted enthusiast of museums. However, a naval blockade at the [[Río de la Plata|La Plata River]] would impede Fiengo of completing his journey, forcing him to return from [[Montevideo]] to Rio de Janeiro, where the pieces were offered at an auction. Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] bought the entire collection for five million ''[[Brazilian real (old)|réis]]'', and subsequently donated it to the National Museum. It has been suggested that the action of Pedro I would have been influenced by [[José Bonifácio de Andrada]], a relevant early member of [[Freemasonry]] in Brazil, perhaps driven by the interest that the organization had for the Egyptian iconography.&lt;ref name="Barkos 2004 31-35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barkos |first=Margaret Marchiori|authorlink=|title=Egiptomania – O Egito no Brasil|year=2004|publisher=Paris Editorial|location=São Paulo|pages=31–35|ISBN=85-72-44261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 222"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=222|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection started by Pedro I would be expanded by his son, emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], amateur Egyptologist and notable collector of archaeological and ethnographic artifacts. One of the most important additions to the Egyptian collection of the National Museum made by Pedro II is the polychromed wood sarcophagus of the singer of [[Amun]], Sha-Amun-en-su, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], offered to the emperor as a gift during his second trip to Egypt, in 1876, by the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]]. The sarcophagus is distinguished for its rarity, since it is one of few examples that have never been opened, still preserving the [[mummy]] of the singer in its interior.&lt;ref name="Guia MN-UFRJ Egito 1"/&gt; The collection would be enriched through other acquisitions and donations, becoming, at the beginning of the 20th-century, sufficiently relevant to draw the attention of international researchers and egyptologysts, such as [[Alberto Childe]], who served as conservator of the Department of Archaeology of the museum between 1912 and 1938, and was also responsible for publishing the ''Guide of the Collections of Classical Archaeology of the National Museum'', in 1919.&lt;ref name="Barkos 2004 31-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brancaglion 2007"/&gt;
[[Image:Múmia feminina 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Egyptian mummy ("Princess Kherima"). Roman Period, 1st–3rd centuries AD.]]
Besides the forementioned coffin of Sha-Amun-en-su, the museum possesses other three sarcophagi, from the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] and the Late Era, belonging to three priests of [[Amun]]: Hori, Pestjef, and Harsiese. The museum also conserves six human mummies (four adults and two children), as well as a number of mummies and sarcophagi of animals (cats, ibises, fishes, and crocodiles). Among the human examples, the highlight is a mummy of a woman from the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Period]], which is considered extremely rare for the preparatory technique used, of which there are only eight similar examples worldwide. Called "princess of the Sun" or "princess Kherima", the mummy has her members and fingers of the hands and feet individually swaddled and is richly adorned, with painted strips.&lt;ref name="Brancaglion 2007"/&gt; "Princess Kherima" is one of the most popular items of the National Museum collection, being even related to accounts of [[Parapsychology|parapsychological experiences]] and collective trances, that supposedly occurred in the 1960s. "Kherima" also inspired the romance ''The Secret of the Mummy'' by Everton Ralph, member of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian society]].&lt;ref name="Barkos 2004 31-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=41–42|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globo Kherima"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Múmia Kherima intriga pesquisadores do Museu Nacional| publisher=O Globo| year=2016| url=http://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/historia/mumia-kherima-intriga-pesquisadores-do-museu-nacional-10998769| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209230534/http://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/historia/mumia-kherima-intriga-pesquisadores-do-museu-nacional-10998769| archive-date=9 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of votive and funerary [[stele]]s is composed of dozens of pieces dated, in their majority, from the Intermediate Period and the Late Era. The steles of Raia and Haunefer, which are graved with titles of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origins present in the [[Bible]] and in the tablets of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], stand out, as well as an unfinished stele, attributed to the emperor [[Tiberius]], of the Roman Period. The museum also had a vast collection of ''[[Ushabti|shabtis]]'', ''i.e.'' statuettes representing funerary servers, including a group of pieces that belonged to pharaoh [[Seti I]], excavated from his tomb at the [[Valley of the Kings]]. The rare artifacts included a limestone statue of a young woman, dated of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], carrying a conic ointment vessel on the top of her head{{snd}}an iconography that is almost exclusively found among paintings and reliefs. The collection also includes fragments of reliefs, masks, statues of deities in bronze, stone and wood (such as representations of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris), [[canopic jar]]s, alabaster bowls, [[funerary cone]]s, jewels, amulets, etc.&lt;ref name="Barkos 2004 31-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brancaglion 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guia MN-UFRJ Egito 2"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional – Egito Antigo (II)| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=2016| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/4/principal10.htm| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424082027/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/4/principal10.htm| archive-date=24 April 2016| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of [[classical archaeology]] of the National Museum added up to around 750 pieces and consists mostly of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and [[Italiotes|Italiote]] objects, being the largest collection of its kind in Latin America. Most of the pieces previously belonged to the Greco-Roman collection of [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|empress Teresa Cristina]], who had been interested in archaeology since her youth. When the empress disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in 1843, right after her [[proxy wedding]] to [[Pedro II of Brazil|emperor Pedro II]], she brought an assemblage of antiquities found during the excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]], the Ancient Roman cities destroyed by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. Part of this collection had also belonged to [[Caroline Bonaparte|Carolina Murat]], sister of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and queen consort of the king of Naples, [[Joachim Murat]].&lt;ref name="MN-UFRJ Arqueologia do Mediterrâneo"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Culturas do Mediterrâneo| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/exposicoes/arqueologia/culturas-mediterraneo/index.html| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080941/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/dir/exposicoes/arqueologia/culturas-mediterraneo/index.html| archive-date=11 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 238"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=238|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBC Coleção TC"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Italianos restauram afrescos inéditos da coleção Imperatriz Tereza Cristina| publisher=Agência Brasil| year=| url=http://memoria.ebc.com.br/agenciabrasil/noticia/2004-01-14/italianos-restauram-afrescos-ineditos-da-colecao-imperatriz-tereza-cristina| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080019/http://memoria.ebc.com.br/agenciabrasil/noticia/2004-01-14/italianos-restauram-afrescos-ineditos-da-colecao-imperatriz-tereza-cristina| archive-date=11 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]], brother of empress Teresa Cristina, had ordered the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, initiated in the 18th century, be resumed. The recovered pieces were sent to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Royal Bourbon Museum]] of [[Naples]]. Aiming to increase the number of classical artifacts in Brazil with a view to the future creation of a museum of Greco-Roman archaeology in the country, the empress established formal exchanges with the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. She requested the shipment of Greco-Roman objects to Rio de Janeiro, while sending artifacts of [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous origins]] to Italy. The empress also personally financed excavations in [[Veios]], an Etruscan archeological site located fifteen kilometers north of Rome, thus enabling a large part of the objects found there to be brought to Brazil. A greater part of those had been gathered between 1853 and 1859, but Teresa Cristina continued to enrich the collection until the fall of the Brazilian empire in 1889, when the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Republic was proclaimed]] and the empress left the country with all the royal family.&lt;ref name="MN-UFRJ Arqueologia do Mediterrâneo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 238"/&gt;

Among the highlights of the collection were a set of four [[fresco]]s from Pompeii, made around the 1st century AD. Two of those are decorated with marine motifs, respectively depicting a sea dragon and a seahorse as the central figure surrounded by dolphins, and had adorned the lower walls of the room of the devotees at the [[Temple of Isis (Pompeii)|Temple of Isis]]. The other two frescos are decorated with representations of plants, birds, and landscapes, stylistically close to the paintings of Herculaneum and [[Stabiae]]. The museum also housed a large number of objects from Pompeii portraying the daily life of Ancient Roman citizens: ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]'', jewels, mirrors, and other pieces of the Roman female ''toilette'', glass and bronze vessels, phallic amulets, oil lamps molded in terracotta, etc.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBC Coleção TC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guia MN-UFRJ Arqueologia do Mediterrâneo"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional – Culturas Mediterrâneas| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/3/princ8.htm| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301031214/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/3/princ8.htm| archive-date=1 March 2018| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of Mediterranean [[pottery]] comprised more than dozens of objects and is noted for the diversity of origins, shapes, decorations and utilitarian purposes. Several of the most important styles and schools of classical antiquity are represented, from the [[Corinth]]ian [[Geometric art|geometric style]] of the 7th century BC to the Roman [[terracotta]] [[amphora]]s of the Early Christian era. The museum houses examples of ''[[krater]]s'', ''[[Oenochoe|oenochoai]]'', ''[[kantharos]]'', [[chalice]]s, ''[[kyathos]]'', [[cup]]s, ''[[hydria]]i'', ''[[Lekythos|lekythoi]]'', ''[[Askos (pottery vessel)|askoi]]'', and ''[[lekanides]]''. The groups of Etruscan ''[[Bucchero]]'' pottery (7th–4th centuries BC), Greek [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure vases]] (7th–5th centuries BC), [[Gnathia vases|Gnathian vessels]] (4th century BC), and the vast set of Italian [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] vases, with ceramics from [[Apulia]], [[Campania]], [[Lucania]] and [[Magna Graecia]], which also stand out.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt;

The collection of sculptures comprised a large number of [[Tanagra figurine]]s, small terracotta sculptures of Greek origin that were widely appreciated in the Ancient world, as well as a group of Etruscan bronze statuettes representing warriors and female figures. The collection of military artifacts included entire pieces or fragments of helmets, maces, scabbards, bronze blades, brooches and ''[[phallera]]s''.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt;

==== Pre-Columbian archaeology ====
[[Image:Cultura Huari - Figura antropomorfa em cerâmica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Peruvian [[Wari culture]]. Anthropomorphic ceramic figurine, 500–1200 AD.]]
The National Museum housed an important group of about 1,800 artifacts produced by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] during the [[Pre-Columbian era]], as well as [[Andes|Andean]] [[Mummy|mummies]]. Gathered throughout the 19th century, the collection was based on holdings of the Brazilian royal family, with several objects coming from the private collection of Emperor Pedro II. It was later enlarged through acquisitions, donations, exchanges, and excavations. By the end of the 19th-century, the collection already had considerable prestige, being cited, on the occasion of opening the 1889 Anthropological Exposition, as one of the largest collections of South American archaeology.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 19"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=19|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Projeto Exposição MN/UFRJ"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Projeto da Nova Exposição do Museu Nacional/UFRJ| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://flanelografo.com.br/impermanencia/biblioteca/Duarte%20et%20al%20(2003).pdf| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214105317/http://flanelografo.com.br/impermanencia/biblioteca/Duarte%20et%20al%20(2003).pdf| archive-date=14 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection comprised mostly objects related to the [[textile manufacturing]], [[featherwork]], [[pottery|ceramic production]], and [[Stone carving|stonecraft]] of the Andean cultures (groups of [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]]) and, to a lesser extent, of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] natives (including a rare assemblage of artifacts from the area of present-day Venezuela) and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures (mainly from present-day [[Mexico]] and [[Nicaragua]]). Several aspects of the daily routine, social organization, religiosity, and imagery of the Pre-Columbian civilizations are addressed in the collection, which has items from common daily use (clothing, body ornaments, weapons) to more refined artifacts, imbued with notable artistic sense (measurement and musical instruments, ritual objects, figurative ceramic sculptures and vessels distinguished for their aesthetic features).&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt; Other aspects of Pre-Columbian life, such as the dynamics of trade, ideological diffusion, and cultural influences among the groups, are also represented in the collection. Items are evaluated in terms of the similarity of decorative patterns and artistic techniques, as well as in the subjects portrayed. Common to nearly all distinct groups are such subjects as plants, nocturnal animals (bats, serpents, owls), and fantastic creatures associated to natural elements and phenomena.&lt;ref name="Visitação Escolar MN/UFRJ"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Guia de Visitação Escolar ao Museu Nacional/UFRJ| publisher=Museu Nacional/UFRJ| year=| url=http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/290230/Guia-de-Visita%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-UFRJ| accessdate=9 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214101615/http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/290230/Guia-de-Visita%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-UFRJ| archive-date=14 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 41-42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=43|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of Andean mummies of the National Museum allows a glimpse at the funerary practices of the cultures of the region. The mummies of the collection were preserved either naturally (as a result of the favorable geo-climatic conditions of the Andean Mountains) or artificially, in the context of religious and ritualistic practices. Originating from [[San Francisco de Chiu Chiu|Chiu Chiu]], at the [[Atacama Desert]], northern Chile, there is a mummy of a man with an estimated age of 3,400 to 4,700 years, preserved in a seated position, with the head resting on the knees and covered by a wool cap. This was the position which the Atacaman cultures used to sleep, due to the cold climate of the desert. It was also the position in which they were buried, together with their belongings.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 308"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=308|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second mummy in the collection{{snd}}an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] man, found in the surroundings of [[Lake Titicaca]], between Peru and Bolivia{{snd}}is preserved in the same position, but involved in a funerary bundle.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 309"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=309|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of mummies also include a boy, donated by the Chilean government, and, illustrating the techniques of artificial mummification of Pre-Columbian cultures, an example of a [[shrunken head]], coming from the [[Jivaroan peoples]] of equatorial Amazon, of ritualistic purposes.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 334"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=334|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of Brazilian archaeology of the National Museum brought together a vast set of artifacts produced by the cultures that flourished in the Brazilian territory during the pre-colonial era, with more than 90,000 objects. It was considered the largest collection in its typology worldwide. Gradually assembled since the early 19th century, the collection started being systematically gathered since 1867 and has been continually expanded until the present day, through excavations, acquisitions and donations, also serving as basis for a large number of research projects conducted by the academics of the museum, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and other institutions. It was composed of objects coming from all regions of Brazil, establishing a timeline spanning more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNRJ Arqueologia Dep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 45"/&gt;

From the oldest inhabitants of the Brazilian territory ([[Horticulture|horticulturists]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] groups), the museum preserved several artifacts made of stone ([[flint]], [[quartz]] and other minerals) and bones, such as [[projectile point]]s used for hunting, axe blades of polished stone and other tools used for carving, scraping, cleaving, triturating, and piercing, in addition to artifacts of ceremonial use and adornments. Although objects made of wood, fiber, and resin were also produced, the majority of them didn't stand the test of time and are almost absent in the collection, except for some individual pieces{{snd}}namely a woven straw basket covered by resin, only partially preserved, found in the southern coast of Brazil.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guia Expo MN Arqueologia Brasileira Artefatos Líticos Primeiros Povoadores"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Arqueologia Brasileira – Artefatos líticos dos primeiros povoadores| publisher=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/coletaartefatos.htm| accessdate=16 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503214622/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/coletaartefatos.htm| archive-date=3 May 2015| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Visitação Escolar MN/UFRJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 261"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=261|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the segment regarding the [[Sambaqui (culture)|Sambaqui people]], ''i.e.'' the fishing and gathering communities which lived in the south-central coast of Brazil between 8,000 years before present and the early Christian era, the National Museum holds a large number of vestiges originating from deposits constituted of agglomerated lime and organic material{{snd}}the so-called [[Sambaquis]], or [[midden]]s. Two fragments of Sambaquis are preserved in the collection, in addition to a group of human skeletal remains found in these archaeological sites, as well as several cultural testimonies of the Sambaqui people, encompassing utilitarian objects used in routine tasks (vessels, bowls, pestles and mortars carved in stone), ceremonies and rituals (such as votive statuettes). Among the highlights of the Sambaqui collection, there is a large set of [[Zoolite (sculpture)|zoolites]] (stone sculptures of votive use, with representation of animals, such as fish and birds, and human figures).&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Visitação Escolar MN/UFRJ"/&gt;
[[Image:Cultura Santarém - Vaso de gargalo MN 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Tapajós people|Santarém culture]]. Ceramic vessel ("caryatid" vase), 1000–1400 AD.]]
The collection included several examples of funerary urns, rattles, dishes, bowls, clothing, dresses, idols, and amulets, with emphasis being placed on ceramic objects, produced by numerous cultures of precolonial Brazil.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 43"/&gt; Best represented groups in the collection include:
* [[Marajoara culture]], which flourished on [[Marajó]] island, at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], between the 5th and the 15th centuries, considered the group that reached the highest level of [[social complexity]] in precolonial Brazil. The museum has a vast assemblage of Marajoara pottery, notable for their heightened artistic and aesthetic sense, as well as for the variety of shapes and refined decoration{{snd}}mostly works of figurative nature (representations of humans and animals), combined with rich geometric patterns (compositions imbued with symmetry, rhythmic repetitions, paired elements, binary oppositions, etc.) and with a predominant usage of the excision technique. Major part of the ceramic pieces are of ceremonial nature, used in funerary contexts, rites of passage, etc. Among the highlights, it's possible to mention the anthropomorphic statuettes (particularly the phallus-shaped female figurines, uniting the male and female principles, a recurring theme of the Marajoara art), large-scale funerary urns, anthropomorphic vases with geometric decoration, ritual thongs, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and hybrid vessels, etc.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 264-275"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=264–275|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tapajós people|Santarém culture]] (or Tapajós culture), which inhabited the region of the [[Tapajós|Tapajós River]] in the state of [[Pará]], between the 5th and the 15th centuries, known for their ceramic work of peculiar style and high technical quality, produced with the techniques of modeling, incision, dotted lines, and ''appliqué'', imbued with aesthetic features that suggest the influence of the [[Mesoamerican civilizations]]. Among the highlights of the collection were the anthropomorphic statuettes of naturalist style (characterised by the closed eyes, shaped like coffee beans), the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels, vases for ceremonial use and, above all, the so-called "caryatid vases" – complex ceramic vessels, endowed with bottlenecks, reliefs and pedestals decorated with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines and fantastic beings. The museum also possesses several examples of ''[[Muiraquitã]]s'', ''i.e.'' small statuettes carved in green gems, shaped like animals (mainly frogs) used as adornments or amulets.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 264-275"/&gt;
[[Image:Cultura Santarém - Vaso antropomorfo representando um homem sentado 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tapajós people|Santarém culture]]. Anthropomorphic vase representing a seated man, 1000–1400 AD.]]
* [[Konduri culture]], which reached their apex in the 7th century and met their decline in the 15th century, and inhabited the region between the [[Trombetas River|Trombetas]] and [[Nhamundá River|Nhamundá]] rivers, in Pará. Although this culture kept an intense contact with the Santarém culture, their artistic production developed unique features. The Konduri collection is primarily composed of pottery, noted for the techniques of decoration such as incision and dotted lines, the lively polichromy, and the reliefs with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 282"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|page=282|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trombetas River culture]], which inhabited the lower Amazon, in the state of Pará, near the region of [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]]. This culture, still largely unknown, was responsible for producing rare artifacts sculpted in polished stone and objects imbued with stylistic elements common to the Mesoamerican cultures. The museum collection preserves lithic artifacts of ceremonial use, as well as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes (zoolites representing fish and jaguars).&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 284-285"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=284–285|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Miracanguera culture]], which flourished on the left bank of the Amazon river, in the region between [[Itacoatiara, Amazonas|Itacoatiara]] and [[Manaus]], between the 9th and the 15th centuries. The museum preserved several examples of ceremonial pottery, mainly anthropomorphic funerary urns characterized by the presence of bulges, necks, and lids, used to store the ashes of the deceased, and other vessels related to funerary rituals. The Miracanguera pottery is distinguished for the presence of ''tabatinga'' layers (clay mixed with organic materials) and the eventual painted decoration of geometric motifs. The plastic composition frequently outlines specific details, such as human figures in a seated position, with the legs represented.&lt;ref name="Guia Expo MN Arqueologia Brasileira Miracanguera"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Arqueologia Brasileira – Miracanguera| publisher=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/miracanguera.htm| accessdate=16 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228162559/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/miracanguera.htm| archive-date=28 February 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Rio Trombetas - Zoólito em forma de peixe.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Trombetas River culture]]. Zoolite in the shape of a fish, w/d.]]
* [[Maracá culture]], which lived in the region of [[Amapá]] between the 15th and the 18th centuries, represented in the collection by a group of typical funerary urns depicting male and female figurines in hieratic position, with head-shaped lids, as well as zoomorphic funerary urns depicting quadrupedal animals, originating from indigenous cemeteries located in the outskirts of the [[Maracá River]]. The Maracá pottery was frequently adorned with geometric patterns and polychromed with white, yellow, red, and black pigments. Ornaments in the members and the head of the figures expressed the social identity of the deceased.&lt;ref name="MN Safra 2007 p 286-289"&gt;{{cite book|last= |first=|authorlink=|title=O Museu Nacional|year=2007|publisher=Banco Safra|location=São Paulo|pages=286–289|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tupi people|Tupi-Guaraní culture]], which inhabited the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century{{snd}}subdivided into the group of the [[Tupinambá people]] (in the [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] regions of Brazil) and the group of the [[Guaraní people]] (in the [[South Region, Brazil|South region of Brazil]] and parts of [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]]). The collection is predominantly composed of ceramics and lithic artifacts of daily use (such as pans, bowls, jars, and dishes) or ritual nature (mainly funerary urns). The Tupi-Guaraní pottery is characterized by its distinct polychromy (with predominance of red, black, and white pigments) and drawings of geometric and sinuous patterns.&lt;ref name="Guia Expo MN Arqueologia Brasileira Cerâmica Tupi-guarani"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Arqueologia Brasileira – Cerâmica Tupi-guaran| publisher=Guia de Exposições do Museu Nacional| year=| url=http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/ceramicatupi.htm| accessdate=16 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt| journal=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301013836/http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/guiaMN/Guia/paginas/7/ceramicatupi.htm| archive-date=1 March 2017| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Museum held the oldest known examples of indigenous mummies found in the Brazilian territory. The collection consisted of the body of an adult woman of approximately 25 years of age, and two children, one located at her feet, with an estimated age of twelve months, involved in a bundle, and a new-born, also covered by a mantle, positioned behind the head of the woman. This mummified set is composed of individuals that probably belonged to the group of the [[Aimoré people|Botocudos]] (or Aimoré) people, of the [[Macro-Jê languages|Macro-Jê]] branch. They were found at the ''Caverna da Babilônia'', a cavern located in the city of [[Rio Novo, Minas Gerais|Rio Novo]], interior of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], in a farm that belonged to [[Maria José de Santana]], who donated the mummies to emperor Pedro II. As an act of gratitude for this favor, Pedro II awarded Maria José with the title of Baroness of Santana.&lt;ref name="MN Íntimos"&gt;{{Cite document| title=Só para os íntimos| publisher=Revista de História| year=| url=http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/secao/artigos/so-para-os-intimos| accessdate=16 February 2017| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| language=pt}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial difficulties ==
From 2014 the museum faced budget cuts that dropped its maintenance to less than [[R$]]520,000 annually. The budget was so low, there was $0.01 to spend on each of the artifacts.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/08/lessons-from-the-destruction-of-the-national-museum-of-brazil|title=Lessons from the destruction of the National Museum of Brazil|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building fell into disrepair, evidenced by peeling wall material, exposed electrical wiring, and termite problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pamplona|first1=Nicola|last2=Alegretti|first2=Laís|title=Incêndio de grandes proporções atinge Museu Nacional na Quinta da Boa Vista, no Rio|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/09/incendio-atinge-o-museu-nacional-na-quinta-da-boa-vista-no-rio.shtml|work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=2 September 2018|language=pt|accessdate=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903002900/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/09/incendio-atinge-o-museu-nacional-na-quinta-da-boa-vista-no-rio.shtml|archive-date=3 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt; By June 2018, the museum's 200th anniversary, it had reached a state of near-complete abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fogo destrói Museu Nacional, mais antigo centro de ciência do País|url=https://brasil.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,incendio-atinge-museu-nacional-no-rio,70002484984|work=[[Estadão]]|date=2 September 2018|language=pt|accessdate=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082044/https://brasil.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,incendio-atinge-museu-nacional-no-rio,70002484984|archive-date=3 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an offer from The World Bank to purchase the museum for $80m, which was turned down because the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro would have to give up ownership.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

Although some items were saved, it is believed that 92.5 % of its archive of 20 million items was destroyed in the fire, though circa 1.5 million items are stored in a separate building, which were not damaged.&lt;ref name=bbc20180902&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45392668 |title=Fire engulfs 200-year-old Brazil museum|last=|first=|date=2 September 2018 |website=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903005443/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45392668|archive-date=2 September 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First responders fighting the fire were hindered by a lack of water. Rio's fire chief claimed that two nearby fire hydrants had insufficient water, leaving firefighters to resort to pumping water from a nearby lake. According to a CEDAE ({{ill|Rio de Janeiro's Water and Sewerage State Company|pt|Companhia Estadual de Águas e Esgotos do Rio de Janeiro}}) employee, although the hydrants did have water, the water pressure was very low, due to the fact that the building is on top of a hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio |title=Brazil museum fire: ‘incalculable’ loss as 200-year-old Rio institution gutted |first=Dom |last=Phillips |work=The Guardian |date=3 September 2018 |access-date=3 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903025826/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio |archive-date=3 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://veja.abril.com.br/brasil/reitor-da-ufrj-faltou-logistica-para-bombeiros-combaterem-incendio/|work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|language=pt|title=Falta de água prejudicou combate ao incêndio, diz comandante dos Bombeiros|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904115902/https://veja.abril.com.br/brasil/reitor-da-ufrj-faltou-logistica-para-bombeiros-combaterem-incendio/|archivedate=4 September 2018|date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil President Michel Temer claimed the loss due to the fire to be too great to have been predicted.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

With a mass 76 thousand times smaller than that of Bendegó, with mere 65 grams and 4&amp;nbsp;cm long, Angra dos Reis rock is the most valuable of the collection and was already the object of meteorite hunters. The Angra dos Reis takes its name because it was sighted by the doctor ''Joaquim Carlos Travassos'', who passed in a [[boat]] in front of ''Praia Grande'', in Angra and recovered it in the city of the coast of Rio de Janeiro in 1869. It was the first of a class of space travelers until very rare today. The object in smoke fell in the sea in front of the Church of Bonfim. Travassos ordered the slaves accompanying him to dive. Two pieces were rescued. One of them, with half a kilo, was entrusted to the Judge of Law of Angra dos Reis and, later, donated to the National Museum. In more than a century of research, this fragment was divided into small portions. The biggest one is buried in the rubble of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://revistagalileu.globo.com/Ciencia/noticia/2018/09/meteorito-de-r-3-mil-segue-perdido-nos-escombros-do-museu-nacional.html|title=Meteorito de R$ 3 mi segue perdido nos escombros do Museu Nacional|language=pt|date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-45599493|title=O meteorito que vale R$ 3 milhões e está perdido nos escombros do Museu Nacional|language=pt|date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Meteorites were found on October 19, 2018, inclusive the ''Angra dos Reais'', however cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2018/10/21/meteorito-que-vale-milhoes-de-reais-e-recuperado-dos-escombros-do-museu-nacional.ghtml|title=Meteorito que vale milhões de reais é recuperado dos escombros do Museu Nacional|language=pt|date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fractions were lost in the experiments, but much smaller fractions of the Angra are still known, with a maximum of 2.5 grams, scattered in collections and owned by researchers. From the existing reports, Travassos presented the father-in-law with the second fragment rescued from the sea, which would have about 1&amp;nbsp;kg. Since then, the trail of this rock has been lost, but could be in the [[Catholic Church]] possession. Researchers suspect, due to the characteristics of the original stone fittings, that there is a third, possibly still submerged in the Angra sea. For more than a century, it was the only copy of which one had science. Until, in the late 1990s, other rocks were discovered or reclassified as ''angrito'', a nomenclature given in reference to Angra dos Reis. According to The Meteoritical Society, there are only 28 known in the world. They are composed of minerals forged only at the very high temperatures of the planet's nucleus. They are the oldest magmatic rocks we know, formed when the solar system was still a cloud of gas and dust. It is estimated that the National Museum meteorite is 4.56 billion years old. For geologists and astronomers, the little rock is a book full of clues about the origin of the sun and the planets. It was in a box in a closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/ciencia-e-saude/noticia/2018/09/21/o-meteorito-que-vale-r-3-milhoes-e-esta-perdido-nos-escombros-do-museu-nacional.ghtml|title=O meteorito que vale R$ 3 milhões e está perdido nos escombros do Museu Nacional|language=pt|date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===
[[File:Ato em frente ao museu nacional 22.jpg|thumb|A protester outside the museum the day after the fire; the sign reads "200 years of history, 20 million items, reduced to ashes".]]

Brazil's president, [[Michel Temer]], said that "the loss of the National Museum is incalculable for Brazil. Today is a tragic day for our country's museology. Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost. The value of our history cannot be measured now, due to the damage to the building that housed the Royal Family during the Empire.

The archaeologist [[Zahi Hawass]] says that the tragedy legitimizes the movement for the [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriation]] of Egyptian objects in museums around the world and that if museums are not able to guarantee the safety and conservation of the objects, the archaeologist argues that to be returned to the native land. Although the collection of the National Museum was not targeted by Egyptian archaeologists, Hawass says that the destruction of the collection strengthens the movement for the repatriation of objects and that [[UNESCO]] observes countries with overseas collections and overseas museums to control them, to ensure that objects are properly protected and restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/internacional/noticia/2018-09/sociedade-que-edita-national-geographic-quer-ajudar-museu-nacional|title=Sociedade que edita a National Geographic quer ajudar Museu Nacional|website=BBC|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] expressed his condolences on Twitter at the event.

Brazilian environmentalist and politician [[Marina Silva]] called the fire "a [[lobotomy]] of the Brazilian memory".&lt;ref name="200Years" /&gt;

News of the fire quickly spread through the city of Rio de Janeiro, and protesters turned up at the gates in the early hours of Monday morning. Initial reports suggested that there were 500 people, forming a chain around the still-smoking building.&lt;ref name="1sbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/brazil-museum-fire-outrage-grows-as-government-blamed-for-tragic-blaze|title=Brazil museum fire: Outrage grows as government blamed for 'tragic' blaze|website=SBS News|accessdate=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904012833/https://www.sbs.com.au/news/brazil-museum-fire-outrage-grows-as-government-blamed-for-tragic-blaze|archive-date=4 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the protesters tried to climb over fencing into the museum grounds; the police who were called to attend, in full riot gear, threw tear gas bombs into the crowds.

=== Cultural institutions ===
The president of the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]], ''Kátia Bogéa'', said that "It's a national and worldwide tragedy. Everybody can see that this is not a loss for the Brazilian people, but for the whole humanity" and commented that it was "a predictable tragedy, because we've known for a long time that Brazilian cultural heritage has no budget".&lt;ref name="reperc_g1"/&gt;

Museums around the world sent their condolences. In the UK, the [[British Library]] said "our hearts go out to the staff and users of [the National Museum] of Brazil" and called the fire "a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of our shared global heritage";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/britishlibrary/status/1036551949578129408|title=Our hearts go out to the staff and users of @MuseuNacional of Brazil.

=== Salvage efforts ===
[[File:RoofMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's depiction of the planned museum roof]]

On 12 September 2018, people began implementing a plan to temporarily shelter and work with what is currently the [[ruins]] of the Museum:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/agencia-estado/2018/09/12/museu-nacional-e-cercado-com-tapumes-de-madeira.htm|title=Museu Nacional é cercado com tapumes dez dias após incêndio|work=UOL notícias|language=pt|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Wooden structures, including a metallic [[wall]], completely surrounding the São Cristovão Palace to protect what remains of the building
* Containment measures for the building to avoid risk of [[landslide]]
* An improvised roof to protect against [[rain]] water
* [[Modular building|Module]]s and containers outside to serve as temporary research [[laboratory]] space

This plan cost [[R$]] 9 million, offered by Brazilian Government as an emergency budget and received since then by Museum. The contracted company to reinstall the walls of building is ''Concrejato'' at a value of R$ 8.998.057,66 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/09/18/ufrj-define-empresa-que-vai-escorar-a-fachada-do-museu-nacional.ghtml|title=UFRJ define empresa que vai escorar a fachada do Museu Nacional|work=Globo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Unesco says that the reconstruction would take 10 years to get ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/afp/2018/09/18/restauracao-do-museu-nacional-levara-10-anos-diz-unesco.htm|title=Restauração do Museu Nacional levará 10 anos, diz Unesco|work=UOL|access-date=2018-09-19|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are recreating 300 parts of the collection of the National Museum, including the skull of Luzia, with [[3D printing|3D printers]].

Museum zoologists have already gone to the field to collect new specimens in an attempt to repopulate the [[invertebrate]] collection, one of the richest (with 5 million copies only in the case of insects) and harder hit by the fire. Before a revamped headquarters is available, Kellner said the museum's intention is to re-display its collection - still considerable - to the public. There is a collective funding campaign to allow the institution's loan back to schools and the plan to revitalize the museum's botanical garden so that it houses a small exhibition that would receive visitors again. "It would be an illusion, even a frivolous thing, to say that the old collection will be reconstituted, but we will continue to fulfill our role," said the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.noticiasaominuto.com.br/brasil/659821/um-mes-depois-buscas-por-itens-no-museu-nacional-ainda-nao-comecaram|title=Um mês depois, buscas por itens no Museu Nacional ainda não começaram|work=Notícia ao minuto|access-date=2018-10-02|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also informed they plan to keep part of ruins as historical exposition with a high modern structure of equipment inside.

The Facade and the exterior of the National Museum will be preserved in the reconstruction works, but the building will be another, said the UFRJ's dean, ''Roberto Leher''. The recovery of the building will take into account a new [[concept]] of [[architecture]]. The cost will still depend on the concept of the museum. Technicians focus are on [[3D modeling]] and a term of reference. New materials with low-carbon, energy-less, environmentally friendly will be used because is a science museum.

== Donations ==
*The [[German Foreign Ministry]] has offered [[€]] 1 million in aid to rebuild Brazil's National Museum. This amount was used to buy [[Intermodal container|container]]-[[laboratory|laboratories]] to investigate specimens. Those equipment were to be located in a donated field nearby [[Maracanã Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-pledges-1-million-for-rio-museum-cleanup/a-45377448|title=Germany pledges €1 million for Rio museum cleanup|work=DW|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Each of 140 [[geopark]]s of UNESCO's conservation areas will collect and send a [[Lithic fragment (geology)|lithic]], [[fossil]], or [[cultural artifact]] to Brazil. This means 140 objects will complement the future collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nacoesunidas.org/parques-mundiais-da-unesco-anunciam-doacao-para-museu-nacional-do-rio/|title=Parques mundiais da UNESCO anunciam doação para Museu Nacional do Rio|access-date=2018-10-04|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On October 17, 2018 Secretary of the Patrimony of the Union, Sidrack Correia confirmed the donation of the area of 49,300 square meters, that is about a kilometer from the museum, to install laboratories Containers in 45 days, budgeted at R$ 2.2 million, purchased with funds from the TJRJ Pecunary Penalty Fund to be used by museum researchers. It also serves as a center for students visitation. Part of the total, 10 thousand square meters will be for the Justice Court to install its transport area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/10/17/governo-federal-doa-terreno-para-a-construcao-de-laboratorios-do-museu-nacional.ghtml|title=Governo federal doa terreno para a construção de laboratórios do Museu Nacional|work=G1|access-date=2018-10-18|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), linked to the Ministry of Industry, Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC), concluded on October 17, 2018 the donation of 1,164 items, mostly mobile, to the National Museum. The furniture, which includes tables, chairs, workstations, drawers and cabinets, aid in the restructuring of the Museum. The idea of the donation came from the need for the institute to free itself of idle equipment that was in its old headquarters, in Edifício A Noite, located in Praça Mauá, the port area of Rio de Janeiro, to allow the return of the property to the Secretariat of the Patrimony of the Union (SPU), which should had been empty. Part of the furniture will be taken to the Botanical Garden of the National Museum, located in Quinta da Boa Vista, where some sectors are working. Others will be used in the direction of the museum, in the services of museology and teaching assistance, and in the departments of invertebrates, geology, paleontology, entomology and ethnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/brasil/2018/10/17/interna-brasil,713350/npi-doa-moveis-para-ajudar-na-recuperacao-do-museu-nacional.shtml|title=INPI doa móveis para ajudar na recuperação do Museu Nacional|work=Correio Brasiliense, Agência Brasil|access-date=2018-10-18|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political influences ==
The director of the National Museum, Alexander W. A. Kellner, issued an open letter addressed to presidential candidates [[Jair Messias Bolsonaro]] and [[Fernando Haddad]] on October 15, 2018 Monday evening, which, along two pages, reinforces the historical importance of the institution, and recalls that his survival is tied to the responsibility of those who hold "power in the hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/museu-nacional-em-carta-presidenciaveis-diretor-fala-sobre-quem-tem-poder-nas-maos-23158844|title=Museu Nacional: em carta a presidenciáveis diretor fala sobre quem tem o 'poder nas mãos'|access-date=2018-10-04|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is also destined for the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], where he had regularly gone to ask for a public hearing, during which he will ask for the inclusion of resources for the museum, and for the next budget. Without these resources, he says the institution will end up for years, harming decades of research.

In the letter, the director says that many reflect on what could have been done differently to avoid a disaster that led to the loss of an invaluable patrimony, involving millions of cultural and scientific pieces. And he adds that "others should (or should) be deeply reflecting on why, being in a position of decision, they did not act firmly in triggering actions that would have avoided the absurdity of that loss."

On October 17, 2018 the Director of Museum had a meeting with federal deputies to solve first R$ 50 million to reinstall the front part of Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2018/10/17/incendio-no-museu-nacional-gestores-pedem-r-50-milhoes-para-restaurar-predio.ghtml|title=Incêndio no Museu Nacional: gestores pedem R$ 50 milhões para restaurar prédio|work=G1|access-date=2018-10-18|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MNPhases.jpg|thumb|Phases]]
On final of October 2018, the Museum's Director atended an audience in [[Brasília]] at [[Chamber of Deputies]] in order to guarantee R$ 56 millions for basic reconstruction of front part of main building, #1, including the [[facade]], [[roof]] and its [[structure]]. He negotiated the money before the President elected [[Jair Bolsonaro]] be sworn in, afraid the building would remain destroyed for years in abandoned situation. Also the containers laboratories were not received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://extra.globo.com/noticias/rio/diretor-do-museu-nacional-vai-camara-em-busca-de-56-milhoes-para-reconstrucao-23195245.html|title=Diretor do Museu Nacional vai à Câmara em busca de R$ 56 milhões para reconstrução|work=G1|access-date=2018-10-29|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2018 the House of Representatives in Brasilia approved an amendment of R$ 55 millions to the budget of 2019. This should have to be further approved by a ''Joint Committee'' and also by the ''Congress Plenary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2018/10/31/museu-nacional-ira-receber-primeira-parte-da-verba-para-reconstrucao-em-2019.ghtml|title=Museu Nacional irá receber primeira parte da verba para reconstrução em 2019|work=G1|access-date=2018-10-31|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director travelled to [[China]] to guarantee pieces of collection to the museum.

A proposal by [[Senator]] ''Maria do Carmo Alves (DEM-SE)'' under analysis in the Commission of Education, Culture and Sport includes in the official Brazilian calendar the National Day of the Museum, to be celebrated on May 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/audios/2018/11/comissao-analisa-criacao-do-dia-nacional-do-museu-em-18-de-maio|title=Comissão analisa criação do Dia Nacional do Museu, em 18 de maio|work=Senado Notícias|access-date=2018-11-13|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until December 2018, the concern was the change of Brazilian Government, because none of the transition teams of the future governor of Rio de Janeiro, neither president of the Republic [[Jair Messias Bolsonaro]] have sought the direction of the museum to talk about the disaster that hit the House of the Imperial Family. Even then, the Containers to store restored objects, until the reconstruction work is completed, had not yet been delivered by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which did not express its opinion on the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bandnewsfmrio.band.uol.com.br/editorias-detalhes/incendio-no-museu-nacional-completa-tres-mese|title=Incêndio no Museu Nacional completa três meses|date=1 December 2018|publisher=Band News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, {{Sum|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|-2018}} years, {{Sum|{{CURRENTMONTH}}|-09}}  months and {{Sum|{{CURRENTDAY}}|-02}} days have passed since the fire.

'''Newspaper production process'''. Newspaper&lt;ref&gt;[[Newspaper#Article type summary in lower lede]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}} production is an act that actually starts from the gathering of news stories, articles, opinions, advertorials and advertisements to printing and folding of the so called “Hard Copy”. Usually the news are printed onto [[newsprint]]. The whole production process can be divided into four parts, they are: Content gathering, Pre Press, Press and Post Press.

==Content gathering==
 
Typical newspaper content can be dived in two parts: News/Information and [[Advertising|Advertisement]]. 

[[News]] production starts with the reporters going out to their respective beat to gather stories and cover events and also the marketing department getting [[advertisement]] into the newspaper on daily basis. It starts with reporters getting their stories ready daily and sending their stories in electronically through their mails to the editor. Each [[reporter]] works with a particular desk in the newsroom, some of these desks are: Metro desk, Sport desk, Business desk, Political desk, Education desk and others. News gathering and dissemination is paramount to every newspaper as this is the responsibility of the newspaper house to the people and this can determine their level of advertiser’s patronage.
After stories are gathered, the Sub Editors are saddled with the responsibility of editing copies submitted by the reporter using a red pen or red font color, the Chief Sub Editor uses blue while the [[Editor]] uses green. This tells that each of the editing done on a particular story is still subjected to the final editing done by either the Chief Sub Editor or the Editor. Some newsrooms have started to automate parts of the [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on digital and social platforms].

==Pre press==
Pre press is where photos are edited, advertisements are created and composed and the whole pages of the newspapers are laid-out and designed. 

After stories have been edited, the editor and other sub editors will sit in an editorial conference to determine what goes inside the paper for the day. Then, each sub editor is expected to plan their pages if possible. The marketing department also will forward the [[advertisement]]s that have been paid for with specification of the pages allotted to the advert, all these will be forwarded to editorial department so as to add these pages in their planning process. The [[newspaper]] planning is done on a dummy sheet to give a prototype of the final outlook of each pages, this is called page planning. 
After the planning, the editorial department forwards the already planned pages to the graphic section where the dummy sheets are transformed the a meaningful [[digital data|digital]] form. At the pre press, text, [[pictures]], cutline, [[graphics]], and graphical illustrations as well as color are put together to form the newspaper pages. Smaller newspapers sometimes still use desktop publishing programs ([[Desktop publishing|DTP]]) such as Corel Draw, Adobe PageMaker, Adobe InDesign, Quark XPress and other graphic design [[software]]. This software enables the [[graphic]] designer to easily compose pages and output them on a hardcopy proof-printer for [[proofreading]] and sending the corrected and finished pages to a RIP ([[Raster image processor|Raster Image Processor]]). The RIP transformes [[PostScript]] (PS/EPS) or [[PDF]] pages into rasterized [[TIFF|TIFF G4]] data. The TIFF data is usually imaged in a CTP-device using a [[Laser]] directly onto the [[Offset Printing plates|offset printing plates]]. Earlier – and even sometimes nowadays – data imaging was done using a film-workflow. So the data was imaged at first onto a [[Photographic film|film]] and then the film was copied with [[Ultraviolet|UV-light]] onto UV-sensitive offset printing plates. The final stage in the newspaper pre-press phase is preparing the imaged offset printing plates for mounting onto the plate cylinder inside of the [[offset press]]. The plates have to be bent and often also punched so that they can be mounted easily and proper on the plate cylinder. 

In order to produce good color quality newspaper follow [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers|WAN-IFRA]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards namely ISO 12647-3 (2013) and [http://www.ifra.com/WebSite%5CIFRAEvent.nsf/0/72B4B80E1D9E5094C12576B1003BCF77/$File/MoritzSchwarzPressAcceptanceTest.pdf Ifra Special Report 1-2008]. [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitungsdruck] 

==Press==
The printing process is the main process step during newspaper production. Quickness and reliability with at the same time reasonable producing are the cornerstones in the production and processing of print products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspaper-production.com/improving-processes|title=newspaper production consulting: Be efficient with Kirchner + Robrecht|website=newspaper production consulting: Be efficient with Kirchner + Robrecht|language=de|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newspaper presses produce not just goods in process (sheets, signatures or reels of printout) as it is the case with typical printing presses. Instead newspaper rotary presses can produce copies which are finished goods. 

The typical newspaper press is divided into two parts: printing and folding.

===''Printing''===

The first functions of a newspaper press are loading and unwinding of newsprint reels. These functions are provided by the ''paster''. Pasters unwind paper reels and automatically change paper reels at full production speed (e.g. 100.000 copies per hour). Often pasters are place below the printing towers. The towers often consist of four printing units to print [[Ink|Cyan]], Magenta, Yellow and Black ink onto the newsprint. The newsprint web travels upwards in the printing tower during the color is applied to it on both sides of the reel. Usually for every page there is one individual printing plate per color. This printing plate is mounted onto the plate cylinder within the printing unit which again is part of the printing tower. Modern presses can print full color on every page. Four color printing units are used for printing on one side of the paper web and another four printing units apply the backside print onto the paper web. Printing front and backside can happen simultaneously (blanket-to-blanket-configuration) or after another (satellite configuration) The printing units cannot just print one page like in digital printing, instead printing towers in newspaper presses can print up to 24 broadsheet pages in full color. If the press consists of several towers much more pages can be printed at once. 

==='''''Folding'''''===

The folder starts were the printed webs come together. The Folder can produce ribbons and combine these ribbons in such a way that the pages are sorted ontop of each other. The folding process starts in the so called super structure and ends in the main foling units at the end of the press process. The ribbons are cut in such a way that the pages of the newspaper are separated from each other and the folder lays down the newspaper copies onto the delivery belt. 

The first real newspaper presses was produced by [[Koenig &amp; Bauer]]. The [[The Times|Times]] in London was printed at first on a rotary/flat machine press instead of a hand press in the night from 28 to 29 November 1819. Today also other manufacturers such as Goss, [[Manroland|Manroland Web Systems]], TKS, [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi]] and TPH are in the press market. 

==Post press==
The copies are collected on the delivery belt and usually transported to the mailroom using a gripper conveyor system. The post press area is also often called mailroom because here the copies are prepared for mailing to the customers. Newspaper copies can be bundled directly so that they are ready to be put into a truck for transportation. Alternatively extra preprints from the newspaper press or flyers/brochures from external sources can inserted into the newspaper copies before creating bundles. Mailroom systems are mostly manufactured by three companies (Ferag, [[Muller Martini|Müller Martini]] and Schur).

The ''Almanac'' also features sections that predict [[Fads and trends|trends]] in fashion, food, home, technology, and living for the coming year.

Released the first Tuesday in the September that precedes the year printed on its cover, ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' has been published continuously since 1792, making it the oldest continuously published periodical in North America.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park |first=Edwards |title=Weathering Every Season with One Canhjny Compendium |journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |at=91 |date=November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Directory of Writer's Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AaVAm-OzsgC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=oldest+continuously+published+periodical+almanac&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xnvfrh8d2G&amp;sig=mL08FksAQNMgybJr_LpzVitEe0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwDGoVChMI5a2s1ISSxwIVR9geCh1jJATz#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20continuously%20published%20periodical%20almanac&amp;f=false |title=The American Directory of Writer's Guidelines |accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Early Republic and Antebellum America"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bates |first=Christopher |date= |title=The Early Republic and Antebellum America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWLxBwAAQBAJ |location=NY, NY |publisher=Routledge |page=830 |isbn=978-1-3174-5740-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history (1792–1850)==
[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the 1793 edition.]]
The first ''Old Farmer's Almanac'' (then known as ''The Farmer's Almanac'') was edited by Robert B. Thomas, the publication's founder.&lt;ref name="columbiab"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Thomas, Robert Bailey |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |date=November 2015 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/al/almanac.html |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many competing [[almanac]]s in the 18th century, but Thomas's upstart was a success.&lt;ref name="columbiab"/&gt; In its second year, distribution tripled to 9,000.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; The initial cost of the book was six pence (about four cents).&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

To calculate the ''Almanac''{{'}}s weather predictions, Thomas studied solar activity,&lt;ref name="nprtotn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pierce |first=John |title=Strange Weather and What it Means |work=Talk of the Nation |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=September 20, 2000 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1082107 |format=SMIL (RealAudio) |accessdate=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; astronomy cycles and [[meteorology|weather patterns]] and used his research to develop a secret [[weather forecasting|forecasting]] formula, which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lamb |first=David |title=Almanac begins third century of know-and-tell |page=5 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other than the ''Almanac''{{'}}s prognosticators, few people have seen the formula. It is kept in a black tin box at the ''Almanac'' offices in [[Dublin, New Hampshire|Dublin]], New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

Thomas also started drilling a hole through the ''Almanac'' so that subscribers could hang it from a nail or a string.&lt;ref name="the hole story"&gt;[http://www.qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/article_865b5f0c-9c1d-11de-81cf-001cc4c03286.html The hole story of Almanac cover], qctimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas served as editor until his death on May 19, 1846. As its editor for more than 50 years, Thomas established ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' as America's "most enduring" almanac by outlasting the competition.&lt;ref name="columbiab"/&gt;

===Becoming "Old"===

In 1832, with his almanac having survived longer than similarly named competitors, Thomas inserted the word "Old" in the title,&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; later dropping it in the title of the 1836 edition. After Thomas's death, John Henry Jenks was appointed editor and, in 1848, the book's name was permanently and officially revised to ''The Old Farmer's Almanac''.

==19th and 20th centuries==
[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1851 cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the 1851 edition.]]

In 1851, Jenks made another change to the ''Almanac'' when he featured a "four seasons" drawing on the cover by Boston artist [[Hammatt Billings]], engraved by [[Henry Nichols (engraver)|Henry Nichols]]. Jenks dropped the new cover for three years and then reinstated it permanently in 1855. This trademarked design is still in use today.

In 1858, [[Abraham Lincoln]] may have used a copy of ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' to argue the innocence of his client, [[William "Duff" Armstrong]], who was on trial for murder in [[Beardstown, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelincolnlog.org/month.php?date_value=1858-05-07 |title=The Papers of Abraham Lincoln |year=2007 |accessdate=March 24, 2007 |author=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln used an almanac to refute the testimony of Charles Allen, an eyewitness who claimed he had seen the crime by the light of the moon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/ihx/lincolnindex.htm |title=Lincoln Room – Lincoln Collections |year=2007 |accessdate=March 24, 2007 |author=University of Illinois Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205225335/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/ihx/lincolnindex.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 29, 1857.

The book stated that not only was the Moon in the first quarter, but it was riding "low" on the horizon, about to set. Because the actual almanac used in the trial was not retained for posterity, there exists some controversy as to whether ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' was the one used.  In 2007, a competing almanac, the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', based in Lewiston, Maine, ran an article claiming that the almanac in question may have been theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rao, Joe |journal=Farmer's Almanac |title= A 100% Guarantee and How We 'May' Have Helped a Former U.S. President, |issue=190 | pages=142–144 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1861, [[Charles Louis Flint]] became editor and provided his readers with a heavier emphasis on farming. The next two editors, John Bobies Tileston and Loomis Joseph Campbell, served short terms and made no format changes.&lt;ref name="ofahistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almanac.com/history/ |title=History of ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' |date=February 22, 2007 |accessdate=February 22, 2007 |author=Almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Robert Ware took over as the book's sixth editor in 1877 and served for 23 years before his brother, Horace, was named to the position in 1900. During Horace Everett Ware's 19 years as editor, he began to orient the book toward a more general audience by replacing the scientific agricultural articles with general features on nature and modern life.&lt;ref name="ofahistory"/&gt;
 
The eighth and ninth editors, Frank B. Newton and Col. Carroll J. Swan, kept ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' tradition alive through wartime and the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref name="ofahistory"/&gt;
 
Roger Scaife was appointed editor in 1936.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; His term coincided with the only time in the history of ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' that its distribution declined and the book's financial stability fell into question. The 1938 edition had a circulation of less than 89,000, compared with 225,000 in 1863.&lt;ref name="ofahistory"/&gt;
 
During his tenure, Scaife also committed the greatest of all blunders in ''Almanac'' history: In the 1938 edition, he dropped the weather forecasts.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; In their place, he substituted temperature and precipitation averages.&lt;ref name="uslegion"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sagendorph |first=Robb |author-link=Robb Sagendorph |title =My Life with the Old Farmer's Almanac |magazine=The American Legion Magazine |pages=24–26, 50–52  |date=January 1965 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public outcry was so great that he reinstated the forecasts in the next year's edition,&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; but the decision had already destroyed his reputation.&lt;ref name="ofahistory"/&gt;

===A new beginning===
[[File:Yankee Publishing, Inc. Headquarters.jpg|320px|thumb|Yankee Publishing, Inc. Headquarters. Publishers of ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' and ''Yankee Magazine'' in Dublin, NH]]
In 1939, Robb Sagendorph, founder and president of Yankee, Inc. (later known as Yankee Publishing, Inc.), acquired the publishing rights to ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' and became its editor.&lt;ref name="uslegion"/&gt;  Sagendorph had moved his family to Dublin, New Hampshire in 1930, and started the magazine ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'' in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporate/soskb/Filings.asp?349014 |title=Corporation Filings |date=August 5, 1935 |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |author=New Hampshire Secretary of State – Corporation Division |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095713/https://www.sos.nh.gov/corporate/soskb/Filings.asp?349014 |archivedate=June 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling that tradition was ''The Old Farmer's Almanac's'' strongest suit, Sagendorph immediately reestablished its format and editorial style to reflect the interests of the general populace much as it had a century earlier.&lt;ref name="uslegion"/&gt; He was fond of quoting Robert B. Thomas, who wrote in 1829 that the Almanac "strives to be useful, but with a pleasant degree of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Robert B. |authorlink=Robert B. Thomas |title=To Patrons |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac |issue=XXXVII |page=1 |publisher=Richardson and Lord |year=1829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Sagendorph's leadership, ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' thrived and readership grew each year.&lt;ref name="uslegion"/&gt;

===A halt in publication (almost)===
During World War II, a German spy was apprehended in New York with a copy of the 1942 ''Old Farmer's Almanac'' in his pocket.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

From 1943 through 1945, to comply with the U.S.
[[Office of Censorship|Office of Censorship's]] voluntary
''[[Office of Censorship#The Code of Wartime Practices|Code of Wartime Practices]]'' for press and radio, ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' featured weather indications rather than forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac |title=To Patrons and Correspondents |issue=151 |page=2 |year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac |title=To Patrons and Correspondents |issue=152 |page=2 |year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac |title=To Patrons and Correspondents |issue=153 |page=2 |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed it to maintain its perfect record of continuous publication.

==Recent history==
[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac logo.svg|thumb|''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' Logo]]
Sagendorph served as the ''Almanac''{{'}}s editor until his death in 1970. His nephew, Judson D. Hale, Sr., took over and kept the ''Almanac'' true to the vision of his uncle. In 2000, the editorial reins were passed to Janice Stillman, the first woman in the ''Almanac''{{'}}s history to hold the position. She is the 13th person to hold the title of editor since it was first published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almanac.com/content/meet-our-editors |title=The Old Farmer's Almanac – Our Editors |year=2015 |accessdate=August 4, 2015 |author=Almanac.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424052356/http://www.almanac.com/content/meet-our-editors |archivedate = April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hale still acts as the publication's editor in chief. In 1992, the ''Almanac''{{'}}s distribution passed the four million mark.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; It is still headquartered in [[Dublin, New Hampshire|Dublin]], New Hampshire.

In the 1990s, the editors decided to discontinue drilling the hole in the ''Almanac'' because it was costing them $40,000 a year and they felt that it was no longer needed. However, when they surveyed their subscribers, the response was overwhelmingly in favor of keeping the holes, so the editors decided to continue drilling them.&lt;ref name="the hole story" /&gt;

===Editions===
''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' publishes four editions per year.  Its annual circulation is 3 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cogan|first1=Marin|title=The Surprising Success of America’s Oldest Living Magazine|url=https://www.topic.com/the-surprising-success-of-america-s-oldest-living-magazine|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=Topic.com|issue=7|publisher=[[First Look Media]]|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only difference between the three U.S. editions is the city by which astronomical information is calculated and how tide times are presented. The National edition is fitted for Boston and the New England states;&lt;ref name="ofanatl"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – National Edition |title=Title Page |issue=215 |page=1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Southern edition is fitted for Atlanta and the southern states;&lt;ref name="ofasouth"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – Southern Edition |title=Title Page |issue=215 |page=1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Western edition is fitted for San Francisco and the western states.&lt;ref name="ofawest"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – Western Edition |title=Title Page |issue=215 |page=1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each edition contains calculations to answer for all the United States.&lt;ref name="ofanatl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ofasouth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ofawest"/&gt;

In 1982, ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' began publishing an annual Canadian edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is fitted for Ottawa, with calculations to answer for all the Canadian provinces,&lt;ref name="ofacanada"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – Canadian Edition |issue=215 |page=1 |year=2007 |title=Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features provincial weather forecasts as well as stories that speak specifically to the [[Canadian history|history]], traditions, and [[Canadian culture|culture]] of the country.

==Weather predictions==
Forecasts emphasize temperature and precipitation deviations from averages. These are based on 30-year statistical averages prepared by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and updated every ten years. The most recent climatological normals tabulation spans the period 1971 through 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/normals/usnormals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011011051630/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/normals/usnormals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 11, 2001 |title=U.S. Normals |year=2007 |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |author=National Climatic Data Center, [[NOAA]], U.S. Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' has always looked to Thomas's original formula to help with predictions, its forecasting methods have been refined over the years. Today, they also incorporate observations of sunspots and other solar activity. Weather trends and events are predicted by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity.&lt;ref name="nprtotn"/&gt;

Forecasts are prepared as much as 18 months in advance&lt;ref name="nprtotn"/&gt; and presented in each edition by region.  There are 16 regions for the U.S.&lt;ref name="ofaustoc"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – National Edition |title=Table of Contents |issue=215 |page=2 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and five for Canada&lt;ref name="ofacatoc"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Old Farmer's Almanac – Canadian Edition |title=Table of Contents |issue=215 |page=2 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their respective country editions. Four additional regions are available on the Almanac's Web site, Almanac.com. These include Hawaii and Alaska for the U.S. and the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almanac.com/weather/longrange |title=Long-Range Weather Forecast Locations in USA and Canada |year=2017 |accessdate=September 26, 2017 |author=Almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the ''Almanac'' stated that the earth had entered a [[global cooling]] period that would probably last decades.  The journal based its prediction on sunspot cycles.  Said contributing meteorologist [[Joseph D'Aleo]], "Studying these and other factor suggests that cold, not warm, climate may be our future."&lt;ref&gt;Tirrell-Wysocki, David, "Old Farmer's Almanac forecasts global 'cooling'", ''[[Brattleboro Reformer]]'', September 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accuracy===
The accuracy of ''The Old Farmer's Almanac''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s predictions has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas M. |last=Kostigen |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/27/kostigen-farmers-almanac/20851273/ |title=Think almanacs can predict 2015 weather?

In its bicentennial edition, the ''Almanac'' stated, "neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy."&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

==Related publications and entities==
Under ''The Old Farmer's Almanac'' brand, Yankee Publishing also produces ''The Old Farmer's Almanac Garden Guide'', an annual gardening resource,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almanac.com/content/2017-garden-guide |title=The Old Farmer's Almanac Garden Guide |year=2017 |accessdate=September 26, 2017 |author=Almanac.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715024615/http://www.almanac.com/garden/07.gg/index.php |archivedate=July 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Old Farmer's Almanac for Kids'', an Almanac-inspired book designed for children ages 8 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.almanac.com/content/old-farmers-almanac-kids-vol-7 |title=Old Farmer's Almanac for Kids |year=2017 |accessdate=September 26, 2017 |author=Almanac.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is published every other year.

==Sacred texts==
===Written Torah===
* [[Tanakh]]
** [[Torah]]
*** [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]]–a Torah in printed form
** [[Nevi'im]]
** [[Ketuvim]]

===Oral Torah===
{{Rabbinical eras timeline|-250|0|Zugot}}
*[[Oral Torah]]
**[[Talmud]] (as encompassing the main Oral Law)
***[[Jerusalem Talmud]]
***[[Babylonian Talmud]]
****[[Mishnah]], the first major written redaction of the Jewish oral traditions known as the "Oral Torah".
*****[[Gemara]], rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah
*****[[Aggadah]], a compendium of rabbinic texts that incorporates folklore, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice in various spheres, from business to medicine.
**[[Tosefta]], a compilation of the Jewish oral law from the late 2nd century, the period of the Mishnah
**[[Midrash]], the genre of rabbinic literature which contains early interpretations and commentaries on the Written Torah and Oral Torah (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (aggadah) and occasionally the Jewish religious laws (halakha), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture (Tanakh).[2]
*[[Midrash halakha]]
*[[Musar literature|Mussar]]
*[[Geonim]], presidents of the two great Babylonian, Talmudic Academies of Sura and Pumbedita, in the Abbasid Caliphate, and generally accepted spiritual leaders of the Jewish community worldwide in the early medieval era
*[[Rishonim]], the leading rabbis and poskim who lived approximately during the 11th to 15th centuries, in the era before the writing of the Shulchan Aruch (Hebrew: שׁוּלחָן עָרוּך, "Set Table", a common printed code of Jewish law, 1563 CE) and following the Geonim (589-1038 CE)
*[[Acharonim]], the leading rabbis and poskim (Jewish legal decisors) living from roughly the 16th century to the present, and more specifically since the writing of the Shulchan Aruch (Hebrew: שׁוּלחָן עָרוּך, "Set Table", a code of Jewish law) in 1563 CE.

==Rabbinic literature==
[[Rabbinic literature]], in its broadest sense, can mean the entire spectrum of [[rabbi]]nic writings throughout [[Judaism|Jewish]] history. But the term often refers specifically to literature from the [[Talmud]]ic era, as opposed to [[medieval]] and modern rabbinic writing, and thus corresponds with the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''Sifrut Hazal'' (ספרות חז"ל; "Literature [of our] sages [of] blessed memory," where ''Hazal'' normally refers ''only'' to the sages of the Talmudic era). This more specific sense of "Rabbinic literature"&amp;mdash;referring to the [[Talmud]]im, [[Midrash]], and related writings, but hardly ever to later texts&amp;mdash;is how the term is generally intended when used in contemporary academic writing. On the other hand, the terms ''meforshim'' and ''parshanim'' (commentaries/commentators) almost always refer to later, post-Talmudic writers of Rabbinic glosses on [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] and Talmudic texts.

===Mishnaic literature===
The [[Mishnah]] and the [[Tosefta]] (compiled from materials pre-dating the year 200) are the earliest extant works of rabbinic literature, expounding and developing Judaism's [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], as well as ethical teachings.   Following these came the two [[Talmud]]s:
*The [[Jerusalem Talmud]], c. 450
*The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], c. 600
*The [[minor tractates]] (part of the Babylonian Talmud)

===The Midrash===
The ''[[midrash]]''&lt;ref name=RandomHouse&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midrash "midrash"]. ''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the genre of [[rabbinic literature]] which contains early interpretations and commentaries on the [[Written Torah]] and [[Oral Torah]], as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (''{{lang|he|[[aggadah]]}}'') and occasionally the Jewish religious laws (''{{lang|he|[[halakha]]}}''), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Tanakh.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 182, Moshe David Herr&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''midrash'' also can refer to a compilation of Midrashic teachings, in the form of legal, exegetical, homiletical, or narrative writing, often configured as a commentary on the [[Bible]] or [[Mishnah]].

===Meforshim===
:''Meforshim'' is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning "(classical rabbinical) commentators" (or roughly meaning "[[Exegesis|exegetes]]"), and is used as a substitute for the correct word ''[[perushim]]'' which means "commentaries".

'''''Peter Paul and Others v Bundesrepublik Deutschland''''' ([2004] ECR I-09425) is a [[European Court of Justice]] case regarding the civil liability of bank regulators in a case where those regulators were alleged to have failed in their duty. As of November 2008, it is the only ECJ case to consider the Deposit Guarantee Directive (94/19/EC),&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[EUR-Lex]].&lt;/ref&gt; which was one of the causes of the [[Icesave dispute]] between [[Iceland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in late 2008.

The Court ruled that the various [[European Union directive|Directives]] on banking supervision did not confer rights on individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of the Court, paras. 41, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and so individual depositors were not entitled to damages from banking supervisors if those Directives were breached. The only individual right guaranteed under [[European Union law]] was the minimum [[deposit insurance]], covering the first 20&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;[[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of the Court, para. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4975">'''Pierre Grégoire'''  (also '''Pedro Gregoire''', '''Petrus Gregorius Tholosanus''') (c.1540–1597) was a French jurist and philosopher

== Career ==
He was born at [[Toulouse]] around 1540. After studies at Toulouse, he became an advocate. From 1570 he was professeur of law at [[Cahors]]; in 1580 he returned to Toulouse in a similar post.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}, Herbert Jaumann, ''Handbuch Gelehrtenkultur der Frühen Neuzeit'' (2004), p. 313; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PCNN_blc77kC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=Tolosanus+Cahors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mh2icTpg9T&amp;sig=sOaFyeHTE9SJcw8PjfPZQTWCkxU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XaGJTo_3F8q50QXPo8TuDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Tolosanus%20Cahors&amp;f=false Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 he was called by [[Charles III, Duke of Lorraine]] to found a law faculty at [[Pont-à-Mousson]], the ''École doctrinale de droit public''. He died at Pont-à-Mousson.

==Works==
His ''Syntaxes artis mirabilis'' (1578) was an encyclopedic work on the sciences where [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[demonology]] were included with [[Astrology]] and mathematics.  Grégoire  is considered to be in the tradition of [[Raymond Lull]]. The work was placed on the ''[[Index of Forbidden Books]]''.

In his ''De Republica'' he expresses political views in favour of [[monarchy]], and uses the analogy of family and state. Although his faculty was dominated by [[Jesuit]]s, Grégoire turned away from the policies of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck (1993), ''Philosophy and Government (1572–1651)'', p. 28; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oOTtZO3TVSIC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Pont-a-Mousson%22+Jesuit+Gregoire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UpvQNhWFvc&amp;sig=xcbdGyM09OXxWN4CvLl5gl2UXs4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3aCJTuLUJuij0QWDo7EL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pont-a-Mousson%22%20Jesuit%20Gregoire&amp;f=false Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; A critic of [[Machiavelli]] and not a [[Gallican]], he drew on both [[Jean Bodin]] and [[François Hotman]], for an eclectic moderate Catholic position supporting the [[papal deposing power]] restricted to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and the publication in France of the [[Tridentine decrees]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

In '''''S v Melanie'''''






, an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], three accused were on charges of [[murder]], [[robbery]] and the [[Weapon possession|unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition]]. At the court ''a quo'', the evidence tendered by the State consisted of alleged pointings out by the accused, and eyewitness [[evidence]].

Melani argued
, ''inter alia'', that the accuseds' fundamental rights had been infringed as they had not been properly warned of their right to legal representation before the pointings out.

The court held that the content of the right to legal representation had in fact not been properly conveyed.

The right to consult with a legal practitioner and especially the right to be informed of this right, was found to be closely related to, and protective of, the presumption of [[innocence]], the [[right to silence]] and the proscription of compelled [[Confession (law)|confessions]].

Failure to recognize the importance of this right would have the effect of depriving persons, especially the uneducated, unsophisticated or poor, of the protection of their rights.

This was found to offend not only the concept of substantive fairness, but also the right to equality before the law.

The court held that accused No. 1 had merely been informed of his right to legal representation which was not explained to him at all and accused No. 2 had not been informed of his right at all.

Therefore, in order to give proper effect to an accused's rights, he had to be informed of his right to consult with counsel in a manner that it could reasonably be supposed that he had understood the content of the right.

The '''Sderot Cinematheque''' is a [[film archive]] operating in [[Sderot]], [[Israel]]  since December 1999. The [[Cinematheque]] was founded in cooperation between [[Sapir Academic College]] (thanks to Professor Haim Bereshit, the manager of the [[Media (communication)|Media]] and [[Film|Cinema]] School at the [[college]]) and Sderot mayor Eli Moyal. 

There are two film screening halls at the Cinematheque, which's number of seats together add up to around 400.

Of the many events hosted by the Cinematheque, the Cinema South International Film Festival, in which films from all over the world and Israel, as well as Final Film Projects of Sapir Academic College graduates are screened, is the Cinematheque's biggest event of the year. 

Manager of the Sapir Academic College's Media and Cinema School Professor Haim Bereshit and mayor of Sderot Eli Moyal had the initial vision of founding the Cinematheque. The Cinematheque is the first educational and cultural cinema institution in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]] of Israel. The main goals of the Cinematheque were bringing about [[culture]] into the daily lives of the Southern District population, as well as minimizing the gaps between the [[Central District (Israel)|Center of Israel]] and the South's populations. By definition, a Cinematheque is an institution that encourages the love of [[film]]. The Cinematheque in Sderot gives every person the chance to enjoy its activities, without worrying about their [[socio-economic status]]. One of its main goals is the promoting of the Israeli Cinema's various activities, including [[Film Festival|festivals]], seminars, special screenings, meetings with creators, musical and cultural events, courses, and workshops. One of the unique things about the Cinematheque is that it exposes the audience to several Israeli/foreign productions, [[documentary|documentaries]]/feature films, and more, accompanied by creators who bring up social issues using cinematic language. The Cinematheque is active seven days a week, with an average of three to six screenings per day.

* Perry Tsai, Co-director American Medical Student Association Sexual Health Scholars Program (AMSA SHSP) “Very few medical schools are teaching about the importance of sexual pleasure, so doctors are not prepared to care for this aspect of their patients’ health and well-being. We use the ''Guide to Getting It On'' to help our scholars gain a more complete understanding of sexuality and to help them promote the sexual health of their patients and peers.”
* Christian Perring, PhD., Associate Professor of Philosophy, [[Dowling College]], New York, from metapsychology.com points out, that  ″the book contains answers to just about every sexual question″ the readers of ''The Guide to Getting it On''  ″ever had″.

The '''''United States Attorneys' Manual''''' is a looseleaf text designed as a quick and ready reference for [[United States Attorney]]s and other employees of the [[United States Department of Justice]] responsible for the prosecution of violations of [[United_States_federal_law#Federal_law|federal law]]. It contains general policies and guidance relevant to the work of the United States Attorneys' offices and to their relations with the legal divisions, investigative agencies, and other components within the Department of Justice.

The ''Manual'' is an internal document of the Department of Justice, and as such, does not have the force of law.  It is updated periodically in much the same way as commercial [[looseleaf service]]s are.  New hard copies of the manual are issued annually to the department's attorneys.  It is also available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=U.S. Attorney's Manual|url=https://www.justice.gov/usam/united-states-attorneys-manual|accessdate=2 May 2018|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization of the ''Manual''==
The ''Manual'' is divided into nine titles:

# Organization and Functions
# Appeals
# Executive Office for United States Attorneys
# [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil]]
# [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division|Environment and Natural Resources Division]]
# [[United States Department of Justice Tax Division|Tax]]
# [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust]]
# [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights]]
# [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal]]

Each title has a corresponding Resource Manual that includes copies of policies, form letters, and other documents.

The last comprehensive update of the ''Manual'' was in 1997. Updates were made in 2018, including the removal of a section called "Need for Free Press and Public Trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tillman|first1=Zoe|title=The Justice Department Deleted Language About Press Freedom And Racial Gerrymandering From Its Internal Manual|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/the-justice-department-deleted-language-about-press-freedom|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=Buzzfeed|date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''viz.''}}
{{Wiktionary|viz.|videlicet}}
The abbreviation '''''viz.''''' (or '''''viz''''' without a full stop), short for the Latin {{lang|la|'''videlicet'''|italic=yes|links=no}}, which itself is a contraction from Latin of '''''videre licet''''' meaning "it is permitted to see", is used as a synonym for "namely", "that is to say", "to wit", or "as follows". It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point. For example: "all types of data viz. text, audio, video, pictures, graphics etc. can be transmitted through networking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='videlicet', Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/videlicet?s=t|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Viz.'' is [[shorthand]] for the adverb ''{{lang|la|videlicet}}''. It uses [[Tironian notes]], a system of Latin shorthand developed {{circa|63 BCE}}. It comprises the first two letters, "vi", followed by the last two, "et", using the z-shaped [[⁊#Current|Tironian "et"]], historically written ⁊,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |last=Brewer  |first=Ebenezer |year=1970 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn= |page=1132 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to E.&amp;nbsp;Cobham Brewer (1810–1897), ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', the same abbreviation mark was used for "habet" and "omnibus".&lt;/ref&gt; a common contraction for "et" in Latin shorthand in [[Ancient Rome]] and [[medieval Europe]].

==Usage==
''Viz.'' is an [[abbreviation]] of ''videlicet'', which itself is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] from [[Latin]] of ''videre licet'' meaning "it is permitted to see".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|The New Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (revised third edition, 1998), pp. 825, 828.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''viz.'' is the continuation of an abbreviation using [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']] (''vi⁊''), the ''z'' replacing the ''⁊'' once the latter had fallen out of common use.

In contradistinction to [[i.e.]] and [[exempli gratia|e.g.]], viz. is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.

* ''Viz.'' is usually read aloud as "that is", "namely", or "to wit",&lt;ref name="AMHER1917"&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes pronounced as it is spelt, viz.: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|z}}.
* ''Videlicet'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref name="AMHER1917" /&gt;

===Examples===
* The main point of his speech, ''viz.'' that our attitude was in fact harmful, was not understood.
* "My grandfather had four sons who grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/148 ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin''] at Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The noble gases, viz., helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and radon, show an unexpected behavior when exposed to this new element.

==Compared with scilicet (sc., ss., §)==
{{Main|Section sign}}
A similar expression is '''''scilicet''''' (from earlier ''scire licet''), abbreviated as ''sc.'', which is Latin for "it is permitted to know". ''Sc.'' provides a parenthetic clarification, removes an  ambiguity, or supplies a word omitted in preceding text,&amp;nbsp; while ''viz.'' is usually used to elaborate or detail text which precedes it.

In legal usage, ''scilicet'' appears abbreviated as ''ss.'' or, in a caption, as [[Section sign|§]], where it  provides a statement of venue{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} and is read as "to wit".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (sixth edition, 1990), p. 1403.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scilicet'' can be read as "namely", "to wit", or "that is to say", or pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|iː|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}} or anglicized as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1560.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zvončari''' (the bellmen) is the characteristic folk custom maintained in the region around [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. It was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00243 UNESCO: Annual carnival bell ringers’ pageant from the Kastav area]&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom dates to [[pagan]] antiquity, and remains typical for this region. The primary task of Zvončari is to scare away evil spirits of winter and to stir up new spring-time cycle. During the [[Rijeka Carnival]] time Zvončari march from village to village throughout the region, following the same centuries-old route, making an extraordinary amount of noise, fueled in part by the wine provided by the locals en route.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Zvoncari.jpg|thumb|Zvoncari in [[Rijeka]], 2007 |right|250px|thumb]] --&gt;
The standard Zvončar costume includes white trousers, striped shirt, and a sheepskin throw. In their hands they hold a "balta" or "bačuka" - a stylized [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], and around the waist one or more big brass bells. The costume varies from village to village; for example, Zvončari of Halubje and {{Interlanguage link multi|Grobnik, Primorje-Gorski Kotar County|hr|3=Grobnik|lt=Grobnik}} (Dondolaši) wear special stylized masks representing fantastic animal heads, while Zvončari of [[Žejane]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Brgud|hr}} wear "flower hats". A legend tells that Zvončari scared away invading [[Tatars]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. According to the legend the shepherds put masks on their heads, belted on bells, and produced a deafening noise that scared the enemy away. From that time on, a mace became  part of the standard equipment of Zvončari. The Zvončari participate regularly in the international [[Rijeka Carnival]].
