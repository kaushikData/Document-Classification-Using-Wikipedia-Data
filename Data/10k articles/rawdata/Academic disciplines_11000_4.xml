The '''Academy of Natural Sciences of [[Drexel University]]''', formerly the '''Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia''', is the oldest [[natural science]] research institution and [[museum]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading [[naturalist]]s of the young American republic with an expressed mission of "the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences". For over two centuries of continuous operations, the Academy has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and [[systematics]] research, and amassed [[natural history]] collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also has a long tradition of public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.

==History==
During the first decades of the United States, [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] was the cultural capital and one of the country's commercial centers. Two of the city's institutions, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.

The increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the great variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness waiting to be discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals.

On 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGY7AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817+january+OR+february+OR+march+OR+april+OR+may+OR+june+OR+july+OR+august+OR+september+OR+october+OR+november+OR+december&amp;ots=ogxVDjRrOn&amp;sig=i_H8ZqJXsvMNdjc1ZGpf4WkXkXQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDjIC-0ejKAhVE5mMKHYiSCzQQ6AEIbjAQ&amp;q=Academy+of+Natural+Sciences+1817+january+OR+february+OR+march+OR+april+OR+may+OR+june+OR+july+OR+august+OR+september+OR+october+OR+november+OR+december|title=The Annals of Philosophy|date=4 November 2017|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including [[William Bartram]], John Godman, [[Richard Harlan]], [[Angelo Heilprin]], [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]], [[William Maclure]], [[Titian Peale]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]], [[Thomas Say]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[John Edwards Holbrook]] of South Carolina, [[Thomas Nuttall]] and  [[Richard Owen]] of the United Kingdom, [[Georges Cuvier]] of France, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy's first decades.

Later during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Distinctions between who is a naturalist and who is a scientist varies and can be elusive. One can make the distinction that naturalists are amateurs interested in the natural sciences, whereas scientists are professionals. This distinction, however, is confounded by history and circumstance. Most of the participants in American science during the 19th century were not professionals, although some of their contributions are of the highest order.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[John James Audubon]], Charles S. Boyer, [[John Cassin]], [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Ezra Townsend Cresson]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[John Lawrence LeConte]], [[Joseph Leidy]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Leidy, the man who first studied ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', is considered the "father" of American paleontology and American [[Parasitology]] and was a leading teacher and authority on microscopy and comparative anatomy. He is widely regarded to have been the leading expert on the natural sciences during the 19th century. More about Leidy can be found on the Academy's [http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy online exhibit on Joseph Leidy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Morton, [[George Ord]], and James Rehn were also members. Corresponding members included such luminaries as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Asa Gray]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].

For much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James Böhlke, [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Henry Weed Fowler]], [[Ruth Patrick]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]], and [[Witmer Stone]].

In 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby [[Drexel University]] and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2011 |title=The Academy of Natural Sciences and Drexel University Announce a Historic Affiliation |url=http://www.ansp.org/about/academy-drexel-affiliation.php |publisher=Academy of Natural Science |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2011-05-19 |title=Academy of Natural Sciences to become Drexel subsidiary |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/05/19/academy-of-natural-sciences-to-become.html |first=Peter Van |last=Allen |work=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and research==
[[File:JVBA Mosasaur 6-09-2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 43 ft. (13 m) complete fossil specimen of Mosasaur species ''[[Tylosaurus]] proriger'' (with a human for scale) is on display.]]
[[Collection (museum)|Collections]] are the hallmark of museums and those at The Academy of Natural Sciences are among the more important of their kind. The size and scope of its collections have grown substantially since the early years. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, [[Biological illustration|illustrations]], photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections grew through a combination of means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Sometimes the Academy is also enlisted to house and care for collections originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.

But these collections are not maintained just to collect dust. They provide a library of [[biodiversity]]. Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in [[Alpha taxonomy|biological taxonomy]], the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species: in essence, the cataloging of Nature. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of [[systematics]], the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species.

Either way, the collections are invaluable. They provide the [[Biological type|type specimens]], the reference material that helps establish a species' identity. They also provide raw materials with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status. New questions and new technology illustrate the importance of these collections. [[Titian Peale]] (1799–1885) may not have been interested in the conservation biology of the butterflies he collected while [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry Pilsbry]] (1862–1957) probably did not consider comparing the DNA of his snails. Yet, modern scientists have such options because these specimens are part of the collections.

===Biological systematics===
The most common science currently conducted in natural history museums is [[Systematics|biological systematics]]. It is also the science with which current natural history collections are most intimately associated.  The Academy's collections and systematics research are presented below.

====Botany====
[[Botany]]  is study of plants. "Plants," to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.
Collections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia [[Herbarium]] (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Constatine Rafinesque]], [[Thomas Meehan (botanist)|Thomas Meehan]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], and [[Frederick Traugott Pursh|Fredrick Pursh]]. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the [[Plant evolutionary developmental biology|development of flowers]] in  the [[Apocynaceae]] (milkweed or dogbane family). The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of [[vascular plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Johann]] and [[Georg Forster]] during the voyages of [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]], and by [[Meriwether Lewis]] during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery)]].

====Diatoms====
The Academy's [[Diatoms|Diatom]] [[Herbarium]], the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the [[#Phycology|Phycology Section]] of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, [[Ruth Patrick]], and Charles Reimer.

====Entomology====
[[Entomology]] has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include [[Thomas Say]], regarded as the father of American entomology, and [[Titian Peale]], a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition]] (1834–1842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the remarkable Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Senior curator [[Dan Otte|Daniel Otte]], an expert on [[Orthoptera]] (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the [http://osf2.orthoptera.org/HomePage.aspx Orthoptera Species File]. Another curator, Jon Gelhaus, an expert on [[Crane fly|crane flies]], manages the [[#Mongolian_Aquatic_Insect_Survey|Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey]]..

====Ichthyology====
[[Ichthyology]] has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s personal collections in 1898. A few years later, [[Henry Weed Fowler]] began his remarkable tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. [[James Edwin Böhlke]], William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the notable scientist who followed Fowler. The current curator, John Lundberg, an expert in [[catfish]]es, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and [[Paleogeography|geographic history]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River Basin]]. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the [http://silurus.ansp.org/ All Catfish Species Inventory] (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and [http://catfishbone.ansp.org/ Catfish Bones] (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in [http://www.neodat.org/ Neodat II] (an online resource of [[Neotropics|Neotropic]] ichthyology collections).

====Malacology====
Two of the early members of the Academy, [[Thomas Say]] and [[Isaac Lea]], were [[Malacology|malacologists]] (see also [[Conchology|conchologists]]). [[R. Tucker Abbott]], [[Samuel Stehman Haldeman]], [[Henry Augustus Pilsbry|Henry A. Pilsbry]], and [[George W. Tryon, Jr.]] were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy's malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator [[Gary Rosenberg]], an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in moving museum collections and research data online. Research websites include the [http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/georef/ Malacology Georeferencing Project] an online database of [http://www.malacolog.org/Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca (Malacolog)]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080327102600/http://data.acnatsci.org/obis/ OBIS Indo-Pacific Mollusc] database.  Research associate and former curator Daniel L. Graf, an expert on [[Unionidae]] (freshwater mussels), maintains the [http://clade.acnatsci.org/mussel/ MUSSEL Project] web site.

====Ornithology====
Just about any ornithologist active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including [[John James Audubon]], [[William Bartram]], [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]], [[John Cassin]], [[Thomas Nuttall]], [[George Ord]], [[John Kirk Townsend]], and [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] (the "father" of American [[ornithology]]), either operated out of or worked closely with The Academy of Natural Sciences. Later notable Academy ornithologists include [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], [[Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee]], Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and [[Witmer Stone]]. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The [[Delaware Valley Ornithological Club]] (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.

====Vertebrate paleontology====
[[Vertebrate Paleontology|Vertebrate paleontology]] in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the [[American Philosophical Society]] (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905164059/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/ Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection], had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. [[Richard Harlan]] was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of [[Georges Cuvier]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174153/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/ Joseph Leidy], who described ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the "father" of American vertebrate paleontology. [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] during the infamous [[Bone Wars]]. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of [[Devonian]] [[tetrapod]]s. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional "fishapod" ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]'' from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, ''[[Hynerpeton]]'' and ''Densignathus'' from the [[Catskill Formation]] in Pennsylvania.

====Other collections====
The Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general [[invertebrate]] collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the [[invertebrate paleontology]] collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens.&lt;ref name="Academy of Natural Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammalogy|url=http://www.ansp.org/research/systematics-evolution/collections/mammalogy/|publisher=Department of Vertebrate Zoology|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of [[rotifer]]s on microslides. The [[herpetology]] collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The [[mammalogy]] collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 [[holotype]]s. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, [[Edward Drinker Cope]], [[Richard Harlan]], [[John Edwards Holbrook]], [[Henry Charles Lea]], [[Isaac Lea]], [[Joseph Leidy]], Samuel G. Morton, and [[Thomas Say]].

===Patrick Center for Environmental Research===
Formerly the [[Limnology]] Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research concerns itself with [[applied ecology]]. Founded in 1947 by [[Ruth Patrick]], formerly of the [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ [[interdisciplinary]] teams of scientists to study [[freshwater]] systems and the first to regard [[biodiversity]] as a central criterion of [[water quality]].

Its 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in [[Environmental science|environmental research]], led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in [[United States environmental law|governmental regulation]] of [[water pollution]], the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private [[Environmental consulting|environmental consulting firms]].

{{as of|2013}}, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology,&lt;ref&gt;Autecology is the study the interaction of an individual organism or individual species with its physical, chemical and biological environment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Particulars may include such measures as temperature preferences, pollution tolerance, light requirements, and ability to recover after disturbance.&lt;/ref&gt; [[environmental chemistry]] and [[Aquatic toxicology|toxicology]], [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]], long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and [[watershed management]]. Some of the work employs most of the center's expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|ecological effects of small dams]] or the ecological benefits of [[Riparian zone|riparian reforestation]].

Other studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling [[Core sample|sediment cores]] in [[tidal marsh]]es throughout the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] [[Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;The Sediment Core work in the Delaware Estuary is being conducted in collaboration with the [[University of Delaware]].&lt;/ref&gt; This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center's expertise in [[biogeochemistry]] and [[phycology]]. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]], [[water pollution]], salinity variations, and [[Global warming|climatic change]] by analyzing the core's sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Biogeochemistry====
The [[Biogeochemistry]] Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of [[Environmental chemistry|chemicals in aquatic systems]]. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of [[Trace metals|trace elements]] (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived [[dissolved organic matter]], and sedimentation and [[eutrophication]] in [[salt marsh]]es.

====Ecological Modeling====
The [[Ecosystem model|Ecological Modeling]] Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modeling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include [[Watershed management|watershed-scale]] modeling and [[risk assessment]]; nonlinear [[Population modeling|population models]] structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in [[Fluid dynamics|turbulent aquatic systems]]; and the ecology and control of [[Introduced species|exotic invasive]] plants in urban parks.

====Fisheries====
The Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, [[Wildlife management|conservation]], and [[Fisheries management|management]] of [[Lotic system ecology|lotic]] and [[estuarine fish]]es. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or [[American eel]]s) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management ([[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|dam releases]]) in the Upper [[Delaware River]] to native and [[Introduced species|introduced fish]] populations.

====Macroinvertebrates====
Benthic macroinvertebrates (primarily [[aquatic insect]]s, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.

====Phycology====
Because of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, [[algae]], particularly [[diatom]]s, make excellent [[Indicator species|indicators of water quality]]. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them ideal organisms for studying [[paleolimnology]] (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). Because of their expertise and their close working relationship with the Academy's [[#Diatoms|Diatom Herbarium]], the [[Phycology]] Section of the Patrick Center is able to provide algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing [[water quality]] and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments ([[Core sample|sediment cores]]) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], will try to establish reference (pre-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) conditions  for lakes throughout the country.

In addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of [http://diatom.ansp.org online resources] for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the [[USGS]] National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.

===Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology===
For most of its history, biological [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]] were conducted using [[Comparative anatomy|comparative morphology]]. In recent decades, however, advances in [[molecular biology]] and computational technologies have opened [[Molecular systematics|new possibilities]] for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of [[cladistics]] and [[computational phylogenetics]]. These technologies also offer new opportunities for [[molecular ecology]] and [[conservation genetics]].

Academy scientists have been early adapters of [[molecular biology]] techniques. [[Allozymes]], [[DNA-DNA hybridization]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and [[serology]] were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs [[DNA sequencing]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s, and AFLP ([[amplified fragment length polymorphism]]). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.

===Asia Center===
The Asia Center is a new initiative to develop programs and partnerships for research and capacity building throughout Asia. Clyde Goulden is the director of the Asia Center. It is modeled on a series of successful programs conducted in Mongolia since 1995 under the auspices of the Academy's Institute for Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies (IMBES). The main activities of IMBES occur in the vicinity of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, but a separate program, the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey, extends to other parts of the country. More recently, the Asia Center has undertaken joint-projects with [[Nanjing University]], Nanjing Paleontological Museum and Zhejiang Ocean University in China and the Institute of the Biological Problems of the North in the Russian Far East.

====Hovsgol====
The Academy's work in [[Mongolia]] started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at [[Lake Khövsgöl|Lake Hovsgol]] (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, [[Lake Baikal]]. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake's [[biodiversity]], [[limnology]], and watershed.&lt;ref&gt;The findings of this research were published in

&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic development]] needed addressing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mongolia]], recently freed from Soviet domination, was experiencing severe economic disruption and increasing pressures through [[globalization]] to exploit its [[Natural resource management|natural resources]]. Mongolians, committed to preserving their natural heritage, needed assistance in developing their scientific and conservation infrastructure.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to [[Ecosystem ecology|ecosystem studies]] and [[capacity building]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Capacity building]] (the development of local expertise and infrastructure) is implemented in part through the inclusion of scientists and students from the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National University of Mongolia]] in research projects, conferences, and workshops. The Academy has also sponsored the training of Mongolian students in Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Hovsgol National Park, which includes the lake and its entire watershed, was created in 1992. Improvements took the form of improving park management, improving physical facilities, staff training and developing park-community relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term ecological monitoring of several [[Drainage basin|tributary watersheds]] began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the 
[http://www.lternet.edu/ International Long Term Ecological Research Network].&lt;ref&gt;Long-term ecological work at Hovsgol has been supported by the [[Global Environmental Facility]]from 2002-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to [[global warming|climate change]]. The region lies in a transitional zone between the [[Semiarid|semi-arid]] Eurasian [[Steppe]] (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian [[Taiga]] (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Substantial increases in annual mean temperatures and growing season length in this semiarid landscape have resulted in [[permafrost]] loss, drier soils, and reduced plant cover in the steppe. Shifts in the seasonal pattern in precipitation are disruptive to grassland plant reproduction and the incidence of extreme weather also appears to be increasing. Changes in the forests are less demonstrable, but increased [[Wildfire|fire frequency]] and pest insect outbreaks are suggestive.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, changes in livestock herding practices&lt;ref&gt;Traditional [[pastoralism]], or animal herding, has existed in Mongolia for millennia, but recent trends in livestock production and practices may be unsustainable. The herds are larger and cashmere goats, which can be particularly damaging to vegetation, are accounting for a greater percentage of the total. Moreover, much of the traditional herder expertise was lost during the Soviet era. Consequently, herders risk seriously [[overgrazing]] the steppe, which, because of [[global warming]], is increasingly vulnerable to [[desertification]].&lt;/ref&gt; raise concerns about [[overgrazing]] and [[desertification]]. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a ''Herder Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;An English version of the Herder Handbook can be [http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=2 downloaded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215023907/http://hovsgolecology.org/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=2 |date=2008-02-15 }} from the Hovsgol Ecology website.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Current work at Hovsgol is funded by the [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12819 National Science Foundation PIRE program], and is a partnership of the Academy's Asia Center, [http://mongolia.bio.upenn.edu/index.html The University of Pennsylvania], the [http://www.must.edu.mn/ Mongolian Academy of Sciences], the [http://must.edu.mn/ Mongolian University of Science and Technology], and the [http://web.num.edu.mn/eng/ National University of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Information on earlier applied work at Hovsgol can be found at [http://hovsgolecology.org hovsgolecology.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey====
The Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clade.ansp.org/entomology/mongolia/|title=Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey: Splash|website=clade.ansp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-year [[biodiversity]] survey, [[Water quality|environmental monitoring]] and [[capacity building]] project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy's [[#Entomology|Entomology Department]].  A total of 217 sites from the [[Selenge River]] Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.

The survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known [[aquatic insect]]s, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.

===Center for Environmental Policy===
The Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.

The center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.

The center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.

===Ewell Sale Stewart Library===
The Library and Archives were established at the Academy's founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include  illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including [[Conrad Gessner|Konrad Gessner's]] ''Historia animalium'', [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]'s ''Insects of Surinam'', [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Psittacidae or Parrots'', and a double elephant folio of [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421170703/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/index.php |archive-date=2008-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific publications===
The ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817.  By 1842, it had been superseded by the ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences''. The ''Proceedings'' have been published continuously since 1841. The ''Journal'' was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and [[monograph]]s. The last volume was issued in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;The volumes of the ''Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences'' published from 1817 to 1842 are referred to as the First Series. The Second Series was published from 1847 to 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series ''Notulae Naturae'' began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The ''Monographs'' series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The ''Special Publications'' series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.

===VIREO===
[http://vireo.ansp.org/ VIREO] (VIsual REsource for [[Ornithology]]) is the most comprehensive collection of bird [[Stock photography|images]] in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 140,000 photographs representing more than 7,000 species. The collection contains work by some of the world's most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.

==Exhibits and public programs==

===Public exhibits===
[[File:Mummy PANS.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A mummy on display at the Academy]]
The Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world's first mounted dinosaur skeleton, ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.  In fact, the size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.

====Collections and the public====
As with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy's collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Wagner Free Institute of Science]] is an early example of an organized public display of natural history collections. Founded in 1855 to offer free lectures on the natural sciences, the Wagner appointed Joseph Leidy in 1885 to organize its growing collections. Leidy's design is still largely intact, and the Wagner is effectively a museum of a museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dioramas====
One expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the [[diorama]]. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife. By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, in turn, contributed to the growth of the [[Conservation movement|Conservation Movement]] in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[lion]], and [[plains zebra]] are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the [[Desert Bighorn Sheep|desert bighorn]], [[kiang]], [[Kodiak bear]], [[panda]], and [[passenger pigeon]], are threatened, [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Extinction|extinct]].

====Dinosaurs====
[[File:Hadro bones.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A display of casts of the 35 bones of the Hadrosaurus]]
Another icon of natural history museums is the [[dinosaur]] skeleton. The first of these, the ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' mount created by noted natural history artist [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], made its debut at the Academy in 1868. ''Hadrosaurus'' mounts also found their way into other public venues, including [[Princeton University]], the [[Royal Museum|Royal Scottish Museum]], the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], and the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 American Centennial Exposition]]. A special exhibit on the history of ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'' ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.
[[File:T-rex exhibit Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' fossil on display with other dinosaur specimens.]]
A skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', served as the centerpiece of the Academy's "Hall of Earth History" during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, "Discovering Dinosaurs." This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the "[[dinosaur renaissance]]." Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than lizards.

In 1979 another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured [[Jim Gary|Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs]] and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as "contemporary art" as exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Twentieth_Century_Dinosaurs_Return_to_Tallahassee_Museum_128476873.html?storySection=story|title=Twentieth Century Dinosaurs Return to Tallahassee Museum|first=Tallahassee Museum|last=Release|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other exhibits====
In 1979, the academy also opened "Outside-In", a hands-on children's nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its "The Big Dig." Other permanent exhibits include "Butterflies!", a live butterfly zoo, and  "Science at the Academy", which showcases current Academy research.

The museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include "Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other Riches", "Frogs: a Chorus of Colors", "The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Exhibition", and "The Scoop on Poop: The Science of What Animals Leave Behind."

===Public programs===

====Festivals====
Four weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy's Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.

====Programs for adults====
The Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.

====Programs for families and children====
Since its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Scouts]] can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.

"Wild Weekends", held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children's programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.

===Educational programs===

====Field Trips and Outreach====
[[Field Trip]]s to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). "Academy on the Go" is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.

====Women in Natural Sciences====
WINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, [[scientific literacy]] and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.

====Other programs====
Academy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. [[Science fair]] participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.

==Awards and research opportunities==

===Hayden Memorial Geological Award===
The [[Hayden Memorial Geological Award]] is given to prominent scientists working in geology or paleontology. It was established in 1888 in memory of [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand V. Hayden]], a distinguished American geologist and pioneering surveyor of the American West who had extensive ties to the Academy.

===Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art===

In addition, artistic and scientific mentors counsel and assist these artists as their careers develop. One grant will be given each year.

[[Research Experiences for Undergraduates|Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)]], a program of the [[National Science Foundation]], provides summer research experience for students attending colleges and universities. Each summer the Academy offers five to ten separate research projects which can include collections, field, imaging and/or lab work. The projects vary but typically include environmental, library collections, and/or systematics research.

'''AgentSheets''' is a [[Cyberlearning]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf08204/nsf08204.pdf Cyberlearning defined by the National Science Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; tool to teach students programming and related information technology skills through game design.

AgentSheets is supported by a middle and high school curriculum called Scalable Game Design aligned with the ISTE [[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS). The mission of this project is to reinvent computer science in public schools by motivating &amp; educating all students including women and underrepresented communities to learn about computer science through game design starting at the middle school level. Through this curriculum students build increasingly sophisticated games and, as part of this process, learn about computational concepts at the level of computational thinking that are relevant to game design as well as to computational science. The curriculum is made available through the Scalable Game Design Wiki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/ Scalable Game Design Wiki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826185550/http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/ |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research investigating motivational aspects of computer science education in public schools is currently exploring the introduction of game design in representative regions of the USA including technology hubs, inner city, rural and remote/tribal areas. Previous research has already found that game design with AgentSheets is universally accessible across gender as well as ethnicity and is not limited to students interested in playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/Publications publications related to the Scalable Game Design project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415191232/http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/Publications |date=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/gamewiki/images/2/27/Scalable_Game_Design_Results.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610162935/http://scalablegamedesign.cs.colorado.edu/gamewiki/images/2/27/Scalable_Game_Design_Results.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NSF ITEST program supported research investigating motivational and educational aspects of introducing computer science at the middle school level are extremely positive in terms of motivational levels, number of participants and participation of women and underrepresented communities. The participation is extremely high because most middle schools participating in the study have made Scalable Game Design a module that is part of existing required courses (e.g., computer power with keyboarding and power point). Many of the middle schools instruct all of their students in scalable game design reaching in some schools over 900 students per year, per school. Of the well over 1000 students participating in the project in the first semester over 52% were girls. Of the girls 85% enjoyed the scalable game design course and 78% would like to take another game design course.

== Design ==

The built-in [[drag-and-drop]] language is accessible enough that students without programming background can make their own simple [[Frogger]]-like game, and publish it on the Web, in their first session. At the same time, AgentSheets is powerful enough to make sophisticated [[The Sims]]-like games with [[artificial intelligence]]. To transition from visual programming to more traditional programming students can render their games into [[Java (programming language)|Java]] source code.

Similar to a spreadsheet, an agentsheet is a computational grid. Unlike spreadsheets, this grid does not just contain numbers and strings but so called agents. These agents are represented by pictures, can be animated, make sounds, react to mouse/keyboard interactions, can read web pages, can speak and even recognize speech commands (Mac). This grid is well suited to build [[computational science]] applications modeling complex scientific phenomena with up to tens of thousands of agents. The grid is useful to build agent-based simulations including cellular automata or diffusion-based models. These models are used in a wide variety of applications. How does a mudslide work? When does a bridge collapse? How fragile are ecosystems? This ability to support game as well as computational science applications with the inclusion of scientific visualizations makes AgentSheets a unique [[computational thinking]] tool that is used computer science and [[STEM fields|STEM]] education.

== How AgentSheets is used ==
[[Image:AS-projects.jpg|thumb|right]]
AgentSheets is used in a number of contexts worldwide:

*Middle school students create [[food webs|food web]] simulations to explore the complexity of [[Ecologies|ecological systems]]
*Middle school computer clubs students build computer games ranging from simple arcade classic such as [[Frogger]] to sophisticated AI-based games such as [[The sims|The Sims]].
*High school students use AgentSheets as story telling and simulation tool of historical events such as the [[César Chávez]] grape boycott&lt;ref&gt;[http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/systems/agentsheets/New-Vista/grape-boycott/ grape boycott project with simulation]&lt;/ref&gt;
*High school students simulate [[Predator-prey interaction|predator prey]] worlds and analyzed data created with spreadsheets and plots
*After school science programs show students how to build their own science simulations ranging from forest fire simulations to the spreading of viruses.
*High school students use AgentSheets as introduction to programming tool&lt;ref&gt;[http://triplets.cs.memphis.edu/index.php?page=project An example GK-12 NSF program using AgentSheets: the Memphis Tri-P-LETS project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902133023/http://triplets.cs.memphis.edu/index.php?page=project |date=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Graduate and undergraduate courses on educational game design use AgentSheets to prototype, playtest, refine, and publish simple educational games&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/courses/gamelet2006/gamelets/Space%20Invaders/index.html sample games called gamelets]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Research exploring Artificial intelligence and collaborative agents, e.g., [[Antiobjects]]

== History ==
The original goal of this research was to explore new models of computational thinking. The first prototype of AgentSheets ran in 1989 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [[NCAR]],  [[Connection Machine|Connection Machine 2]]. The Connection Machine is a highly parallel computer with up to 65,536 CPUs. Realizing how hard it was to program the Connection Machine the insight that "CPU cycles will always be ultimately cheaper than cognitive cycles" led to the exploration of several new [[programming paradigm]]s:
* '''Agent-Based Graphical Rewrite Rules''': (1991) Behavior such as a train following train tracks can be specified through before/after rules. These rules can be created by [[programming by example]]. The user would tell the system to watch the train; the user would move the train on train track one step and stop recording; the system would create the rule allowing trains to follow train tracks. Agent-Based Graphical Rewrite Rules were later also used in the [[Stagecast Creator|KidSim/Cocoa/Creator]] kid programming tool.
* '''Semantical Rewrite Rules''': (1994) It became clear that Agent-Based Graphical Rewrite Rules used in AgentSheets91 and KidSim/Cocoa/Creator were not powerful enough for a number of applications that need more general patterns. For instance, it was simple to create a rule to make a train follow a straight segment of track but the number of rules quickly exploded when trying to have trains follow all combinations of turns and intersections. Semantic rewrite rules could interpret rules topologically. With a single rule a user could create a complete train that follows train track behavior.
* '''Programming by Analogous Examples''': (1995) New behavior can be created through analogies. For instance the behavior of a car can be described as analogy to trains. A car moves on a road like a train on a train track. A challenge to this approach is conceptual exception handling. Analogies are often either incomplete or too general. This requires that users can refine programs produced by Programming by Analogous Examples.
* '''Tactile Programming''': (1996) AgentSheets becomes the world's first drag and drop educational programming environment. Drag and drop interfaces can be used to compose syntactically correct programs. In Visual AgenTalk (VAT), a rule-based visual programming language, users create rules by dragging and dropping conditions and actions from palettes.  The tactile aspect of Visual AgenTalk allows users to perceive through drag and drop what programs do. By dragging and dropping conditions, actions, rules and even methods onto agents they see the consequence of invoking program fragment without having to write a test program. Similar drag and drop programming can later be found in the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] language (part of [[Squeak]]), in [[Alice (software)|Alice]] and in [[Scratch programming language|Scratch]].
* '''AgentSheets Inc.''': (1996) With the support of the National Science Foundation AgentSheets has become a commercial product. The programming model has been extended, more interaction modalities have been added (e.g., speech recognition (Mac)), scientific visualization has been refined (e.g., 3D real time plotting (Mac)), and AgentSheets has been localized (e.g., Japanese and Greek).
* '''Scalable Game Design''': (2008) A game design based free curriculum covering computational thinking ideas from elementary to graduate school based on AgentSheets. The mission of Scalable Game Design is to: Reinventing computer science in public schools by motivating &amp; educating all students including women and underrepresented communities to learn about computer science through game design starting at the middle school level. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation.
* '''Conversational Programming''': (2010) AgentSheets 3 is the world first programming environment supporting computational thinking by providing information about the meaning of the program. Unlike visual programming approaches, which only help with syntactic challenges, such as avoiding missing semicolons, Conversational Programming helps with the semantics, that is the meaning of your program. Is this condition true right now? Would this rule fire? Why does that rule fail? A conversational programming agent will tell all this and more in a non intrusive kind of way.

The '''Antiphonary tonary missal of St. Benigne''' (also called '''Antiphonarium Codex Montpellier''' or '''Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon''') was supposed to be written in the last years of the 10th century, when the Abbot [[William of Volpiano]] at St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] reformed the liturgy of several monasteries in Burgundy. The chant manuscript records mainly Western plainchant of the Roman-Frankish [[proper (liturgy)|proper mass]] and part of the chant sung during the [[matins]] ("[[Gregorian chant]]"), but unlike the common form of the [[Roman Gradual|Gradual]] and of the [[Antiphonary]], William organized his manuscript according to the chant genre ([[antiphon]]s with psalmody, [[alleluia]] verses, [[gradual]]s, [[offertory|offertories]], and [[trope (music)|proses]] for the missal part), and these sections were subdivided into eight parts according to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Tonary|octoechos]]. This disposition followed the order of a [[tonary]], but William of Volpiano wrote not only the incipits of the classified chant, he wrote the complete chant text with the music in central French [[neume]]s which were still written in ''campo aperto'', and added a second alphabetic notation of his own invention for the melodic structure of the codified chant.

== Historical background ==

This particular type of a fully notated [[tonary]] only appeared in Burgundy and Normandy. It can be regarded as a characteristic document of a certain school founded by [[William of Volpiano]], who was reforming abbot at St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] since 989. In 1001 he followed a request by [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Duke Richard II]] and became first abbot at the [[Abbey of Fécamp]] which was a reforming centre of monasticism in Normandy.

Only this manuscript was written during the time of William by the same hand as several other manuscripts of the Library of the Medical Faculty of Montpellier (today "Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin") which all belong to St. Bénigne. It is not known, whether it was really written by William of Volpiano in person. The few things known about him can be read in a hagiographic source, the ''Vita domni Willelmi'' in fourteen chapters written by his disciple, the Burgundian monk Raoul Glaber in 1031, and revised probably by demand of the later Abbot John of Fécamp during the late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;See the edition of Véronique Gazeau and Monique Goullet ([[#Gaz08|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt; William was born as son of the Alemannic Duke Robert of Volpiano at the citadel of his family on the island S. Giulio of the Lake Orta in Piedmont. The legend said that [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto]] had conquered this island, while William was born, so the Emperor became his patron and he was educated as a monk and made his clerical career at [[Cluny Abbey]] during the reform of [[Majolus of Cluny|Abbot Majolus]] who continued the [[Cluniac reforms|reform]] of his predecessor [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]] and supported reforms connected with papal politics under influence of the Ottonic Emperors. Concerning liturgical reforms, Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] already emphasized the need for a reform of monasticism in Southern Italy and to abandon local liturgies in favour of the Roman rite, a kind of second Carolingian reform, and he already wished to "liberate" Arab Sicily and to organize church provinces of the island which was mainly populated by Muslims and by a Greek Christians. His plan failed after the catastrophic defeat of his son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] near [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], but the role of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] as a centre for liturgical reforms had increased in Ottonic times.

William's reforms were not only concerned with liturgy and the new design of local chant books, but also with the construction of new churches and buildings for abandoned abbeys, with canon law, with the organization of grammar schools and even rural communities of Normandy. It was typical for a career at [[Cluny Abbey]] to get one of the most prestigious positions as a cantor and to continue as a reforming abbot in another Abbey, which was subjected to this powerful and ambitious Abbey. As Abbot of St. Benignus William reformed several monasteries of Burgundy, Lorraine and the [[Île-de-France]]. There are some testimonies like the ''Libellus de revelatione, edificatione et auctoritate Fiscannensis monasterii'', a chronicle of Fécamp, which reports certain ressentments against Norman culture and its local liturgical customs.&lt;ref&gt;Gazeau ([[#Gaz02|2002, 44]]).&lt;/ref&gt; William appeared as a [[Cluniac reform]]er, but studies of his liturgical reform especially of the Office chant for Fécamp did not confirm, that he just removed local in favour of Cluniac customs.&lt;ref&gt;See the dissertation of Olivier Diard ([[#Dia00|2000]]) which proves that he "corrected" chants as Raoul Glaber called it, and he also added own compositions which can only found in the two manuscripts, and he respected certain customs of the local school.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the reform and the history of Norman monasticism, the reform of William of Volpiano was neither the beginning nor its climax, as a reformer he had to find a balance between local needs and problems and certain interests of the Cluniac Abbot, of the Pope, and of the Norman patrons, whose founding activities cultivated a new form of policy. William contributed to this history with the foundation of an own school.

According to Véronique Gazeau he did not spend too much time in Normandy during the period about 30 years of his Norman activities, but nevertheless his school could be established, because he ordained his students as abbots.&lt;ref&gt;Gazeau ([[#Gaz02|2002, 39f]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He was not only Abbot at Fécamp, but also at Jumièges between 1015 and 1017. He became first Abbot of Bernay, a foundation of [[Judith of Brittany|Countess Judith]], [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Richard II]]'s wife, in 1025. By order of Duke Robert he left Fécamp for John of Ravenna in 1028, before 1027 he was assisted at the Abbey at Bernay by a ''custos'' Thierry, an elder and experienced monk and prior from Saint-Bénigne of Dijon. Before he followed Suppo as prior at Mont-Saint-Michel in 1023. These administrative changes were caused by the establishment of monastic centres during certain periods, in which some Abbeys were no longer guided by an abbot, but by a prior of the community who was often called "custos", and several new foundations did not always start as an Abbey, they were subordinated to older abbeys. These monastic centres which had the control over various monasteries including former abbeys, were used to control new foundations as well as to obey liturgical and administrative reforms. This practice was continued after William's death, [[Abbey of Fécamp|Fécamp]] and [[Benignus of Dijon|Saint-Bénigne]] were controlled by one abbot between 1052 and 1054: Abbot John of Ravenna. When the new founded monasteries became abbeys, the abbots were usually chosen among the monks of Fécamp.

Only few writings by William have survived in the Abbey of Fécamp, but it is not always easy to decide, if the collection of Montpellier which belonged obviously to the library of the Abbey St. Benignus of Dijon, had this Abbey as destination. Michel Huglo remarked that the last part of the manuscript H.159, the real Antiphonary with antiphons and responsories for the [[Matins]], was continued by the 13th-century copy of the Antiphonary of the Abbey of Fécamp (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 254, olim A.190).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So the destination of the Tonary of Saint-Bénigne is still a matter of discussion. On the other hand, customs of St. Bénigne like the liturgy for the patron can also be found in other Abbeys as Fécamp and Bernay, and the tonaries of Dijon (Montpellier, Ms. H159), of Fécamp (Rouen, Ms. 244, olim A.261), and of Jumièges (Rouen, Ms. 248, olim A.339) are so consistent that they can be regarded as documents of one school which can be ascribed to William of Volpiano.

== The alphabetic notation invented by William of Volpiano ==

One of William's innovations as a cantor and notator was an alphabetic pitch notation. Its point of reference was the Boethian diagramm, which displayed the double octave of the ''[[Tone system#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|systema teleion]]'' in the [[Diatonic genus|diatonic]] (semitonium-tonus-tonus), the [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]] (semitonium-semitonium-trihemitonium), and the [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic]] [[tetrachord]] (diesis-diesis-ditonus). The different positions were represented by alphabetical letters, except the dieses which had special signs not unlike the tyronic letters used by [[Boethius]]:

[[File:William of Volpiano's alphabetic notation.jpg|center|650px|thumb|alt=Introduction into William of Volpiano's aplphabetic notation|Alphabetic notation invented by [[William of Volpiano]]: the letters referred to the Boethian diagramme]]

This alphabetic pitch notation does not only offer insights into microtonal shifts used by the cantors of this local school, it also proves that the common projection of the piano keyboard on the medieval tone system is inadequate. Like many other letter systems used since the 8th century, also the system of William of Volpiano represented the positions of the Boethian diagramm, and the enharmonic signs used for the dieses represented not a change into another genus, but microtonal attractions within the diatonic melos of a certain mode.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Phillips ([[#Phi00|2000]]) offers an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the diesis [[Guido of Arezzo]] wrote about 1026 in his treatise ''[[Micrologus]]'' that the diesis sharpens the usual tonus between re-mi (a-b; d-e; g-h or h-i) with the proportion 9:8 by a proportion of 7:6 (a-˫; d-˧; g-Γ or h-˥).&lt;ref&gt;See: {{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guido's explanation, how to find this intervall at the monochord, made it already evident that the diesis, taken from the "enharmonic" division of the tetrachord, was used here as a microtonal shift in different melodic modes of the diatonic genus.

== Composition of the manuscript ==

The Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon is organized in a very rare form of a fully notated [[tonary]], which serves like a fully notated music manuscript for mass ([[gradual]]) and office chant ([[antiphonary]]).&lt;ref&gt;It has been preserved in the Bibliothèque Inter-Universitaire, Section Médecine, at the [[University of Montpellier]] (Ms. H.159), and it was issued as a facsimile in the series illustrating the relics of ancient musical notation, ''Paléographie Musicale'' (first series, Solesmes, [[#PM05|1896]]; reprinted twice: Bern, 1972; Solesmes, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first division of the chant book is between the book's gradual (ff. 13r-155v) and an antiphonary fragment (ff. 156r-162v) which has the [[Matins]] for Palm Sunday, St. Blasius and St. Hylarius in the conventional liturgical order, but with tonal rubrics.&lt;ref&gt;This form was also used in a contemporary Aquitanian abridged [[antiphonary]] or [[breviary]] (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, fonds lat., Ms. 1085), the only difference is that every chant is just represented by an incipit and that the tonal classification is a Latin ordinal according to the system of Hucbald (tonus I-VIII). William of Volpiano followed also here the shape of another [[tonary]] type and used classifications like [https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/308/mode/2up "P TE"] for "Plagi tetrardi" as they were already used in the 9th-century Gradual-Sacramentary of Saint-Denis (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, fonds lat., Ms. 118).&lt;/ref&gt; The last leaf was added from another book to use the blank versoside for additions on the last pages written by other hands, chant notated in adiastematic neumes but without alphabetic notation and even diastematic neumes with alphabetic notation (ff. 160r-163r).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159161rZ.jpg folio 161 recto].&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual itself with proper mass chant is divided into six parts: The first are antiphons ([[introit]]s and [[Communion (chant)|communions]]) (ff. 13r-53r). The next three parts are chant genres which precedes lessons: [[Alleluia (chant)|alleluia]] verses for [[Gospel Book|gospel]] readings (ff. 53v-69r), the benedictiones (hymnus trium puerorum) for [[Lectionary|prophetic]] readings (ff. 75r-76v), and the [[Responsory|graduels]] for [[epistle]] readings (ff. 77r-98v). The last two parts are an ''offertorial'' (ff. 99r-151r) and a [[Tract (liturgy)|tractus]] collection (ff. 69r-74v; 151v-155v), dedicated to the genre which replace the alleluia verses during fasten time for all kinds of scriptural readings.&lt;ref&gt;An exact description of its content can be found in the analytic table of the facsimile edition in the serial of [[#PM05|Paléographie musicale]] ([https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/n13/mode/2up VIII, 9-18]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The third level of division are the eight parts according to the oktoechos in the order of autentus protus, plagi proti, autentus deuterus etc. In the first part, every tonal section has all introits according to the liturgical year cycle and then all communions according to the liturgical order. The whole disposition is not new, but it is identical with tonaries from different regions of the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac Monastic Association]]. The only difference is, that every chant is not represented by an incipit, it is fully notated in neumes and in alphabetic notation as well. Thanks to this manuscript, even cantors who do not know the chant, can memorize the melody together with its tonus.

As an example might serve the Introitus "Repleatur os meum" used as a refrain for psalm 70 during the procession into the church, at the beginning of the morning mass on Saturday before Pentecost. The introit was written in the first part of the antiphons and is quite at the beginning of the deuterus section (written as heading on each page), hence an introit in the 3rd tone or "autentus deuterus":
[[File:Tonary of Saint-Bénigne de Dijon.jpg|thumb|900px|center|alt=Montpellier, Bibliothèque Inter-Universitaire, Section Médecine, Ms. H159, f. 25v|The introit "Repleatur os meum" of the authentic deuterus mode with the psalm 70 "In te domine speravi" and its ''differentia'' "ii" notated with "amen" ([[Montpellier]], Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecine, Ms. [[#MOfH159|H159]], f. 25v)]]
The beginning with the psalm incipit and the ending of the psalmody, here called ''differentia'' no. "ii", follows the antiphon. The antiphons of the entrance (introits) have the gradual order of the mass as a rubric at the margin (on a verso page as here: left), i.e. the serial for the day with ''gradual'' ('''R'''), ''alleluia'' ('''All''') or ''tractus'' ('''TR'''), ''offertorium'' ('''OF'''), and ''communio'' ('''CO'''). A conventional [[tonary]] with the list of ''differentiae'' was also attached to the beginning of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;See the coloured reproductions of the folios [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159011rZ.jpg 11 recto] and [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159011vZ.jpg 11 verso] and the transcription in the analytic table of the PM edition ([https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/n15/mode/2up 1901, VIII, 10]).&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as an index to find the ''differentia'' no. ii or melodic ending used during the recitation of the [[psalm]] - here the incipit refers to psalm 70 of the [[Vulgata]]. This tonary is preceded by an alleluia collection written in central French neumes in campo aperto.

The style of William of Volpiano's tonary which follows, is unique, and Michel Huglo called it one of the finest tonaries which survived in the manuscript collections today. The scribe used red ink for the chant text and different colours to decorate its initials, while the neume and the alphabetic notation was written in black ink.&lt;ref&gt;See folio [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159014rZ.jpg 14 recto].&lt;/ref&gt;

== William of Volpiano's contribution to the evolution of musical notation ==

William of Volpiano's innovation of the notation system did not change the habits of central French neume notation, it just added an own alphabetic pitch notation. Often it was not clear how the letters refer to the neumes. Letter groups usually refer to the group of a ligature, but sometimes neumes were added as well to the letters to help the reading cantor for the coordination.

Among the monastic reforms of [[Normandy]] [[William of Volpiano]] was an important protagonist among the local abbots, but his alphabetic notation was only used over the following centuries in the Norman monasteries of his school, but never in the later Italo-Norman manuscripts which were rather influenced by the [[Saint Martial school|Aquitanian school]] (a few manuscripts used central French neumes, but without alphabetic notation). Within the Cluniac Monastic Association, the cantors of the following generation like [[Adémar de Chabannes]] who was taught by his uncle Roger at [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges]] ([[Aquitaine]]), developed a new diastematic neume notation which allowed to indicate the ligatures, even if they were separated by the vertical disposition according to their pitch class. His innovation was imitated by Italian cantors, first in Northern Italy than in other reform centres of the 11th century like [[Benevento]] and [[Monte Cassino]]. During the 12th century one are two lines were added to help the scribe and the reader for a constant vertical orientation.

After the first generation of fully notated neume manuscripts written since the early 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest Southern French testimonies of local melodic neume notation («notation protoaquitaine») can be found in a gradual written about 890 (Albi, Bibliothèque municipale Rochegude, Ms. 44), where only 27 pieces have musical notation and usually only in some parts. Nevertheless, the scriptor left space for the notator (see the Christmas masses on [http://archivesnumeriques.mediatheques.grand-albigeois.fr/_images/OEB/RES_MS044/index.htm folio 5r–5v] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319062306/http://archivesnumeriques.mediatheques.grand-albigeois.fr/_images/OEB/RES_MS044/index.htm |date=March 19, 2014 }}), even if it had not always been used for later additions of neumes.
&lt;/ref&gt; the particular notation system represent a transition between the adiastematic and diastematic neumes. During the 11th century a lot of local traditions, different from the chant repertory of the Roman-Frankish reform, were codified the first time in diastematic neumes: [[Beneventan chant|Old Beneventan chant]] (Beneventan neumes without lines), [[Aquileian Rite|Ravenna chant]] (Beneventan neumes), [[Old Roman chant]] (Roman neumes without lines), [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]] or Milanese chant (square neumes on a penta- or tetragramm).

AM worked by generating and modifying short Lisp programs which were then interpreted as defining various mathematical concepts;&lt;ref name="koza"&gt;{{citation|title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|series=|first=John R.|last=Koza|publisher=MIT Press|year=1992|isbn=9780262111706|contribution=9.3 AM and Euroski|pages=232–236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhtxo60BV0EC&amp;pg=PA232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, a program that tested equality between the length of two lists was considered to represent the concept of numerical equality, while a program that produced a list whose length was the product of the lengths of two other lists was interpreted as representing the concept of multiplication.  The system had elaborate heuristics for choosing which programs to extend and modify, based on the experiences of working mathematicians in solving mathematical problems.

== Controversy ==

Lenat claimed that the system was composed of hundreds of data structures called "concepts," together with hundreds of "heuristic rules" and a simple flow of control: "AM repeatedly selects the top task from the agenda and tries to carry it out.  This is the whole control structure!"  Yet the heuristic rules were not always represented as separate data structures; some had to be intertwined with the control flow logic.  Some rules had preconditions that depended on the history, or otherwise could not be represented in the framework of the explicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, the published versions of the rules often involve vague terms that are not defined further, such as "If two expressions are structurally similar, ..." (Rule 218) or "... replace the value obtained by some other (very similar) value..." (Rule 129).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, p.&amp;nbsp;258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of information is the user, via Rule 2: "If the user has recently referred to X, then boost the priority of any tasks involving X."  Thus, it appears quite possible that much of the real discovery work is buried in unexplained procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, p.&amp;nbsp;252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenat claimed that the system had rediscovered both [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].  Later critics accused Lenat of over-interpreting the output of AM. In his paper ''Why AM and Eurisko appear to work'', Lenat conceded that any system that generated enough short Lisp programs would generate ones that could be interpreted by an external observer as representing equally sophisticated mathematical concepts.  However, he argued that this property was in itself interesting&amp;mdash;and that a promising direction for further research would be to look for other languages in which short random strings were likely to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Lenat, D. B., and Brown, J. S. (August 1984). "Why AM and EURISKO appear to work." ''Artificial Intelligence'' 23(3):269—294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successor ==

This intuition was the basis of AM's successor [[Eurisko]], which attempted to generalize the search for mathematical concepts to the search for useful [[heuristic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Artificial Intelligence: Mirrors for the Mind|series=Milestones in Discovery and Invention|first=Harry|last=Henderson|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781604130591|contribution=The Automated Mathematician|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKmIiICDIwgC&amp;pg=PA93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|300px|An example of computer animation which is produced in the "[[motion capture]]" technique]]
'''Computer animation''' is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer [[animation]] ''only'' refers to the moving images. [[Virtual cinematography|Modern computer animation]] usually uses [[3D computer graphics]], although [[2D computer graphics]] are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well.

Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the [[stop motion]] techniques using 3D models, and [[traditional animation]] techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, constructing [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] for effects shots or hiring [[extra (actor)|extras]] for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or [[Theatrical property|props]]. To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the [[computer monitor]] and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it, but advanced slightly in time (usually at a rate of 24, 25 or 30 frames/second). This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

For [[3D animation]]s, objects (models) are built on the computer monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged with a [[Skeletal animation|virtual skeleton]]. For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton. Then the limbs, eyes, mouth, clothes, etc. of the figure are moved by the animator on [[key frame]]s. The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as [[Inbetweening|tweening]] or [[morphing]]. Finally, the animation is [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=232}}

For 3D animations, all frames must be rendered after the modeling is complete. For 2D vector animations, the [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] process is the key frame illustration process, while tweened frames are rendered as needed. For pre-recorded presentations, the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium, like digital video. The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience. Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet (e.g. [[Adobe Flash]], [[X3D]]) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to [[streaming media|streaming]] or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations.

==Explanation==
To trick the [[Human eye|eye]] and the [[Human brain|brain]] into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object, the pictures should be drawn at around 12 [[frame rate|frames per second]] or faster.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=148}} (A [[Film frame|frame]] is one complete image.) With rates above 75-120  frames per second, no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and the brain both process images. At rates below 12 frames per second, most people can detect [[jerkiness]] associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement.{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=100–101, 255}} Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15  frames per second in order to save on the number of drawings needed, but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons. To produce more realistic imagery, computer animation demands higher frame rates.

Films seen in theaters in the United States run at 24 frames per second, which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement. For high resolution, adapters are used.

==History==
{{Main article|History of computer animation}}
{{See also|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}
Early digital computer animation was developed at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1960s by Edward E. Zajac, Frank W. Sinden, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=390–394}}  Other digital animation was also practiced at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=69–75}}

In 1967, a computer animation named "Hummingbird" was created by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awvQp1TdBqc]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1968, a computer animation called "[[:ru:Кошечка (мультфильм)|Kitty]]" was created with [[BESM]]-4 by Nikolai Konstantinov, depicting a cat moving around.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=so_HQKv-Bmk]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1971, a computer animation called "Metadata" was created, showing various shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vkxrVpzPK4U]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early step in the history of computer animation was the sequel to the 1973 film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]],'' a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=404}} The sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), used the 3D [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame]] imagery, which featured a computer-animated hand and face both created by [[University of Utah]] graduates [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=282–288}} This imagery originally appeared in their student film ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'', which they completed in 1972.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=64}}{{sfn|Means|2011}}

Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at [[SIGGRAPH]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=97–98}} an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques that is attended by thousands of computer professionals each year.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=95–97}} Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use [[game engine]]s to render non-interactive movies, which led to the art form [[Machinima]].

The very first full length computer animated television series was ''[[ReBoot]]'',{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=188}} which debuted in September 1994; the series followed the adventures of characters who lived inside a computer.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=430}} The first feature-length computer animated film was ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), which was made by [[Pixar]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=432}}{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=302}}&lt;ref&gt;"Our Story", Pixar, 1986-2013. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. {{cite web |url= http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story |title= The Pixar Timeline, 1979 to Present. |publisher= Pixar |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125659/http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story |archivedate= 2015-09-05 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed an adventure centered around toys and their owners. This groundbreaking film was also the first of many fully computer-animated movies.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=302}}

==Animation methods==
[[Image:Stickwalkav.gif|thumb|right|In this [[Graphics Interchange Format|.gif]] of a 2D [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, each 'stick' of the [[stick figure|figure]] is [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframed]] over time to create motion.]]
In most 3D computer animation systems, an animator creates a simplified representation of a character's anatomy, which is analogous to a [[skeleton]] or [[stick figure]].{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=193–196}} The position of each segment of the skeletal model is defined by animation variables, or [[Avar (animation variable)|Avars]] for short. In human and animal characters, many parts of the skeletal model correspond to the actual bones, but [[skeletal animation]] is also used to animate other things, with facial features (though other methods for [[facial animation]] exist).{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=324–326}} The character "Woody" in ''[[Toy Story]]'', for example, uses 700 Avars (100 in the face alone). The computer doesn't usually render the skeletal model directly (it is invisible), but it does use the skeletal model to compute the exact position and orientation of that certain character, which is eventually rendered into an image. Thus by changing the values of Avars over time, the animator creates motion by making the character move from frame to frame.

There are several methods for generating the Avar values to obtain realistic motion. Traditionally, animators manipulate the Avars directly.{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=111–118}} Rather than set Avars for every frame, they usually set Avars at strategic points (frames) in time and let the computer interpolate or [[tweening|tween]] between them in a process called ''[[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframing]]''. Keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator and has roots in hand-drawn [[traditional animation]].{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=132}}

In contrast, a newer method called ''[[motion capture]]'' makes use of [[live action]] footage.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=118}} When computer animation is driven by motion capture, a real performer acts out the scene as if they were the character to be animated.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=94–98}} His/her motion is recorded to a computer using [[video camera]]s and markers and that performance is then applied to the animated character.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=226}}

Each method has its advantages and as of 2007, games and films are using either or both of these methods in productions. Keyframe animation can produce motions that would be difficult or impossible to act out, while motion capture can reproduce the subtleties of a particular actor.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=204}} For example, in the 2006 film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', [[Bill Nighy]] provided the performance for the character [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Even though Nighy doesn't appear in the movie himself, the movie benefited from his performance by recording the nuances of his body language, posture, facial expressions, etc. Thus motion capture is appropriate in situations where believable, realistic behavior and action is required, but the types of characters required exceed what can be done throughout the conventional costuming.

==Modeling==
3D computer animation combines 3D models of objects and programmed or hand "keyframed" movement. These models are constructed out of geometrical vertices, faces, and edges in a 3D coordinate system. Objects are sculpted much like real clay or plaster, working from general forms to specific details with various sculpting tools. Unless a 3D model is intended to be a solid color, it must be painted with "[[texture mapping|textures]]" for realism. A bone/joint animation system is set up to deform the CGI model (e.g., to make a humanoid model walk). In a process known as ''rigging'', the virtual marionette is given various controllers and handles for controlling movement.{{sfn|Parent|2012|p=289}} Animation data can be created using [[motion capture]], or [[keyframing]] by a human animator, or a combination of the two.{{sfn|Beane|2012|p=2-15}}

3D models rigged for animation may contain thousands of control points — for example, "Woody" from ''[[Toy Story]]'' uses 700 specialized animation controllers. [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] labored for two years to create [[Aslan]] in the movie ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', which had about 1,851 controllers (742 in the face alone). In the 2004 film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', designers had to design forces of extreme weather with the help of video references and accurate meteorological facts. For the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', actor [[Andy Serkis]] was used to help designers pinpoint the gorilla's prime location in the shots and used his expressions to model "human" characteristics onto the creature. Serkis had earlier provided the voice and performance for [[Gollum]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.

==Equipment==

Computer animation can be created with a computer and an animation software. Some impressive animation can be achieved even with basic programs; however, the rendering can take a lot of time on an ordinary home computer.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=158}} Professional animators of movies, television and video games could make photorealistic animation with high detail. This level of quality for movie animation would take hundreds of years to create on a home computer. Instead, many powerful [[workstation]] computers are used.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=144}} Graphics workstation computers use two to four processors, and they are a lot more powerful than an actual home computer and are specialized for rendering. A large number of workstations (known as a ''"[[render farm]]"'') are networked together to effectively act as a giant computer.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=195}} The result is a computer-animated movie that can be completed in about one to five years (however, this process is not composed solely of rendering). A workstation typically costs $2,000-16,000 with the more expensive stations being able to render much faster due to the more technologically-advanced hardware that they contain. Professionals also use digital [[movie camera]]s, motion/[[performance capture]], [[Chroma key|bluescreens]], [[List of video editing software|film editing software]], props, and other tools used for movie animation.

==Facial animation==
{{Main article|Computer facial animation}}
The realistic modeling of human facial features is both one of the most challenging and sought after elements in computer-generated imagery. [[Computer facial animation]] is a highly complex field where models typically include a very large number of animation variables.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=110–116}} Historically speaking, the first [[SIGGRAPH]] tutorials on ''State of the art in Facial Animation'' in 1989 and 1990 proved to be a turning point in the field by bringing together and consolidating multiple research elements and sparked interest among a number of researchers.{{sfn|Parke|Waters|2008|p=xi}}

The [[Facial Action Coding System]] (with 46 "action units", "lip bite" or "squint"), which had been developed in 1976, became a popular basis for many systems.{{sfn|Magnenat Thalmann|Thalmann|2004|p=122}} As early as 2001, [[MPEG-4]] included 68 [[Face Animation Parameter]]s (FAPs) for lips, jaws, etc., and the field has made significant progress since then and the use of facial [[microexpression]] has increased.{{sfn|Magnenat Thalmann|Thalmann|2004|p=122}}{{sfn|Pereira|Ebrahimi|2002|p=404}}

In some cases, an [[Affect measures|affective space]], the [[PAD emotional state model]], can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]].{{sfn|Pereira|Ebrahimi|2002|pp=60–61}} In this approach, the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space and the lower level space is the MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAP). A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two-level structure – the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.{{sfn|Paiva|Prada|Picard|2007|pages=24–33}}

==Realism==
Realism in computer animation can mean making each frame look [[photorealism|photorealistic]], in the sense that the scene is rendered to resemble a photograph or make the characters' animation believable and lifelike.{{sfn|Masson|1999|pp=160–161}} Computer animation can also be realistic with or without the [[photorealistic rendering]].{{sfn|Parent|2012|pp=14–17}}

One of the greatest challenges in computer animation has been creating human characters that look and move with the highest degree of realism. Part of the difficulty in making pleasing, realistic human characters is the [[uncanny valley]], the concept where the human audience (up to a point) tends to have an increasingly negative, emotional response as a human replica looks and acts more and more human. Films that have attempted photorealistic human characters, such as ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2004/11/10/polar_express/|title=The Polar Express|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=2004-11-10|accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2013/11/01/10-scariest-movies-and-why-they-creep-us-out-243852.html|title=The 10 Scariest Movies and Why They Creep Us Out|last=Herman|first=Barbara|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=2013-10-30|accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/10/review.polar.express/index.html|title=Review: 'Polar Express' a creepy ride|last=Clinton|first=Paul|work=[[CNN]]|date=2004-11-10|accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'',&lt;ref name="digital in beowulf"&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/digital-actors-in-beowulf-are-just-uncanny/ Digital Actors in ‘Beowulf’ Are Just Uncanny]&amp;nbsp;– ''New York Times'', November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neumaier|first=Joe|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/blah-humbug-christmas-carol-3-d-spin-dickens-parts-lacks-spirit-article-1.414317|title=Blah, humbug!

have been criticized as "creepy" and "disconcerting".

The goal of computer animation is not always to emulate live action as closely as possible, so many animated films instead feature characters who are [[anthropomorphic]] animals, fantasy creatures and characters, superheroes, or otherwise have non-realistic, cartoon-like proportions.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=7}} Computer animation can also be tailored to mimic or substitute for other kinds of animation, like traditional stop-motion animation (as shown in ''[[Flushed Away]]'' or ''[[The Lego Movie]]''). Some of the long-standing [[12 basic principles of animation|basic principles of animation]], like squash &amp; stretch, call for movement that is not strictly realistic, and such principles still see widespread application in computer animation.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=59}}

== Films ==
[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film made using [[Machinima]]]]
CGI short films have been produced as [[independent animation]] since 1976.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=58}} An early example of an animated feature film to incorporate CGI animation was the 1983 Japanese [[anime]] film ''[[Golgo 13: The Professional]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|date=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|isbn=1569762228|page=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTI1yeZd-tkC&amp;pg=PA216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of computer animation (especially in the field of [[special effect]]s) skyrocketed during the [[Modern animation in the United States|modern era of U.S. animation]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=52}} The first completely computer-animated movie was ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), but ''[[VeggieTales]]'' is the first American fully 3D computer animated series sold directly (made in 1993); its success inspired other animation series, such as ''[[ReBoot]]'' in 1994.

==Web animations==
The popularity of [[website]]s that allow members to upload their own movies for others to view has created a growing community of [[amateur]] computer animators.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=82, 89}} With utilities and programs often included free with modern [[operating system]]s, many users can make their own animated movies and shorts. Several [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] animation software applications exist as well. The ease at which these animations can be distributed has attracted professional animation talent also. Companies such as [[PowToon]] and [[GoAnimate]] attempt to bridged the gap by giving amateurs access to professional animations as [[clip art]].

The oldest (most backward compatible) web-based animations are in the animated [[GIF]] format, which can be uploaded and seen on the web easily.{{sfn|Kuperberg|2002|pp=112–113}} However, the [[raster graphics]] format of GIF animations slows the [[download]] and frame rate, especially with larger screen sizes. The growing demand for higher quality web-based animations was met by a [[vector graphics]] alternative that relied on the use of a [[Browser extension|plugin]].  For decades, [[Flash animation]]s were the most popular format, until the web development community abandoned support for the [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash player]] plugin.  Web browsers on [[mobile device]]s and [[mobile operating system]]s never fully supported the Flash plugin.

By this time, [[Bandwidth (computing)|internet bandwidth]] and download speeds increased, making raster graphic animations more convenient. Some of the more complex vector graphic animations had a slower frame rate due to complex [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] than some of the raster graphic alternatives. Many of the GIF and Flash animations were already converted to [[digital video]] formats, which were compatible with mobile devices and reduced file sizes via [[video compression]] technology. However, compatibility was still problematic as some of the popular video formats such as Apple's [[QuickTime]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]] required plugins. [[YouTube]], the most popular video viewing website, was also relying on the Flash plugin to deliver digital video in the [[Flash Video]] format.

The latest alternatives are [[HTML5]] compatible animations. Technologies such as [[JavaScript]] and  [[CSS animation]]s made sequencing the movement of images in HTML5 web pages more convenient. [[SVG animation]]s offered a vector graphic alternative to the original Flash graphic format, [[SmartSketch]]. YouTube offers an HTML5 alternative for digital video. [[APNG]] (Animated PNG) offered a raster graphic alternative to animated GIF files that enables multi-level transparency not available in GIFs

{{See also|Comparison of HTML5 and Flash}}

==Detailed examples and pseudocode==
In 2D computer animation, moving objects are often referred to as "[[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]." A sprite is an image that has a location associated with it. The location of the sprite is changed slightly, between each displayed frame, to make the sprite appear to move.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=123}} The following [[pseudocode]] makes a sprite move from left to right:

 '''var''' ''int'' x := 0, y := screenHeight / 2;
 '''while''' x &lt; screenWidth
 drawBackground()
 drawSpriteAtXY (x, y) ''// draw on top of the background''
 x := x + 5 ''// move to the right''

Computer animation uses different techniques to produce animations. Most frequently, sophisticated [[mathematics]] is used to manipulate complex three-dimensional [[polygon]]s, apply "[[Texture mapping|textures]]", lighting and other effects to the polygons and finally [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] the complete image. A sophisticated [[graphical user interface]] may be used to create the animation and arrange its choreography. Another technique called [[constructive solid geometry]] defines objects by conducting boolean operations on regular shapes, and has the advantage that animations may be accurately produced at any resolution.

== Computer-assisted vs. computer-generated ==

''To animate means, figuratively, to "give life to". There are two basic methods that animators commonly use to accomplish this.''

Computer-assisted animation is usually classed as two-dimensional ([[2D computer graphics|2D]]) animation. Drawings are either hand drawn (pencil to paper) or interactively drawn (on the computer) using different assisting appliances and are positioned into specific software packages. Within the [[software]] package, the creator places drawings into different [[key frame]]s which fundamentally create an outline of the most important movements.{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=115}} The computer then fills in the "in-between frames", a process commonly known as [[Inbetweening|Tweening]].{{sfn|Masson|1999|p=284}} Computer-assisted animation employs new technologies to produce content faster than is possible with [[traditional animation]], while still retaining the stylistic elements of traditionally drawn characters or objects.&lt;ref name="Roos"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/computer-animation.htm |title=How Computer Animation Works |publisher=HowStuffWorks|last=Roos|first=Dave|date=2013|access-date=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of films produced using computer-assisted animation are [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|''The Little Mermaid'']], ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'']], ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|''Pocahontas'']], [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'']], ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', [[Mulan (1998 film)|''Mulan'']], ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'' and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.

Computer-generated animation is known as three-dimensional ([[3D computer graphics|3D]]) animation. Creators design an object or character with an X, a Y and a Z axis. No pencil-to-paper drawings create the way computer generated animation works. The object or character created will then be taken into a software, key framing and tweening are also carried out in computer generated animation but are also a lot of techniques used that do not relate to [[traditional animation]]. [[Animator]]s can break physical laws by using mathematical [[algorithm]]s to cheat [[mass]], [[force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]] rulings. Fundamentally, time scale and quality could be said to be a preferred way to produce animation as they are two major things that are enhanced by using computer generated animation. Another positive aspect of CGA is the fact one can create a flock of creatures to act independently when created as a group. An animal's fur can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] to wave in the wind and lie flat when it rains instead of programming each strand of hair separately.&lt;ref name="Roos" /&gt;

A few examples of computer-generated animation movies are ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', and ''[[Shrek]]''. &lt;!-- please don't add any more examples --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10438">'''Contrastive rhetoric''' is the study of how a person's first language and his or her culture influence [[second language writing|writing in a second language]] or how a common language is used among different cultures. The term was first coined by the American [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]] Robert Kaplan in 1966 to denote eclecticism and subsequent growth of collective knowledge in certain languages.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. (1966). Cultural thought patterns in intercultural education. ''[[Language acquisition|Language Learning]]'' 16(1): 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely expanded from 1996 to today by [[Finns|Finnish]]-born, US-based applied linguist Ulla Connor,&lt;ref name="Connor 1996"&gt;Connor, Ulla. (1996). ''Contrastive rhetoric: Cross-cultural aspects of second-language writing''. Cambridge, UK: [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Since its inception the area of study has had a significant impact on the exploration of intercultural discourse structures that extend beyond the target language's native forms of discourse organization. The field brought attention to cultural and associated linguistic habits in expression of English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Robert|title=Contrastive Rhetoric on About.com|publisher=[[About.com]]|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/c/g/Contrastive-Rhetoric.htm|accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance of dialect geography was especially welcomed in the United States on ESL instruction, as an emphasis on particular style in [[Spoken language|spoken-language]] and writing skills was previously dominated in both [[English language learning and teaching|English as a second language]] (ESL) and [[English as a foreign language]] (EFL) classes.&lt;ref&gt;Cai, Guanjun. (1998). "Contrastive Rhetoric." ''Theorizing Composition: A Critical Sourcebook of Theory and Scholarship in Contemporary Composition Studies'', ed. by Mary Lynch Kennedy. Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

Since 1966, when Kaplan’s original work on contrastive rhetoric appeared, and 1996, when Ulla Connor’s book on contrastive rhetoric reinvigorated interest in the area, new trends have appeared in research approaches and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla., Nagelhout, E., &amp; Rozycki, W. (Eds.) (2008). "Introduction" ''Contrastive Rhetoric: Reaching to Intercultural Rhetoric'', John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;  The change has been affected by three major developments—the acknowledgment of more genres with specific textual requirements, increased awareness of the social contexts of writing, and the need for an alternative conceptual framework that takes a more critical perspective of contrastive rhetoric—have motivated scholars of contrastive rhetoric to adjust and supplement research approaches in their work.

===EAP and other genres===
First, there was a marked increase in the types of written texts considered the purview of [[second language writing]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;ETIC (1975). English for academic study: Problems and perspectives. ETIC Occasional Paper. London: The British Council.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2004). Introduction. ''Journal of English for Academic Purposes'' 3: 271-276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[English for Academic Purposes]] (EAP) classes teach other types of writing besides the student essay required in college classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, R.R. (1997). ''English for academic purposes: A guide and resource book for teachers''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2004). Intercultural rhetoric research: Beyond texts. ''Journal of English for Academic Purposes'' 3: 291-304&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important genres are the academic research article, research report, and grant proposal.  Writing for professional purposes, such as business, is also now considered a legitimate type of second language writing and worthy of research and teaching.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite web|last=Connor|first=Ulla|title=Intercultural Rhetoric and EAP/ESP|publisher=[[National University of Singapore]]|url=http://nus.edu.sg/celc/symposium/Keynote%20Address%20-%20Ulla%20Connor.pdf|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
===Socially situated writing===
Second, in addition to the expansion of the genre, textual analysis has moved contrastive rhetoric to emphasize the social situation of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, Charles, &amp; Prior, Paul. (Eds.). (2004). ''What writing does and how it does it: An introduction to analyzing texts and textual practices''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, writing is increasingly regarded as being socially situated; each situation may entail special consideration to audience, purposes, level of perfection, and correspondingly may require varying amounts of revision, collaboration, and attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Matthew. (2009). Writing around the world: a guide to writing across cultures. London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations and norms of discourse communities or communities of practice (cultural and disciplinary) may shape these situational expectations and practices. This is where contrastive rhetoric overlaps with [[social constructionism]], which sees approaches to textual meaning as dynamic, socio-cognitive activities.  Instead of analyzing what texts "mean," the interest is to understand how they construct meaning.  Bazerman and Prior (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;6) pose three questions to guide the analysis of writing:

* “What does the text talk about?”
* “How do texts influence audiences?”
* “How do texts come into being?”

===Critical contrastive rhetoric===
Third, in response to criticisms that challenge traditional contrastive rhetoric, an alternative conceptual framework known as ''critical contrastive rhetoric'' has been established that maintains a critical understanding of the politics of cultural difference.  Critical contrastive rhetoric explores issues such as critical thinking&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley|first1=Jim|title=Displaying critical thinking in EFL academic writing: A discussion of Japanese to English contrastive rhetoric|journal=RELC Journal|date=2013|volume=44|issue=2|pages=195-208|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/relc_mckinley_contrastive_rhetoric_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in teaching situations that challenge essentialism. It takes into consideration [[poststructuralist]], [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] critiques of language and culture, in order to reconceptualize cultural difference in rhetoric. In practice, it "affirms multiplicity of languages, rhetorical forms, and students’ identities, while problematizing the discursive construction of rhetoric and identities, and thus allowing writing teachers to recognize the complex web of rhetoric, culture, power, and discourse in responding to student writing."&lt;ref name="Kubota"&gt;Kubota, Ryuko &amp; Lehner, Al. (2004). Toward critical contrastive rhetoric. ''Journal of Second Language Writing'', 13, 7–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions of relevance==

In the early 2000s, some postmodern and [[critical pedagogy]] writers in the [[second language writing]] field, began referring to contrastive rhetoric as if it had been frozen in space.&lt;ref name="Kubota" /&gt;  Over the years, the term contrastive rhetoric had started to gain a negative connotation, even negatively affecting writing in a second language.&lt;ref name="Connor 1996" /&gt;  Understood by many as Kaplan’s original work, contrastive rhetoric was increasingly characterized as static, and linked to [[contrastive analysis]], a movement associated with [[Structuralism|structural linguistics]] and [[behavioralism]].  Many of the contributions made to contrastive rhetoric from the late 1960s to the early 1990s have been ignored.  In a 2002 article, Connor&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2002). New directions in contrastive rhetoric. [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]] Quarterly 36: 493-510.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to address these criticisms and to offer new directions for a viable contrastive rhetoric.  In addressing the critiques, she aimed to draw attention to the broad scope of contrastive rhetoric and determined that a new term would better encompass the essence of contrastive rhetoric in its current state.  To distinguish between the often-quoted “static” model and the new advances that have been made, Connor suggests it may be useful to begin using the term '''intercultural rhetoric''' instead of contrastive rhetoric to refer to the current models of cross-cultural research.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Rhetoric" /&gt;

According to Connor, the term ''intercultural rhetoric'' better describes the broadening trends of expression across languages and cultures.  It preserves the traditional approaches that use [[textual analysis]], [[genre analysis]], and [[corpus linguistics|corpus analysis]], yet also introduces [[ethnographic]] approaches that examine language in interactions.  Furthermore, it connotes the analysis of texts that allows for dynamic definitions of culture and the inclusion of smaller cultures (e.g., disciplinary, classroom) in the analysis.

While Connor continues to use the term ''intercultural rhetoric'', scholars outside the United States looking at specific language differences (e.g. English and Japanese&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; and English and Spanish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiménez Ramirez|first=Jorge.|title=Cómo aumentar la calidad de la escritura en la enseñanza de español" (How to improve texts in Spanish as a Second Language)|publisher=Actas XXI Congreso Internacional ASELE. Cáceres (Spain): Ediciones de la Universidad de Extremadura|url=http://es.scribd.com/doc/50447552/MEJORA-ESCRITURA-CON-LA-RETORICA-CONTRASTIVA-ESPANOL-INGLES-Jorge-Jimenez|date=2010|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Escobar, Ángel F. (2012). ''A Contrastive Analysis of the Rhetorical Patterns of English and Spanish Expository Journal Writing''. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.&lt;/ref&gt;) consider this to be a loaded label and continue to use the term ''contrastive rhetoric'' for the distinctiveness the theory shows and for the freedom of using tools to assess and understand the field in a non-restrictive manner.

'''Critical applied linguistics''' ('''CALx''') is an interdisciplinary critical approach to [[English language|English]] [[applied linguistics]]. One of the central concerns in this approach is exposing the political dimensions and power relations involved in  mainstream applied linguistics, in areas like language teaching, language policy and planning, language testing, language rights, and so on.

Inclusions are stored nutrients, secretory products, and pigment granules. Examples of inclusions are [[glycogen]] granules in the liver and muscle cells, [[lipid]] droplets in fat cells, [[pigment]] granules in certain cells of skin and hair, water-containing [[vacuoles]], and crystals of various types.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Leslie P. Gartner and James L. Hiatt ; Text book of Histology; 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

These structures were first observed by [[O. F. Müller]] in 1786.&lt;ref name=Shively/&gt;

==Examples==
'''[[Glycogen]]''': Glycogen is the most common form of [[glucose]] in animals and is especially abundant in cells of muscles, and liver. It appears in electron micrograph as clusters, or a rosette of beta particles that resemble [[ribosomes]], located near the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Glycogen is an important energy source of the cell; therefore, it will be available on demand.  The enzymes responsible for glycogenolysis degrade glycogen into individual molecules of glucose and can be utilized by multiple organs of the body.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Fawcett; The cell, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amenta1997"/&gt;

'''[[Lipid]]s''': Lipids are [[triglycerides]] in storage form is the common form of inclusions, not only are stored in specialized cells ([[adipocytes]]) but also are located as individuals droplets in various cell type especially [[hepatocytes]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; These are fluid at body temperature and appear in living cells as [[refractile]] spherical droplets. Lipid yields more than twice as many calories per gram as does carbohydrate. On demand, they serve as a local store of energy and a potential source of short carbon chains that are used by the cell in its synthesis of membranes and other lipid containing structural components or secretory products.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''[[Crystal]]s''': Crystalline inclusions have long been recognized as normal constituents of certain cell types such as [[Sertoli cells]] and [[Leydig cells]] of the human testis, and occasionally in [[macrophages]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; It is believed that these structures are crystalline forms of certain proteins which is located everywhere in the cell such as in [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi body]], and free in cytoplasmic matrix.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''[[Pigment]]s''':  The most common pigment in the body, besides [[hemoglobin]] of red blood cells is [[melanin]], manufactured by [[melanocytes]] of the skin and hair, pigments cells of the retina and specialized nerve cells in the [[substantia nigra]] of the brain.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; These pigments have protective functions in skin and aid in the sense of sight in the retina but their functions in neurons is not understood completely. Furthermore, cardiac tissue and central nervous system neurons shows yellow to brown pigment called [[lipofuscin]], some believed that they have lysosomal activity.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''Secretory products:''' [[Hormone]]s, [[mucus]], [[Digestive enzyme|digestives enzymes]], [[neurotransmitters]], fibrous proteins, and hydrochloric acid are all different types of secretory products found in cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasmic inclusions bound for secretion in some secretory cells are sometimes not visible by microscopy; some glands secrete products that are only released when needed by the body. An example of such glands is steroid-secreting endocrine gland.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;

Its primary areas of research was [[astrophysics]] and [[solar system physics]]. A great deal of the research was concentrated on [[X-ray]] coming from [[astronomical objects]]. DRI have had X-ray equipment on board the Russian Satellite [[Granat]] and the European [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] satellite. The now concluded [[Danish Small Satellite Program]], which resulted in the aforementioned Oersted (''Ørsted'') satellite, was headed by DRI. The DRI space missions were supervised by the [[Danish Space Board]].&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt;

On 1 January 2005 the DRI and the [[geodesy]] part of [[Kort &amp; Matrikelstyrelsen]] merged to form the [[Danish National Space Center]].

The '''divergence problem''' is an anomaly from the field of [[dendroclimatology]], the study of past climate through observations of old trees, primarily the properties of their annual growth rings.  It is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the [[thermometer]]s ([[Instrumental temperature record|instrumental temperatures]]) and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood densities or, in some cases, widths of tree rings in the far northern forests.

While the thermometer records indicate a substantial late 20th century warming trend, many tree rings from such sites do not display a corresponding change in their maximum latewood density. In some studies this issue has also been found with tree ring width.&lt;ref name=Darrigo&gt;{{cite journal | last = D'Arrigo  | first = Rosanne

&lt;/ref&gt; A temperature trend extracted from tree rings alone would not show any substantial warming since  the 1950s.  The temperature graphs calculated in these two ways thus "diverge" from one another, which is the origin of the term.

==Discovery==
The problem of changing response of some tree ring proxies to recent climate changes was identified in [[Alaska]] by {{harvnb|Taubes|1995}} and {{harvnb|Jacoby|d'Arrigo|1995}}. Tree ring specialist [[Keith Briffa]]'s February 1998 study showed that this problem was more widespread at high northern latitudes, and warned that it had to be taken into account to avoid overestimating past temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briffa|Schweingruber|Jones|Osborn|1998}},&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|d'Arrigo|Wilson|Liepert|Cherubini|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
The deviation of some tree ring proxy measurements from the instrumental record since the 1950s raises the question of the reliability of tree ring proxies in the period before the [[instrumental temperature record]]. The wide geographic and temporal distribution of well-preserved trees, the solid physical, chemical, and biological basis for their use, and their annual discrimination make [[dendrochronology]] particularly important in pre-instrumental climate reconstructions. Tree ring proxies are essentially consistent with other [[Proxy (climate)|proxy measurements]] for the period 1600&amp;ndash;1950. Before around AD 1600, the uncertainty of temperature reconstructions rises due to the relative paucity of data sets and their limited geographic distribution. As of 2006, these uncertainties were considered too great to allow conclusion on whether the tree ring record diverges from other proxies during this period.&lt;ref name="Surface2000" /&gt; In more recent studies evidence suggested that the divergence is caused by human activities, and so confined to the recent past, but use of affected proxies can lead to overestimation of past temperatures, understating the current warming trend.&lt;ref name=Darrigo /&gt;

==Possible explanations==
The explanation for the divergence problem is still unclear, but is likely to represent the impact of some other climatic variable that is important to modern northern hemisphere forests but not significant before the 1950s. Rosanne D'Arrigo, senior research scientist at the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory#Tree ring lab|Tree Ring Lab]] at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]], hypothesises that "beyond a certain threshold level of temperature the trees may become more stressed physiologically, especially if moisture availability does not increase at the same time."  Signs suggestive of such stress are visible from space, where satellite pictures show "evidence of browning in some northern vegetation despite recent warming." &lt;ref name="csm_20091214"&gt;{{cite news |first=Moises |last=Velasquez-Manoff |title=Climategate, global warming, and the tree rings divergence problem |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=December 14, 2009 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/content/view/print/268803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible explanations include that the response to recent rapid [[global warming]] might be delayed or [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] in some fashion. The divergence might represent changes to other climatic variables to which tree rings are sensitive, such as delayed snowmelt and changes in seasonality. Growth rates could depend more on annual maximum or minimum temperatures, especially in temperature limited growth regions (i.e. high latitudes and altitudes). Another possible explanation is [[global dimming]] due to atmospheric [[aerosol]]s.&lt;ref name=Darrigo /&gt;

In 2012, Brienen et al. proposed that the divergence problem was largely an artefact of sampling large living trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brienen R.J.W. |author2=Gloor E. |author3=Zuidema P.A. |title=Detecting evidence for {{CO2}} fertilization from tree ring studies: The potential role of sampling biases |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=26 |pages=GB1025 |year=2012 |doi=10.1029/2011GB004143 |url= |bibcode=2012GBioC..26B1025B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cardym.jpg |thumb|right|200px|Drama students performing on stage.]]
A '''drama school''', '''stage school''' or '''theatre school''' is an undergraduate and/or graduate [[school]] or [[academic department|department]] at a [[college]] or [[university]]; or a free-standing institution (such as the Drama section at the [[Juilliard School]]); which specializes in the pre-professional training in [[drama]] and [[theatre]] arts, such as [[acting]], [[technical theatre|design and technical theatre]], [[arts administration]], and related subjects. If the drama school is part of a degree-granting institution, undergraduates typically take a [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], or, occasionally, [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Design]].  Graduate students may take a [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Doctor of Arts]], [[Doctor of Fine Arts]], or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.

==Entry and application process==
[[File:Dramaclubssst.jpg|thumb|Romanian students (Drama Club Botosani) in "The Taming of the Shrew"]]
Entry to drama school is usually through a competitive [[audition]] process. Some schools make this a two-stage process. Places on an acting course are limited (usually well below 100) so those who fare best at the audition are selected. Most academies state that applicants must be over 18 years of age.
Auditions usually involve the performance of [[monologue]]s and group workshops, and may also include a [[singing]] activity. This varies from academy to academy. If this is the case for an [[acting]] degree, the school looks more at how an applicant can put character into the song rather than how well they can sing. For a [[musical theatre]] degree, the emphasis is on showing one's talent as a [[singer]]. Most colleges offer callback auditions, often in several stages, in which students being considered for entry onto a course are brought back to audition again, demonstrating their talents further. It is also possible to get into a drama school by previous grades. Some auditioners may be under 18.

==Course content==

The courses offered by drama schools focus on practical courses, rather than theoretical classes. Their aim is to train students as professional [[actor]]s for stage (theatre or musical theatre) and camera-based work (film and television shows). Students are required to be enthusiastic and motivated in order to meet the demands of the program. At the beginning of the final year (usually the third), most drama schools stage a series of performances throughout the academic year to which [[Talent agent|agents]] and [[casting director]]s are invited. This helps to build the future of the graduates and serves as a showcase of what the students can do.

==Funding==

===United Kingdom===
In 1833 the actress [[Frances Maria Kelly]] managed the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] where she funded and operated a dramatic school, the earliest record of a drama school in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burwick|first1=Frederick|title=British Drama of the Industrial Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Conference of Drama Schools]] comprises Britain’s 22 leading Drama Schools. CDS exists in order to strengthen the voice of the member schools, to set and maintain the highest standards of training within the vocational drama sector, and to make it easier for prospective students to understand the range of courses on offer and the application process. Founded in 1969, the 22 member schools offer courses in Acting, Musical Theatre, Directing and Technical Theatre training. Graduates of CDS courses are currently working on stage, in front of the camera and behind the scenes in theatres and studios across Britain. In September 2016, Midlands Academy of Musical Theatre opened in Birmingham. Offering West End quality training in Musical Theatre to students aged 18+, and with the same or better opportunities as many London drama schools, they offer a regional option for prospective drama school students. In 2012 it was merged with the [[National Council for Drama Training]] to create a single national authority [[Drama UK]] responsible for both the provision of Drama Training and accreditation of official courses. In 2017 Drama UK was replaced by the [[Federation of Drama Schools]].

In the UK, funding varies from drama school to drama school. Historically drama schools were not part of the mainstream academic system, and therefore were not funded on the same basis as universities. Some drama schools are now part of a university, such as [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]], which is part of the [[City University of London]], and Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance, which is part of the University of Manchester, and these tend to charge similar tuition fees to universities. Student loans, drama awards and scholarships may help to provide students with their funding.
The most prominent funding scheme for performing arts education in the UK are the [[Dance and Drama Awards]].  This is a government scheme which subsidises the training offered at a selection of the leading performing arts schools in the fields of dance, drama, musical theatre and stage management.

===Ireland===

A number of third level institutions provide courses in Drama and Theatre Studies, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from TCD [http://www.tcd.ie/drama-film-music/ Drama Dept, TCD]&lt;/ref&gt; NUI Maynooth,&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from NUIM English Dept [http://english.nuim.ie/madtherapy.shtml Dramatherapy Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin City University.  A decision by Trinity in Jan 2007 to drop its BA in Acting Studies for cost reasons met with disappointment from the theatre sector.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity News report http://www.trinitynews.ie/articles.php?tn=1&amp;issue=2&amp;id=215{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  website&lt;/ref&gt;  A Forum for Acting Training was convened with leading professionals from the industry who recommended in a report published 27 May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Acting Training Report, May 2008, [http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/pdf/forum-on-acting-training-report.pdf Forum Report]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an Academy for Dramatic Arts, independent of a University, but with third level accreditation should be created. The report was submitted to the Irish Government.  On 1 August 2008, [[The Irish Times]] reported that a [[RADA]] graduate, [[Danielle Ryan]], granddaughter of the late [[Tony Ryan]] who founded [[Ryanair]], had announced plans to develop an Irish Academy of Dramatic Arts part-funded from a Trust created by her late father, Captain Cathal Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Smyth, Irish Times, 1 August 2008 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0801/1217368811614.html Acting academy to include theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan went ahead and the academy, known as The Lir, opened in September 2011. The Lir is part of Trinity College and is situated in the Grand Canal Dock area. It is officially associated with [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art |RADA]].

'''''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers''''' (English: ''Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''''Encyclopédie''''', was a general [[encyclopedia]] published in [[France]] between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the [[Encyclopédistes]]. It was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and, until 1759, co-edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' is most famous for representing the thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the ''Encyclopédie'''s aim was "to change the way people think" and for people to be able to inform themselves and to know things.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Hunt, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other contributors advocated for the [[secularization]] of learning away from the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University of the State of New York|title=Annual Report of the Regents, Volume 106|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABxEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the ''Encyclopédie'' and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Kramnick, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe the [[Artes Mechanicae|mechanical arts]]. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2013). ''Books: a living history''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The ''Encyclopédie'' was originally conceived as a French translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Magee, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Chambers had first published his ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1971. pp. 3–5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS 1970"&gt;[[Robert Shackleton]] "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 The ''Encyclopedie'']" in: ''Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (vol. 114, No. 5, 1970. p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation appeared between 1747 and 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert had started translating Chambers into French,&lt;ref&gt;''Précis de la vie du citoyen Lambert'', Bibliothèque nationale, Ln. 11217; Listed in Shackleton (1970, p. 130).&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1745 the expatriate Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] and German [[Gottfried Sellius]] were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' for publication, which they entitled ''Encyclopédie''.

Early in 1745 a prospectus for the ''Encyclopédie''&lt;ref&gt;Recently rediscovered in the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'', see [http://blog.bnf.fr/lecteurs/index.php/2010/12/prospectus-pour-une-traduction-francaise-de-la-cyclopaedia-de-chambers/ Prospectus pour une traduction française de la Cyclopaedia de Chambers] blog.bnf.fr, Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published to attract subscribers to the project. This four page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon,&lt;ref&gt;[[André-François Le Breton]], Jean-Michel Papillon, Ephraim Chambers. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-4AxtwAACAAJ Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciences]''. 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied by a plan, stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction from 1745 original in: Luneau de Boisjermain (1771) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIdYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 Mémoire pour les libraires associés à l'Encyclopédie: contre le sieur Luneau de Boisjermain].'' p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Blom]]. ''Encyclopédie: the triumph of reason in an unreasonable age Fourth Estate'', 2004. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OMTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 Prospectus du Dictionnaire de Chambers, traduit en François, et proposé par souscription]" in: M. Desfontaines. ''Jugemens sur quelques ouvrages nouveaux.'' Vol 8. (1745). p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'' journal was lavish in its praise: "voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu'on ait faites depuis long-temps" (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a very long time).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eX9KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA934 Review] in: ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'', May 1745, Nr. 2. pp. 934–38&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mercure Journal'' in June 1745, printed a 25-page article that specifically praised Mill's role as translator; the ''Journal'' introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The ''Journal'' reported that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercure Journal'' (1745, p. 87) cited in: Lough (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cooperation fell apart later on in 1745. [[André Le Breton]], the publisher commissioned to manage the physical production and sales of the volumes, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming for example that Mills's knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Mills returned to England soon after the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Mills' summary of this matter was published in [[:fr:Pierre-Joseph Luneau de Boisjermain|Boisjermain]]'s ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wRhBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau de Boisjermain av. d. Piéc. justif]'' 1771, pp. 162–63, where Boisjermain also gave his version of the events (pp. 2–5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comments by Le Breton are published in his biography; in the preface of the encyclopedia; in John Lough (1971); etc.&lt;/ref&gt; For his new editor, Le Breton settled on the mathematician [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]. Among those hired by Malves were the young [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Denis Diderot]]. Within thirteen months, in August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being an ineffective leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and d'Alembert to be the new editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would remain as editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the ''Encyclopédie'' through to its completion; d'Alembert would leave this role in 1758. As d'Alembert worked on the ''Encyclopédie'', its title expanded. As of 1750, the full title was ''Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.'' ("Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Persons of Letters, edited by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and ''[[Belles-lettres]]'' of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d'Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and to the Royal Society of London.") The title page was amended as d'Alembert acquired more titles.

==Publication==
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice section 256px.jpg|thumb|Extract from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of the ''Encyclopédie'' (1772). It was drawn by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and engraved by Bonaventure-Louis Prévost. The work is laden with [[symbol]]ism: The figure in the centre represents truth—surrounded by bright light (the central symbol of the Enlightenment). Two other figures on the right, reason and philosophy, are tearing the veil from truth.]]
The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver [[Robert Bénard]] provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. Because of its occasional radical contents (see "Contents" below), the ''Encyclopédie'' caused much controversy in conservative circles, and on the initiative of the [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury#Opposition to the Encyclopédie|Parlement of Paris]], the French government suspended the encyclopedia's ''privilège'' in 1759.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Magee, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suspension, work continued "in secret," partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]]. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.

During the "secretive" period, Diderot accomplished a well-known work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show Neufchastel as the place of publication. Neufchastel (now Neuchâtel) is safely across the French border in what is now part Switzerland but which was then an independent principality,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, D (1992) ''Postcompulsory Education in Suisse romande'', unpublished PhD thesis, University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; where official production of the ''Encyclopédie'' was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the ''Encyclopédie'' could not seize the production plates for the ''Encyclopédie'' in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.

In 1775, [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]] obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven "extra" volumes as part of the first full issue of the ''Encyclopédie'', for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.

&lt;!-- info taken from the French article --&gt;From 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the ''[[Encyclopédie méthodique]]''. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.&lt;!-- From where this is it refers to the EM, but elsewhere the ''Encyclopédie''. Remove for now: The run of the press was 4,250 copies — a ridiculously small number for the present but very large for the 18th century where editions rarely exceeded 1,500 copies. --&gt;

==Contributors==
Since the objective of the editors of the ''Encyclopédie'' was to gather all the knowledge in the world, Diderot and D'Alembert knew they would need various contributors to help them with their project.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[philosophes]] ([[intellectuals]] of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) contributed to the ''Encyclopédie'', including Diderot himself, [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The most prolific contributor was [[Louis de Jaucourt]], who wrote 17,266 articles between 1759 and 1765, or about eight per day, representing a full 25% of the ''Encyclopédie''. The publication became a place where these contributors could share their ideas and interests.

Still, as [[Frank Kafker]] has argued, the Encyclopedists were not a unified group:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camargofoundation.org/fellowdetails_new05.asp?recno=357 |title=Fellow Project Details |publisher=The Camargo Foundation |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... despite their reputation, [the Encyclopedists] were not a close-knit group of [[Radicalization|radicals]] intent on subverting the Old Regime in France. Instead they were a disparate group of men of letters, physicians, scientists, craftsmen and scholars ... even the small minority who were persecuted for writing articles belittling what they viewed as unreasonable customs—thus weakening the might of the Catholic Church and undermining that of the monarchy—did not envision that their ideas would encourage a revolution.}}

Following is a list of notable contributors with their area of contribution (for a more detailed list, see [[Encyclopédistes]]):

*[[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]] – editor; science (especially mathematics), contemporary affairs, philosophy, religion, among others
*[[Claude Bourgelat]] – manège, farriery
*[[André Le Breton]] – chief publisher; article on printer's ink &lt;!--to be noted elsewhere: he was the only person to have participated for the entire duration of the project.--&gt;
*[[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] – natural history
*[[Denis Diderot]] – chief editor; economics, mechanical arts, philosophy, politics, religion, among others
*[[Baron d'Holbach]] – science (chemistry, mineralogy), politics, religion, among others
*[[Louis de Jaucourt|Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt]] – economics, literature, medicine, politics, bookbinding, among others
*[[Jean-Baptiste de La Chapelle]] – mathematics
*[[Abbé]] [[André Morellet]] – theology, philosophy
*[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] – part of the article "Goût" ("Taste")
*[[François Quesnay]] – articles on tax farmers and grain
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] – music, political theory
*[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] – economics, etymology, philosophy, physics
*[[Voltaire]] – history, literature, philosophy

Due to the controversial nature of some of the articles, several of its editors went to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ian|title=An Encyclopedia Brown story: Bound and determined to fight for the facts in the time of Trump|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/an-encyclopedia-ian-brown-story/article35586033/|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents and controversies ==

===Structure===
[[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|300px|thumb|Fig. 3: "[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination.]] Like most encyclopedias, the ''Encyclopédie'' attempted to collect and summarize human knowledge in a variety of fields and topics, ranging from philosophy to theology to science and the arts. The ''Encyclopédie'' was controversial for reorganizing knowledge based on [[humanism|human]] [[rationalism|reason]] instead of by nature or theology.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, pp. 7,  539&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge and intellect branched from the three categories of human thought, whereas all other perceived aspects of knowledge, including theology, were simply branches or components of these man made categories.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 1993, pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the ''Encyclopédie'', D'Alembert's "[[Preliminary Discourse]]", is considered an important exposition of Enlightenment ideals.  Among other things, it presents a [[Figurative system of human knowledge|taxonomy of human knowledge]] (see Fig. 3), which was inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]''. The three main branches of knowledge are: "Memory"/History, "Reason"/Philosophy, and "Imagination"/Poetry. This tree of knowledge was created to help readers evaluate the usefulness of the content within the ''Encyclopédie'', and to organize its content.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is the fact that theology is ordered under "Philosophy" and that "Knowledge of God" is only a few nodes away from "[[Divination]]" and "[[Black Magic]]".

===Religious and political controversies===
The authors of the ''Encyclopédie'' challenged religious authority. The authors, especially Diderot and d'Alembert, located religion within a system of reason and philosophy. They did not reject all religious claims, but believed theology and notions of [[God]] must be proven. [[Louis de Jaucourt]] therefore harshly criticized superstition as an intellectual error in his article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 51–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"&gt;Lough, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore doubted the authenticity of presupposed historical events cited in the Bible and questioned the validity of miracles and the Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living story|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary scholars argue the skeptical view of miracles in the ''Encyclopédie'' may be interpreted in terms of "[[Protestant]] debates about the cessation of the charismata."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"/&gt;

These challenges led to suppression from church and state authorities. The ''Encyclopédie'' and its contributors endured many attacks and attempts at censorship by the clergy or other censors, which threatened the publication of the project as well as the authors themselves. The [[Curia regis#France|King's Council]] suppressed the ''Encyclopédie'' in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=780 "Diderot's Encyclopedia"]. Historical Text Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]], under [[Pope Clement XIII]], placed it on its [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|list of banned books]]. Prominent intellectuals criticized it, most famously [[Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan|Lefranc de Pompignan]] at the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. A playwright, [[Charles Palissot de Montenoy]], wrote a play called ''Les Philosophes'' to criticize the ''Encyclopédie''. When Abbé [[André Morellet]], one of the contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'', wrote a mock preface for it, he was sent to the [[Bastille]] due to allegations of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred Owen|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|year=2015|publisher=Princeton Legacy Library|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEl9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To defend themselves from controversy, the encyclopedia’s articles wrote of theological topics in a mixed manner. Some articles supported orthodoxy, and some included overt criticisms of Christianity. To avoid direct retribution from censors, writers often hid criticism in obscure articles or expressed it in ironic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the contributors still openly attacked the Catholic Church in certain articles with examples including criticizing excess festivals, monasteries, and celibacy of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and society===
The ''Encyclopédie'' is often seen as an influence for the [[French Revolution]] because of its emphasis on Enlightenment political theories. Diderot and other authors, in famous articles such as "Political Authority", emphasized the shift of the origin of political authority from divinity or heritage to the people. This Enlightenment ideal, espoused by Rousseau and others, advocated that people have the right to consent to their government in a form of social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major, contentious component of political issues in the ''Encyclopédie'' was personal or natural rights. Articles such as "Natural Rights" by Diderot explained the relationship between individuals and the general will. The natural state of humanity, according to the authors, is barbaric and unorganized. To balance the desires of individuals and the needs of the general will, humanity requires civil society and laws that benefit all persons. Writers, to varying degrees, criticized [[Thomas Hobbes]]' notions of a selfish humanity that requires a sovereign to rule over it.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, pp. 191–92&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economics, the ''Encyclopédie'' expressed favor for [[laissez-faire]] ideals or principles of economic liberalism. Articles concerning economics or markets, such as "Economic Politics", generally favored free competition and denounced monopolies. Articles often criticized guilds as creating monopolies and approved of state intervention to remove such monopolies. The writers advocated extending laissez-faire principles of liberalism from the market to the individual level, such as with privatization of education and opening of careers to all levels of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 331–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
At the same time, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a vast compendium of knowledge, notably on the technologies of the period, describing the traditional craft tools and processes. Much information was taken from the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]''. These articles applied a scientific approach to understanding the mechanical and production processes, and offered new ways to improve machines to make them more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot felt that people should have access to "useful knowledge" that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Encyclopédie'' played an important role in the intellectual ferment leading to the French Revolution. "No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion," wrote the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]. In ''The Encyclopédie and the Age of Revolution'', a work published in conjunction with a 1989 exhibition of the ''Encyclopédie'' at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], Clorinda Donato writes the following:
{{quote|The encyclopedians successfully argued and marketed their belief in the potential of reason and unified knowledge to empower human will and thus helped to shape the social issues that the French Revolution would address. Although it is doubtful whether the many artisans, technicians, or laborers whose work and presence and interspersed throughout the ''Encyclopédie'' actually read it, the recognition of their work as equal to that of intellectuals, clerics, and rulers prepared the terrain for demands for increased representation. Thus the ''Encyclopédie'' served to recognize and galvanize a new power base, ultimately contributing to the destruction of old values and the creation of new ones (12).}}

While many contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'' had no interest in radically reforming French society, the ''Encyclopédie'' as a whole pointed that way. The ''Encyclopédie'' denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, pp. 480–81&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The ''Encyclopédie''{{'}}s influence continues today. Historian Dan O'Sullivan compares it to [[Wikipedia]]:

{{quote|Like Wikipedia, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a collaborative effort involving numerous writers and technicians. As do [[Wikipedians]] today, Diderot and his colleagues needed to engage with the latest technology in dealing with the problems of designing an up-to-date encyclopedia. These included what kind of information to include, how to set up links between various articles, and how to achieve the maximum readership.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Quotations==
* The goal of an encyclopedia is to assemble all the knowledge scattered on the surface of the earth, to demonstrate the general system to the people with whom we live, &amp; to transmit it to the people who will come after us, so that the works of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous &amp; happier, &amp; that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race. (''Encyclopédie'', Diderot)&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"En effet, le but d'une Encyclopédie est de rassembler les connoissances éparses sur la surface de la terre; d'en exposer le système général aux hommes avec qui nous vivons, &amp; de le transmettre aux hommes qui viendront après nous; afin que les travaux des siecles passés n'aient pas été des travaux inutiles pour les siecles qui succéderont; que nos neveux, devenant plus instruits, deviennent en même tems plus vertueux &amp; plus heureux, &amp; que nous ne mourions pas sans avoir bien mérité du genre humain." From [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1252.encyclopedie0513 uchicago.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Reason is to the philosopher what [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] is to the Christian...  Other men walk in darkness; the philosopher, who has the same passions, acts only after reflection;  he walks through the night, but it is preceded by a torch.  The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations.  He does not confuse truth with plausibility; he takes for truth what is true, for forgery what is false, for doubtful what is doubtful, and probable what is probable.  The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy." (''Philosophers'', Dumarsais)
* "If exclusive privileges were not granted, and if the financial system would not tend to concentrate wealth, there would be few great fortunes and no quick wealth.  When the means of growing rich is divided between a greater number of citizens, wealth will also be more evenly distributed; extreme poverty and extreme wealth would be also rare." (''Wealth'', Diderot)
* "[[Urena lobata|Aguaxima]], a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom such descriptions are made. It cannot be for the natives of the countries concerned, who are likely to know more about the aguaxima than is contained in this description, and who do not need to learn that the aguaxima grows in their country. It is as if you said to a Frenchman that the pear tree is a tree that grows in France, in Germany, etc. It is not meant for us either, for what do we care that there is a tree in Brazil named aguaxima, if all we know about it is its name? What is the point of giving the name? It leaves the ignorant just as they were and teaches the rest of us nothing. If all the same I mention this plant here, along with several others that are described just as poorly, then it is out of consideration for certain readers who prefer to find nothing in a dictionary article or even to find something stupid than to find no article at all." (''Aguaxima'', Diderot)

{{General relativity |phenomena}}

In [[general relativity]], an '''event horizon''' is a region in [[spacetime]] beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.  In layman's terms, it is defined as the shell of "points of no return", i.e., the boundary at which the gravitational pull of a massive object becomes so great as to make escape impossible. An event horizon is most commonly associated with [[black holes]].  Light emitted from inside the event horizon can never reach the outside observer.  Likewise, any object approaching the horizon from the observer's side appears to slow down and never quite pass through the horizon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Eric | last=Chaisson | title=Relatively Speaking: Relativity, Black Holes, and the Fate of the Universe | page=213 | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | year=1990 | isbn=978-0393306750}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its image becoming more and more [[redshift]]ed as time elapses. This means that the wavelength of the light emitted from the object is getting longer as the object moves away from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey | last=Bennett |last2=Donahue | first2= Megan | author2-link = Megan Donahue |last3=Schneider |first3= Nicholas| last4=Voit |first4=Mark|title=The Cosmic Perspective | page=156 | publisher=[[Pearson Education]] | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-134-05906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveling object, however, experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the horizon in a finite amount of [[proper time]].

More specific types of horizon include the related but distinct [[Absolute horizon|absolute]] and [[apparent horizon]]s found around a black hole.  Still other distinct notions include the [[Cauchy horizon|Cauchy]] and [[Killing horizon]]s; the [[photon sphere]]s and [[ergosphere]]s of the [[Kerr solution]]; [[particle horizon|particle]] and [[cosmological horizon]]s relevant to [[cosmology]]; and [[isolated horizon|isolated]] and [[dynamical horizon]]s important in current black hole research.

One of the best-known examples of an event horizon derives from general relativity's description of a [[black hole]], a celestial object so massive that no nearby matter or radiation can escape its [[gravitational field]].  Often,  this is described as the boundary within which the black hole's [[escape velocity]] is greater than the [[speed of light]].  However,  a more accurate description is that within this horizon, all [[lightlike]] paths (paths that light could take) and hence all paths in the forward [[light cone]]s of particles within the horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate system used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time |first1=S.

The surface at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] acts as an event horizon in a non-rotating body that fits inside this radius (although a [[rotating black hole]] operates slightly differently). The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the [[Sun]] this radius is approximately 3 kilometers and for the [[Earth]] it is about 9 millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force, to overcome [[Electron degeneracy pressure|electron]] and [[neutron degeneracy pressure]]. The minimal mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these pressures is the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]], which is approximately three solar masses.

Black hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although erroneous, is the notion that black holes "vacuum up" material in their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of seeking out material to consume than any other gravitational attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that matter can be observed falling into a black hole. This is not possible. Astronomers can detect only [[accretion disk]]s around black holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates high-energy radiation which can be detected (similarly, some matter from these accretion disks is forced out along the axes of spin of the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed directly at Earth). Furthermore, a distant observer will never actually see something reach the horizon. Instead, while approaching the hole, the object will seem to go ever more slowly, while any light it emits will be further and further redshifted.

==Cosmic event horizon==
{{Main|Cosmological horizons}}

In [[cosmology]], the event horizon of the [[observable universe]]  is the largest [[comoving distance]] from which light emitted ''now'' can ever reach the observer in the future. This differs from the concept of [[particle horizon]], which  represents the largest comoving distance from which light emitted in the ''past'' could have reached the observer at a given time. For events beyond that distance, light has not had time to reach our location, even if it were emitted at the time the universe began. How the particle horizon changes with time depends on the nature of the [[expansion of the universe]]. If the expansion has certain characteristics, there are parts of the universe that will never be observable, no matter how long the observer waits for light from those regions to arrive. The boundary past which events cannot ever be observed is an event horizon, and it represents the maximum extent of the particle horizon.

The criterion for determining whether a particle horizon for the universe exists is as follows. Define a [[comoving distance]] ''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' as
:&lt;math&gt;d_p=\int_{0}^{t_0} \frac{c}{a(t)} \,dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''a'' is the [[scale factor (universe)|scale factor]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the age of the Universe. If {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[Limit (mathematics)|→ ∞]]}} (i.e., points arbitrarily as far away as can be observed), then no event horizon exists. If {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ∞}}, a horizon is present.

Examples of cosmological models without an event horizon are universes dominated by [[matter]] or by [[light|radiation]]. An example of a cosmological model with an event horizon is a universe dominated by the [[cosmological constant]] (a [[de Sitter universe]]).

A calculation of the speeds of the cosmological event and particle horizons was given in a paper on the [[FLRW]] cosmological model, approximating the Universe as composed of non-interacting constituents, each one being [[Equation of state (cosmology)|a perfect fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Apparent horizon of an accelerated particle==
{{See also|Hyperbolic motion (relativity)}}
[[Image:Event-horizon-particle.svg|right|thumb|[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagram]] showing a uniformly [[acceleration|accelerated]] particle, '''P''', and an event '''E''' that is outside the particle's apparent horizon. The event's forward [[light cone]] never intersects the particle's [[world line]].]]

If a particle is moving at a constant velocity in a non-expanding universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that Universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the forward [[light cone]]s from these events intersect the particle's [[world line]]. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some situations light cones from some events never intersect the particle's world line. Under these conditions, an [[apparent horizon]] is present in the particle's (accelerating) reference frame, representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.

For example, this occurs with a uniformly accelerated particle. A [[Minkowski diagram|spacetime diagram]] of this situation is shown in the figure to the right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never reaches, the [[speed of light]] with respect to its original reference frame. On the spacetime diagram, its path is a [[hyperbola]], which [[asymptote|asymptotically approaches]] a 45-degree line (the path of a light ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, there appears to be a boundary behind it from which no signals can escape (an apparent horizon).

While approximations of this type of situation can occur in the real world {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (in [[particle accelerator]]s, for example), a true event horizon is never present, as this requires the particle to be accelerated indefinitely (requiring arbitrarily large amounts of energy and an arbitrarily large apparatus).

==Interacting with an event horizon==
A misconception concerning event horizons, especially [[black hole]] event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that destroys objects that approach them. In practice, all event horizons appear to be some distance away from any observer, and objects sent towards an event horizon never appear to cross it from the sending observer's point of view (as the horizon-crossing event's [[light cone]] never intersects the observer's [[world line]]). Attempting to make an object near the horizon remain stationary with respect to an observer requires applying a force whose magnitude increases unboundedly (becoming infinite) the closer it gets.

In the case of a horizon perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer in empty space, the horizon seems to remain a fixed distance from the observer no matter how its surroundings move. Varying the observer's acceleration may cause the horizon to appear to move over time, or may prevent an event horizon from existing, depending on the acceleration function chosen. The observer never touches the horizon and never passes a location where it appeared to be.

In the case of a horizon perceived by an occupant of a [[de Sitter universe]], the horizon always appears to be a fixed distance away for a [[inertial frame of reference|non-accelerating]] observer. It is never contacted, even by an accelerating observer.

In the case of the horizon around a black hole, observers stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The [[proper length|proper distance]] to the horizon is finite,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Misner |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles W. Misner |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |author2-link=Kip Thorne |last3=Wheeler |first3=John |author3-link=John Archibald Wheeler | title=Gravitation | publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] | year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0 |page=824|title-link=Gravitation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was approximately at rest in [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]), the [[proper acceleration]] ([[G-force]]) experienced by points on the rope closer and closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in [[freefall]]), then indeed the observer at the bottom of the rope can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon, since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.

Observers crossing a black hole event horizon can calculate the moment they have crossed it, but will not actually see or feel anything special happen at that moment. In terms of visual appearance, observers who fall into the hole perceive the black region constituting the horizon as lying at some apparent distance below them, and never experience crossing this visual horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/schw.html|title=Journey into a Schwarzschild black hole|website=jila.colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects that had entered the horizon along the same radial path but at an earlier time would appear below the observer but still above the visual position of the horizon, and if they had fallen in recently enough the observer could exchange messages with them before either one was destroyed by the [[gravitational singularity]].&lt;ref name="casa.colorado.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/dive.html|title=Dive into the Black Hole|website=casa.colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing [[tidal force]]s (and eventual impact with the hole's singularity) are the only locally noticeable effects. Tidal forces are a function of the mass of the black hole. In realistic [[stellar black hole]]s, [[spaghettification]] occurs early: tidal forces tear materials apart well before the event horizon. However, in [[supermassive black hole]]s, which are found in centers of galaxies, spaghettification occurs inside the event horizon. A human astronaut would survive the fall through an event horizon only in a black hole with a mass of approximately 10,000 [[solar mass]]es or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Relativity: An introduction for physicists|first1=Michael Paul

|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&amp;pg=PA265|chapter=11. Schwarzschild black holes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond general relativity==
The description of event horizons given by [[general relativity]] is thought to be incomplete. When the conditions under which event horizons occur are modeled using a more comprehensive picture of the way the Universe works, that includes both relativity and [[quantum mechanics]], event horizons are expected to have properties that are different from those predicted using general relativity alone.

At present, it is expected that the primary impact of quantum effects is for event horizons to possess a [[temperature]] and so emit radiation. For [[black hole]]s, this manifests as [[Hawking radiation]], and the larger question of how the black hole possesses a temperature is part of the topic of [[black hole thermodynamics]]. For accelerating particles, this manifests as the [[Unruh effect]], which causes space around the particle to appear to be filled with matter and radiation.

According to the controversial [[Firewall (physics)|black hole firewall]] hypothesis, matter falling into a black hole would be burned to a crisp by a high energy "firewall" at the event horizon.

An alternative is provided by the [[Black hole complementarity|complementarity principle]], according to which, in the chart of the far observer, infalling matter is thermalized at the horizon and reemitted as Hawking radiation, while in the chart of an infalling observer matter continues undisturbed through the inner region and is destroyed at the singularity. This hypothesis does not violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] as there is a single copy of the information according to any given observer. Black hole complementarity is actually suggested by the scaling laws of [[String Theory|strings]] approaching the event horizon, suggesting that in the Schwarzschild chart they stretch to cover the horizon and thermalize into a [[Planck length]]-thick membrane.

A complete description of event horizons is expected to, at minimum, require a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. One such candidate theory is [[M-theory]].  Another such candidate theory is [[Loop Quantum Gravity|loop quantum gravity]].

The '''Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research''' ('''FAIR''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAIR home page|url=http://www.fair-center.eu|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an international [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] facility under construction which will use [[antiproton]]s and [[ion]]s to perform research in the fields of: [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[Book:Hadronic Matter|hadron]] and [[particle physics]], [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[Matter#Antimatter|anti-matter]] physics, high density [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]], and applications in [[condensed matter physics]], [[biology]] and the [[bio-medical]] sciences. It is situated in [[Darmstadt]] in [[Germany]] and is expected to provide beams to the experiments from 2018 onwards.

FAIR will be based upon an expansion of the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]], the details of which have been laid out in the FAIR Baseline Technical Report 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FAIR - Baseline Technical Report|year=2006|isbn=3-9811298-0-6|url=http://www.fair-center.eu/for-users/publications/fair-publications.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 2010 the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe limited liability company (German GmbH), abbreviated as FAIR GmbH, was founded which coordinates the construction of the new accelerators and experiments.

The project's cost was estimated at 1.6 billion euro ($2 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAIR: New German particle accelerator clears first hurdle|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-06-fair-german-particle-hurdle.html|publisher=phys.org|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FAIR science case==

The four scientific pillars of FAIR are:
   
* Atomic, Plasma Physics and Applications - APPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APPA summary|url=http://www.fair-center.eu/public/experiment-program/appa-physics.html|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compressed Baryonic Matter - CBM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=CBM Collaboration|title=CBM home page|url=http://www.fair-center.eu/for-users/experiments/cbm.html|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nuclear Structure, Astrophysics and Reactions - NUSTAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NUSTAR Collaboration|title=NUSTAR home page|url=http://www.fair-center.eu/for-users/experiments/nustar.html|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* antiProton ANnihilation at DArmstadt - [[PANDA experiment|PANDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=PANDA Collaboration|title=PANDA home page|url=http://www-panda.gsi.de/|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those are described on the web pages of FAIR (see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned experiments at FAIR|url=http://www.fair-center.eu/public/experiment-program.html|publisher=FAIR|accessdate=12 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and links therein).

==FAIR accelerators==
[[File:Fair-Baustelle-06-03-2013 panorama-stitch.png|thumbnail|800px|center|The FAIR construction area from the far east of the GSI ground (spring 2013). On the left, the tree free circle, will give room for the future heavy ion synchrotron SIS100, middle after the container housing two rotary drilling machines (each 100 tons "light") for the approximately 1400 piles, each max 40m deep and appr. 1,2m in diameter, right of the image the place for the future other accelerators and experimental areas.]]
Beams of protons will be prepared in the proton linear accelerator, p-LINAC, while heavy ions will be prepared in the UNILAC. Both of them will be fed into the SIS18. From there they will be directed into SIS100 (and SIS300 if applicable). Protons will be used either to produce antiproton beams by directing them on a dedicated production target or directly used for experiments within APPA. These antiprotons will be captured and cooled in the Collector Ring, CR (and RESR when available) before being injected into HESR, where they will be utilised within the PANDA experiment. High energetic heavy ions will either be used directly for studies with the CBM or APPA experiments or to produce unstable ion beams. The latter will be produced in the Rare Isotope Production Target and filtered the Super-FRS, where the NUSTAR experiments will take place.

==FAIR partner countries==

Roughly 3,000 scientists from more than 50 countries are already working on the planning of the experiment and accelerator facilities. This project is realised by partners from Finland, France, Germany, India, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia and Sweden that have signed an international treaty, the FAIR Convention, which formally entered into force in March 2014. The UK has joined as first associate member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain signs up to world's hottest nuclear physics project|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/03/britain-hottest-nuclear-physics-project-fair|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further countries, like Italy, are in negotiations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1703">A '''fail-stop''' subset of a [[computer language]] is one that has the same [[formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] as the original, except in the case where an [[exception handling|exceptional condition]] arises.  The fail-stop subset must report an exceptional condition whenever the superset language reports one, but may additionally report an exceptional condition in other cases.

Fail-stop languages are often used in computer systems where [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] is very important, since it is easier to make such systems [[fail-fast]].  For example, the "+" operator in many programming languages is not [[Associativity|associative]] because of the possibility of floating-point [[Arithmetic overflow|overflow]].  Repairing these languages to fail fast when commonly assumed properties do not hold makes it much easier to write and verify correct code.

==Examples==
In many widely used programming languages the code below might reduce the bank account value if the deposited amount or old account value is very large, by causing an overflowed value to be assigned to new_bank_account_value.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
  new_bank_account_value = old_bank_account_value + amount_deposited
  // example calculation with 32-bit signed integers to demonstrate, which overflow above 2,147,483,647
  // -2,147,483,646 = 2,147,483,640 + 10
&lt;/source&gt;

But in a fail-stop language that treats overflow as an exceptional condition, it is either correct, or will terminate with an exceptional condition.

A '''hemiepiphyte''' is a plant that spends part of its life cycle as an [[epiphyte]]. The seeds of primary hemiepiphytes germinate in the canopy and initially live epiphytically.  They send roots downward, and these roots eventually make contact with the ground.  Secondary epiphytes are root-climbers&lt;ref name="Mayo et al. 1998b" /&gt; that begin as rooted vines growing upward from the forest floor, but later break their connection to the ground.&lt;ref name="Kricher"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Kricher |title=Tropical Ecology |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691115139 |pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, they may send down long roots to the ground.&lt;ref name="Mayo et al. 1998b"&gt;Mayo et al. "Araceae" in Kubitzki (1998b ''The families and genera of vascular plants''): "The root climbers and hemiepiphytes normally grow in humid forests, often very high in the canopy. When losing connection with the forest floor, they may send down long roots to the ground; such plants may be referred to as secondary hemiepiphytes. Hemiepiphytes and root climbers cling tightly to the bark of the host with negatively phototropic roots. Skototropism, an orientation movement towards a well-defined dark area, has been observed in ''Monstera tenuis'' and other genera and is an adaptation in juvenile plants for seeking a suitable host tree, following germination on the forest floor."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strangler fig]]s are hemiepiphytic – they may begin life as epiphytes but after making contact with the ground they encircle their host tree and "strangle" it.  This usually results in the death of the host tree, either through [[girdling]] or through competition for light.&lt;ref name="Strangler Fig Rooting Habits and Nutrient Relations in the Llanos of Venezuela"&gt;{{cite journal |last= E.

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviorism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customization]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "magic bullet" or "hypodermic needle theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Commmunication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1197). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

'''The Jewish People Policy Institute''' ('''JPPI'''; {{lang-he|המכון למדיניות העם היהודי}}; formerly: '''The Jewish People Policy Planning (JPPPI)'''), is a [[Non-profit organization]] with the purpose of promoting and securing the [[Jew|Jewish people]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish People Policy Institute|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/jewish_people_policy_institute|publisher=NY-The Jewish Week|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is a professional policy planning apparatus and a strategic thought process for the Jewish people in the most fundamental subjects concerning the Jewish people. The institute is served by most prominent public figures from the government, academia, the private sector in Israel and Jewish communities around the world, who constitute the [[think tank]] of this body.

The JPPI's viewpoint is all-Jewish and long term, and a cornerstone of its work is the premise that Israel is the core of the Jewish people. Its think tank systematically and professionally examines the challenges, threats and opportunities that the Jewish people are coping with, and develops principles for policies and strategic alternatives. In addition, it may recommend on immediate steps needed to be taken in order to secure the continuity and prosperity of the Jewish people.

JPPI was founded in 2002 by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], and is run as an independent body. It is headed by a board of directors that is now chaired by [[Dennis Ross]], the special advisor for the Persian Gulf Southwest Asia in U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration. Its current President is Avinoam Bar-Yosef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conference to discuss Jewish world's budget|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4296104,00.html|accessdate=16 November 2013|newspaper=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kamasutra'' is the oldest surviving Hindu text on erotic love.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xi, Quote: "The Kamasutra is the oldest extant Hindu textbook of erotic love."}} It is a ''sutra''-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different ''bhasya'' (exposition and commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and [[anustubh]]-meter poetry verses. The text acknowledges the Hindu concept of [[Purusharthas]], and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. Its chapters discuss methods for courtship, finding a partner, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xi-xiii}} The majority of the book is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou, ''The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text'', {{ISBN|978-0892815258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Levy (2010), Kama sense marketing, iUniverse, {{ISBN|978-1440195563}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is one of many Indian texts on ''[[Kama Shastra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages. The ''Kamasutra'' has influenced many secondary texts that followed after the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old [[Hindu temples]]. Of these, the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] is a UNESCO world heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240 Khajuraho Group of Monuments] UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the surviving temples in north India, one in [[Rajasthan]] sculpts all the major chapters and sexual positions to illustrate the ''Kamasutra''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/d/019pho0001007s3u00660000.html Ramgarh temple], The British Library&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' became "one of the most pirated books in English language" soon after it was published in 1883 by Richard Burton. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the ''Kamasutra'' because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date, author and history ==

The original composition date or century for the ''Kamasutra'' is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Refractions of Desire, Feminist Perspectives in the Novels of Toni Morrison, Michèle Roberts, and Anita Desai|author=Sengupta, J.|date=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126906291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9Y_tQfm_WgC|page=21|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Keay]], the ''Kama Sutra'' is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India: A History: from the Earliest Civilisations to the Boom of the Twenty-first Century|pages=81–103|author=John Keay|publisher=Grove Press|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUPZt-4yqzQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger who has co-translated ''Kama sutra'' and published many papers on related Hindu texts, the surviving version of the ''Kamasutra'' must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}} The text makes no mention of the [[Gupta Empire]] which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping ancient Indian arts, Hindu culture and economy from the 4th-century through the 6th-century. For these reasons, she dates the ''Kama sutra'' to the second half of the 3rd-century CE.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}}

The place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north or northwest ancient India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now [[Patna]]).{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}} 

Vatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] verse, but little is known about him.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}} Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} He cites the work of others he calls "teachers" and "scholars", and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} Vatsyayana's Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the ''Brihatsamhita'' of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=3-4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Varahamihira|author2=M Ramakrishna Bhat|title=Brhat Samhita of Varahamihira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VR8iriWmzUC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1060-0|pages=720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu tradition has the concept of the ''[[Purusharthas]]'' which outlines "four main goals of life".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life:&lt;ref&gt;[a] A.

Each of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The ''Kamasutra'' belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the ''Ratirahasya'' (called ''Kokashastra'' in some Indian scripts), the ''Anangaranga'', the ''Nagarasarvasva'' and the ''Panchasayaka''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite journal|title= Rethinking the History of the "Kāma" World in Early India| author= Daud Ali| journal= Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1|year= 2011| pages= 1-13| jstor=23884104}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite journal| title= Padmaśrī's "Nāgarasarvasva" and the World of Medieval Kāmaśāstra|author= Daud Ali| journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1| year= 2011| pages= 41-62| jstor= 23884106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha. He makes a passing mention of the fourth aim of life in some verses.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xi-xvi}}

===Vedic heritage===
The earliest foundations of the ''kamasutra'' are found in the [[Vedic era]] literature of Hinduism.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}&lt;ref name="De1969p89"/&gt; Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Shvetaketu Auddalaki as the "first human author of the ''kamasutra''". Auddalaki is an early Upanishadic [[rishi]] (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' such as in section 6.2, and the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}} These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) and the ontological concept of [[Brahman]], these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious ''[[yajna]]'' ritual (sacrificial fire, [[Agni]]) and suffused in spiritual terms:{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}

A fire – that is what a woman is, Gautama.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the ''kamasutra'' began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a ''sutra''-genre text by Vatsyayana.&lt;ref name="De1969p89"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sushil Kumar De|title=Ancient Indian Erotics and Erotic Literature|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NdiHngEACAAJ|year= 1969|publisher= K.L. Mukhopadhyay|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Doniger, this paradigm of celebrating pleasures, enjoyment and sexuality as a ''dharmic'' act began in the "earthy, vibrant text known as the ''[[Rigveda]]''" of the Hindus.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiii}} The ''Kamasutra'' and celebration of sex, eroticism and pleasure is an integral part of the religious milieu in Hinduism and quite prevalent in its temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Erotic Sculptures of India| author= Y. Krishan| journal= Artibus Asiae| volume= 34| number= 4| year= 1972|pages = 331-343| doi= 10.2307/3249625}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xi-xvii}}

===Epics===
Human relationships, sex and emotional fulfillment are a significant part of the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature such as the major Hindu epics: the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''Ramayana''. The ancient Indian view has been, states Johann Meyer, that love and sex are a delightful necessity. Though she is reserved and selective, "a woman stands in very great need of ''surata'' (amorous or sexual pleasure)", and "the woman has a far stronger erotic disposition, her delight is the sexual act is greater than a man's".&lt;ref name="Meyer1953p229"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Jakob Meyer|title=Sexual Life in Ancient India: A Study in the Comparative History of Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izFNswlJ9LMC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Orig: 1953)|isbn=978-81-208-0638-2|pages=229–230, 240–244, context: 229–257 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Kamasutra'' manuscripts have survived in many versions across the Indian subcontinent. While attempting to get a translation of the Sanskrit kama-sastra text ''Anangaranga'' that had already been in widely translated by the Hindus in regional languages such as Marathi, associates of the British Orientalist Richard Burton stumbled into portions of the ''Kamasutra'' manuscript. They commissioned the Sanskrit scholar Bhagvanlal Indraji to locate a complete ''Kamasutra'' manuscript and translate it. Indraji collected variant manuscripts in libraries and temples of Varanasi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Burton published an edited English translation of these manuscripts, but not a [[critical edition]] of the ''Kamasutra'' in Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=614–615}}

According to S.C. Upadhyaya, known for his 1961 scholarly study and a more accurate translation of the ''Kamasutra'', there are issues with the manuscripts that have survived and the text likely underwent revisions over time.&lt;ref name=Upadhyaya1961p52&gt;{{cite book| title= Kama sutra of Vatsyayana Complete translation from the original Sanskrit| author1=Vatsyayana| author2= SC Upadhyaya (transl)| year=1965 | publisher= DB Taraporevala (Orig publication year: 1961) | oclc=150688197|pages=52-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by other 1st-millennium CE Hindu texts on ''kama'' that mention and cite the ''Kamasutra'', but some of these quotations credited to the ''Kamasutra'' by these historic authors "are not to be found in the text of the Kamasutra" that have survived.&lt;ref name=Upadhyaya1961p52/&gt;{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=623–624}}

== Contents ==
Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' states it has 1250 verses, distributed over 36 chapters in 64 sections, organised into 7 books.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxii}} This statement is included in the opening chapter of the text, a common practice in ancient Hindu texts likely included to prevent major and unauthorized expansions of a popular text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxii-xxiii with footnotes}} The text that has survived into the modern era has 67 sections, and this list is enumerated in Book 7 and in Yashodhara's Sanskrit commentary (''[[bhasya]]'') on the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxii-xxiii with footnotes}}

The contents of the treatise explicitly aim to be comprehensive, including everything "good or bad" in Vatsyayana's view. The text does not censor a view or lifestyle, but Vatsyayana does include his own comments on what he approves and disapproves of. He also, states Doniger, remarks that "reflective people should accept only the good".{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxi}}

The ''Kamasutra'' uses a mixture of prose and poetry, and the narration has the form of a dramatic fiction where two characters are called the ''nayaka'' (man) and ''nayika'' (woman), aided by the characters called ''pitamarda'' (libertine), ''vita'' (pander) and ''vidushaka'' (jester). This format follows the teachings found in the Sanskrit classic named the ''[[Natyasastra]]''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xxv-xxvi with footnotes}} The teachings and discussions found in the ''Kamasutra'' extensively incorporate ancient Hindu mythology and legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=H.

Across human cultures, states Michel Foucault, "the truth of sex" has been produced and shared by two processes. One method has been ''ars erotica'' texts, while the other has been the ''scientia sexualis'' literature. The first are typically of the hidden variety and shared by one person to another, between friends or from a master to a student, focusing on the emotions and experience, sans physiology. These bury many of the truths about sex and human sexual nature.&lt;ref name="Foucault2012p57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The History of Sexuality: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwkYO9KveeEC|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-81928-4|pages=57–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} The second are empirical studies of the type found in biology, physiology and medical texts, focusing on the physiology and objective observations, sans emotions.&lt;ref name="Foucault2012p57"/&gt;{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} The ''Kamasutra'' belongs to both camps, states Wendy Doniger. It discusses, in its distilled form, the physiology, the emotions and the experience while citing and quoting prior Sanskrit scholarship on the nature of ''kama''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}

The ''Kamasutra'' is a "[[sutra]]"-genre text consisting of intensely condensed, aphoristic verses. Doniger describes them as a "kind of atomic string (thread) of meanings", which are so cryptic that any translation is more like deciphering and filling in the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} Condensing a text into a sutra-genre religious text form makes it easier to remember and transmit, but it also introduces ambiguity and the need to understand the context of each chapter, its philological roots, as well as the prior literature, states Doniger.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}} However, this method of knowledge preservation and transmission has its foundation in the Vedas, which themselves are cryptic and require a commentator and teacher-guide to comprehend the details and the inter-relationship of the ideas.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} The ''Kamasutra'' too has attracted commentaries, of which the most well known are those of 12th-century{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} or 13th-century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yaśodhara's ''Jayamaṅgalā'' in the Sanskrit language, and of Devadatta Shastri who commented on the original text as well as its commentaries in the Hindi language.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002|pp=xv–xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Wezler|editor1=Madhav Deshpande|editor2=Peter Edwin Hook|title=Indian Linguistic Studies: Festschrift in Honor of George Cardona|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVR0rGVQ8ecC |year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1885-9|pages=316–322 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other Sanskrit commentaries on the ''Kamasutra'', such as the ''Sutra Vritti'' by Narsingha Sastri.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=5-6}} These commentaries on the ''Kamasutra'' cite and quote text from other Hindu texts such as the ''Upanishads'', the ''Arthashastra'', the ''Natyashastra'', the ''Manusmriti'', the ''Nyayasutra'', the ''Markandeya Purana'', the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Nitishastra'' and others to provide the context, per the norms of its literary traditions.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=11-12}} The extant translations of the ''Kamasutra'' typically incorporate these commentaries, states Daniélou.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=6-12}}

In the colonial era marked by sexual censorship, the ''Kamasutra'' became famous as a pirated and underground text for its explicit description of sex positions. The stereotypical image of the text is one where erotic pursuit with sexual intercourse include improbable contortionist forms.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p20/&gt; In reality, according to Doniger, the ''real Kamasutra'' is much more and is a book about "the art of living", about understanding one's body and a partner's body, finding a partner and emotional connection, marriage, the power equation over time in intimate relationships, the nature of adultery and drugs along with many simple to complex variations in sex positions to explore. It is also a psychological treatise that presents the effect of desire and pleasure on human behavior.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p20&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016 |publisher =Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=20-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adultery===
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
The ''Kamasutra'', states the Indologist and Sanskrit literature scholar [[Ludo Rocher]], discourages adultery but then devotes "not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (''karana'') for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman". Vatsyayana mentions different types of ''nayikas'' (urban girls) such as unmarried virgins, those married and abandoned by husband, widow seeking remarriage and courtesans, then discusses their kama/sexual education, rights and mores.&lt;ref name="Rocher1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rocher|first1=Ludo|title=The Kāmasūtra: Vātsyāyana's Attitude toward Dharma and Dharmaśāstra|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=105|issue=3| year=1985|pages= 521|doi=10.2307/601526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In childhood, [[Vātsyāyana]] says, a person should learn how to make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass, one should concentrate on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Same-sex relationships===
The ''Kamasutra'' includes verses describing homosexual relations such as oral sex between two men, as well as between two women.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=9-10}} Lesbian relations are extensively covered in Chapters 5 and 8 in Book 2 of the text.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=169-177}}

According to Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' discusses same-sex relationships through the notion of the ''tritiya prakriti'', literally, "third sexuality" or "third nature". In ''Redeeming the Kamasutra,'' Doniger states that "the Kamasutra departs from the dharmic view of homosexuality in significant ways", where the term ''kliba'' appears. In contemporary translations, this has been inaccurately rendered as "eunuch" – or, a castrated man in a harem, a practice that started in India after the arrival of Turkish Sultans.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word ''Kliba'' found in older Indian texts refers to a "man who does not act like a man", typically in a pejorative sense. The ''Kamasutra'' does not use the pejorative term ''kliba'' at all, but speaks instead of a "third nature" or, in the sexual behavior context as the "third sexuality".&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"/&gt; 

The text states that there are two sorts of "third nature", one where a man behaves like a woman, and in the other, a woman behaves like a man. In one of the longest consecutive sets of verses describing a sexual act, the ''Kamasutra'' describes fellatio technique between a man dressed like a woman performing fellatio on another man.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p114"/&gt; The text also mentions same-sex behavior between two women, such as a girl losing her virginity with a girlfriend as they use their fingers,&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as oral sex and the use of sex toys between women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davesh Soneji|editor=Yudit Kornberg Greenberg|title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC |year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-980-1|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Svairini'', a term Danielou translates as a lesbian,{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=48, 171-172}} is described in the text as a woman who lives a conjugal life with another woman or by herself fending for herself, not interested in a husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P.P. Mishra|editor=Yudit Kornberg Greenberg|title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC |year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-980-1|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the text has some fleeting remarks on bisexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p120"/&gt;

The historical records suggest that the ''Kamasutra'' was a well-known and popular text in Indian history, states [[Wendy Doniger]]. This popularity through the [[Mughal Empire]] era is confirmed by its regional translations. The Mughals, states Doniger, had "commissioned lavishly illustrated Persian and Sanskrit ''Kamasutra'' manuscripts".&lt;ref name="Doniger2016p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English translation of the ''Kama Sutra'' was privately printed in 1883 by the Orientalist Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. He did not translate it, but did edit it to suit the Victorian British attitudes. The unedited translation was produced by the Indian scholar [[Bhagwan Lal Indraji]] with the assistance of a student Shivaram Parshuram Bhide, under the guidance of Burton's friend, the Indian civil servant [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref&gt;McConnachie (2007), pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, the Burton version is a "flawed English translation" but influential as modern translators and abridged versions of ''Kamasutra'' even in the Indian languages such as Hindi are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"&gt;[a] [https://lithub.com/redeeming-the-kamasutra/ Sir Richard Burton’s Version of the Kamasutra], Wendy Doniger, ''Literary Hub'' (March 11, 2016);&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Against Dharma: Dissent in the Ancient Indian Sciences of Sex and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBNDwAAQBAJ |year=2018|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21619-6|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Burton version of the ''Kamasutra'' was produced in an environment where Victorian mindset and Protestant proselytizers were busy finding faults and attacking Hinduism and its culture, rejecting as "filthy paganism" anything sensuous and sexual in Hindu arts and literature. The "Hindus were cowering under their scorn", states Doniger, and the open discussion of sex in the ''Kamasutra'' scandalized the 19th-century Europeans.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; The Burton edition of the ''Kamasutra'' was illegal to publish in England and the United States till 1962. Yet, states Doniger, it became soon after its publication in 1883, "one of the most pirated books in the English language", widely copied, reprinted and republished sometimes without even Richard Burton's name.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt;

Burton made two important contributions to the ''Kamasutra''. First, he had the courage to publish it in the colonial era against the political and cultural mores of the British elite. He creatively found a way to subvert the then prevalent censorship laws of Britain under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Translating/'The' "Kama Sutra"| author= Ben Grant|journal = Third World Quarterly| volume= 26|number= 3| year= 2005| pages= 509-510| publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|jstor=  3993841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Burton created a fake publishing house named ''The Kama Shastra Society of London and Benares'' (Benares = [[Varanasi]]), with the declaration that it is "for private circulation only".&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; The second major contribution was to edit it in a major way, by changing words and rewriting sections to make it more acceptable to the general British public. For example, the original Sanskrit ''Kamasutra'' does not use the words [[lingam]] or [[yoni]] for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms. Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to "anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away."&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=499-505|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Burton used the terms [[lingam]] and [[yoni]] for human sexual organs, terms that actually mean a lot more in Sanskrit texts and its meaning depends on the context. However, Burton's ''Kamasutra'' gave a unique, specific meaning to these words in the western imagination.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; 

The problems with Burton mistranslation are many, states Doniger. First, the text "simply does not say what Burton says it says".&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Second, it "robs women of their voices, turning direct quotes into indirect quotes, thus losing the force of the dialogue that animates the work and erasing the vivid presence of the many women who speak in the Kamasutra". Third, it changes the force of words in the original text. For example, when a woman says "Stop!" or "Let me go!" in the original text of Vatsyayana, Burton changed it to "She continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, or desire of liberation", states Doniger, and thus misconstrues the context and intent of the original text.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt; Similarly, while the original ''Kamasutra'' acknowledges that "women have strong privileges", Burton erased these passages and thus eroded women's agency in ancient India in the typical Orientialist manner that dehumanized the Indian culture.&lt;ref name="Doniger2018p164"/&gt;&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt;

In 1961, S. C. Upadhyaya published his translation as the ''Kamasutra of Vatsyayana: Complete Translation from the Original''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Kama sutra of Vatsyayana Complete translation from the original Sanskrit| author1=Vatsyayana| author2= SC Upadhyaya (transl)| year=1965 | publisher= DB Taraporevala (Orig publication year: 1961) | oclc=150688197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jyoti Puri, it is considered among the best-known scholarly English-language translations of the ''Kamasutra'' in post-independent India.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=607}}

Other translations include those by [[Alain Daniélou]] (''The Complete Kama Sutra'' in 1994)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaindanielou.org/The-Complete-Kama-Sutra.html ''The Complete Kama Sutra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506045738/http://www.alaindanielou.org/The-Complete-Kama-Sutra.html |date=6 May 2008 }} by Alain Daniélou.&lt;/ref&gt; This translation, originally into French, and thence into English, featured the original text attributed to [[Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana]], along with a medieval and a modern commentary.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993}} Unlike the 1883 version, Daniélou's new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original, and does not incorporate notes in the text. He includes English translations of two important commentaries, one by Jayamangala commentary, and a more modern commentary by Devadatta Shastri, as [[endnote]]s.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993}} Wendy Doniger questions the accuracy of Daniélou's translation, stating that he has freely reinterpreted the ''Kamasutra'' while disregarding the gender that is implicit in the Sanskrit words. He, at times, reverses the object and subject, making the woman the subject and man the object when the ''Kamasutra'' is explicitly stating the reverse. According to Doniger,  "even this cryptic text [''Kamasutra''] is not infinitely elastic" and such creative reinterpretations do not reflect the text.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xxxvi-xxxvii with footnotes}}

A translation by [[Indra Sinha]] was published in 1980. In the early 1990s, its chapter on sexual positions began circulating on the internet as an independent text and today is often assumed to be the whole of the ''Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sexual embraces, not in this text,

these, too, may be used for love-making,

Indira Kapoor, a director of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, states that the ''Kamasutra'' is a treatise on human sexual behavior and an ancient attempt to seriously study sexuality among other things. According to Kapoor, quotes Jyoti Puri, the attitude of contemporary Indians is markedly different, with misconceptions and expressions of embarrassment, rather than curiosity and pride, when faced with texts such as ''Kamasutra'' and amorous and erotic arts found in Hindu temples.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=605}} ''Kamasutra'', states Kapoor, must be viewed as a means to discover and improve the "self-confidence and understanding of their bodies and feelings".{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|p=605}}

The ''Kamasutra'' has been a popular reference to erotic ancient literature. In the Western media, such as in the American women's magazine ''[[Redbook]]'', the Kamasutra is described as "Although it was written centuries ago, there's still no better sex handbook, which details hundreds of positions, each offering a subtle variation in pleasure to men and women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lamar Graham|year=1995| title= A Love Map to His Body|journal = Redbook|issue=May|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jyoti Puri, who has published a review and feminist critique of the text, states that the "''Kamasutra'' is frequently appropriated as indisputable evidence of a non-Western and tolerant, indeed celebratory, view of sexuality" and for "the belief that the ''Kamasutra'' provides a transparent glimpse into the positive, even exalted, view of sexuality".{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=604, 606–608}} However, according to Puri, this is a colonial and anticolonial modernist interpretation of the text. These narratives neither resonate with nor provide the "politics of gender, race, nationality and class" in ancient India published by other historians and that may have been prevalent then.{{sfn|Jyoti Puri|2002|pp=633-634}}

According to Wendy Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' is a "great cultural masterpiece", one which can inspire contemporary Indians to overcome "self-doubts and rejoice" in their ancient heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3790">'''[[Immanuel Kant]]'s antinomies''', from the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', are contradictions which he believed follow necessarily from our attempts to conceive the nature of transcendent reality.

Kant thought that certain of his antinomies (God and Freedom) could be resolved as "Postulates of Practical Reason". He used them to describe the equally rational-but-contradictory results of applying the universe of pure thought to the categories or criteria, i.e. applying reason proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena). [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

==Overview==
Kant's antinomies are four: two "mathematical" and two "dynamical". They are connected with (1) the limitation of the universe in respect of space and time, (2) the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist), (3) the problem of free will in relation to universal causality, and (4) the existence of a necessary being.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (1911), Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two antinomies are dubbed "mathematical" antinomies, presumably because in each case we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to be sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and space and time. The second two are dubbed "dynamical" antinomies, presumably because the proponents of the thesis are not committing themselves solely to claims about spatio-temporal objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Al-Azm, ''The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies'', Oxford University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, ''Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion'', Cambridge University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, "The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies," in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE:  Kant himself did not use the plural term, "antinomies," but only the singular term, "Antinomy," as the logical status of a species of metaphysical argument.   There is Antinomy, and Kant argued in detail regarding four cases of Antinomy in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] (1780).

==The mathematical antinomies==
===The first antinomy (of space and time)===
*Thesis:
**The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited as regards space.
*Anti-thesis:
**The world has no beginning, and no limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time and space.

===The second antinomy (of atomism)===
*Thesis:
**Every composite substance in the world is made up of simple parts, and nothing anywhere exists save the simple or what is composed of the simple.
*Anti-thesis:
**No composite thing in the world is made up of simple parts, and there nowhere exists in the world anything simple.

==The dynamical antinomies==
===The third antinomy (of spontaneity and causal determinism)===
*Thesis:
**Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can one and all be derived. To explain these appearances it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of Spontaneity.
*Anti-thesis:
**There is no Spontaneity; everything in the world takes place solely in accordance with laws of nature.

===The fourth antinomy (of necessary being or not)===
*Thesis:
**There belongs to the world, either as its part or as its cause, a being that is absolutely necessary.
*Anti-thesis:
**An absolutely necessary being nowhere exists in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause.

The '''Kazimierz Palace''' ({{lang-pl|Pałac Kazimierzowski}}) is a [[Reconstruction (architecture)|rebuilt]] palace in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It is adjacent to the [[Royal Route, Warsaw|Royal Route]], at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście|Krakowskie Przedmieście 26/28]]''.

Originally built in 1637-41, it was first rebuilt in 1660 for King [[John II Casimir]] ({{lang-pl|Jan II Kazimierz Waza}}, from whom it takes its name) and again in 1765-68, by [[Domenico Merlini]], for the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Corps of Cadets]] established by King [[Stanisław II Augustus]].

Since 1816, the Kazimierz Palace has served intermittently as the seat of [[Warsaw University]] (which was closed by the [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] authorities after each Uprising on the part of their Polish subjects, and in 1939-44 by [[Nazi Germany|the Germans]]).

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Zygmunt Kazimierz Waza.png|thumb|left|upright|Prince Zygmunt Kazimierz Vasa in the palace's [[loggia]], facing the [[Vistula River]], 1644]]
[[File:POL Warsaw Villa Regia 1656.jpg|thumb|''Villa Regia'' ("Royal Villa"), 1656]]

The Kazimierz Palace was erected in 1637-41 for King [[Władysław IV]] in the [[Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland|mannerist]]-early [[Baroque]] style as a ''[[villa suburbana]]'' ([[suburb]]an [[villa]]) christened the ''Villa Regia'' ([[Latin]] for  "Royal Villa"), to the design of Italian architect [[Giovanni Trevano]].&lt;ref name= warszawa&gt;{{cite web  |author =  |url = http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=uniwersytet_palac&amp;r3=0 |title = Pałac Kazimierzowski, Villa Regia |work = warszawa1939.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2008-02-17|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= lileyko&gt;{{cite book | first= Jerzy |last= Lileyko | title = Życie codzienne w Warszawie za Wazów |trans-title= Everyday Life in Warsaw under the Vasas | year =1984 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = | location =Warsaw | isbn =83-06-01021-3 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed as a rectangular building with corner towers, a type of residence known as ''Poggio–Reale - Serlio'' after the [[Poggio Reale (villa)|Villa Poggio Reale]] in Naples.

The ''Villa Regia'' had a magnificent [[loggia]] at its garden facade, with a wonderful view of the [[Vistula River]] and its opposite, [[Praga]] bank. It had four [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]]s and two gardens — a [[flower garden]] at the front, and a [[botanical garden]] at the rear. Both gardens were adorned with sculptures that had been procured by royal architect Agostino Locci. Some had been purchased in [[Florence]] for 7,000 [[Dutch gulden|guldens]], others had been produced in [[Prague]] by [[Adrien de Vries]].&lt;ref name= kieniewicz&gt;{{cite book | author = | coauthors = | title = Warszawa w latach 1526–1795| trans-title= Warsaw in 1526–1795 | year = 1984 | editor-first = Stefan| editor-last= Kieniewicz | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = | location =Warsaw | isbn = 8301033231 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Adam Jarzębski]], they had included a ''[[Hercules]] Fighting the [[Centaur]] [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]'' and a ''Horse Bitten by a Snake''.&lt;ref name= lileyko /&gt; Another feature of the gardens was a large arbor where initially the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] royal painter Christian Melich had his studio, but which was later selected by Queen [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Marie Louise Gonzaga]] as the venue for her [[literary salon]].

The palace had rich furnishings, with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-style gilded ceilings (surviving  examples of such ceilings in Poland may be seen at the [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop's Palace]] in [[Kielce]]) and brown [[Chęciny]] and black [[Dębnik, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Dębnik]] [[marble]] [[portal (architecture)|portal]]s. In the 1650s, sculptor Giovanni Francesco Rossi created profuse [[Baroque|Roman-Baroque]]-style [[marble]] decorations, with busts of [[Roman emperors]] and of King [[John II Casimir]] and Queen [[Ludwika Maria Gonzaga|Marie Louise Gonzaga]] (today displayed at [[Gripsholm Castle]] in Sweden).&lt;ref name= kieniewicz /&gt; These decorations were so precious that during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish Deluge]] [[King of Sweden|Sweden's King]] [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] ordered the very window frames pulled out and transported to Sweden.&lt;ref name= kieniewicz /&gt;

The ''Villa Regia'' had a large concert hall, decorated with an oil-painted [[plafond]] depicting [[St. Cecilia]], [[patron saint]] of music and of Queen [[Cecilia Renata of Austria|Cecila Renata]], where the Royal Cappella Vasa gave frequent concerts, and a large collection of ancient sculptures which would be plundered during the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], and taken to Berlin;&lt;ref name= lileyko /&gt;&lt;ref name= kieniewicz /&gt; while the garden sculptures were taken to Sweden.&lt;ref name= lileyko /&gt; Then, having been plundered, the palace was burned.

[[File:POL Pałac Kazmierzowski Warsaw.jpg|thumb|[[:pl:Aleksander Józef Sułkowski|Sułkowski]]'s palace]]
Following the devastations wrought by the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], the ''Villa Regia'' was rebuilt twice, in 1652 and 1660, to designs by Izydor Affait or Titus Livius Burattini, and came to be called the "Kazimierz Palace" for King [[John II Casimir]], who favored it as a residence.&lt;ref name= warszawa /&gt;

Abandoned in 1667, the palace later became the property of King [[John III Sobieski]]. In 1695, the building was totally destroyed by fire.

===Rebuilding===
About 1724, the property's ownership was transferred to King [[Augustus II]].  In this period were constructed an entrance gate at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' and eight [[barracks]] set perpendicularly to the palace façade.
[[File:Vogel Cadets Palace.jpg|thumb|[[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Corps of Cadets]], 1785]]

In 1735, the palace became the property of Count [[:pl:Aleksander Józef Sułkowski|Aleksander Józef Sułkowski]].  A [[brickworks]], a stove  factory and a [[brewery]] were established here, and in 1737-39 he rebuilt the palace, probably to a [[rococo]] design by Johann Sigmund Deybel and [[Joachim Daniel von Jauch]]. The palace was enlarged and covered with [[mansard roof]]s. The central portion of the building was adorned with a bulbous top bearing a clock and an eagle.&lt;ref name= kieniewicz /&gt;

In 1765, ownership was transferred to King [[Stanisław II August]], who located the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Corps of Cadets]] here following interior redesigns by [[Domenico Merlini]]. From 1769, the famous newspaper sponsored by the King, the ''[[Monitor (Polish newspaper)|Monitor]]'', was printed in an establishment housed in an outbuilding of the palace.  On April 5, 1769, the patriotic play ''Junak'' was presented on a Cadet Corps stage in the palace.&lt;ref name= kieniewicz /&gt;

In 1794, after the suppression of the [[Kościuszko Uprising]], the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Corps of Cadets]] was closed down.

===Warsaw University===
[[File:6 Warszawa 184.jpg|thumb|left|Kazimierz Palace, 2006]]
In 1814, a fire destroyed the barracks before the palace, and in 1816 their place was taken initially by two side [[pavilion]]s designed by [[Jakub Kubicki]].  That same year, the palace became the seat of [[Warsaw University]]. Concurrently, in 1817-31, it also housed the [[Warsaw Lyceum]], a secondary school where [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s father taught [[French language|French]] and whose alumni included young Chopin himself.

The years 1818-22 saw expansion by two pavilions parallel to ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'', designed by Michał Kado. In 1824, the palace was thoroughly rebuilt in the [[classicist]] style to the design probably of Hilary Szpilowski and Wacław Ritschel.  About 1820, two further pavilions, a northern and a southern one, arose at the palace building itself.
[[File:Kazimierz Palace, Warsaw University 4.JPG|thumb|Plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s Kazimierz Palace, commemorating 1866–68 student [[Bolesław Prus]]]]

In 1840-41, the next pavilion was built, designed by [[Antonio Corazzi]], originally to be a secondary school and later serving as the seat of the "Main School" (i.e., [[Warsaw University]]).  About 1863, the pavilions were rebuilt to designs by Antoni Sulimowski.

In 1891-94, in the yard between the palace and the ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' gate, a [[library]] building was erected to a design by Antoni Jabłoński-Jasieńczyk and Stefan Szyller, and in 1910 a new ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' gate was built. In 1929-31, the library building was rebuilt, and in 1930, the ''Auditorium Maximum'' building was erected to a design by Aleksander Bojemski. 

During World War II, the Kazimierz Palace was destroyed, along with other [[Warsaw University]] buildings. It suffered during both the 1939 defense of Warsaw and the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. After the war, in 1945-54, the palace was rebuilt to a design by Piotr Biegański. The reconstruction of the whole campus was finally completed in 1960.

The Kazimierz Palace currently houses the Warsaw University [[Rector (academia)|rectorate]], as well as the Museum of the History of Warsaw University.  Since the building's revitalization in 2006 (partly with [[European Union]] funds), the building is one of the most attractive on Warsaw's [[Royal Route, Warsaw|Royal Route]].

'''Polymorphism''' in biophysics is the ability of [[lipid]]s to aggregate in a variety of ways, giving rise to structures of different shapes, known as "phases".  This can be in the form of spheres of lipid molecules ([[micelle]]s), pairs of layers that face one another (lamellar phase, observed in biological systems as a lipid [[bilayer]]), a tubular arrangement ([[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]), or various [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] phases (Fd3m, Im3m, Ia3m, Pn3m, and Pm3m being those discovered so far).  More complicated aggregations have also been observed, such as [[rhombohedral]], [[tetragonal]] and [[orthorhombic]] phases.

It forms an important part of current academic research in the fields of [[membrane biophysics]] (polymorphism), [[biochemistry]] (biological impact) and [[organic chemistry]] (synthesis).

Determination of the topology of a lipid system is possible by a number of methods, the most reliable of which is [[x-ray diffraction]].  This uses a beam of x-rays that are scattered by the sample, giving a diffraction pattern as a set of rings.  The ratio of the distances of these rings from the central point indicates which phase(s) are present.

The structural phase of the aggregation is influenced by the ratio of lipids present, temperature, hydration, pressure and ionic strength (and type).

==Hexagonal phases==
{{main|Hexagonal phase}}

In lipid polymorphism, if the packing ratio{{clarify|date=January 2015}} of lipids is greater or less than one, lipid membranes can form two separate hexagonal phases, or nonlamellar phases, in which long, tubular aggregates form according to the environment in which the lipid is introduced.

===Hexagonal I phase (H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;)===

This phase is favored in detergent-in-water solutions and has a packing ratio of less than one. The micellar population in a detergent/water mixture cannot increase without limit as the detergent to water ratio increases. In the presence of low amounts of water, lipids that would normally form micelles will form larger aggregates in the form of micellar tubules in order to satisfy the requirements of the hydrophobic effect.  These aggregates can be thought of as micelles that are fused together. These tubes have the polar head groups facing out, and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains facing the interior. This phase is only seen under unique, specialized conditions, and most likely is not relevant for biological membranes.

===Hexagonal II phase (H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;)===

Lipid molecules in the HII phase pack inversely to the packing observed in the hexagonal I phase described above. This phase has the polar head groups on the inside and the hydrophobic, hydrocarbon tails on the outside in solution. The packing ratio for this phase is larger than one&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Marc &amp; Boekema, Egbert. (2007). Two distinct mechanisms of vesicle-to-micelle and micelle-to-vesicle transition are mediated by the packing parameter of phospholipid–detergent systems, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6124701_Two_distinct_mechanisms_of_vesicle-to-micelle_and_micelle-to-vesicle_transition_are_mediated_by_the_packing_parameter_of_phospholipid-detergent_systems#pf9&lt;/ref&gt;, which is synonymous with an inverse cone packing.

Extended arrays of long tubes will form (as in the hexagonal I phase), but because of the way the polar head groups pack, the tubes take the shape of aqueous channels.  These arrays can stack together like pipes. This way of packing may leave a finite hydrophobic surface in contact with water on the outside of the array. However, the otherwise energetically favorable packing apparently stabilizes this phase as a whole. It is also possible that an outer monolayer of lipid coats the surface of the collection of tubes to protect the hydrophobic surface from interaction with the aqueous phase.

It is suggested that this phase is formed by lipids in solution in order to compensate for the hydrophobic effect. The tight packing of the lipid head groups reduces their contact with the aqueous phase. This, in turn, reduces the amount of ordered, but unbound water molecules. 
The most common lipids that form this phase include phospatidylethanolamine (PE), when it has unsaturated hydrocarbon chains. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG, otherwise known as cardiolipin) in the presence of calcium is also capable of forming this phase.

===Techniques for detection===
There are several techniques used to map out which phase is present during perturbations done on the lipid. These perturbations include pH changes, temperature changes, pressure changes, volume changes, etc.

The most common technique used to study phospholipid phase presence is phosphorus [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (31P NMR). In this technique, different and unique powder diffraction patterns are observed for lamellar, hexagonal, and isotropic phases. Other techniques that are used and do offer definitive evidence of existence of lamellar and hexagonal phases include freeze-fracture electron microscopy, [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC), and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (2H NMR).

Additionally, [[negative stain]]ing transmission electron microscopy has been shown as a useful tool to study [[lipid bilayer phase behavior]] and polymorphism into ''[[lamellar phase]], micellar, [[unilamellar liposome]], and hexagonal aqueous-lipid structures'', in aqueous dispersions of [[membrane lipids]].&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of thylakoid membrane lipids by sucrose. ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'' vol. 1212(1), pp. 129-133.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15042978_Destabilisation_of_lamellar_dispersion_of_thylakoid_membrane_lipids_by_sucrose?ev=prf_pub&lt;/ref&gt; As water-soluble negative stain is excluded from the [[hydrophobic]] part (fatty acyl chains) of lipid aggregates, the [[hydrophilic]] headgroup portions of the lipid aggregates stain dark and clearly mark the outlines of the lipid aggregates (see figure).

'''Logic''' (from the {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λογική|λογική]]|logikḗ}}&lt;ref name="argumentative"/&gt;), originally meaning "the word" or "what is spoken", but coming to mean "thought" or "reason", is a subject concerned with the most general laws of [[truth]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to Frege, see the [[Definitions of logic]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the [[Logical form|form]] of [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[inference]]. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its [[consequent|conclusion]]. (In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as ''therefore'', ''hence'', ''ergo'', and so on.)

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see {{section link||Rival conceptions}}, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of [[inference]], including [[fallacies]], and the study of [[semantics]], including [[paradox]]es.  Historically, logic has been studied in [[philosophy]] (since ancient times) and [[mathematics]] (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and other fields.

==Concepts==
{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], "First Rule of Logic"}}
The concept of [[logical form]] is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional [[syllogism|Aristotelian syllogistic logic]] and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.
* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[Logical argument|arguments]]. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See 'Rival conceptions', below.
* '''[[Mathematical formalism|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.&lt;ref name="The Basic Works"/&gt; In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.
* '''[[Mathematical logic#Symbolic logic|Symbolic logic]]''' is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].
* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[recursion theory]].

However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'".&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, [[Joseph Goguen|J. A. Goguen]], R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical form===
{{main article|Logical form}}
Logic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the [[universal quantifier]] ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".&lt;ref name="Aristotle's syllogistic from the standpoint of modern formal logic"/&gt; According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the "matter" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.

=== Semantics ===
{{main article|Semantics of logic}}

The validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.

Aristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[On Interpretation]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition Theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus "every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand." &lt;ref&gt;''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the [[Port Royal Logic]], says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, 1690.  [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], IV. v. 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.

Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".

===Inference===
''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.

===Logical systems===
{{main article|Formal system}}
A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:
* '''[[Consistency proof|Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, Merrie 2009"/&gt;
* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.
* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.
* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound  when it is both valid and its premises are true).&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

===Logic and rationality===
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}
As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.

There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],&lt;ref name=abduction&gt;On [[abductive reasoning]], see:

* Bunt, H. &amp; Black, W. ''Abduction, Belief and Context in Dialogue: Studies in Computational Pragmatics''. (Natural Language Processing, 1.) John Benjamins, Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2000. vi. 471 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|90-272-4983-0}}, {{ISBN|1556197942}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) first introduced the term as "guessing".&lt;ref name=guess&gt;See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:
* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.
* "PAP" ["Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319–320.
* A Letter to F. A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from an observed surprising circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to abduce &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; involves determining that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.

===Rival conceptions===
{{Main article|Rival conceptions of logic}}
Logic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic "does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations."&lt;ref name="stanford-logic-onthology"/&gt;

Logic has been defined{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as "the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form".  This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.&lt;ref name="brandom-2000" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{Main article|History of logic}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384–322&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]
In Europe, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mtu"/&gt; Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; as well as influential terms such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicables]], [[syllogisms]] and [[proposition]]s. In [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.

The [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325–250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two."&lt;ref name="propositions"/&gt; In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].

In India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number", as well as the theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].&lt;ref name="Indian logic: a reader"/&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.

The [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[Gödel]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.

The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and [[Wittgenstein]] had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.

===Syllogistic logic===
{{main article|Aristotelian logic}}
[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]

The ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.

Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.

Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.

{{Quotation|I was upset. I had always believed logic was a universal weapon, and now I realized how its validity depended on the way it was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Name of the Rose|last=Eco|first=Umberto|publisher=Vintage|year=1980|isbn=9780099466031|location=London|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Propositional logic===
{{main article|Propositional calculus}}
A propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as "theorems".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.

===Predicate logic===
[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that &lt;math&gt;\forall x. F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true.]]
{{main article|Predicate logic}}
Predicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], "there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves" can be formalised by the sentence &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{man}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{man}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;, using the non-logical predicate &lt;math&gt;\text{man}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation &lt;math&gt;\text{shaves}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].

Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.

The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytical philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].

Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Modal logic===
{{main article|Modal logic}}
In languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, "''We go to the games''" can be modified to give "''We should go to the games''", and "''We can go to the games''" and perhaps "''We will go to the games''". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].

===Informal reasoning and dialectic===
{{main article|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}
The motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].

This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809|date=1978|journal=Informal Logic|volume=1|issue=#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jacquette, Dale|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|publisher=Ontos Verlag|isbn=3110329050}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.

[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].

===Mathematical logic===
{{main article|Mathematical logic}}
Mathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

The earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle"/&gt; Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.&lt;ref name="Prior Analytics"/&gt;

One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s.

Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic5"/&gt; Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.

If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.

[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity"/&gt; Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6"/&gt;

===Philosophical logic===
{{main article|Philosophical logic}}
[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|("natural") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday&lt;!--was: "normal" proper--&gt; reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called "logic" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).

Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Epistemology and Cognition|first=Alvin I.|last=Goldman|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780674258969|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&amp;pg=PA293|quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development|volume=106|series=Advances in Psychology|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Demetriou|editor2-first=A.|editor2-last=Efklides|publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn=9780080867601|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&amp;pg=PA194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational logic===
{{main article|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]
Logic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt Gödel]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.

Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:
* Section F.3 on [[Logics and meanings of programs]] and F.4 on [[Mathematical logic and formal languages]] as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];
* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on [[Arithmetic and logic structures]], relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];
* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].

Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.

===Non-classical logic===
{{Main article|Non-classical logic}}
The logics discussed above are all "[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]" or "two-valued"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].

Hegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that "neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself".&lt;ref name="philosophical"/&gt;

In 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.&lt;ref name="Brenner2008"/&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, "possible", so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9781118053072|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of "degrees of truth", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].

[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.

==Controversies==
==="Is Logic Empirical?"===
{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}
What is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]"&lt;ref name="Is Logic Empirical?"/&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"/&gt;

Another paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.&lt;ref name="Truth and Other Enigmas"/&gt; Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, "Is Logic Empirical?" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].

===Implication: Strict or material===
{{main article|Paradoxes of material implication}}
The notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of "if&amp;nbsp;... then&amp;nbsp;...", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].

The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].

The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus "if that man gets elected, granny will die" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.

===Tolerating the impossible===
{{main article|Paraconsistent logic}}
[[Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.

Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.&lt;ref name="stanford7"/&gt;{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}

===Rejection of logical truth===
The philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a "...&amp;nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short&amp;nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="nietzsche"/&gt; His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that "logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished".&lt;ref name="nietzsche8"/&gt; Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: "Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world".&lt;ref name="nietzsche9"/&gt;

This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name="nietzsche10"/&gt; [[Georg Lukács]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, "Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with "He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|year=1945|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/|page=762|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|220px|thumb|right|"It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things."&lt;br/&gt;- [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], ''[[The Prince]]'']]

In [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], '''Machiavellian intelligence''' is the capacity of an entity to be in a successful [[political science|political]] engagement with [[social group]]s. The first introduction of this concept to [[primatology]] came from [[Frans de Waal]]'s book "Chimpanzee Politics" (1982), which described social maneuvering while explicitly quoting [[Machiavelli]]. Also known as '''machiavellianism''', it is the art of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] in which others are socially manipulated in a way that benefits the user.

==Machiavellian behaviors==
Machiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by [[behavior]]s including:
*[[blame|Blaming]] and [[forgiveness]];
*[[lie|Lying]] and [[truth|truth-telling]];
*Making and breaking [[Political alliance|alliances]];
*Making and breaking [[promise]]s;
*Making and breaking [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s;
*[[Misleading]] and misdirection.

==Criticisms==
===Food and nutrient factors===
The claim that large brains are linked to large social groups in [[primate]]s and [[cetacean]]s, on which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis is based, is criticized by a number of researchers for overlooking the availability of food as a common limiting factor for brain size and social group size. Among primates as well as cetaceans, there are some opportunistic species that eat most types of food and other species that are specialised in particular types of food, as well as differences in the overall availability of food between different geographical regions in which the animals live. Some critics of Machiavellian intelligence argue that species that have to keep their use of nutrients down due to food poverty or specialisation in a rare type of food lowers average brain size for species that live in smaller groups, making big brains falsely appear to be linked to large groups due to the common causes of opportunistic foraging for nutritious food and a rich supply of food. These critics also cite that the "exceptions" in the form of small-brained primates in very large groups typically eat abundant but nutrient-poor foods (such as [[gelada]]s that eat grass), as predicted by the food-based model, and argue that the higher individual need for nutrients put on by large brains causes groups to become smaller if the species have the same degree of digestive specialisation and environmental availability of food.&lt;ref&gt;Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not sociality - 2017, Alex R. DeCasien, Scott A. Williams &amp; James P. Higham https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0112 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evolution: Eating away at the social brain, Chris Venditti https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0122 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism that relates to food regards the assumption that modern [[hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] are living in marginal environments displaced by [[agriculture|farming peoples]] and that people in [[paleolithic]] times supposedly lived in larger social groups than hunters and gatherers do today. The researchers who put forward that criticism cite observations that hunters and gatherers often trade with farmers who live nearby and/or steal food from them, opportunities that were not available before agriculture was invented. The critics therefore argue that our prehistoric ancestors before agriculture lived in even smaller groups than hunters and gatherers do today, in groups smaller than those of the most opportunistic non-human apes as a result of the greater requirement for nutrients in human brains.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter-Gatherers: An Interdisciplinary Perspective - 2001 edition, Catherine Panter-Brick, Robert H. Layton, Peter Rowley-Conwy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barely Surviving or More than Enough?: The environmental archaeology of subsistence, specialisation and surplus food production - 2013, Maaike Groot, Daphne Lentjes, Jørn Zeiler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex social groups without intelligence===
Some researchers criticize the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis from observations of [[social insect]]s that form societies that are organized and yet have very small brains. Some of these insects, such as [[Jack jumper ant|Jack jumpers]] and [[paper wasp]]s have hierarchical societies in which each individual treat every other in accordance with their status, as opposed to the disorganized herds as which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis depict social animals with small brains.&lt;ref&gt;Ants at Work: How an Insect Society is Organized - 1999, Deborah M. Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insects, Science &amp; Society - 2012, David Pimentel&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term refers to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513) and to the hypothesis that the techniques which lead to certain kinds of political [[wikt:success|success]] within large [[social group]]s are also applicable within smaller groups, including the [[family|family-unit]]. The term "everyday politics" was later introduced in reference to these various methods. These arguments are based on research by primatologists such as [[Nicholas Humphrey]] (1975).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21473">'''Material culture''' is the physical aspect of [[culture]] in the objects and [[architecture]] that surround people. It includes usage, consumption, creation, and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms, and rituals that the objects create or take part in. Some scholars also include other intangible [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] that include sound, smell and events,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Material Culture of Multilingualism|last=Aronin|first=Larissa|last2=Hornsby|first2=Michael|last3=Kiliańska-Przybyło|first3=Grażyna|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319911038|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some even consider language as part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture|last=Kieschnick|first=John|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=0691096759|location=Princeton|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in archaeological and anthropological studies, specifically focusing on the material evidence that can be attributed to culture in the past or present. It is usually synonymous with artifacts, which humans use to cope with the physical world, facilitate social intercourse, and benefit man's state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences, Volume 1, Issue 1|last=Buchli|first=Victor|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0415267196|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly analysis of material culture - the human-made or altered things - is called '''material culture studies.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture in America: Understanding Everyday Life|last=Sheumaker|first=Helen|last2=Wajda|first2=Shirley|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9781576076477|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary field]] that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[historic preservation]], [[folklore]], [[literary criticism]] and [[museum studies]], among others. Anything from buildings and architectural elements to books, jewelry, or toothbrushes can be considered material culture.

== Material value ==

Research in several areas looked into the reasons for perceiving an object with meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value.

A well-known related theory is Kahneman's endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people evaluate objects they own with higher value than the same object if they do not own it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Knetsch|first2=Jack L.|last3=Thaler|first3=Richard H.|date=1991-01-01|title=Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias|jstor=1942711|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=5|issue=1|pages=193–206|doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment effect was found to occur as soon as the item is acquired and to increase over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strahilevitz|first=Michal A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1998-12-01|title=The Effect of Ownership History on the Valuation of Objects|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/25/3/276/1795651/The-Effect-of-Ownership-History-on-the-Valuation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=276–289|doi=10.1086/209539|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time, or space, or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lohmann|first=Andrew|last2=Arriaga|first2=Ximena B.|last3=Goodfriend|first3=Wind|date=2003-09-01|title=Close relationships and placemaking: Do objects in a couple's home reflect couplehood?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6811.00058/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=437–450|doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00058|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, "gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schieffelin|first=Edward L.|date=1980-01-01|title=Reciprocity and the Construction of Reality|jstor=2801347|journal=Man|volume=15|issue=3|pages=502–517|doi=10.2307/2801347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KNvxPSAYzbQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=the+gift+the+form&amp;ots=FXvgTLvKWT&amp;sig=TUMOcc7zIOAjDfDs9YcjcuksGHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20gift%20the%20form&amp;f=false|title=The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies|last=Mauss|first=Marcel|date=2000-01-01|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393320435|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mauss, the giver never really leaves the gift but becomes part of the receiver's future by inserting the gift into their life. A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
Material culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of [[anthropology]] and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Ian|title=Understanding Material Culture|year=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location=New York, New York|isbn=0761942262}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the "golden age" of [[museum]]-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture.

The origins of the field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates back to the 1990s. The ''[[Journal of Material Culture]]'' started putting out publications only in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodward|first=Sophie|title=Material Culture|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0085.xml|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a sense that can be thought of as younger for tying closely to ethnographic work and collecting habits. [[Collecting]] habits date back to hundreds of years ago.

==Contributors==
[[Leslie White]] was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of [[cultural evolution]], [[sociocultural evolution]], and especially [[neoevolutionism]] and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]] Ann Arbor. He was president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (1964). He wrote ''The Science of Culture'' in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism] American Materialism&lt;/ref&gt;

American anthropologist [[James Deetz]], known for his work in the field of [[historical archaeology]], wrote the book "In Small Things Forgotten" in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects.

Ian M. G. Quimby's ''Material Culture and the Study of American Life'', written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education.

Thomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]], wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book ''Artifacts and the American Past'', Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts.

[[Gerd Koch]], associated with the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]], is known for his studies on the material culture of [[Tuvalu]],&lt;ref name="GKT"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Koch|first1= Gerd |authorlink1=Gerd Koch|title= Die Materielle Kulture der Ellice-Inseln|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1961 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Berlin: Museum fur Volkerkunde ([[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]]).

==Archaeology==
[[Archaeology]] is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Arthur Asa|title=What Objects Mean: An Introduction of Material Culture|year=2009|publisher=Left Coast Press Inc.|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=9781598744118|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[archaeological culture]] is a recurring [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of the [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |last=Renfrew |first=Colin |last2=Bahn |first2=Paul |year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kris Hurst|first=K|title=Material Culture|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/material_cultur.htm|work=About.com : Archaeology|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture.

Beginning in the European [[Renaissance]] and the culture's fascination with classical antiquities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of [[archaeological theory]], such as [[trans-cultural diffusion]], [[processual archaeology]], and [[post-processual archaeology]]. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including [[prehistoric archaeology]], [[classical archaeology]], [[historical archaeology]], [[cognitive archaeology]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology==

[[Anthropology]] is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used.

The first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on [[kinship]] and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Lewis Henry|title=Ancient Society|year=1877|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 19th century, [[Franz Boas]] brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Limitations of the Comparative Method of Anthropology|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Methods of Ethnology|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in France, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the [[social facts]] that functions as a coercive force to maintain [[solidarity]] in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Emile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical [[fieldwork]]. According to Lévi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 20th century, [[Mary Douglas]] thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Purity and Danger|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]], a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and said that all aspects of society have material causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cultural Materialism|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

In archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BUPlAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=material+culture+in+the+social+world&amp;ots=OfvHscrlHt&amp;sig=2pdpOqR1MmCBqyRwLgx5WrbNd0s#v=onepage&amp;q=material%20culture%20in%20the%20social%20world&amp;f=false|title=Material Culture In The Social World|last=Tim|first=Dant|date=1999-08-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335198214|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=noXhAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=love+objects+material+culture&amp;ots=l5m77l0Voh&amp;sig=TuC02c1Q-X9U3z0WS2sajuCK5pY#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20objects%20material%20culture&amp;f=false|title=Love Objects: Emotion, Design and Material Culture|last=Moran|first=Anna|last2=O'Brien|first2=Sorcha|date=2014-08-28|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781472517180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage industry==

Museums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the [[heritage industry]].  Defined as "the business of managing places that are important to an area's history and encouraging people to visit them," the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications.

That relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the [[humanities]] take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows [[curators]], researchers, and directors to conserve material culture's legacy.

==Current production==
Some observers advocate intentionally altering the material cultures created by current civilizations. For example, [[waste reduction]] advocates within [[environmentalism]] advocate [[design education|teaching design]] approaches, such as [[cradle-to-cradle design]] and [[appropriate technology]]. [[Anti-consumerism]] advocates encourage consuming less (thus creating fewer artifacts), engaging in more [[do-it-yourself]] projects and [[self-sufficiency]] (changing the quality of artifacts produced), and [[localism (politics)|localism]] impacts the geographic distribution and uniformity of artifacts.

'''Media art history''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that explores the current developments as well as the history and genealogy of [[new media art]], [[digital art]], and [[electronic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubitt, Sean and Paul Thomas. eds. 2013. Relive: Media Art Histories. Cambridge/Mass.: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, Oliver. ed. 2007. MediaArtHistories. Cambridge: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieling, Rudolf and Dieter Daniels. eds. 2004. Media Art Net 1: Survey of Media Art. New York/Vienna: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, media art histories addresses the contemporary interplay of art, technology, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2002. Information Arts. Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2010. Art + Science Now. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Linda. 1983. The Fourth Dimension and Non - Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art . Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, it aims to reveal the historical relationships and aspects of the ‘afterlife’ ([[Aby Warburg]]) in new media art by means of a historical comparative approach. This strand of research encompasses questions of the history of media and perception, of so-called archetypes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Grau, Oliver. 2003. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of [[iconography]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ″Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[new media art]] itself is of great importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. Köln: Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of [[interactivity]], processuality, [[multimedia]], and [[real time (media)|real time]]. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities – more or less its ‘media-specificity’ – of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.

Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‘genre’ of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres).

== Resources and research projects ==

Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/&lt;/ref&gt; platform located in New York, Netzspannung&lt;ref&gt;http://netzspannung.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2005), the database project Compart&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.&lt;ref&gt;http://monoskop.org/Monoskop&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as [[Nettime]] or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community.

In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the [[Ars Electronica]], the [[Transmediale]], the [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and [[SIGGRAPH]] (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, [[ZKM]] (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], or the [[Walker Art Center]]) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin-based DAM – Digital Art Museum).  Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums.

Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued.  These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Art Net.  This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration Liverpool Declaration]. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney;  Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Brasília; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt-University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU’s  Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re-live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/]

== Focus of research ==

Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours – the field is driven by the idea of a ‘deep time of the media’ (S. Zielinski).

Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science ([[Lorraine Daston]], Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science ([[Oliver Grau]], [[Barbara Stafford]], Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, [[Edward A. Shanken]], Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, [[Jonathan Crary]], [[Horst Bredekamp]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Hans Belting]]), [[media studies]] and [[media archaeology]] ([[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Jussi Parikka]], [[ Wolfgang Ernst (media theorist)|Wolfgang Ernst]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], Stephan Oettermann, [[Lev Manovich]]), [[sound studies]] ([[Douglas Kahn]]), [[film studies]] (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczyński), as well as [[computer science]] ([[Frieder Nake]]).

'''Mobbing''' in animals is an [[antipredator adaptation]] in which individuals of prey species&lt;!--can be several at once--&gt; [[wikt:mob|mob]] a [[predator]] by cooperatively attacking or harassing it, usually to protect their [[offspring]]. A simple definition of mobbing is an assemblage of individuals around a potentially dangerous predator.&lt;ref name="Dominey" /&gt; This is most frequently seen in [[birds]], though it is also known to occur in many other [[animal]]s such as the [[meerkat]], and some [[Bovinae|bovines]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cows-kill-leopard-in-maharashtra/article24414221.ece|title=Cows kill leopard in Maharashtra|date=2018-07-13|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-08-12|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1630667,00.html|title=When Animals Attack — and Defend|first=Jeffrey|last=Kluger|date=7 June 2007|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mobbing has evolved independently in many species, it only tends to be present in those whose young are frequently preyed upon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This [[ethology|behavior]] may complement [[crypsis|cryptic]] adaptations in the offspring themselves, such as [[camouflage]] and hiding. [[Mobbing calls]] may be used to summon nearby individuals to [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperate]] in the attack.

[[Konrad Lorenz]], in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), attributed mobbing among birds and animals to [[instinct]]s rooted in the [[Darwinian]] struggle to survive. In his view, humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control (see [[mobbing]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/mobbing.htm Kenneth Westheus Mobbing]. uwaterloo.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds that breed in colonies such as [[gull]]s are widely seen to attack intruders, including encroaching humans.&lt;ref name="Alcock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcock| first=John| authorlink=John Alcock (behavioral ecologist)| year=1998| title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach| edition=6th| publisher=Sinauer Associates| location=Sunderland| isbn=0-87893-009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the birds that most frequently engage in mobbing include mockingbirds, crows and jays, chickadees, terns, and blackbirds. Behavior includes flying about the intruder, dive bombing, loud squawking and [[defecation|defecating]] on the predator.
Mobbing can also be used to obtain food, by driving larger birds and mammals away from a food source, or by harassing a bird with food. One bird might distract while others quickly steal food. Scavenging birds such as gulls frequently use this technique to steal food from humans nearby. A flock of birds might drive a powerful animal away from food. Costs of mobbing behavior include the risk of engaging with predators, as well as energy expended in the process. The [[black-headed gull]] is a species which aggressively engages intruding predators, such as [[carrion crow]]s. Classic experiments on this species by Hans Kruuk involved placing hen eggs at intervals from a [[nest]]ing colony, and recording the percentage of successful predation events as well as the probability of the crow being subjected to mobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kruuk| first=H.| year=1964| title=Predators and anti-predator behaviour of the black-headed gull ''Larus ridibundus''| location=Leiden| publisher=E.J. Brill| series=''Behaviour Supplements'' (11)| oclc=1502972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed decreasing mobbing with increased distance from the nest, which was correlated with increased predation success. Mobbing may function by reducing the predator's ability to locate nests (as a distraction) since predators cannot focus on locating eggs while they are under attack.

Besides the ability to drive the predator away, mobbing also draws attention to the predator, making stealth attacks impossible. Mobbing plays a critical role in the identification of predators and inter-generational learning about predator identification. Reintroduction of species is often unsuccessful, because the established population lacks this cultural knowledge of how to identify local predators. Scientists are exploring ways to train populations to identify and respond to predators before releasing them into the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Griffin |first=Andrea S. |author2=[[Daniel T. Blumstein]] |author3=Christopher S. Evans |date=October 2000 |title=Training Captive-Bred or Translocated Animals to Avoid Predators |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=1317–1326 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99326.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adaptationist]] [[Scientific hypothesis|hypotheses]] regarding why an organism should engage in such risky behavior have been suggested by Eberhard Curio,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Curio| first=E.| year=1978| title=The adaptive significance of avian mobbing. I. Teleonomic hypotheses and predictions| journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie| volume=48| pages=175–183 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1978.tb00254.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; including advertising their physical fitness and hence uncatchability (much like [[stotting]] behavior in gazelles), distracting predators from finding their offspring, [[Animal communication|warning]] their offspring, luring the predator away, allowing offspring to [[learn]] to recognize the predator species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1126/science.202.4370.899|last=Curio| first=E.|author2=U. Ernst |author3=W. Vieth  |year=1978| title=Cultural  Transmission of Enemy Recognition: One Function of Mobbing |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume=202| pages=899–901 |issue=4370 | pmid=17752463}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly [[injury|injuring]] the predator or attracting a predator of the predator itself. The much lower frequency of attacks between nesting seasons suggests such behavior may have [[evolved]] due to its [[Hamilton's rule|benefit]] for the mobber's young. [[Niko Tinbergen]] argued that the mobbing was a source of [[confusion]] to gull chick predators, distracting them from searching for prey .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Tinbergen| first=Niko| title=The herring gull's world: a study of the social behavior of birds| publisher=Lyons and Bulford| location=New York|isbn=1-55821-049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, an intruding carrion crow can only avoid incoming attacks by facing its attackers, which prevents it from locating its target.&lt;ref name="Alcock" /&gt;

Besides [[experiment]]al research, the [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|comparative method]] can also be employed to investigate hypotheses such as those given by Curio above. For example, not all [[gull]] species show mobbing behavior. The [[kittiwake]] nests on sheer cliffs that are almost completely inaccessible to predators, meaning its young are not at risk of predation like other gull species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Cullen| first=E.| year=1957| title=Adaptations in the kittiwake to cliff nesting| journal=Ibis| volume=99|pages=275–302| doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1957.tb01950.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[divergent evolution]].

Looking at variation in the behavioural responses of 22 different passerine species to a potential predator, the Eurasian Pygmy Owl, extent of mobbing was positively related with a species prevalence in the owls' diet.  Furthermore, the intensity of mobbing was greater in autumn than spring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dutour, M.|author2=Lena, J.-P. | author3= Lengagne, T. |year=2017| title=Mobbing behaviour in a passerine community increases with prevalence in predator diet| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=324–330 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12461/full | doi=10.1111/ibi.12461 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing is thought to carry risks to roosting predators, including potential harm from the mobbing birds, or attracting larger, more dangerous predators. Birds at risk of mobbing such as [[owl]]s have cryptic [[plumage]] and hidden roosts which reduces this danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrichsen | first1 = Ditte K. | last2 = Christiansen | first2 = Peter | last3 = Nielsen | first3 = Elsemarie K. | last4 = Dabelsteen | first4 = Torben | last5 = Sunde | first5 = Peter | year = 2006 | title = Exposure affects the risk of an owl being mobbed – experimental evidence | journal = Journal of Avian Biology | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 13–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2005.0908-8857.03658.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other animals==
[[File:Squirrel vs snake.jpg|thumb|270px|The occurrence of mobbing behavior across widely different [[taxa]], including [[California ground squirrel]]s, is evidence of convergent evolution.]]
Another way the comparative method can be used here is by comparing gulls with distantly related organisms. This approach relies on the existence of [[convergent evolution]], where distantly related organisms evolve the same trait due to similar [[selection pressure]]s. As mentioned, many bird species such as the [[swallow]]s also mob predators, however more distantly related groups including [[mammal]]s have been known to engage in this behavior. One example is the [[California ground squirrel]], which distracts predators such as the [[rattlesnake]] and [[gopher snake]] from locating their nest [[burrow]]s by kicking sand into their face, which disrupts the snake's sensory organs; for crotaline snakes, this includes the heat-detecting organs in the [[loreal pit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coss| first=Richard G.|last2=Biardi| year=1997|first2=J. E.| title=Individual Variation in the Antisnake Behavior of California Ground Squirrels (''Spermophilus beecheyi'')| journal=Journal of Mammalogy| volume=78| issue=2| pages=294–310| doi=10.2307/1382883|jstor=1382883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[social behavior|social]] species also uses alarm calls.

Some [[fish]] engage in mobbing; for example, [[bluegill]]s sometimes attack [[Common snapping turtle|snapping turtles]].&lt;ref name="Dominey"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dominey| first=Wallace J.| year=1983| title=Mobbing  in Colonially Nesting Fishes, Especially the Bluegill, ''Lepomis  macrochirus''| journal=Copeia| volume=1983| issue=4| pages=1086–1088| doi=10.2307/1445113| jstor=1445113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluegills, which form large nesting colonies, were seen to attack both released and naturally occurring turtles, which may advertise their presence, drive the predator from the area, or aid in the transmission of predator recognition. Similarly, humpback whales are known to mob killer whales when the latter are attacking other species, including other cetacean species, seals, sea lions, and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitman|first1=Robert L.|last2=Deecke|first2=Volker B.|last3=Gabriele|first3=Christine M.|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Mridula|last5=Black|first5=Nancy|last6=Denkinger|first6=Judith|last7=Durban|first7=John W.|last8=Mathews|first8=Elizabeth A.|last9=Matkin|first9=Dena R.|last10=Neilson|first10=Janet L.|last11=Schulman-Janiger|first11=Alisa|last12=Shearwater|first12=Debra|last13=Stap|first13=Peggy|last14=Ternullo|first14=Richard|title=Humpback whales interfering when mammal-eating killer whales attack other species: Mobbing behavior and interspecific altruism?|journal=Marine Mammal Science|date=2017|volume=33|issue=1|pages=7–58|doi=10.1111/mms.12343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobbing calls==
[[File:Parus major 4 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|left|thumb|The [[great tit]] (''P. major''), a [[passerine]] bird, employs both mobbing behavior and alarm calls.]] 
Mobbing calls are [[signaling theory|signal]]s made by the mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from [[alarm call]]s, which allow con-specifics to ''escape'' from the predator. The [[great tit]], a European [[songbird]], uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched [[bird of prey]], such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5[[Frequency (sound)|kHz]] range,&lt;ref name="Alcock" /&gt; and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8&amp;nbsp;kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Brown| first= C. H.| year=1982| title=Ventriloquial and locatable vocalizations in birds| journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume=59|pages=338–350| doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1982.tb00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.

Mobbing calls may also be part of an animal's arsenal in harassing the predator. Studies of ''[[Phainopepla]]'' mobbing calls indicate it may serve to enhance the swooping attack on the predators, including [[scrub jay]]s. In this species, the mobbing call is smoothly upsweeping, and is made when swooping down in an arc beside the predator. This call was also heard during [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic behavior]] interactions with [[conspecifics]], and may serve additionally or alternatively as an alarm call to their mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Leger| first=Daniel W.|author2=Laura F. Carroll| year=1981| title=Mobbing calls of the ''Phainopepla'' | journal=The Condor| volume=83| issue=4|pages=377–380| doi=10.2307/1367509| url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v083n04/p0377-p0380.pdf| accessdate=2007-06-12|format=PDF| jstor=1367509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[File:Serengeti liontree buffl.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[African buffalo]] herd confronting a [[lion]]]]
The evolution of mobbing behavior can be explained using [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable strategies]], which are in turn based on [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Geoffrey A.|last2=Milinski|first2=Manfred |title=Cooperation under predation risk: a data-based ESS analysis|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1997|volume=264|issue=1385|pages=1239–1247|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0171|pmc=1688555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing involves risks (costs) to the individual and benefits (payoffs) to the individual and others. The individuals themselves are often genetically related, and mobbing is increasingly studied with the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] by considering [[inclusive fitness]] (the carrying on of one's genes through one's family members), rather than merely benefit to the individual.

By cooperating to successfully drive away predators, all individuals involved increase their chances of survival and reproduction.  An individual stands little chance against a larger predator, but when a large group is involved, the risk to each group member is reduced or diluted. This so-called dilution effect proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton]] is another way of explaining the benefits of cooperation by selfish individuals.  [[Lanchester's laws]] also provide an insight into the advantages of attacking in a large group rather than individually.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |isbn=0-201-48340-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamilton, W.

Another interpretation involves the use of [[signalling theory]], and possibly the [[handicap principle]]. Here the idea is that a mobbing bird, by apparently putting itself at risk, displays its status and health so as to be [[sexual selection|preferred by potential partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ethology|author=Arnold, K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50318">'''Muted Group Theory''' ('''MGT'''), created by [[Edwin Ardener]] and [[Shirley Ardener]] in 1975, is a [[communication theory]] that focuses on how [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]] are muted and excluded via the use of language. The main idea of MGT is that "Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The term “mutedness” refers to a group’s inability to express themselves due to this inequity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967775008|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=9781259870323|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s) as being as follows: 1) the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the [[Social norm|social norms]] and vocabulary, and 2) members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the [[Linguistic imperialism|dominant language]] to express themselves. However, this [[translation]] process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the [[Social exclusion|marginalized group]]. All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group. Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

==Overview ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 10.26.45 PM.png|thumbnail|Ardener's Dominant Group vs Muted Group|336x336px]]Muted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of [[cultural anthropology]] by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled "Belief and the Problem of Women," in which Ardener explored the "problem" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that "those trained in [[ethnography]] evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide."&lt;ref name="Ardener73"&gt;Ardener, Edwin, &amp; Chapman, Malcolm. (2007). ''The voice of prophecy and other essays''. New York: Berghahn Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a "bounded model of society"&lt;ref name=Ardener73/&gt; akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to.&lt;ref name=Ardener73/&gt;  Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: "[…] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?"&lt;ref name="Ardener73" /&gt;

After conducting an experiment with the information in his essay, the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society, which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph. On the other hand, the female point of view is considered as non-dominant and non-standard, so it falls into the muted category with the broken line. According to Ardener, because male-based understandings of society represent the dominant worldview, certain groups are silenced or muted. He writes: "In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure, the female one is a muted structure."&lt;ref name="Ardener73" /&gt; As part of the critical approach to the world, Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups. Moreover, Ardener's concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other non-dominant groups within social structures.

Scholars Cheris Kramer, Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language “defines, deprecrates, and ignores women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Cheris|last2=Thorne|first2=Barrie|last3=Henley|first3=Nancy|date=1978-04|title=Perspectives on Language and Communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/493507|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=3|issue=3|pages=638–651|doi=10.1086/493507|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; What they discovered is that "male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language. Women are often defined by their relation to men (“Miss/Mrs.” or “Harold’s Widow”) while men have more autonomous varied linguistic status."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Cheris|last2=Thorne|first2=Barrie|last3=Henley|first3=Nancy|date=1978-04|title=Perspectives on Language and Communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/493507|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=3|issue=3|pages=638–651|doi=10.1086/493507|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Key concepts ===

==== Mutedness ====
[[File:Muted.jpg|thumb|Graphic highlighting ways women are silenced.]]
Mutedness does not equal silence. Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas, regardless of time and space, without changing their language to meet the dominant group's vocabulary. Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked, muffled, and invisible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A  First Look at Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Emory A|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-353430-5|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As gender communication scholar [[Cheris Kramarae]] states, social interaction and communication create the current language structure. Because the latter was mainly built by men, men have an advantage over women. Consequently, women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a man's language.&lt;ref name="Kramarae1981"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and men speaking: Frameworks for analysis|date=1981|publisher=Newbury House Publishers|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris}} Rowley, MA: Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae states:

"The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally, for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation. Women (as well as members of other non-dominant groups) are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish, because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group, men."

As Cowan points out, " 'mutedness' does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voices…are allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system."&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, R. (May, 2007). Muted group theory: Providing answers and raising questions concerning workplace bullying. Conference Papers -- National Communication Association. Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muted group ====
Muted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group.  According to Gerdrin, muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and non-dominant groups.&lt;ref name="Gendrin"&gt;Gendrin, D. M. Homeless women's inner voices: Friends or foes?, in Hearing many voices. Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not.&lt;ref name="Gendrin" /&gt; The discrepancies in power result in the "oppressor" and "[[Oppression|the oppressed]]". Kramarae points out that muted group as "the oppressed" are people who don't have a "public recognized vocabulary" to express their experience. Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about "the validity of their experience" and "the legitimacy of their feelings".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kramarae also addresses that [[gender]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Social class|class hierarchies]], where muted groups, are supported by our "political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the lack of power, muted groups are usually at the margin of the society.

==== The "muting" process ====
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 11.27.28 PM.png|thumb|West and Turner's Muting or Silencing Process|352x352px]]Several scholars have researched and studied how the "muting" process occurs. Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing women's related lexicon, reinforcing family hierarchies, constructing a male-controlled media, trivializing their opinions, ideas, and concerns, and censoring women's voices.&lt;ref name="Houston1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kramarae|first2=Cheris|year=1991|title=Speaking from silence:methods of silencing and of resistance|journal=Discourse and Society|last1=Houston|first1=Marsha}} 2.4  387-400. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities.&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt;

According to West and Turner (2010), individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the "muting" process: 
* Name the silencing factors, had it been men or news agencies. 
* Reclaim, elevate and celebrate women's discourse. 
* Create new words to the language system that are inclusive of marginalized groups and gendered words and experiences. 
* Use media platforms (traditional and new) to voice groups.&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner (2010). Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. 5th ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assumptions ==
According to Cheris Kramarae, MGT makes three assumptions :

=== Assumption #1 ===

''The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world''

Using men's words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other. This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words "[[sex]]" and "gender". Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level. This is because language is man made. This makes it easier for men to communicate over women. [[Symbolic interactionism|Symbolic Interactionism Theory]] believes that "the extent of knowing is the extent of naming."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When applied to muted group, this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers.

=== Assumption #2 ===

''Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as men's experience are dominant''

Kramarae argues that English is a "[hu]man-made language" and that it "embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine", while supporting "the perceptions of white middle-class males. Men are the standard."&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W., &amp; Foss, K.A. (2011). Theories of human communication, 10th ed. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press. P148&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women, so that women's voices become less present, or "muted". Kramarae also explains that men's control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns. Some of these include names such as "[[slut]]", "whore", and "easy lay", along with speech patterns such as "[[gossip]]ing", "whining", and "[[wikt:bitch#Verb|bitching]]".&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt; When it comes to words connoting promiscuity, there are fewer male-specific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positive/sexual light. These include words such as "stud", "player", and "[[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;465).  Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality. She believes that "words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought". This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are at a disadvantage once again.

=== Assumption #3 ===

''Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life''

Kramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public. According to Kramarae, this is because, "what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another example of the male-dominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking, women most often use sports and war analogies (things most women do not usually associate themselves with) in order to relate to their male audiences. This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long. Almost all prominent authors, theorists, and scientists have historically been male. This allows for them to give women the "facts" they should believe about society and life in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanGorp|first=Ericka|title=Muted Group Theory|url=http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Papers/App_Papers/VanGorp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae also believes that "males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feminist scholar [[Dale Spender]] supports the idea that language, and society in general, is traditionally male-centric. "[[Masculinity]] is the unmarked form: the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise. Femininity is the marked form: it is the proof of otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man-Made Language|last=Spender|first=Dale|publisher=Pandora Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0863584015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If masculinity, and subsequently language, are unmarked forms, than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life.

==Applications==

=== Language ===
[[File:The Ladies' Dictionary 1694 (22163418033).jpg|thumb|289x289px|Application in language - A Feminist Dictionary]]
According to Kissack, traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society. Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women, that is, "female-preferential" language. It has been considered as lower than the "male-preferential" language. The primary difference between the two is "male-preferential" language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas "female-preferential" language consists mainly of personal details, emotions reflected in the conversations, also there is a great use of adjectives in it.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

Muted group theory has "recognized that women's voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that women's experiences merit linguistic recognition".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. T. (2005). Feminist standpoint theory and muted group theory: Commonalities and divergences. Women &amp; Language, 28(2), 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries. Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources. These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women. Furthering this idea, Kramarae and Paula Treichler created [[A Feminist Dictionary]] with words they believed [[Merriam-Webster]] defined on male ideas. For example, the word "[[Cuckold]]" is defined as "the husband of an unfaithful wife" in Merriam Webster. However, there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband. She is simply called a wife. Another example Kramarae defined was the word "doll". She defined "doll" as "a toy playmate given to, or made by children". Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions "dolls". The feminist dictionary includes up to 2,500 words to emphasize women's linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status.&lt;ref&gt;Treichler, P., and C. Kramarae. (1985) A feminist dictionary. Boston. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings. She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Hannah R. "Expanding the Dialogue: 7e Need for Fat Studies in Critical Intercultural Communication." (Winter 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass Media ===
[[File:Pride in London 2016 - A London Live reporter interviews the flag bearer for India before the parade.png|thumb|337x337px|Application in mass media - Women in the mass media industry]]
According to Kramarae, women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970; thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history. The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers, who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books, essays, poetry, plays, film scripts, etc. will appear in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris|title=Technology and Women's Voices : Keeping in Touch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid-70s there is an increase of women in the male-dominated profession of journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creedon|first1=P.|last2=Cramer|first2=J.|title=Women in Mass Communication|date=2007|publisher=Thousand Oak|pages=275–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014, The Women's Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry. The report compiles 27,000 pieces of content among "20 of the most widely circulated, read, and viewed, and listened TV networks, newspapers, news wires, and online news in the United States."&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/|title=The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Women's Media Center|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that women (36.1%) are significantly out-numbered by men (63.4%). Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing, the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover. Several studies show that while men mainly report on "hard" news, women are often relegated to cover "soft" news. Thus, women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Maria Elizabeth|last2=Samson|first2=Lelia|title=Sexual Cues Emanating From the Anchorette Chair: Implications for Perceived Professionalism, Fitness for Beat, and Memory for News|journal=Communication Research|date=2012|doi=10.1177/0093650210384986|volume=38|issue=4|pages=471–496|hdl=2022/14319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engstrom|first1=Erika|last2=Ferri|first2=Anthony J|title=Looking Through a Gendered Lens: Local U.S. Television News Anchors' Perceived Career Barriers|journal=Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media|date=Fall 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Women's Media Centre study is very U.S.-centric, non-dominant groups are often muted even in other country's media landscapes. For example, Aparna Hebbani and Charise-Rose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere.&lt;ref name="Hebbani"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Rose-Wills|first2=Charise|title=How Muslim women in Australia navigate through media (mis) representations of hijab/burqa|journal=Australian Journal of Communication|pages=89–102|last1=Hebbani|first1=Aparna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study shows that women that wear a [[hijab]] or [[burqa]] are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt; According to the authors, Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences, views, and perspective in their representation in Australian media. Thus, there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt; It also shows that although currently muted, this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt;

=== Social Rituals ===
[[File:Documentary-wedding-photographers-melbourne.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in social rituals - A father gives his daughter away at the wedding ceremony.]]
There are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individual's behavior deviates from this norm they attain "negative feedback" for this opposition to the norm by their actions. In the case of women, this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner, but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts, they are "discriminated" and "discouraged" for acting that way.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

Social rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place. Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position. For example, the fact that the father of the bride "gives her away" to the groom, that the position of the bride – at the left of the minister – is considered less privileged than the one of the groom, that the groom announces his vows first, and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride, are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man.&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt;

As [[Catharine MacKinnon]] (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. Like language, the legal system has thus been created, defined, and interpreted mostly by men.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon1983"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Summer 1983|title=Feminism, Marxism, Method, and the State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence|journal=The University Chicago Press|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate [[sexual harassment]] and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women|date=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist [[jurisprudence]] and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1988|title=The nature of domination and the nature of women: reflections on Feminism Unmodified|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|volume=|last1=Finley|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Workplace===
[[File:L-14-11-17-A-0465 (15796735016).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in the workplace - Women in the workplace]]
In 1940s America, women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war. However, after the war period, the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace, and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society. Organizations still appear to be male dominated. Women's experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are. The "structure" is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective.&lt;ref name="Kissack"&gt;Kissack, H. (2010). "Muted voices: a critical look at e-male in organizations". ''Journal of European Industrial Training''. '''34''' (6): 539–551. {{DOI|10.1108/03090591011061211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most organization goals are met by the usage of "male-preferential" language, as they tend to focus on aspects such as "economic gain" and "performance improved". The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties. Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them, so in order to attain success in their workplace, they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize "male-preferential" language.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

One of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the "performance appraisals" into consideration. What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like "masculine" standards.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt; Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency, dominant emotions, and can point to the employee’s role in the silencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meares|first=Mary M.|last2=Oetzel|first2=John G.|last3=Torres|first3=Annette|last4=Derkacs|first4=Denise|last5=Ginossar|first5=Tamar|date=2004-02|title=Employee mistreatment and muted voices in the culturally diverse workplace|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0090988042000178121|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4–27|doi=10.1080/0090988042000178121|issn=0090-9882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group. Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are "the verbal minority".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. T. (1992). Telling our stories: Narratives as a basis for theorizing sexual harassment. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 20, 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations rarely encourage issues of [[sexual harassment]] be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clair|first=Robin Patric|date=1993-06|title=The use of framing devices to sequester organizational narratives: Hegemony and harassment|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637759309376304|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=113–136|doi=10.1080/03637759309376304|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include: "expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group, fear of not being protected from retaliation, worry that the male dominated hierarchy will 'team up' against them, or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1981-12|title=Toward a Redefinition of Sexual Equality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1340713|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=95|issue=2|pages=487|doi=10.2307/1340713|issn=0017-811X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amiot|first=Catherine E.|last2=Bourhis|first2=Richard Y.|date=2005-06|title=Discrimination between dominant and subordinate groups: The positive-negative asymmetry effect and normative processes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1348/014466604x17605|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=289–308|doi=10.1348/014466604x17605|issn=0144-6665}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Education ===
[[File:Womens Studies (8407729802).jpg|thumb|260x260px|Application in education - "Women's studies"]]
The classroom can be a place where women are muted. [[Women's education in the United States]] has progressed over the years, but academia is still male-dominated. Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments, such as including "women's humor", "speechlessness", and ways to address the issue of "abusive language".&lt;ref name="Kramarae1996"&gt;Kramarae, Cheris. (1996) "Centers Of Change: An Introduction To Women's Own Communication Programs." Communication Education 45.4: 315. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking.

In the classroom, men and women utilize language differently. The bond differently with other members of their gender. Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems, while men bond with each other using "playful insults" and "put downs".&lt;ref name="Tannen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|year=1992|title=How Men and Women Use Language Differently in Their Lives and in the Classroom|journal=The Education Digest|volume=57|issue=6}} n. page. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of classroom discussions, men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions.&lt;ref name="Tannen1992" /&gt;

Houston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on "woman-centered communication" education. [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] (WS) has evolved and grown over the years. Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs, African American Programs, and other programs focused on marginalized groups.&lt;ref name="Kramarae1996" /&gt;

=== Politics ===
[[File:Third Party Debate 2012 (8120719565).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in politics - Third Party Debate 2012]]
Independent parties have emerged since [[World War II]] to offer people alternative choices for election. However, most of these parties operate only in "circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms". Prentice studied the impact of the [[Third party (United States)|third party]], i.e., candidates from non-major parties, in public debate. He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates, they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by "standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prentice|first=Carolyn|year=2005|title=Third Party Candidates in Political Debates: Muted Groups Struggling to Express Themselves|url=|journal=Speaker &amp; Gavel|volume=42: Iss. 1, Article 2.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways: "ignoring their claims, appearing confused (verbally or nonverbally) by the claims, or actively attacking the claims made". He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties' worldviews, which results in third party's mutedness. In order to participate and articulate their own worldview, third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties' models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== LGBT Communities ===
[[File:Pride London 2011 - 024.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in LGBT study - "Older LGBT Group celebrating Pride" in Trafalgar Square, London.]]
[[LGBT]] groups are considered marginalized and muted in our society.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, J. E. (1999). Disidentifications: Queers of color and the performance of politics. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant groups who "hold privileged positions within society" have developed social norms that marginalize LGBT groups.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M. P. (1996). Laying the foundation for co‐cultural communication theory: An inductive approach to studying "non‐dominant" communication strategies and the factors that influence them. Communication Studies, 47(3). doi: 10.1080/10510979609368473&lt;/ref&gt; Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity, they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups. As Gross notes, "For many oppressed groups the experience of commonality is largely the commonality of their difference from, and oppression by, the dominant culture".&lt;ref&gt;Gross, L. (1993). Contested closets: The politics and ethics of outing. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to function and achieve success within the dominant culture, LGBT groups must adopt certain communication strategies to match the social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J., &amp; Warber, K. M. (2015). Queer identity management and political self-expression on social networking sites: A co-cultural approach to the spiral of silence. Journal of Communication, 65, 79-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
[[File:1. The right to be heard- People claiming their right to a better life (9065195747).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in race - "the right to be heard"]]
[[Gloria Ladson-Billings]] believes that "stories provide the necessary context for understanding, feeling, and interpreting" and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ladson-Billings, Gloria. (1998). Just what is critical race theory and what's it doing in a nice field like education?, International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 11:1, 7-24, DOI: 10.1080/095183998236863&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized group's viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of "naming one's own reality". Delgado addresses three reasons for "naming one's own reality" in legal discourse: "1) much of 'reality' is socially constructed; 2) stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic self-preservation; and 3) the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome [[ethnocentrism]] and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way".&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, R. (1989). Symposium: Legal storytelling. Michigan Law Review, 87, 2073.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to education, critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a "[[White supremacy|White supremacist]] master script". As Swartz contends, master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students, which legitimizes "dominant, white, upper-class, male voices" and mutes multiple perspectives. The voices from other non-dominant groups are under control, mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, E. (1992). Emancipatory narratives: Rewriting the master script in the school curriculum. Journal of Negro Education, 61, 341-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Lasdon-Billing argues that the curriculum should be race-neutral or colorblind, present people of color, and "presume a homogenized 'we' in a celebration of diversity".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Age ===
[[Ageism]] leads to certain age groups being muted in American society. In particular, the elderly are often ignored and marginalized.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Carol|date=1996|title=Muted lives: older battered women|url=|journal=Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=8|issue=2|pages=3–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Muted lives: Older battered women'', Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism. She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women, not just abused women in general. She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties, "They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Here, age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group. In ''Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas'', Deborah Ballard-Reisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups. Ageism, as well as other factors, result in this community being muted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballard-Reisch   87-93|first=Deborah|date=2010|title=Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas|url=|journal=Women &amp; Language|volume=33|issue=2|pages=87–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aging populations, as seen in Seaver and Ballard-Reisch's works, can be silenced by stereotypes, such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change.

Issues of ageism intersect with [[heterosexism]] when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced. Scholar Maria T. Brown writes, "The exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Maria T.|date=2009|title=LGBT aging and rhetorical silence|url=https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/lgbt-aging-and-rhetorical-silence|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=6|pages=65–78|via=Syracuse University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown claims that the silencing is a "rhetorical move" that excludes the elderly from [[queer theory]] and queerness from the field [[gerontology]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This case study is an example of how identities intersect (in this case, being elderly and part of the LGBT community). MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections.

=== Disability ===
Marcel Calvez argues that, "What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvez|first=Marcel|date=2001|title=Involvement and detachment in intellectual disability studies|url=|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=41–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this logic, he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted. Calvez's study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities, with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced.

Many disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them. The means of muting, ridicule, ritual, control, and harassment can all apply to disabled groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Ableism|Ableist]] language, such as use of the pejorative term "[[Retard (pejorative)|retard]]", can be used to ridicule disabled groups. By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities, disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm.

== Navigating the Muted Status ==
To get their concerns recognized by the dominant group, the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group. There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of "inferior" groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;Stanback, M., &amp; Pearce, W. (n.d.). ''Talking to “The Man”: Some Communication Strategies Used by Members of “Subordinate” Social Groups.'' The Quarterly Journal of Speech, 67(1), 21–30. &lt;/ref&gt; Orbe (1994) identified six themes central to African American male communication: "(1) the importance of other African Americans, (2) learning how to communicate with non-African Americans, (3) keeping a safe distance, (4) playing the part (snap!), (5) testing the sincerity of non-African Americans, and (6) an intense social responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orbe|first=Mark P.|date=1994-06|title=“Remember, it's always whites' ball”: Descriptions of African American male communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01463379409369935|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=42|issue=3|pages=287–300|doi=10.1080/01463379409369935|issn=0146-3373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in Orbe’s research were observed changing immediately into two different people, in order to play the part, when communicating with non-African Americans.  

In addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men, African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language. A speaker’s dialect (e.g. Black English or Mainstream American English) is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy, for example, the speaker’s socio-economic status, educational status, provenance, and/or racial/ethnic origin. As a result, African American women find themselves needing to “code-switch” when communicating with the dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Marsha Houston: (aka Marsha Houston Stanback)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452225692.n9|work=Black Pioneers in Communication Research|pages=172–188|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9780761929932|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies of Resistance ==
MGT offers ways to change the muting status quo, i.e., naming the strategies of silencing, reclaiming, elevating and celebrating women's discourse, and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group.

Women as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally, but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse (Vonnegut 1992). Specifically, with the creation of the [[Feminist theory|Feminist Theory]] to understand the nature of gender inequality. Additionally, in the last year, the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the [[Me Too movement|Me Too Movement]] are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group.

== Extension ==
Although the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a [[feminist theory]], it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hechter|first1=M.|date=2004|title=From class to culture|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=400–445|doi=10.1086/421357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Orbe, a communication theorist, has suggested that in the U.S. the dominant group consists of white, heterosexual, middle-class, males. Thus, groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted.

=== Interethnic Communication  ===
In ''[[African Americans|African-American]] communication research: Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication'' (1995) and ''Constructing co-cultural theory:  An explication of culture, power, and communication'' (1998), Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory:
*Muting as described in muted group theory can be applied to many cultural groups.  Orbe stated that research performed by the dominant white European culture has created a view of African-American communication "which promotes the illusion that all African-Americans, regardless of gender, age, class, or sexual orientation, communicate in a similar manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orbe|first=MP|year=1995|title=African American Communication Research: Toward a Deeper Understanding of Interethnic Communication|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=59|pages=61–78|doi=10.1080/10570319509374507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are several ways in which members of a muted group can face their position within the dominant culture.  Orbe identified 26 different ways that members of muted groups can use to face the structures and messages imposed by dominant groups.  For example, individuals can choose to (1) emphasize commonalities and downplay cultural differences, (2) educate others about norms of the muted group, and (3) avoid members of the dominant group. Orbe also suggests that individuals choose one of the 26 different ways based on previous experiences, context, abilities, and perceived costs and rewards.

Therefore, although Kramarae focuses on women's muted voices, she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences. Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group, i.e. African-Americans, but also contributes by assessing "how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuing the legacy of theorizing from the margins: Conceptualizations of co-cultural theory", Women and Language|last1=Orbe|first1=M. P.|date=1995|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model", African American communication and identities: Essential reading|last1=Orbe|first1=M. P.|date=1998|publisher=Thousand Oakes|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-cultural Communication ===
Orbe regards "interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members" as co-cultural communication. He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the co-cultural communication process: "assimilation (e.g., becoming integrated into mainstream culture), accommodation (gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy), or separation (maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Orbe, M.P. (1998b). From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model. Communication Theory, 8, 1–26. doi:10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00209.x&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes three communication approaches: "nonassertive (when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational, putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts), assertive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others), or aggressive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others)."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Further, although various groups can be considered as muted within society, silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group. For example, Anita Taylor and M. J. Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement. Thus, members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearing Many Voices|last1=Hardman|first1=M. J.|last2=Taylor|first2=A.|date=2000|publisher=Hampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Edwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials.&lt;ref name="Ardener2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardener|first=Shirley|author2=Edwin Ardener|year=2005|title="Muted Groups": The genesis of an idea and its praxis|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|issue=2|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive (intellectual) boy among hearty (sportive) boys in an all boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained.&lt;ref name="Ardener2005" /&gt;

MGT has often been challenged. [[Deborah Tannen]], the theorist that created [[Genderlect]] Theory, criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women. Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power, but unlike Kramarae, she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily  by men and women's different styles. Tannen warns readers that "bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate, to wield power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conversational style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramerae thinks Tannen's opinion is naïve. She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted. She also pointed out that "our political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems support gender, race, and class hierarchies".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Em|publisher=David Patterson|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-353430-5|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both theorists believe muting is involved, but they see it from different standpoints.

Is MGT outdated? In the 1970s and 1980s, MGT challenged the status quo, of academia, at least. While many women reading and discussing the theory thought it made sense in their own lives, many other academics thought it wasn't proper, both theoretically and politically. It certainly wasn't like any of the theories in introductory communication texts at the time. It was considered radical. If MGT isn't as exciting as it once seemed, this is due in part to its success and the success of theories and actions related to it.

'''''N''-body units''' are a completely self-contained [[Systems of measurement|system of units]] used for [[N-body simulation]]s of self-gravitating systems in astrophysics. In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the total mass, ''M'', the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', and the [[Virial theorem#Virial radius|virial radius]], ''R'', are normalized. The underlying assumption is that the system of ''N'' objects (stars) satisfies the [[virial theorem]]. The consequence of standard N-body units is that the velocity dispersion of the system, ''v'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; and that the dynamical or crossing time, ''t'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle 2\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of standard N-body units was advocated by [[Michel Hénon]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hénon | first = Michel | authorlink = Michel Hénon

'''Neuroleadership''' refers to the application of findings from [[neuroscience]] to the field of [[leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6698/is_3_75/ai_n56939147/ | title=NeuroLeadership: sustaining research relevance into the 21st century | publisher=SAM Advanced Management Journal | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=March 30, 2012 |author1=Lafferty, Christina L. |author2=Alford, Kenneth L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term neuroleadership was first coined by David Rock in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidrock.net/ |title=David Rock |publisher=David Rock |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US publication [[Strategy+Business]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy-business.com/press/freearticle/06207 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114173817/http://www.strategy-business.com/press/freearticle/06207 |date=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Mark Waldman developed a NeuroLeadership class that is part of the Executive MBA program at Loyola Marymount University. Neuroleadership claims to bring neuroscientific knowledge into the areas of [[leadership development]], [[management]] training, change management, education, consulting and coaching. One of the major components of the NeuroLeadership programs being introduced in universities and organizations is the concept of mindfulness, an outgrowth of the work originally established by Jon Kabat Zinn. 

==Criticism==
Neuroleadership is not without its critics.&lt;ref&gt;See for example comments by Howard Gardner and Warren Bennis in [http://www.afraccess.com/Index_mxml.html?URL=EDP:%2f%2f20071108000019927746 Australian Financial Review 9 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; They question whether having scientific brain data to back up what was commonly believed adds any value.

'''Newton’s cradle''' is a device that demonstrates [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|energy]] using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. It is also known as '''Newton's balls''' or '''Executive Ball Clicker'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16940&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup19784/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html |title=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.eu |publisher=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095258/http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 July 2011 |title=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |publisher=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |title=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |publisher=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170526/http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |title=Demo.pa.mus.edu |publisher=Demo.pa.msu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814121658/http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newton’s Cradle 1 Jan 18.jpg|thumb|A 5-ball newton's cradle]]
A typical Newton's cradle consists of a series of identically sized metal balls suspended in a metal frame so that they are just touching each other at rest. Each ball is attached to the frame by two wires of equal length angled away from each other. This restricts the [[pendulum]]s' movements to the same plane.

==Operation==
[[File:Newton’s cradle slo mo.webm|thumb|Newton's cradle in [[slow motion]].]]
When one of the end balls ("the first") is pulled sideways, the attached string makes it follow an upward arc. When it is let go, it strikes the second ball and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity of the first ball and swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the first ball.  This shows that the last ball receives most of the energy and momentum of the first ball. The impact produces a compression wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel does this, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the drop of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gauld|first1=Colin F.|title=Newton’s Cradle in Physics Education|journal=Science &amp; Education|date=August 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=597–617|doi=10.1007/s11191-005-4785-3|bibcode=2006Sc&amp;Ed..15..597G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics explanation==
[[File:Newton's Cradle 2 ball cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle with two balls of equal weight and perfectly efficient elasticity. The left ball is pulled away and let go. Neglecting the energy losses, the left ball strikes the right ball, transferring all the velocity to the right ball. Because they are the same weight, the same velocity indicates all the momentum and energy are also transferred. The kinetic energy, as determined by the velocity, is converted to potential energy as it reaches the same height as the initial ball and the cycle repeats.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|An idealized Newton's cradle with five balls when there are no energy losses and there is always a small separation between the balls, except for when a pair is colliding.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 3 ball swing 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle three-ball swing in a five-ball system. The central ball swings without any apparent interruption.]]
Newton's cradle can be modeled with simple physics and minor errors if you incorrectly assume the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, the simplification can't explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton's cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are '''not''' touching initially and only collide in pairs.

===Simple solution===
The conservation of momentum (mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity) and kinetic energy (0.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity^2) can be used to find the resulting velocities for [[elastic collision|two colliding perfectly elastic objects]].  These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns.  When the two objects weigh the same, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other's initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so we do not need to account for heat and sound energy losses.

Steel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much [[waste heat]]. The simple effect from two same-weight efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the interesting effect seen in the cradle, and gives an approximate solution to all its action.

For a sequence of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: The first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all its velocity to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the velocity to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball. Right behind this sequence is the first ball transferring its velocity to the second ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls.  If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.

====Other examples of this effect====
The interesting effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line.  The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium.  If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act like a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle's balls to a straight line. For example, [[lithotripsy]] shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]]. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.

====When the simple solution applies====
For the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch a third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear heavier. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.

Even when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.

Small steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30&amp;nbsp;µm in a small Newton's cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.

===More complete solution===
[[File:Newton Cradle 5 ball system in 3D 2 ball swing.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle five-ball system in 3D two-ball swing]]
A cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that is at least twice the distance that the surface of balls compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than 2 balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only 2 balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.

For two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.

Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics, but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton's law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball—and five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.

Most materials like steel that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke's force law for springs, &lt;math&gt;F=k\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz's adjustment to Hooke's law, &lt;math&gt;\ F=k\cdot x^{1.5}&lt;/math&gt;. This and Newton's law for motion (&lt;math&gt;F=m\cdot a&lt;/math&gt;) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that are solved numerically. When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. 40% to 50% of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. 13% of the initial velocity is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3 degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at −7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. When balls are "touching" in subsequent collisions is complex, but still determinable by this method, especially if friction losses is included and the pendulum timing is calculated exactly instead of relying on the small angle approximation.

The differential equations with the initial separations are needed if there is less than 10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (less than width of a human hair) when using 100 gram steel balls with an initial 1&amp;nbsp;m/s strike speed.

The Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hinch/publications/PRSLA455_3201.pdf |title=The fragmentation of a line of balls by an impact |first1=E.J. |last1=Hinch |first2=S. |last2=Saint-Jean |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A |year=1999 |volume=455 |pages=3201–3220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertically direction as the fourth ball.  But in a real Newton's cradle the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ≈10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (given steel, 100&amp;nbsp;g, and 1&amp;nbsp;m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.

===Effect of pressure waves===
The forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of a material builds up to form a pressure wave.  Pressure waves (aka sound) in steel travel about 5&amp;nbsp;cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all 5 balls about 10 times, although dispersing to less of a wave front with more reflections.  This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.

Identically-shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected—but it's less of a wave front with each reflection.

===Effect of different types of balls===
Using different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic.  The size of the spheres doesn't change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, is be lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt; but the energy had to be absorbed and released increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.

===Heat and friction losses===
This discussion has neglected energy losses from heat generated in the balls from non-perfect elasticity, friction in the strings, friction from air resistance, and sound generated from the clank of the vibrating balls. The energy losses are the reason the balls eventually come to a stop, but they are not the primary or initial cause of the action to become more disorderly, away from the ideal action of only one ball moving at any instant. The increase in the non-ideal action is caused by collisions that involve more than two balls at a time, effectively making the struck ball appear heavier. The size of the steel balls is limited because the collisions may exceed the elastic limit of the steel, deforming it and causing heat losses.

==Applications==
The most common application is that of a desktop [[executive toy]]. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]].

A similar principle, the propagation of waves in solids, was used in the Constantinesco [[Synchronization gear]] system for propeller / gun synchronizers on early fighter aircraft.{{elucidate|date=May 2015}}

==History==
[[File:American Science and Surplus - Newton's Cradle.jpg|thumb|right|Large Newton's cradle at American Science and Surplus]]
[[Christiaan Huygens]] used pendulums to study collisions. His work, ''De Motu Corporum ex Percussione'' (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of [[Newton's first law]] and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.

The principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French [[physicist]] [[Edme Mariotte|Abbé Mariotte]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/NewtonianMechanics/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html|title= Harvard website page on Newton's Cradle|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Edme Mariotte]]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton acknowledged Mariotte's work, among that of others, in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

There is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton's cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular [[executive toy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} However, in early 1967, an English actor, [[Simon Prebble]], coined the name "Newton's cradle" (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by [[Harrods]] of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director [[Richard Loncraine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The largest cradle device in the world was designed by ''[[MythBusters]]'' and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel [[rebar]]-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb episode|2074856|Newton's Crane Cradle (5 October 2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two halves to act as a "contact point" for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller scale version constructed by them consists of five {{Convert|6|inch|cm|adj=mid}} chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing {{convert|33|lb|kg}}, and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.

The cradle device with the largest diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball {{convert|26|in|cm}} in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==In popular culture==
Newton's cradle has been used more than 20 times in movies,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=newton%27s-cradle Most Popular "Newton's Cradle" Titles - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; often as a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman's role in ''The Hudsucker Proxy'', Magneto in ''X-Men'', and the Kryptonians in ''Superman II''.  It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in ''Concussion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ Concussion – Cinemaniac Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075312/https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ |date=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler's role in ''Night Shift'', Dustin Hoffman's role in ''Straw Dogs'', and Gwyneth Paltrow's role in ''Iron Man 2''. It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', and as a row of 1968 [[Eero Aarnio]] bubble chairs with scantily-clad women in them in ''Gamer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylessentials.com/?p=385 13 Icons of Modern Design in Movies « Style Essentials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Storks (film)|Storks]]'', Hunter the CEO of Cornerstore has one not with balls, but with little birds.

In 2017, an episode of the ''Omnibus'' [[podcast]], featuring ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' champion [[Ken Jennings]] and musician [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]], focused on the history of Newton's Cradle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omnibusproject.com/podcasts/newtons-cradle-entry-835-1c1311.htm  ''Omnibus'': Newton's Cradle (Entry 835.1C1311)]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director [[Sam Seaborn]] in ''[[The West Wing]]''.

Jefferson Airplane (1968) on the album "Crown of Creation" used the cradle as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track.

'''Palomar Observatory''' is an astronomical [[observatory]] located in [[San Diego County, California]], United States, {{convert|145|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Los Angeles]], California, in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]].  It is owned and operated by the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) located in [[Pasadena, California]]. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University, [http://www.astro.cornell.edu Dept. of Astronomy]: [http://www.astro.cornell.edu/facilities/palomar.php  Palomar Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory operates several telescopes, including the 200-inch ({{convert|200|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Hale Telescope]] and the 48-inch ({{convert|48|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Samuel Oschin Telescope]].  In addition, other instruments and projects have been hosted at the observatory, such as the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the historic 18-inch ({{convert|18|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Schmidt telescope]], Palomar Observatory's first telescope, dating from 1936.

==History==

===Hale's vision for large telescopes and Palomar Observatory===

Astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]], whose vision created the Palomar Observatory, built the world's largest telescope four times. He published an article that was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that the American people would understand and support his project even though the country was in the depths of the Great Depression.

Hale followed this article with a letter to the International Education Board (later absorbed into the [[General Education Board]]) of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] dated April 16, 1928 in which he requested funding for this project. In his letter, Hale stated:

"No method of advancing science is so productive as the development of new and more powerful instruments and methods of research. A larger telescope would not only furnish the necessary gain in light space-penetration and photographic resolving power, but permit the application of ideas and devices derived chiefly from the recent fundamental advances in physics and chemistry."

===Hale Telescope===
{{Main|Hale telescope}}

The 200-inch telescope is named after astronomer and project manager [[George Hale]]. It was built by Caltech with a $6&amp;nbsp;million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, using a [[Pyrex]] blank manufactured by [[Corning Glass Works]] under the direction of George McCauley after several years of unsuccessful attempts by [[General Electric]] under Dr. A.L. Ellis. The first steps toward funding the construction of the 200 inch telescope were taken by Hale in 1928 and included a 23-ton glass block cast by [[José Antonio de Artigas Sanz]]. [[John August Anderson|Dr. J.A. Anderson]] was the initial project manager assigned in  the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TtcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Super Camera of the Skies."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1942, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope (the largest in the world at that time) saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] January 26, 1949 targeting [[NGC 2261]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://365daysofastronomy.org/2009/01/26/january-26-60th-anniversary-of-hale-telescope-first-light/  "60th Anniversary of Hale Telescope,"] ''[[365 Days of Astronomy]]'' (podcast). January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The American astronomer [[Edwin Powell Hubble]] was the first astronomer to use the telescope.

The 200-inch telescope was the largest telescope in the world from 1949 until 1975, when the Russian [[BTA-6]] telescope saw [[first light (astronomy)|first light]]. Astronomers using the Hale Telescope have discovered distant objects at the edges of the known universe called [[quasar]]s and have given us the first direct evidence of stars in distant galaxies. They have studied the structure and chemistry of intergalactic clouds, leading to an understanding of the synthesis of elements in the universe, and have discovered thousands of [[asteroid]]s. A one-tenth-scale engineering model of the telescope at Corning Community College in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], home of the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) was used to discover at least one minor planet, [[34419 Corning]].{{JPL|34419|†}}

===Architecture and design===
[[File:Palomar Observatory Dome - High Resolution.jpg|thumb|Hale Telescope Dome]]

According to the Observatory's Public Affairs Office, [[Russell W. Porter]] was primarily responsible for the [[Art Deco]] architecture of the Observatory's buildings, including the dome of the 200–inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Max Mason]] directed the construction and [[Theodore von Karman]] was involved in the engineering.

===Palomar Observatory and light pollution===

Much of the surrounding region of Southern California has adopted shielded lighting to reduce the [[light pollution]] that would potentially affect the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa International Dark-Sky Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101110647/http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa |date=2008-01-01 }} (IDA): [http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/is020.pdf  "Sky Glow Effect on Existing Large Telescopes"], IDA Info #20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescopes and instruments==
[[Image:P48 1994 Jean Large.jpg|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Jean Mueller]] posing with the [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] ]]

* The 200-inch [[Hale Telescope]] was first proposed in 1928 and has been operational since 1948. It was the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescope in the world]] for 45 years.&lt;ref name=HALE&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 200-inch Hale Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 60-inch reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building. It was dedicated in 1970 to take some of the load off of the Hale Telescope. This telescope was used to discover the first [[brown dwarf]] star.&lt;ref name=60IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 60-inch Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/60-inch.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 48-inch [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] was started in 1938 and installed in 1948. It was initially called the 48–inch Schmidt, and was dedicated to [[Samuel Oschin]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=SOT&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Samuel Oschin Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] was discovered using this instrument.&lt;ref name=SOTD&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Discoveries from Palomar Observatory’s 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html#science |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of Eris triggered the discussions in the international astronomy community that led to [[Pluto]] being re-classified as a [[dwarf planet]].

===Former instruments===

* An 18-inch [[Schmidt camera]] became the first operational telescope at the Palomar in 1936.  In the 1930s, [[Fritz Zwicky]], a Caltech astronomer, discovered over 100 [[supernovae]] in other galaxies with this telescope and gathered the first evidence for dark matter.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] was discovered with this instrument in 1993.  It has since been retired and is on display at the small museum/visitor center.&lt;ref name=18IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 18-inch Schmidt Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#p18 |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] was a multi-telescope instrument that permitted astronomers to make very high resolution measurements of the sizes and positions of objects in space. The shapes of some bright stars have been measured with the PTI.  It operated from 1995 to 2008.&lt;ref name=PTI&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#pti |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Palomar Planet Search Telescope (PPST), aka ''Sleuth,'' was a {{Convert|0.1|m|in|abbr=on}} robotic telescope that operated from 2003 until 2008.  It was dedicated to the search for planets around other stars using the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] method.  It operated in conjunction with telescopes at [[Lowell Observatory]] and in the [[Canary Islands]] as part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).&lt;ref name=PPST&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Sleuth: The Palomar Planet Finder |url=http://palomarskies.blogspot.de/2009/10/goodbye-to-sleuth.html |publisher=Palomar Skies |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The observatory has completed several [[astronomical survey]]s: the first in the 1950s, the second in the 1980s and 1990s, and a third in 2003.

===POSS-I===
The initial [[National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]] (POSS or POSS-I), sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6 [[degree (angle)|degree]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescope. The survey covered the sky from a [[declination]] of +90 degrees ([[Celestial pole|celestial north pole]]) to -27 degrees and all [[right ascension]]s and had a sensitivity to +22 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees [[declination]] was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.

Fritz Zwicky was the first astronomer to observe on Mt. Palomar and was the father of the Sky Survey Technique.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech did recognize Fritz Zwicky's sky survey pioneering work; however, The Big Picture project failed to recognize his contribution to the sky survey technique in the introductory panel at the Griffith Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) produced images which were based on the photographic data developed in the course of POSS-I.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS): [http://aps.umn.edu/ MAPS catalogue;] Mollise, Rod. (2006). {{Google books|Z0mvZk0s_TMC|''The Urban Astronomer's Guide: a Walking tour of the Cosmos for City Sky Watchers,'' p. 238.|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.B. Whiteoak, an Australian radio astronomer, used the same instrument to broaden this POSS-I data further.  Whiteoaks observations extended south to about -45 degrees [[declination]], using the same field centers as the corresponding northern declination zones. Unlike POSS-I, the [[Whiteoak extension]] consisted only of red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates.

===POSS-II===
{{Redirect|Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|POSS I|Palomar Sky Survey}}

The '''Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey''' ('''POSS II''', sometimes '''Second Palomar Sky Survey''') was performed in the 1980s and 1990s that made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was given an achromatic corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ), red (IIIaF) and near infrared (IVN) plates, respectively. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, [[J. Dave Mendenhall]], K. Rykoski, [[Jeffrey L. Phinney]] and [[Jean Mueller]] (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets during the course of POSS II and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then graduate student C. Wilson early in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516193335/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html |date=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the completion of the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), POSS II was the most extensive wide-field sky survey ever. When completed, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] will surpass ''POSS I'' and ''POSS II'' in depth, although the POSS covers almost 2.5 times more area on the sky.

POSS II also exists in digitized form (i.e., the photographic plates were scanned), both in photographic form as the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS)&lt;ref&gt;NASA/Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).: [http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/  &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ultimission &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rchive at &lt;u&gt;ST&lt;/u&gt;ScI (MAST)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=this appears to be an incomplete sentence|date=March 2012}}

===QUEST===
The multi-year POSS projects were followed by the Palomar [[Quasar Equatorial Survey Team]] (QUEST) Variability survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech press release: [http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12417.html "New Sky Survey Begins at Palomar Observatory."] July 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This survey yielded results that were used by several projects, including the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] project. Another program that used the QUEST results discovered [[90377 Sedna]] on 14 November 2003, and around 40 [[Kuiper belt]] objects. Other programs that share the camera are [[Shri Kulkarni]]'s search for [[Gamma ray burster|gamma-ray bursts]] (this takes advantage of the automated telescope's ability to react as soon as a burst is seen and take a series of snapshots of the fading burst), [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]]' search for [[supernova]]e to test whether the [[universe's expansion]] is accelerating or not, and [[S. George Djorgovski]]'s [[quasar]] search.

The camera for the Palomar QUEST Survey was a mosaic of 112 [[Charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) covering the whole (4 degree by 4 degree) field of view of the Schmidt telescope, the largest CCD mosaic used in an astronomical camera when built. This instrument was used to produce The Big Picture, the largest astronomical photograph ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ "The Big Picture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204102050/http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Big Picture is on display at [[Griffith Observatory]].

===Current research===
Current research programs on the 200-inch Hale Telescope cover the range of the observable universe including studies on near-Earth asteroids, outer solar system planets, Kuiper Belt Objects, star formation, exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;JPL: [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-090 "Planet-Hunting Method Succeeds at Last."] May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; gamma-ray bursts, black holes, quasars and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl Hale Telescope Observing Runs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212205940/http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope is actively working on a new sky survey, the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] (PTF).&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/ Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 60-inch telescope is used for a variety of projects including follow-up observations for the Palomar Transient Factory and is a rapid response telescope for [[gamma-ray bursts]].

===Clearest images===
In September 2007, a team of [[astronomer]]s from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] released some of the clearest pictures ever taken of [[outer space]].  The pictures were obtained through the use of a new hybrid "[[Lucky imaging]]" and "[[adaptive optics]]" system that sharpens pictures taken from the Palomar Observatory.  The resolution attained exceeds that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6975961.stm "'Clearest' images taken of space,"] BBC.

==Visiting==

The Palomar Observatory is an active research facility. However, parts of it are open to the public during the day. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the 200-inch telescope daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The observatory is open 7 days a week, year round, except for December 24 and 25 and during times of inclement weather. Guided tours of the 200-inch Hale Telescope dome and observing area are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October.  Details are available at the [http://palomar-observatory.org Observatory's web site].   There is a visitor's center and a gift shop on the grounds. Behind-the-scenes tours for the public are offered through the community support group, [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/friends.html Friends of Palomar Observatory].  Periodic tours are also organized by the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben H. Fleet Science Center: [http://www.rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html Palomar Observatory tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030411112150/http://rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html |date=2003-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The observatory is located off [[California State Route 76|State Route 76]] in northern [[San Diego County, California]], is two hours' drive from downtown [[San Diego]], and three hours' drive from central [[Los Angeles]] ( [[UCLA]], [[LAX]] airport ).  Those staying at nearby Palomar Campground can visit Palomar Observatory by hiking {{convert|2.2|mi|km}} up Observatory Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Observatory Trail in Cleveland National Forest | url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/observatory-trail-palomar-mountain/ | website=hikespeak.com | publisher=Hikespeak | accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the October 11 and 12, 1989, [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic strips, Calvin has a dream where Stupendous Man takes the lens from the Palomar Observatory telescope (though really the telescope has a mirror and not a lens) and uses it to destroy his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/search.php?phrase=stupendous+man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian band [[The Rheostatics]]' 1992 release ''[[Whale Music (album)|Whale Music]]'' features a track entitled "Palomar." The song depicts a man named Palomar on the top of a mount, cleaning his lenses with saline waters, and assembling his kaleidoscope in his lonely observatory.  The song presents a visual characterization of a man on a mountain and his relationship with his best friend, a dog.

In 1994, Palomar is mentioned in the first episode of season 2 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]". [[Fox Mulder]] refers to Hale's suggestion that an [[elf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Hale.html Biography of George Ellery Hale] at scienceworld.wolfram.com&lt;/ref&gt; crawled through his window and told him to build the observatory.

The band [[Wellwater Conspiracy]]'s 1997 debut album, ''[[Declaration of Conformity]]'', contains an instrumental track entitled "Palomar Observatory."  Wellwater Conspiracy singer/drummer [[Matt Cameron]] grew up in [[San Diego]] near the observatory.

[[File:Dan2parallel.jpg|thumb|A paraphrase of the [[Book of Daniel]] placing in parallel prophecy and interprephrases]]

A '''paraphrase''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|f|r|eɪ|z}} is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The term itself is derived via [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|paraphrasis}}'' from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, meaning "additional manner of expression".  The act of paraphrasing is also called "paraphrasis".

A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, "The signal was red" might be paraphrased as "The train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red". A paraphrase is usually introduced with ''[[verbum dicendi]]''—a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in "The signal was red, ''that is'', the train was not allowed to proceed," the ''that is'' signals the paraphrase that follows.

A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct [[quotation]], the paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a [[:wikt:summary|summary]]. One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for example: When the light was red, trains could not go (Wikipedia).

Paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as "original [[research]]," and not as  paraphrase.

Unlike a [[metaphrase|''meta''phrase]], which represents a "formal equivalent" of the source, a ''para''phrase represents a "dynamic equivalent" thereof. While a metaphrase attempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential thought expressed in a source text&amp;#8203;, &amp;#8203;if necessary, at the expense of [[literal and figurative language|literality]]. For details, see [[dynamic and formal equivalence]].

The term is applied to the genre of [[Biblical paraphrase]]s, which were the most widely circulated versions of the Bible available in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="jh"&gt;{{cite journal|first=James H. |last=Morey |title=Peter Comestar, Biblical Paraphrase, and the Medieval Popular Bible |journal=Speculum |volume=68 |number=1 |date=January 1993 |pages=6–35 |doi=10.2307/2863832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the purpose was not to render an exact rendition of the meaning or the complete text, but to present material from the Bible in a version that was theologically orthodox and not subject to heretical interpretation, or, in most cases, to take from the Bible and present to a wide public material that was interesting, entertaining and spiritually meaningful, or, simply to abridge the text.&lt;ref name="jh"/&gt;

The phrase "in your own words" is often used within this context to imply that the writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style - how they would have written it if they had created the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/skillsforstudy/writing-in-your-own-words.php | title=Writing in your own words | publisher=The Open University | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, there are some models to learn and recognize paraphrase on natural language texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259174469_Learning_to_Rank_Effective_Paraphrases_from_Query_Logs_for_Community_Question_Answering  |title=Learning to Rank Effective Paraphrases from Query Logs for Community Question Answering |conference= AAAI |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences can also be automatically paraphrased using [[text simplification]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Shardlow, Matthew.

[[File:pitturainfamantesketch.jpg|thumb|right|Preparatory drawings for ''pittura infamante'' by [[Andrea del Sarto]]]]
[[File:schandbild.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] ''[[:de:schandbild|schandbild]]'' (circa 1490)]]

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of ''pittura infamante''==
;Bologna
*[[Konrad von Landau]], painted on the walls of [[Bologna]] for treachery; in response Landau created his own "''pittura infamante''" on the saddle of his horse, depicting the local politicians hung upside down by their feet in the hand of a giant whore.&lt;ref&gt;Caferro, 2006, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fermo

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">A '''practical engineer''' (Senior Technician)({{lang-he|הנדסאי}}) is a professional degree awarded by [[List of Israeli universities and colleges#Colleges|technological college]]s in [[Israel]] and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/B0B48981-357D-446F-AFAC-91A358E93C87.htm Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor (State of Israel)] Retrieved on 15 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel. It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline.

== Professional regulation ==
Practical Engineers are used to mediate between professional engineers and engineering technicians.  While most of the decision making process is performed by professional engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by professional engineers.

In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the [[hi-tech]] industry and form an important work-force.

Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level. For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high with 2 dimensional static scheme and spans up to 6 meters, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required.

== Education, training &amp; skills ==
Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training.
In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years.

From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics.

Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused.

As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an [[internship]] program.

== Equivalent qualifications ==
There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero Técnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as [[Engineering Technician|Engineering technicians]], [[Associate degree|Associate Engineers]] or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries. The French [[Brevet de Technicien Supérieur]] is similar.

Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a [[Bachelor's degree]]

A '''pseudorandom''' process is a process that appears to be [[randomness|random]] but is not. Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit [[statistical randomness]] while being generated by an entirely [[Deterministic system|deterministic causal process]]. Such a process is easier to produce than a genuinely random one, and has the benefit that it can be used again and again to produce exactly the same numbers, which is useful for testing and fixing software.

To generate truly random numbers would require precise, accurate, and repeatable system measurements of absolutely non-deterministic processes. [[Linux]] uses, for example, various system timings (like user keystrokes, I/O, or least-significant digit voltage measurements) to produce a pool of random numbers. It attempts to constantly replenish the pool, depending on the level of importance, and so will issue a random number. This system is an example, and similar to those of dedicated hardware random number generators. Even with all of this work, it is not truly random.

==History==

The generation of random numbers has many uses (mostly in [[statistics]], for random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]], and [[simulation]]). Before modern computing, researchers requiring random numbers would either generate them through various means ([[dice]], [[playing cards|cards]], [[roulette|roulette wheels]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  etc.) or use existing random number tables.

The first attempt to provide researchers with a ready supply of random digits was in 1927, when the Cambridge University Press published a table of 41,600 digits developed by [[L.H.C. Tippett]]. In 1947, the [[RAND Corporation]] generated numbers by the electronic simulation of a roulette wheel;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1418/index2.html|title=A Million Random Digits {{!}} RAND|website=www.rand.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results were eventually published in 1955  as ''[[A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]]''.

==Almost random==
A pseudorandom variable is a variable which is created by a [[deterministic algorithm]], often a computer program or subroutine, which in most cases takes random bits as input. The pseudorandom string will typically be longer than the original random string, but less random (less [[Information entropy|entropic]] in the [[information theory]] sense). This can be useful for randomized algorithms.

[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely used in such applications as computer modeling (e.g., [[Markov chain]]s), statistics, experimental design, etc.

==In computational complexity==
In [[theoretical computer science]], a [[probability distribution|distribution]] is '''pseudorandom''' against a class of adversaries if no adversary from the class can distinguish it from the uniform distribution with significant advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Goldreich. Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
This notion of pseudorandomness is studied in [[computational complexity theory]] and has applications to [[cryptography]].

Formally, let ''S'' and ''T'' be finite sets and let '''F''' = {''f'': ''S'' → ''T''} be a class of functions.  A [[probability distribution|distribution]] '''D''' over ''S'' is ε-'''pseudorandom''' against '''F''' if for every ''f'' in '''F''', the [[total variation distance|statistical distance]] between the distributions ''f''(''X''), where ''X'' is sampled from '''D''',  and ''f''(''Y''), where ''Y'' is sampled from the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] on ''S'', is at most ε.

In typical applications, the class '''F''' describes a model of computation with bounded resources
and one is interested in designing distributions '''D''' with certain properties that are pseudorandom against '''F'''.  The distribution '''D''' is often specified as the output of a [[pseudorandom generator]].

==Cryptography==

{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}

Though random numbers are needed in [[cryptography]], the use of [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom number generators]] (whether [[Hardware random number generator|hardware]] or [[Random number generation|software]] or some combination) is insecure. When random values are required in cryptography, the goal is to make a message as hard to crack as possible, by eliminating or obscuring the parameters used to encrypt the message (the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) from the message itself or from the context in which it is carried.  Pseudorandom sequences are deterministic and reproducible; all that is required in order to discover and reproduce a pseudorandom sequence is the algorithm used to generate it and the initial [[Seed (randomness)|seed]].  So the entire sequence of numbers is only as powerful as the randomly chosen parts - sometimes the algorithm and the seed, but usually only the seed.

There are many examples in cryptographic history of ciphers, otherwise excellent, in which random choices were not random enough and security was lost as a direct consequence. The [[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese [[PURPLE]] cipher machine used for diplomatic communications is a good example. It was consistently broken throughout World War II, mostly because the "key values" used were insufficiently random. They had patterns, and those patterns made any intercepted traffic readily decryptable. Had the keys (i.e. the initial settings of the stepping switches in the machine) been made unpredictably (i.e. randomly), that traffic would have been much harder to break, and perhaps even secure in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-u-s-cracked-japans-purple-encryption-machine-458385664|title=How the U.S. Cracked Japan's 'Purple Encryption Machine' at the Dawn of World War II|last=Alberto-Perez|work=io9|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In security==

Since pseudorandom numbers are in fact deterministic, a given seed will always determine the same pseudorandom number.  This attribute is used in security, in the form of [[rolling code]] to avoid [[replay attack]]s, in which a command would be intercepted to be used by a thief at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Brain, M., "[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/remote-entry.htm How Remote Entry Works]", ''HowStuffWorks''  Auto Auto Basics. Retrieved July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monte Carlo method simulations==

A [[Monte Carlo method]] simulation is defined as any method that utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation.  Monte Carlo simulations are applied to many topics including [[quantum chromodynamics]], cancer radiation therapy, traffic flow, [[stellar evolution]] and VLSI design.  All these simulations require the use of random numbers and therefore [[pseudorandom number generator]]s, which makes creating random-like numbers very important.

A simple example of how a computer would perform a Monte Carlo simulation is the calculation of [[Pi|π]].  If a square enclosed a circle and a point were randomly chosen inside the square the point would either lie inside the circle or outside it.  If the process were repeated many times, the ratio of the random points that lie inside the circle to the total number of random points in the square would approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square.  From this we can estimate pi, as shown in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code below utilizing a [[SciPy]] package to generate pseudorandom numbers with the [[Mersenne twister|MT19937]] algorithm.  Note that this method is a computationally inefficient way to [[Numerical approximations of π|numerically approximate π]].
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import scipy
N=100000
x_array = scipy.random.rand(N) 
y_array = scipy.random.rand(N) 
# generate N pseudorandom independent x and y-values on interval [0,1)
N_qtr_circle = sum(x_array**2+y_array**2 &lt; 1) 
# Number of pts within the quarter circle x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1 centered at the origin with radius r=1. 
# True area of quarter circle is pi/4 and has N_qtr_circle points within it.
# True area of the square is 1 and has N points within it, hence we approximate pi with
pi_approx = 4*float(N_qtr_circle)/N # Typical values: 3.13756, 3.15156
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12190">The '''Records of Early English Drama (REED)''' is a performance history research project, based at the [[University of Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1976 by a group of international scholars interested in understanding “the native tradition of English playmaking that apparently flourished in late medieval provincial towns”&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the context for the development of the [[English Renaissance theatre]], including the work of [[Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries.  REED’s primary focus is to locate, transcribe, edit, and publish historical documents from England, Wales, and Scotland containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and mimetic ceremony from the late [[Middle Ages]] until 1642, when the [[Puritans]] closed the London public theatres. 

From its inception in 1976 to 2016, REED published twenty-seven print collections of records edited by over thirty international scholars. REED is also engaged in creating a collection of free digital resources for research and education including ''Patrons and Performances''&lt;ref name="PandP"&gt;[https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/ ''Patrons and Performances''] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mlabib.mla.hcommons.org/2014/05/26/website-of-the-week-wow-147-reed-patrons-and-performances-web-site/ Website of the Week (WoW) #147: REED: Patrons and Performances] – entry on the ''Patrons and Performances'' website from the MLA International Bibliography blog, part of [[Modern Languages Association]]’s [https://hcommons.org/ Humanities Commons].

In March 2017, REED moved to digital publication of records with the launch of ''REED Online'',&lt;ref name="REEDonline"&gt;[https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/ ''REED Online''] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;  a publication site where records will be freely available.  

==History==

During a 1970-71 research trip in [[York]], England, to study manuscripts related to the York cycle of biblical plays (also known as the [[York Mystery Plays]]), Alexandra F. Johnston, an early drama scholar from the University of Toronto, came across a manuscript transcription of a 1433 indenture agreement between the leaders of the medieval Mercers' Guild and their pageant masters. The document contained details of a medieval pageant wagon and sophisticated staging unknown to researchers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnston also met Margaret Dorrell, an Australian graduate student at the [[University of Leeds]], who was working on a similar project related to the York records; the two women decided to collaborate.

Within the next two years, Johnston and Dorrell met other scholars of medieval and Renaissance drama working independently on manuscripts from other English cities (David Galloway of the [[University of New Brunswick]] on [[Norwich]], Reginald Ingram of the [[University of British Columbia]] on [[Coventry]], and Lawrence Clopper of [[Indiana University Bloomington]] on [[Chester]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of a scholarly publishing project to find, transcribe, and edit documentary evidence of performance arose from these meetings and was met with interest by the individual researchers and their academic communities. 

In January 1974, Johnston circulated a position paper on the project. Discussions and planning followed and, in February 1975, the inaugural REED meeting was held at [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria University]] in the University of Toronto. In 1975-76, Johnston received a Canada Council personal grant for the publication of the York records as a pilot project, and in late 1976, REED was officially launched with a [[Canada Council]] ten-year Major Editorial Grant for the proposed series of collections, establishing REED as a long-term research and publishing project.  Because three of the four initial collections were edited by Canadian researchers, Toronto, Canada, became the home of the project.  

In 1979, REED published its first two collections of records: York, edited by Alexandra F. Johnston and Margaret Rogerson (née Dorrell), and Chester, edited by Lawrence D. Clopper.  Since then the project has expanded its scope from major cities and towns to all the counties of England, Wales, and Scotland, based on historic pre-1642 county borders.

After its inception in 1976, REED produced the bi-annual ''REED Newsletter'' which, in 1997, became the refereed scholarly journal ''[[Early Theatre]]''. 

REED has had close ties to the English Department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.utoronto.ca/ Department of English, University of Toronto] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre for Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://medieval.utoronto.ca/ Centre for Medieval Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CMS), the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies&lt;ref&gt;[https://crrs.ca/ Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CRRS), and the Graduate Centre for Study of Drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dramacentre.utoronto.ca/ Graduate Centre for Study of Drama] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1976 to 2009 the project was based at Victoria University in the University of Toronto.  In 2009 the offices of the project moved to the English Department.  REED retains active relationships with the English Department, the CMS, and the [[University of Toronto Libraries]]. REED’s internal governance is provided by an Executive Board of senior scholars in early drama and related fields, with digital advisors and collections editors drawn from Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 

REED has collaborated with the [[Poculi Ludique Societas]] (PLS) to mount four productions of full cycles of medieval biblical dramas: the ''York Plays''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beadle |first=Richard |title=The York Plays: A Critical Edition of the York Corpus Christi Play as recorded in British Library Additional ms 35290. |year=2009 |volume=2 vols. |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford UP for the Early English Text Society |isbn=0-1995-9036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the [[York Mystery Plays]]) in 1977 and 1998, and the ''Chester Plays'' (also called the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]) in 1983 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.chass.utoronto.ca/plspls/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/index.html The Chester Plays] - an acting text adapted by Alexandra F. Johnston for the 2010 performances.&lt;/ref&gt; with participation from international amateur theatre groups.

In November 2002, REED, in partnership with the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], hosted the Picturing Shakespeare symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |date=22 December 2001 |title=Experts to Debate Sanders Painting |work=Globe and Mail |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |title=Face-off over a Portrait |work=Globe and Mail |date=20 November 2002 |page=R5}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition of and an accompanying public symposium regarding the [[Sanders portrait]], an Elizabethan painting reputed to be the only one of Shakespeare made during his lifetime.

In addition to revealing evidence of vernacular entertainment activities, the research work for the collections produces a body of knowledge regarding professional travelling entertainers, their patronage, and their performance venues.  This cumulative information was first launched for public use through the Patrons and Performances&lt;ref name="PandP" /&gt; website in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Audrey and Sally-Beth MacLean, “Introduction,” p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, REED collaborated with the [[Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London]], and the Department of English at the [[University of Southampton]] to create ''Early Modern London Theatres''&lt;ref name="EMLoT" /&gt; (''EMLoT''), a research database and educational resource, with learning modules.  ''EMLoT'' gathers documents related to professional theatres north and south of the Thames up to 1642 and bibliographic information about their subsequent transcriptions, documenting how scholars “got [their] information about the early theatres, from whom and when.”&lt;ref&gt;Principal investigator John McGavin quoted in {{cite magazine |last=Reisz |first=Matthew  |title=Reading the Riot Acts and Scenes of London's Violent Theatrical Past |date=3 March 2011 |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reading-the-riot-acts-and-scenes-of-londons-violent-theatrical-past/415326.article |magazine=[[Times Higher Education]] |access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, REED collaborated with the [[BBC]] and [[The British Library]] to produce an ongoing public website titled Shakespeare on Tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 Shakespeare on Tour] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many REED editors contributed stories and images from their research in the Elizabethan period to help raise “the curtain on performances of The Bard’s plays countrywide from the 16th Century to the present day.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 |title=Shakespeare on Tour, Homepage |access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout its existence, REED maintained its primary focus and published about six collections each decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reed.utoronto.ca/print-collections-2/print-collections/ |title=Published Collections |publisher=REED |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, REED published its last print collection (''Civic London to 1558'', edited by Anne Lancashire),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=King |first=Pamela |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/reed-drama/ |title=Unbroken REED |magazine=Times Literary Supplement |date=26 May 2017 |access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2017, the first digital collection (''Staffordshire'', edited by Alan B. Somerset) was made freely available on its publication website, ''REED Online''&lt;ref name="REEDonline" /&gt;. All subsequent collections will be added to this database and website.

REED has received substantial funding from private individuals and foundations (including the Jackman Foundation), the [[Canada Council]], and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] in Canada; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] in the U.S.; as well as the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and [[The British Academy]] in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rynor |first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2848">'''Related services''' is defined by the [[United States]] '''''[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] ("IDEA")''''' 1997 as,
:"transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education..."[section 300.24(a)]. 

Students who need [[special education]] and specially designed instruction are eligible for related serves under ''IDEA''.  During the evaluation process the student is evaluated to first find out if the student has a disability, and secondly to determine what types of related services the student requires.  Within ''IDEA'' it can be in many forms. 

The related services include:  audiology, counseling services, early identification, family training-counseling and home visits, health services, medical services, nursing services, nutrition services, occupational therapy, orientation and mobility services, parent counseling and training, physical therapy, psychological services, recreation and therapeutic recreation, rehabilitative counseling services, interpretation services,  school health services, service coordination services, social work services in schools, speech pathology and speech-language pathology, transportation and related costs, and assistive technology and services.  Related services were mandated in the ''IDEA'' 1997, and more than 6.1 million children with disabilities received related services in 1998-1999 (Nichcy). 

Children with exceptionalities depend on related services in their individualized education programs.  The related services according to ''IDEA'', "...assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education" [section 300.24(a)].  Related services also help children with exceptionalities to reach their IEP goals and objectives.  In fact, in the IEP the related services section is located directly after the goals and objectives section.  The IEP requires the document constructor to list the service provided, the location that the service will be provided in, the frequency that the service will be provided, the projected beginning date of the service, and the anticipated duration of the service.  In order to make sure that this section of the IEP is written correctly is it essential that the service provider of the particular service either attend the IEP meeting, or send a written document describing the details of the service that will be provided.

'''''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism''''' was an exhibition curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48720&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, through bringing about a hundred works each of four modern Indian artists, namely [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] on the centre stage, put the Santiniketan art movement into focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1418/14180690.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar argues that the "Santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style, and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique. Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual modernism==
The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition "Place for People"—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian Kumar’s exhibition and related publication, ''A Contextual Modernism'', focused on the [[Santiniketan]] artists [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. Of the Santiniketan artists, Kumar observed that they "reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kumar "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual modernism and the Bengal School of Art==
{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kumar had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 1980s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was misleading. According to Kumar, "this happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiniketan: art movement and school==
{{History of art sidebar}}
Kumar draws distinction between ''Santiniketan the art movement'' and ''Santiniketan the School'':

{{Quotation| I am not sure, however, if everyone noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan as an art movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position and the other a modernist position. I am not suggesting that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.|''ALL THE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF THE LIVED WORLD &lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The shared perspectives==
{{Quotation|The brief survey of the individual works of the core Santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but by a community of ideas. Which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward. Thus they do not represent a school but a movement.|''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism, 1997}}

'''Teleconnection''' in [[atmospheric science]] refers to climate anomalies being related to each other at large distances (typically thousands of kilometers). The most emblematic teleconnection is that linking sea-level [[pressure]] at [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]], which defines the [[Southern Oscillation]].

== History ==
Teleconnections were first noted by the British meteorologist [[Sir Gilbert Walker]] in the late 19th century, through computation of the [[correlation]] between [[time series]] of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature and rainfall. They served as a building block for the understanding of climate variability, by showing that the latter was not purely [[random]].

Indeed, the term [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is an implicit acknowledgment that the phenomenon underlies variability in several locations at once. It was later noticed that associated teleconnections occurred all over North America, as embodied by the [[Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern]].

In the 1980s, improved observations allowed to detect teleconnections at larger distances throughout the [[troposphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1981)109&lt;0784:TITGHF&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1981|volume=109|pages=784|title=Teleconnections in the Geopotential Height Field during the Northern Hemisphere Winter|last1=Wallace|first1=John M.|last2=Gutzler|first2=David S.|journal=Monthly Weather Review|issue=4|bibcode=1981MWRv..109..784W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concomitantly, the theory emerged that such patterns could be understood through the dispersion of [[Rossby waves]] due to the spherical geometry of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038&lt;1179:TSLROA&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1981|volume=38|pages=1179|title=The Steady Linear Response of a Spherical Atmosphere to Thermal and Orographic Forcing|last1=Hoskins|first1=Brian J.|last2=Karoly|first2=David J.|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|issue=6|bibcode=1981JAtS...38.1179H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called the "proto-model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/97JC01444|title=Progress during TOGA in understanding and modeling global teleconnections associated with tropical sea surface temperatures|year=1998|last1=Trenberth|first1=Kevin E.|last2=Branstator|first2=Grant W.|last3=Karoly|first3=David|last4=Kumar|first4=Arun|last5=Lau|first5=Ngar-Cheung|last6=Ropelewski|first6=Chester|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=103|pages=14291|bibcode=1998JGR...10314291T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Teleconnections within the tropical Pacific began to be understood thanks to the idealized calculations of A.E. Gill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/qj.49710644905 |title=Some simple solutions for heat-induced tropical circulation |year=1980 |last1=Gill |first1=A. E. |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=106 |issue=449 |pages=447|bibcode = 1980QJRMS.106..447G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later through more complex models.

Building upon the "proto-model", much of the early theory of teleconnections dealt with [[barotropic]], [[linear]]ized model of atmospheric flow about a constant mean state. However, the model was soon invalidated when it was discovered that actual teleconnection patterns were nearly insensitive to the location of the forcing, in direct contradiction with the predictions offered by this simple picture. 
Simmons and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1983)040&lt;1363:BWPAIA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=1983 |volume=40 |pages=1363 |title=Barotropic Wave Propagation and Instability, and Atmospheric Teleconnection Patterns |last1=Simmons |first1=A. J. |last2=Wallace |first2=J. M. |last3=Branstator |first3=G. W. |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |issue=6|bibcode = 1983JAtS...40.1363S }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if a more realistic background state was prescribed, it would become [[unstable]], leading to a similar pattern regardless of the location of the forcing, in accordance to observations. This "modal" property turned out to be an artifact of the barotropicity of the model, though it has appeared for more subtle reasons in more realistic models.

More recent work has shown that most teleconnections from the tropics to the extratropics can be understood to surprising accuracy by the propagation of linear, [[planetary waves]] upon a 3-dimensional seasonally-varying basic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015&lt;2125:NWSWTA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2002 |volume=15 |pages=2125 |title=Northern Winter Stationary Waves: Theory and Modeling |last1=Held |first1=Isaac M. |last2=Ting |first2=Mingfang |last3=Wang |first3=Hailan |journal=Journal of Climate |issue=16|bibcode = 2002JCli...15.2125H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the patterns are persistent over time and somewhat "locked" to geographical features such as mountain ranges, these waves are called ''[[standing wave|stationary]]''.

Another mechanism of teleconnection between tropical oceans and midlatitude regions is symmetric along latitude circles (i.e. "zonal") and between hemispheres, unlike the stationary wave mechanism. It relies on interactions between transient [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] and the mean atmospheric flow that are mutually reinforcing (i.e. [[non-linear]]). It has been shown to explain some aspects of ENSO teleconnections in temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;2960:MOHSCV&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 |volume=16 |pages=2960 |title=Mechanisms of Hemispherically Symmetric Climate Variability* |last1=Seager |first1=Richard |last2=Harnik |first2=Nili |last3=Kushnir |first3=Yochanan |last4=Robinson |first4=Walter |last5=Miller |first5=Jennifer |journal=Journal of Climate |issue=18|bibcode = 2003JCli...16.2960S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1256/qj.04.96 |title=Mechanisms of ENSO-forcing of hemispherically symmetric precipitation variability |year=2005 |last1=Seager |first1=R. |last2=Harnik |first2=N. |last3=Robinson |first3=W.

== Applications ==
Since tropical [[sea surface temperature]]s are predictable up to two years ahead of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02439 |title=Predictability of El Niño over the past 148 years |year=2004 |last1=Chen |first1=Dake |last2=Cane |first2=Mark A. |last3=Kaplan |first3=Alexey |last4=Zebiak |first4=Stephen E. |last5=Huang |first5=Daji |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6984 |pages=733–6 |pmid=15085127|bibcode = 2004Natur.428..733C }}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of teleconnection patterns gives some amount of predictability in remote locations with an outlook sometimes as long as a few seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110043157/http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=944&amp;PageID=0&amp;cached=true&amp;mode=2&amp;userID=2 IRI Seasonal Climate Forecasts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For instance, predicting [[El Niño]] enables prediction of North American rainfall, snowfall, droughts or temperature patterns with a few weeks to months lead time. In [[Sir Gilbert Walker]]'s time, A strong El Niño usually meant a weaker [[Monsoon#Global_monsoons|Indian monsoon]], but this [[anticorrelation]] has weakened in the 1980s and 1990s, for controversial reasons.{{fact|date=January 2014}}

== Overview ==
[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew [[Edward Bernays]], who was the first to use psychological techniques in [[public relations]], are discussed in part one. His daughter [[Anna Freud]], a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in part two. [[Wilhelm Reich]], an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.

Along these lines, ''The Century of the Self'' asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of [[consumerism]] and [[commodification]] and their implications. It also questions the modern way people see themselves, the attitudes to [[fashion]], and [[superficiality]].

The business and political worlds use psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill the desires of the public, and to make their products and speeches as pleasing as possible to consumers and voters. Curtis questions the intentions and origins of this relatively new approach to engaging the public.

Where once the political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a group, [[Stuart Ewen]], a historian of public relations, argues that politicians now appeal to [[Instinct|primitive impulses]] that have little bearing on issues outside the narrow self-interests of a consumer society.

The words of Paul Mazur, a leading [[Wall Street]] banker working for [[Lehman Brothers]] in 1927, are cited: "We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. [...] Man's desires must overshadow his needs."&lt;ref&gt;Note: the quote is from a 1927 article by Mazur in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part four the main subjects are [[Philip Gould]], a political strategist, and [[Matthew Freud]], a PR consultant and the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud. In the 1990s, they were instrumental to bringing the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the US and [[New Labour]] in the United Kingdom back into power through use of the [[focus group]], originally invented by psychoanalysts employed by US corporations to allow consumers to express their feelings and needs, just as patients do in psychotherapy.

Curtis ends by saying that, "Although we feel we are free, in reality, we—like the politicians—have become the slaves of our own desires," and compares Britain and America to 'Democracity', an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] created by Edward Bernays.

'''The Continence of Scipio''', or '''The Clemency of Scipio''', is an episode recounted by [[Livy]] of the Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]] during his campaign in Spain during the [[Second Punic War]]. He refused a generous ransom for a young female prisoner, returning her to her fiance '''Allucius''', who in return became a supporter of Rome.  In recognition of his magnanimous treatment of a prisoner, he was taken as one of the prime examples of mercy during warfare in classical times. Interest in the story revived in the [[Renaissance]] and the episode figured widely thereafter in both the literary and figurative arts.

==The classical story==
[[File:Nicolò dell'Abate - The Continence of Scipio - WGA00015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Nicolò dell'Abate]], ''The Continence of Scipio'', c. 1555.]]
The story related by Livy in his history of Rome was followed by all later writers, although it is recorded that the earlier historian [[Valerius Antias]] took a dissenting view.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.550&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy's account of the siege of the Carthaginian colony of [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]], the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] prince Allucius was betrothed to a beautiful virgin who was taken prisoner by Scipio Africanus in 209 BC.  Despite having a reputation for womanizing, instead of the usual brutal treatment given to attractive female "barbarian" prisoners, Scipio summoned her parents and fiance, who arrived with a ransom of treasure. Scipio refused this and returned her to them, asking only that they be friends to Rome.  When they offered the ransom as a present, he accepted it, only to return it immediately as a wedding gift from himself.  Allucius then brought over his tribe to support the Roman armies in gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0158%3Abook%3D26%3Achapter%3D50 Book 26, chapter 50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], iv. 3. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sil. Ital. xv. 268 &amp;c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern treatments==
===Literature and opera===
This episode was a popular motif for [[exemplary literature]] from that time on, growing to a peak of popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Prior to this period, it was given pride of place in the story of Scipio inserted into translations of [[Plutarch’s Lives]] that was written originally by the Dutchman [[Carolus Clusius]] in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.519&lt;/ref&gt; Among dramatic treatments of the story, one of the foremost was the ''Scipion'' of [[Jean Desmarets]] (1638), which was then adapted into Dutch by Jan Lemmers as ''Schipio in Karthago'' (1649) and also performed later as ''Schipio en Olinde''. In England a verse drama on the episode, ''Scipio Africanus'', was chiefly distinguished by being the work of a schoolboy, [[Charles Beckingham]]. It was acted and later printed in 1718. 

Operatic treatments were numerous, with several composers setting the same libretto. So, for example, [[Nicolo Minato]]'s ''Scipione Africano'' was set, or served as the basis for adaptations, by [[Francesco Cavalli]] (1662); [[Carlo Ambrogio Lonati]] (1692); [[Francesco Bianchi (composer)|Francesco Bianchi]] (1787); and [[Gioacchino Albertini]] (1789). In addition, there was [[Johann Sigismund Kusser]]'s German version, ''Der großmütige Scipio Africanus'' (1694). [[Giovanni Battista Boccabadati]]'s prose drama ''Scipione'' (1693) served as the basis for [[Apostolo Zeno]]'s ''Scipione nelle Spagne''.  This was performed in 1710, with music possibly by [[Antonio Caldara]], and was also set by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1714), [[Tomaso Albinoni]] (1724), [[George Friederic Handel]] (1726), [[Carlo Arrigoni]] (1739), and  [[Leonardo Leo]] (1740). [[Johann Christian Bach]]'s ''La Clemenza di Scipione'' (1778) was also based upon it.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi - The Continence of Scipio Africanus - WGA01544.jpg|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]]]
There were numerous artistic depictions of the mercy and sexual restraint of Scipio although, as with the operas, they go now by a variety of titles. "The Continence of Scipio" is most common in English, although "The Clemency of Scipio" is also found. In other languages the terms magnanimity (''großmütigheit'') and generosity are alternatives. There is also sometimes a difficulty in identifying which scene is intended. The most common alternative example of military clemency descending from classical times was [[Alexander the Great]]'s generous treatment of the family of the defeated Persian King [[Darius III|Darius]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]]. The scene of a victorious general seated at the centre of the composition with kneeling figures before him might portray either story without other clues to its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.524&lt;/ref&gt;  

Typically, Scipio sits on a throne on a raised dias, stretching out an arm in the direction of the Spanish party, with their treasure laid out in front of them. The "continence" shown by Scipio is both sexual and financial.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle&lt;/ref&gt;   The story of [[Timoclea]] and Alexander the Great is rather different, but produces similar compositions of a woman brought before a magnanimous classical commander, which sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Antonio Fasolo, Castello Porto Colleoni Thiene, Cleopatra's Banquet - The Continence of Scipio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Giovanni Antonio Fasolo]]'s 16th century fresco is to the right of the door at the Castello Porto Colleoni Thiene.]]
Tapestry series based on the exploits of Scipio, which would often portray this scene, was one contextual identifier; so was connection with the histories of Livy or the expanded Plutarch for which the numerous surviving prints were intended, or on which they were dependent. Another context was the work's association with marriage, since the wedding between Allucius and his bride followed immediately on her restoration to him. [[Apollonio di Giovanni di Tommaso]]'s episodic depiction appeared as a painted panel on a 15th-century marriage chest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O14938/the-continence-of-scipio-oil-painting-apollonio-di-giovanni Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pietro da Cortona]]’s mural in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] was intended for the marriage of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] in 1637. In the case of the 1621 painting of the scene by [[Anthony van Dyck]], which features prominently [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], together with his future bride, the artist's patron was also the sponsor of the marriage. Several other paintings from this time may have similar histories. The connection also extends to literary works, since it is known that Boccabadati's 1693 drama ''Scipione'' was written for performance during the celebration of the marriage between [[Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena]] and [[Margherita Maria Farnese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovan-battista-boccabadati_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29 ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' - Volume 10 (1968)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:1751 Tiepolo Die Enthaltsamkeit Scipios anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|''The Clemency of Scipio'' by [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]] (1751), [[Städel]].]]

Many paintings of Scipio's act of clemency were produced in Europe - over a hundred by [[Low Countries]] artists alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle p.565ff&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists made a speciality of the subject, returning to it more than once. [[Frans Francken the Younger]] painted eight versions, [[Sebastiano Ricci]] six versions, [[Simon de Vos]] and [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]] four each. [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] painted two versions, as did [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. In the case of the latter, both paintings were subsequently destroyed. Beside the historical record, a sketch of the 1620 version remains, as does a copy now in [[Lacock Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-continence-of-scipio-100954 BBC Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 16th century [[fresco]]s by [[Gian Battista Zelotti]] at the Villa Emo, Fanzolo; the Villa Caldogno-Nordera, Caldogna; and elsewhere in Italy.

'''''The Late Shift''''' is a 1996 American [[television film]] produced by [[HBO]]. It was directed by [[Betty Thomas]] and based on the [[The Late Shift (book)|book of the same name]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' media reporter Bill Carter.&lt;!--different [[Bill Carter]] than WP article and writer of Miss Sarajevo--&gt;

==Plot==
Behind-the-scenes network politics embroil television executives responsible for late-night programming after 1991's  retirement announcement of [[Johnny Carson]] from ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on [[NBC]].

Carson's permanent guest host [[Jay Leno]] and the host of the show that follows Carson's each night, [[David Letterman]], both vie for the position. It is widely assumed that Letterman is the hand-picked heir apparent Carson favors, but privately NBC executives speculate that Leno could be more popular with 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. audiences, as well as easier for the network to deal with and control.

Leno's tough manager [[Helen Kushnick]] secures the spot for Leno with negotiating tactics that could be construed as either shrewd or unethical. Leno is concerned that her methods might alienate Carson but does not wish to be disloyal, as he believes Kushnick to be responsible for his success and had promised to take care of her after her husband's death. She harshly instructs the comic to just keep telling jokes and leave the business end to her.

Surely enough, she lands Leno the coveted job as ''Tonight Show'' host and the producer's position for herself, on the condition that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position. Another reason NBC's executives prefer Leno is that they will own the show, whereas Letterman stipulates that he will maintain ownership rights to his.

Kushnick's bullying manner angers Leno's bosses, colleagues, potential guests, and others to the point of interfering with network airtime and relationships. The top NBC executives warn the mild-mannered Leno that they are going to fire Kushnick and, if he sides with her, he would be let go as well. Kushnick is dismissed by NBC and barred from the studio lot. She keeps pleading with Leno to keep his promise to take care of her and her daughter, but he is angry because she nearly cost him a dream job. Leno eavesdrops on a private executive meeting in which they discuss the possibility of having Letterman step in as host.

Letterman, devastated at being passed over, hires Hollywood superagent [[Michael Ovitz]] to negotiate on his behalf after Ovitz makes the dramatic promise that not only will he ensure Letterman is offered an 11:30 p.m. show, he will be offered it by every network. True to Ovitz's word, Letterman is courted by all the major networks and syndicates. He continues to hold on to his lifelong dream of hosting ''The Tonight Show'', but ''Tonight Show''/''Late Show'' producer [[Peter Lassally]] makes it clear that the ''Tonight'' job is now "damaged goods" and that he would be working with the very people who passed him by, who may also double cross him and retain Leno if he can make the show a hit before Letterman takes over. Letterman is still unconvinced, so Lassally suggests he call Carson to ask for advice. Letterman asks Carson what he would do in the same situation, and after Carson says he would probably leave NBC, Letterman accepts a lucrative offer to host [[Late Show with David Letterman|his own 11:30 show]] on [[CBS]].

Letterman and Leno ultimately go head to head at 11:30, with Letterman winning in the TV ratings in the beginning, then Leno firmly re-establishing his show's lead in the ratings.

Real life CBS executive Rod Perth (played by Ed Begley Jr. in the film) appears briefly in a cameo role.   (He’s the man Howard Stringer mistakes for Perth in the CAA lobby).  Actor Ed Begley Jr. and Rod Perth share an extraordinary physical resemblance, something the film makers milk for humor in the scene.

==Reception==

The film received seven [[Emmy Award]] nominations in categories including "Outstanding Made for Television Movie,"&lt;ref name="orlandoemmy" /&gt; makeup,&lt;ref name="elber" /&gt; casting,&lt;ref name="elber" /&gt; writing,&lt;ref name="lorando" /&gt; directing,&lt;ref name="orlandoemmy" /&gt; and acting.&lt;ref name="orlandoemmy" /&gt; For her role in the film as Helen Kushnick, actress Kathy Bates won awards from the [[American Comedy Awards]],&lt;ref name="disneycuts" /&gt; the [[Golden Globe Award]]s,&lt;ref name="frombeacon" /&gt; the [[Satellite Award]]s,&lt;ref name="golden" /&gt; and the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].&lt;ref name="seinfeld" /&gt; The film was also recognized with an award for "Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Specials" from the [[Directors Guild of America Award]]s.&lt;ref name="contra" /&gt; However, David Letterman, who saw clips of the film, called the movie "the biggest waste of film since my wedding photos." He also likened John Michael Higgins' portrayal to that of a "psychotic chimp." Letterman invited Higgins onto his program, but Higgins declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=A.J.|title=Early Word on HBO's ''Late Shift''|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291297,00.html|accessdate=March 1, 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=February 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
Kushnick filed a $30 million [[lawsuit]] against Bill Carter, author of the [[eponymous]] book upon which the HBO film was based, claiming [[libel]]. Specifically, her case related to a claim that she planted a story about Carson's retirement in the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR120352.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 "Dish: Fox backing off the gay buss"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 21 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The then-pending lawsuit was noted in the film's epilogue, as the Broadway tune "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]" plays. The lawsuit settled out of court for an undisclosed sum; Kushnick died of [[cancer]] in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shales |first=Tom |title=Tom Shales on the villains in the Leno-O'Brien fiasco at NBC |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=January 19, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803528.html |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
On January 19, 2010, during Conan O'Brien's final week as host of "The Tonight Show," guest [[Quentin Tarantino]] jokingly suggested that he direct a sequel to ''The Late Shift'', cast O'Brien as himself and make it a revenge movie in the style of his film ''[[Kill Bill]]'' with the title ''Late Shift 2: The Rolling Thunder of Revenge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/latenight-watch-the-revenge-of-conan-obrien.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Show Tracker - Late-night Watch: The Revenge of Conan O'Brien|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2012|first=Mary |last=McNamara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]|date=January 19, 2010|title=Season 1, Episode 142|author=[[Conan O'Brien]]; [[Quentin Tarantino]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/01/20/quentin-tarantino-conan-obrien/|title=Quentin Tarantino to direct Conan O'Brien in 'Late Shift 2: The Rolling Thunder of Revenge'|first=Mandi |last=Bierly|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]: PopWatch|publisher=Entertainment Weekly, Inc.; popwatch.ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' reported in February 2010 that a sequel to ''The Late Shift'' film was in planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Salem  | first = Rob  | title = Why Tonight belongs to yesterday | work =[[The Toronto Star]]  | publisher = Toronto Star Newspapers Limited | page =E01  | date =February 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', O'Brien stated he wished that actress [[Tilda Swinton]] could portray him in a film version about ''The Tonight Show'' conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =Conan O'Brien's next move  | work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = February 24, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a running gag about their similar appearance.

When asked in a June 2010 interview with ''[[Movieline]]'' if there was going to be a film adaptation of ''[[The War for Late Night]]'', Carter responded that plans were not serious at that point, stating, "Not really. Nothing serious. Let’s put it this way: There have always been people kicking it around because they think it’s funny. ... Letterman made a ... joke saying that [[Max von Sydow]] should play him.

The '''Thomas Tang International Moot Court Competition''', also known as the '''Tang''', is a [[Moot court|moot court competition]] sponsored by the National [[Asian-Pacific American|Asian Pacific American]] [[Bar association|Bar Association]], attracting participants from [[law school]]s in the U.S. and Asia.

==History==
The [[Thomas Tang]] National Moot Court Competition was founded in 1993 by the Asian Pacific-American Law Student Association ("APALSA") of the South Texas College of Law, [[Houston, Texas]].   The competition came about as a result of an intense debate among three South Texas College of Law ("STCL") students - Kevin Pham, Pam Rea, and John Tang - over the need for a moot court competition that would celebrate the growing Asian American presence and influence in the American legal system and would simultaneously encourage law students to analyze issues that impact Americans from all backgrounds.  These three students, along with every other member of the South Texas College of Law APALSA organization during 1993, mobilized their efforts, to bring about the competition as a lasting contribution to the legal education community.  Rea authored the moot court case and the local rules for the competition, while Pham and Tang relentlessly sought and obtained support from the law school's administration and the local Asian American Bar Association ("AABA") of Houston, and provided leadership to the many student volunteers needed for a successful outcome.  Both the Houston Chapter of the AABA and South Texas College of Law embraced the APALSA students' vision and supported their efforts, but the organization and efforts that resulted in the highly successful first year of the Tang were the result of the collaboration among law students who pursued a vision to contribute to the opportunities available to Asian American law students.  The success of the Tang was realized in the first year, as law students traveled from all over the United States to participate in the competition.

The students who founded the competition named it after the highest ranking Asian American justice at that time, The Honorable Thomas Tang, the senior judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Justice Tang greatly honored the students of STCL and the participating competitors, when he personally attended the 1993 competition and presided over Final Round.  In his remarks to the participating students in 1993, Justice Tang noted the efforts of the law students in creating opportunity and change, and challenged future law students to seek out ways of their own to enhance the legal profession and advance the involvement of persons from all backgrounds in our justice system.

The Tang is now administered by the NAPABA Law Foundation and the NAPABA Judicial Council, whose leadership continues to offer law students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the complexities and strength of the American justice system as it applies to all Americans. The Competition continues to honor the late Judge Thomas Tang, a champion of [[individual rights]], an advocate for the advancement of minority attorneys, an ardent supporter of NAPABA and the moot court competition. Judge Tang served on the United States [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] [[Court of Appeals]] from 1977 until his death in 1995. Judge Tang's wife, Dr. Pearl Tang, continues the legacy and participates every year.
