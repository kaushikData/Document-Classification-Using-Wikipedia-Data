The '''1870 Victorian football season''' was an [[Australian rules football]] competition played during the winter of 1870, consisting of matches between metropolitan football clubs in Melbourne in the colony of Victoria. The premier club was {{AFL Mel}}.

==Historical status==
By convention, the 1870 season is considered the first season of senior football competition in Victoria's history, or at least the first for which a premiership can be officially allocated. The reasons for this are somewhat arbitrary, since the competing clubs, organizational structure of football, and standard of play in 1870 were not materially different from 1869. 

The view of 1870 as being the inaugural premiership has existed since at least 1889, when ''The Argus'' newspaper first published a table of historical premiers and second and third place-getters dating back to 1870 and no earlier. In the article which adjoined the publication of the 1889 table, the reporter commented that the haphazard nature of scheduling, frequency of cancelled matches, and overall lesser standard of play made it difficult to assign a premiership to the seasons during the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=5|title=The Football Premiership|date=23 September 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The VFL's official publication, the ''[[Football Record]]'', also showed this same list from its inception in 1912 until 1918. In 1919, this was replaced with a new table that showed club placings since 1897, and two supplementary tables showing cumulated placings for the periods 1897 to 1918 and 1870 to 1918. These supplementary tables remained in the Record until 1923, but were omitted from the 1924 editions of the Record, and did not reappear after that.&lt;ref name="agebackdate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/history-of-the-afl-could-be-turned-on-its-head-20140620-zsglu.html|title=History of the AFL could be turned on its head|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=18 October 2014|author=Caroline Wilson|work=[[The Age]]|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/rethinking+the+historical+record/161 Rethinking the historical record] &lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2016, the [[AFL Commission]] has formally recognised the top level of Victorian football back to 1870 as senior, which applies to both the unaffiliated period from 1870–1876 and the [[Victorian Football Association]] from 1877–1896. However, it maintains a distinction between the 1870–1896 competitions and the history of the [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]] from 1897 onwards, and requires statistics and achievements from those two periods to be delineated; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-06-09/afl-knocks-back-cats-bid-for-extra-flags|title=AFL knocks back Cats' bid for extra flags|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Australian Football League|author=Travis King}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, the Commission allowed clubs to recognise these achievements in their own histories. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/teams/port-adelaide/afl-commission-accepts-all-clubs-can-acknowledge-their-success-from-outside-the-vflafl-competition/news-story/d7ab969dff3bfe01e75933e899e8b87a AFL Commission will allow clubs to recognise their history outside the VFL/AFL] &lt;/ref&gt;

==1870 season==
Five clubs participated in senior football during the 1870 season: [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]], {{AFL Car}}, [[Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company|Hobson's Bay Railway]], {{AFL Mel}} and South Yarra. They competed in specific matches for the Challenge Cup, and a premier team was selected based on all matches during the season, including Challenge Cup matches.

===Challenge Cup===
In 1870, the South Yarra Football Club purchased and put up a new trophy, known as the [[Challenge Cup (Australia)|Challenge Cup]] (or sometimes as the South Yarra Presentation Challenge Cup, to differentiate it from other challenge cups donated by different organisations), for competition. South Yarra was the permanent holder of the previous Challenge Cup, and decided it would be appropriate to provide a new trophy for competition. The rules relating to the presentation of the new Challenge Cup were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=652|author=|date=21 May 1870|volume=VIII|issue=216|title=The South Yarra Presentation Challenge Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Yarra would be the initial holder of the cup.
*Any match between the holder of the cup and another senior team would be played for the cup.
*In a cup match, the winner of the match would take possession of the cup, and the incumbent holder would retain the cup in the event of a draw.
*A club would become the permanent holder of the cup if it won the cup four times in a row without a loss (but with no limit on the number of drawn games during that streak); until that time, the cup would remain a perpetual award.
Other stipulations relating to Challenge Cup games were that they were required to be controlled by central umpires, rather than by the team captains, and that no player was allowed to play for more than one club in Challenge Cup games during the year.

[[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]] took possession of the Cup in the first game against South Yarra, and never relinquished it. However, the fate of the Cup became controversial when Hobson's Bay Railway forfeited its 11 June match against Albert-park due to lack of players. Railway declined to play when only fourteen of its selected twenty turned up on the day of the game,&lt;ref name="railwayresponse"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=332|author=J. Hacker (honorary secretary of the Hobson's Bay Railway Football Club)|date= 10 September 1870|volume=IX|issue=232|title=The "walk-over" and the Challenge Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Albert-park took to the field and scored two goals against no opposition as a [[walk-over#sports|walk-over]] formality.&lt;ref name="walkover" /&gt; Albert-park claimed the walk-over as its second Cup victory, and consequently claimed permanent possession of the Cup with its fourth win of the year on 20 August, but South Yarra, as cup donors, and several other clubs argued that the walk-over should have counted as a cancelled match rather than an Albert-park victory, and that another win was needed to claim permanent ownership of the Cup.&lt;ref name="cancelled" /&gt; Albert-park argued that enough procedural requirements, such as the appointment of umpires and the pre-game coin toss, had been carried out for the game to be considered official&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=300|author=C. Crooke (treasurer of Albert-park Football Club)|date=3 September 1870|volume=IX|issue=231|title=Albert-park v. Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Railway denied that these procedures had been carried out&lt;ref name="railwayresponse" /&gt; – and Albert-park argued that it was entitled to claim victory because Railway had declined the options of playing short or fielding other club officials or members who were present. Albert-park's position in claiming victory on a technicality was considered to be against the spirit of competition. There was no specific rule regarding walk-overs written into the rules which could be used to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name="cancelled" /&gt;

Ultimately, the dispute was unresolved. There was no central body which could make a binding ruling on whether or not the walk-over counted as a victory, and neither side conceded its opponent's point. Albert-park played only one further game for the season, a draw against {{AFL Mel}}, but it refused to put the Cup up for contest in the match. It is also noted that Albert-park was denied the chance to become the undisputed permanent holder of the Cup on 6 August, when its return match with the weak Railway club was cancelled due to inclement weather.&lt;ref name="cancelled" /&gt;

Albert-park ultimately gave the Cup back to South Yarra at the end of the year, but maintained its position that it had won the Cup outright and was donating it in its capacity as the Cup's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=492|author=Fair Play|date=15 October 1870|volume=IX|issue=237|title=Football – retrospect of the season}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Yarra maintained its position that Albert-park had not won the Cup, and had forfeited its position as incumbent holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=684|author=|date=3 June 1871|volume=X|issue=270|title=The Challenge Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premiership===
Although it had claimed the Challenge Cup and was undefeated during the season, Albert-park was not recognised as the premier team of the 1870 season: instead, {{AFL Mel}}, which was also undefeated, was named as the premier. Melbourne had recorded more wins than Albert-park during the year and had played four games against {{AFL Car}} for two wins and two draws, while Albert-park's three matches against Carlton had been drawn and their on-field wins had come against the weak South Yarra club, giving Melbourne a better claim to the premier position.

It is noteworthy that Albert-park's claim to the Challenge Cup was helped in large part by the fact that it was the first team to play against South Yarra during the year. Had South Yarra played its first game against Melbourne, Melbourne would have been in a strong position to win the Challenge Cup as well as the premiership.

===Senior results===

The following table shows the five clubs' senior results during the year: all matches played amongst the five Challenge Cup teams, plus matches that Melbourne played against the Police and against the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684–1922)|18th Royal Irish Regiment]]. Albert-park's disputed walk-over victory against Railway is not included in the table.

==Notable events==
*{{note|1}}In its Challenge Cup game against {{AFL Mel}} on 4 June, Albert-park scored a goal in the first half, but it was later annulled after a head count discovered that Albert-park had 22 men instead of 20 on the field. The game ended in a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref name="headcount" /&gt;
*The practice of stopping play at half-time and changing ends was first introduced in the game between {{AFL Mel}} and {{AFL Car}} on 11 June; prior to this, teams had changed ends after each goal was scored.&lt;ref name="walkover" /&gt;

* 19 March – Racing 92 and Stade Français announced that their planned merger had collapsed following major resistance, including a strike by Stade players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/18949353/racing-92-president-jacky-lorenzetti-confirms-racing-92-stade-francais-merger-collapse-amid-resistance-beautiful-project |title=Racing 92-Stade Francais merger collapses amid resistance |publisher=ESPN (UK) |date=19 March 2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9 April – Super Rugby organiser SANZAAR announced that the competition would drop three of its 18 teams after the 2017 season. Australia will lose one of its five teams, and South Africa two of its six. The affected unions were to determine which franchises would be axed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/39547949 |title=Super Rugby to cut three sides for 15-team format from 2018 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=9 April 2017 |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 April – [[RugbyWA]], the governing body for the sport in [[Western Australia]] and operator of the [[Western Force]], one of two Australian sides in danger of being axed from Super Rugby, announced that it had brought legal action against the [[Australian Rugby Union]] regarding the process of determining the franchise to be contracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/19123348/rugbywa-board-legal-action-aru |title=RugbyWA board in legal action against ARU |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] |publisher=ESPN (UK) |date=10 April 2017 |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 May – World Rugby announced significant reform of its Regulation 8, which covers international eligibility:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/news/245382 |title=World Rugby announces historic eligibility regulation reform |publisher=World Rugby |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** From 31 December 2020 forward, the required period of continuous residency in a country for purposes of international eligibility will increase from three years to five. (This only applies if a player does not qualify for that country by birth, or by the birth of a parent or grandparent in said country.) 
** Effective immediately, individuals with 10 years of cumulative residency in a country who are not previously tied to another national team will be eligible for that country, even if they do not meet the continuous residency requirement.
** Effective 1 January 2018, a member union cannot nominate its under-20 national team as its "A" side. This means that playing on or against a U-20 national team will not bind the player to that country at senior level. (Note that a 15-a-side match cannot bind a player to a given national union unless ''both the player's team and its opposition'' are senior or "A" national sides.) 
** Effective 1 July 2017, rugby sevens players will not be tied to a national union until either of the following events occurs:
*** They play for a senior national sevens team after reaching age 20.
*** They represent a national team in the Olympic sevens tournament or Rugby World Cup Sevens after reaching age 18.
* 30 June – [[BBC Wales]] reported that the [[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]] and [[Southern Kings]], the two most likely South African teams to be dropped from Super Rugby, would join the European [[Pro14|Pro12]] competition as early as the [[2017–18 Pro14|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/40448854 |title=South African sides Cheetahs and Southern Kings set to join Pro12 |first1=Matt |last1=Lloyd |first2=Gareth |last2=Griffiths |publisher=BBC Sport Wales |date=30 June 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">The '''50+1 rule''' ([[German language|German]]: ''50+1-Regel'') is an informal term used to refer to a clause in the regulations of the [[Deutsche Fußball-Liga]]. The clause states that, in order to obtain a license to compete in the [[Bundesliga]], a club must hold a majority of its own voting rights. The rule is designed to ensure that the club's members retain overall control, protecting clubs from the influence of external investors.

==Background==
Prior to 1998, football clubs in Germany were owned exclusively by members' associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schaerlaeckens|first1=Leander|title=The best league in the world?|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5673975/success-germany-bundesliga|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that clubs were run as [[not-for-profit organisations]], and private ownership was not allowed under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Müller|first1=Christian|title=Football Governance|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmcumeds/writev/792/fg84.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed following a ruling by the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) in October 1998, which allowed clubs to convert their football teams into public or private limited companies. However, the "50+1 rule" requires the parent club to own at least 50% plus one additional share of the football company, ensuring that the club's members still hold a majority of voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Honigstein|first1=Raphael|title=League crack down on lewd shirt numbers to concentrate on 50+1|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/feb/10/raphael-onigstein-bundesliga-blog-bayern-munich|website=The Guardian|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
In cases where a person or company has substantially funded a club for a continuous period of 20 years, it is possible for that person or company to own a controlling stake in the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hesse|first1=Uli|title=Issues looming for Germany's footballing landscape|url=http://www.espnfc.com/german-bundesliga/10/blog/post/2219877/issues-looming-for-germanys-footballing-landscape|website=ESPN|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exception most notably applies to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] (owned by pharmaceuticals company [[Bayer]]), and [[VfL Wolfsburg]] (owned by automobile manufacturer [[Volkswagen]]), and has more recently allowed [[SAP SE|SAP]] co-founder [[Dietmar Hopp]] to gain control of his former youth club of [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]].

==Criticism==
The rule has been criticised on a number of occasions. One of the rule's most vocal opponents is [[Hannover 96]] president [[Martin Kind]], who argued that the rule could be in breach of EU competition law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amies|first1=Nick|title=For better or worse, Bundesliga clubs to keep ownership rule|url=http://www.dw.de/for-better-or-worse-bundesliga-clubs-to-keep-ownership-rule/a-4909350|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hannover put forward a motion to change the 50+1 rule, but this was overwhelmingly rejected, with 32 out of 36 clubs voting against the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conn|first1=David|title=Bundesliga votes to keep clubs owned by members|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2009/nov/13/bundesligafootball-bayernmunich|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the rule has also been brought into question following the rise of [[RB Leipzig]]. Although it is theoretically possible to become a voting member here, RB Leipzig reserves the right to reject any membership application without citing a reason. As a result, RB Leipzig has only a handful of members, most of whom are Red Bull GmbH employees. Critics have also noted that the annual membership fee is relatively expensive compared to other clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oltermann|first1=Philip|title=Why RB Leipzig are sending shockwaves through German football|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/06/rb-leipzig-sending-shockwaves-through-german-football|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beach Soccer Worldwide''' ('''BSWW''') is the organisation responsible for the founding and growth of [[association football]]'s derivative sport of [[beach soccer]]. The founding partners of BSWW codified the rules of beach soccer in 1992, with BSWW as it is known today having been officially founded in 2001 as a singular institution to develop the sport and organise international beach soccer competitions across the globe, primarily between national teams.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The company is recognised as playing the biggest role in helping to establish the rules of beach soccer, to spread and evolve the sport around the world as cited by FIFA who took on governing body status of the sport from BSWW in 2005.&lt;ref name="History2"/&gt; Having established the sport's key regulations, FIFA acknowledged BSWW's framework, making their rules the official laws of beach soccer and now controls them and any modifications.

Today, under the recognition of FIFA, BSWW continues to be main organisation that organises beach soccer tournaments and development (with FIFA's assistance) around the world, mainly in Europe, including the Euro Beach Soccer League, BSWW exhibition tour events and others, having involved over 110 national teams in the sport, as well as newly founded club competitions.&lt;ref name="retention"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; Its founders also established the [[Beach Soccer World Championships]]; BSWW created a partnership with [[FIFA]], ''FIFA Beach Soccer S.L.'', in 2005 to manage the tournament as the newly named [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]], the only major international beach soccer tournament that BSWW does not have a hand in organising but which is all the management of FIFA.&lt;ref name="fifaWC"/&gt;

Members of the organisation serve on FIFA's Beach Soccer Committee.

==History==
{{see also|Beach Soccer#Rules}}

===Founding===
BSWW's routes are traced back to 1992 with the establishment of the official rules of the sport by Giancarlo Signorini, the founding partner of ''Beach Soccer Company (BSC)''.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/history.htm |title=The History and Growth of Pro Beach Soccer (1992 to Present) |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=2001 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020215032512/http://www.beachsoccer.com/history.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-tournament-guide.com/Life-is-a-Beach.html|title=Life is a Beach|publisher=soccer-tournament-guide.com|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Signorini staged a pilot event in [[Los Angeles]] in order to test out and perfect these rules which remain very similar today. In July 1993, with the aid of his own company, BSI, Signorini organised the first professional beach soccer event, held on [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida]]. A keen interest was taken by Brazilian sports marketing agency, Koch Tavares, who replicated the event in 1994 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] and Viking Graham Sports Group, a [[Philadelphia]] based investment group, acquired BSI's rights to stage professional beach soccer events, forming a partnership with Signorini to create ''Beach Soccer Company''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/04/11/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/YOUNG-MEN-BY-THE-SEA-PRO-BEACH-SOCCER-TOUR-EXPANDS-SCHEDULE.aspx|title=YOUNG MEN BY THE SEA: PRO BEACH SOCCER TOUR EXPANDS SCHEDULE|publisher=sportsbusinessdaily.com|date=11 April 1997|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch Tavares and BSC went on to be the main two entities involved in promoting beach soccer for the rest of the 1990s, with the former responsible for organising the ''Beach Soccer World Championships'' beginning in 1995, and the latter establishing the ''[[Pro Beach Soccer Tour]]'' in 1996, a series of worldwide professional exhibition tournaments to promote the sport, and the ''[[Euro Beach Soccer League|European Pro Beach Soccer League]]'' in 1998, all contested between national teams as opposed to clubs. BSC relocated to [[Monaco]] in 1998 and again to Barcelona in 1999, renaming to become ''Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. (PBS)'' in 2000 to reflect the branding of their established events.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2001, the entity of Koch Tavares responsible for beach soccer and PBS came together to create one single company in order to streamline development of the sport under one unifying company, as opposed to multiple parties involved trying to synchronise progress between one another, officially forming Beach Soccer Worldwide, opting to remain based in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer-dbsv.de/|title=BeachSoccer|publisher=beachsoccer-dbsv.de|accessdate=28 April 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSWW took on roles of organising all major competitions of the preceding companies including the [[Pro Beach Soccer Tour]] and [[Euro Beach Soccer League|European Pro Beach Soccer League]], whilst supervising the [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|World Championships]] and the newly created America's League, all remaining focused on national teams. This was also done to make it easier to bring on board sponsors, coordinate media coverage and present the football alternative to FIFA under a clearly defined, all-encompassing, representative body for beach soccer.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===FIFA partnership===

BSWW's attention immediately turned to FIFA. Beach Soccer Company had already ensured all tournaments from 2000 onwards were played under [[Association football culture#Fair Play|FIFA's fair play]] rules and delegates from both parties met multiple times to discuss for BSWW's rules of the sport and competitions to gain recognition and backing of football's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/index2.asp?main=fifa.htm |title=FIFA |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=2001 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605205650/http://www.beachsoccer.com/index2.asp?main=fifa.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, FIFA had come to an agreement with BSWW to adopt the rules and regulations that had been established over the previous decade, with some minor changes to ensure FIFA's interest in key components of regular football were respected and acknowledging key major tournaments in the sport including the World Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/development/news/y=2002/m=2/news=attractive-sport-with-bright-future-81212.html |title=An Attractive Sport with a Bright Future|publisher=fifa.com|date=22 February 2002|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, BSWW also brought on board major sponsors such as [[MasterCard]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Coca-Cola]] for certain time period.&lt;ref name="History2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/corp_history_02.php?idn=9&amp;seccion=3&amp;action=open&amp;id=3 |title=BSWW History |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=2004 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025124334/http://www.beachsoccer.com/corp_history_02.php?idn=9&amp;seccion=3&amp;action=open&amp;id=3 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement with FIFA was furthered in 2004 when ''FIFA Beach Soccer S.L.'' was established in agreement and partnership with BSWW, to take over responsibility of the World Championships, being beach soccer's primary tournament, to become an official FIFA competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2004/m=10/news=fifa-executive-committee-confirms-the-strategic-studies-committee-prop-94383.html|title=FIFA Executive Committee confirms the Strategic Studies Committee's proposals and adopts FIFA Code of Ethics|publisher=fifa.com|date=6 October 2004|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly named ''FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup'' would start in 2005, with BSWW staff acting as advisers. It was also agreed that FIFA would become the sport's governing body, taking over from BSWW.&lt;ref name="fifaWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/media/news/y=2005/m=2/news=fifa-launches-first-ever-fifa-beach-soccer-world-cup-96141.html|title=FIFA launches first ever FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup|publisher=fifa.com|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However at this time FIFA also recognised BSWW as the main entity behind past and more importantly continuing promotion and development of the sport elsewhere besides the new World Cup,&lt;ref name="History2"/&gt; and so BSWW retained the organisation responsibilities and control of other beach soccer championships like the EBSL, with FIFA only taking full control of the World Cup.&lt;ref name="retention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/corp_thebsww.php?idn=8&amp;seccion=3&amp;action=open&amp;id=2 |title=the bsww |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=2004 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025123537/http://www.beachsoccer.com/corp_thebsww.php?idn=8&amp;seccion=3&amp;action=open&amp;id=2 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So much so that after the first successful World Cup in 2005, when FIFA established World Cup qualifying tournaments to promote the sport across all confederations to start in 2006, all responsibility was handed to BSWW to organise and execute such events, with FIFA only supervising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/documents/tournaments/BSWC2006/FIFA_beach_soccer_world_cup_2006_regulations_en.pdf |title=Regulations FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Rio de Janeiro 2006 |publisher=fifa.com |date=November 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107132659/http://www.fifa.com/documents/tournaments/BSWC2006/FIFA_beach_soccer_world_cup_2006_regulations_en.pdf |archivedate=January 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued development===

Since then, BSWW has continued to develop the sport worldwide, now aided greatly with FIFA's beach soccer training courses and refereeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/beach-soccer-expansion-is-reaching-new-heights|title=Beach soccer expansion is reaching new heights|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=19 February 2015|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/editorials/23|title=Development programs: Planning comes first|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Euro Beach Soccer League (dropping the ''pro'' from the title in 2004 as it was no longer reflecting of the company name)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballfriendsonline.com/2011/04/18/beach-soccer-a-developing-sport/|title=Beach Soccer … A Developing Sport|publisher=footballfriendsonline.com|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has remained BSWW's main asset, gathering up to 27 nations to compete in recent editions compared to just 7 in the first event in 1998 in a summer-long event. The Pro Beach Soccer Tour has also been renamed to the BSWW Tour for the same reasons, continuing exhibition events to promote the sport as far wide and remote as [[Réunion]] and [[Cape Verde]] with around 10 tour events a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/tournaments/4|title=BSWW Tour|publisher=beachsoccer.com|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSWW has continued organising the World Cup qualifiers, as well as establishing new regular international competitions such as the [[Beach Soccer Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] (similar to the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]) since 2011 and generating more interest from big sponsors like [[Samsung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/samsung-partners-with-intercontinental-cup-2011|title=Samsung partners with Intercontinental Cup 2011|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huawei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/news/huawei-official-sponsor-of-the-intercontinental-cup|title=Huawei, official sponsor of the Intercontinental Cup|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=27 October 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSWW representatives, in partnership with FIFA, have liaised with the [[International Olympic Committee]] a number of times, with Olympic-affiliated events such as the [[Asian Beach Games]] integrating beach soccer from 2008 onward, the [[South American Beach Games]] from 2009 and the [[European Games]] starting from 2015. The ultimate aim is to have beach soccer a sport in the [[summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport360.com/video/football/38525/video-beach-soccer-would-sell-out-rio-olympics|title=VIDEO: Beach Soccer would ‘sell out’ Rio Olympics|publisher=Sport360|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/hickey-beach-soccer-deserves-to-be-in-the-olympics|title=Hickey: "Beach Soccer deserves to be in the Olympics"|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baku2015.com/news/article/olympic-goal-sight-beach-soccer-seizes-chance-shine-39360.html|title=European Games are Beach Soccer's opportunity to show off to the world|publisher=baku2015.com|date=12 June 2015|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite a campaign for inclusion in the [[Rio 2016]] and [[Tokyo 2020|Tokyo 2020 Olympics.]],&lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; the sport was ultimately not included and so lobbying in cooperation with FIFA continues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/722484.shtml|title=IOC rules out including beach soccer, futsal at Rio Games|publisher=globaltimes.cn|date=22 July 2012|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ultimately fulfil the goal of making beach soccer an Olympic sport. In 2017, BSWW secured beach soccer as a sport at the inaugural Olympic-affiliated [[2019 World Beach Games|World Beach Games in 2019]] and hope to use its inclusion as a springboard for future absorption into the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/news/fifa-beach-soccer-workshop-live-updates|title=FIFA Beach Soccer Workshop held in Dubai|publisher=globaltimes.cn|date=3 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a greater involvement from certain confederations in organising World Cup qualifying championships has eased the full involvement of BSWW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/bsww-and-afc-sign-long-term-agreement|title=BSWW and AFC sign long term agreement|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=10 May 2014|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the federation to promote the club side of the game more, establishing the [[Mundialito de Clubs]] (Club World Cup) in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/the-clubs-competition-comes-true-the-new-reality-of-beach-soccer-is-here|title=The Clubs competition comes true: the new reality of Beach Soccer is here|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Euro Winners Cup]] (similar to the [[UEFA Champions League]]) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/news/san-benedetto-start-engines|title=San Benedetto start engines|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the women's game has also become a target for BSWW, with the first official game between Switzerland and Germany in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theroonba.com/beachwom09.htm|title=INTERNATIONAL BEACH SOCCER RESULTS - 2009 (WOMEN)|publisher=theroonba.com|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting further international exhibition tournaments and friendlies involving nations such as England, Italy and the Czech Republic, with the Euro Winners Cup having a 16-club women's version for the first time in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/the-biggest-euro-winners-cup-ever|title=The biggest Euro Winners Cup ever!|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Women's [[Euro Beach Soccer Cup]] also taking place in 2016.

BSWW has organised and delivered over 200 international events in more than 50 countries worldwide, involving over 110 nations from all confederations, assembling an audience of over 250 million households in 180 countries.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/corporate|title=BEACH SOCCER CORPORATE|publisher=beachsoccer.com |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-president Joan Cuscó continues to serve on FIFA's Beach Soccer committee as BSWW's representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/committees/committee=1934062/index.html|title=Beach Soccer Committee|publisher=fifa.com |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, BSWW and FIFA agreed to extend their partnership until at least 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccerrussia.ru/info/item/8047?type=2|title=Хорошие новости и текущие трудности.

{{main article|BSWW World Rankings}}
BSWW established a ranking system for European teams in the mid-2000s as the majority of tournaments are held in Europe and it is the most active continent for national teams. Hence the ranking was used for seeding in competitions like the EBSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plazovakopana.cz/clanky/reprezentace/bsww-aktualni-zebricek-evropskych-zemi-2010.html |title=BSWW - aktuální žebříček evropských zemí 2010 |publisher=plazovakopana.cz |date=2010 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |language=Czech |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317185020/https://www.plazovakopana.cz/clanky/reprezentace/bsww-aktualni-zebricek-evropskych-zemi-2010.html |archivedate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/news/27-teams-in-4-groups-will-take-part-in-the-european-qualifier|title=27 teams in 4 groups will take part in the European Qualifier|publisher=beachsoccer.com|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, BSWW created the first world ranking table based on a similar system to [[FIFA World Ranking|FIFA's world ranking]] for association football national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/ranking/overall|title=BSWW Beach Soccer rankings As per December 2015|publisher=beachsoccer.com|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been standard practice for BSWW to award prizes to the top scorer, [[MVP]] and best goalkeeper at the conclusion every event of their organisation. However, in 2014, BSWW took this concept of awards to a new level, establishing beach soccer's first annual end of season [[awards ceremony]], taking place during November in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/news/stars-shine-bright-in-dubai |title=Stars shine bright in Dubai |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony, a gala event attended by many of the world's leading figures in the sport, celebrates the achievements of top performers worldwide over the course of the season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachsoccer.com/events/beach-soccer-stars-2016 |title=Beach Soccer Stars 2016 |publisher=beachsoccer.com |accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared to [[The Best FIFA Football Awards|FIFA's The Best]] awards and the [[Ballon D'or]] in [[association football]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlehamptongazette.co.uk/sport/football/kempson-scoops-women-s-beach-soccer-ballon-d-or-1-8232745 |title=Kempson scoops women's beach soccer 'Ballon d'Or' |publisher=Littlehampton Gazette |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both importance, grandeur and equivalence for the those involved in beach soccer.

Some of the many prizes awarded on the night include best player of the year, best coach of the year, best goal and best team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/events/beach-soccer-stars-2014 |title=Beach Soccer Stars 2014 |publisher=beachsoccer.com |accessdate=7 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
Beach Soccer Worldwide extends its commitment beyond purely sport development. In 2009, the Beach Soccer Foundation was created by BSWW to tackle three main issues surrounding the sport:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/foundation|title=The Beach Soccer Foundation|publisher=beachsoccer.com |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Environmental protection through awareness and recycling

The '''Bermuda Under-19 cricket team''' represents [[Bermuda]] in Under-19 international cricket competitions.

Most recently, Bermuda took part in the [[2009 ICC Americas Under-19 Championship]], finishing 3rd and so just missing out on the chance to progress to the [[2009 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|World Cup Qualifier]]. They won three matches losing only to [[Canada Under-19 cricket team|Canada]] and [[United States Under-19 cricket team|the United States]].&lt;ref name=2009champ&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2009/TOURNAMENTS/AMERICASU19/about.shtml Americas Under 19 Championship 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203142900/http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2009/TOURNAMENTS/AMERICASU19/about.shtml |date=3 February 2010 }} cricketeurope4.net 10/12/10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guildford Flames At Milton Keynes Lightning.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Breakaway during a game between the  [[Guildford Flames]] and the [[Milton Keynes Lightning]] ]]
A '''breakaway''' is a situation in [[ice hockey]] in which a player with the [[Hockey puck|puck]] has no [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defending players]], except for the [[goaltender]], between themselves and the opposing [[goal (hockey)|goal]], leaving them free to [[Ice skating|skate]] in and [[Shot (ice hockey)|shoot]] at will (before the out-of-position defenders can catch them). A breakaway is considered a lapse on the part of the defending team. If a player's progress is illegally impeded by an opposing player or if the goalie throws their stick at the oncoming player, the breakaway player is awarded a [[penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]. If a player faces an empty net (i.e. the opposing team has pulled their goalie) and is illegally impeded by an opposing player, they are [[Awarded goal (ice hockey)|automatically awarded a goal]] for their team instead of taking a penalty shot.

==Defense against a breakaway==

*One theory about the best way for the goalie to react to a breakaway is called the "Y" theory. In this theory the goalie comes out to somewhere between halfway between the faceoff circle hashes and the crease or up to the hashes. From there the goalie lines up to the puck and skates backwards, following the puck. Based on the player's actions, the goalie can then drop and take the shot. If the player goes diagonally with the puck, the goalie splits off from going straight back and then goes diagonal either way. The "Y" comes from the going straight back and then the diagonal movement. That forms a "Y" representing how a goalie can potentially play that breakaway.
*Another way the goalie can respond is to follow the blade of the stick. If it is more towards one side or the other, the goalie can usually anticipate where the shot is going to hit.
*Yet another way is that if the shot is going to be high (can be determined if the stick blade is upright on the ice 90 degrees), the goalie can move up to cut off the angle on the player, and go down right before the shot is taken. This way, there is more of a chance that the puck will not go over the goalie into the net.
*A goalie can go up to the player, dive down sideways, and collide with the player, forcing them to chip the puck over the goalie, or deke. Though this strategy for goalies can be risky, it can usually work, considering that usually the player's head is down looking at the puck, allowing the goalie to surprise the player. This term is collectively known as the "two-pad stack" or the "Hextall" because [[Ron Hextall]] was famous for diving and stacking the pads to take out opposing players' legs.[http://www.nhl.com/video/app?page=GameHighlights&amp;service=page&amp;gid=503&amp;gtid=2&amp;season=20062007&amp;media=/20062007/02/0503/IH_NHL_2006_2007_503_2_700K_continuous.wmv (See at 1:25)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} This is not recommended though at youth hockey levels as it can be very dangerous.
*Until the mid-2010s, a way to avoid a particularly threatening breakaway (multiple skaters with no defenders approaching the net) would be to deliberately [[moving the goalposts|move the goalposts]] to stop play; although it was illegal, the resulting [[penalty shot]] would be contested with only one player (and be subject to the restrictions therein, such as continuously moving forward), reducing the chances of being scored upon. Most leagues began increasing the severity of the penalty on this tactic after goaltender [[David Leggio]] exploited it twice; in North America, such a move will result in the goaltender being ejected from the game, while in Germany, the [[Awarded goal (ice hockey)|goal is automatically awarded]].

'''''Death Race 2000''''' is a 1975 American [[action film]] directed by [[Paul Bartel]], and starring [[David Carradine]], [[Simone Griffeth]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]]. The film takes place in a [[dystopia]]n [[United States|American]] society in the year 2000, where the murderous Transcontinental Road Race has become a form of national entertainment. The [[screenplay]] is based on the [[short story]] "The Racer" by [[Ib Melchior]].&lt;ref name="Brosnan"&gt;Bosnan, John &amp; Nichols, Peter "Death Race 2000" in Clute, John &amp; Nichols, Peter eds. (1998) ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (2nd edition) Orbit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After the "World Crash of '79", massive civil unrest and economic ruin occurs. The United States government restructured into a totalitarian regime under martial law. To pacify the population, the government has organized the Transcontinental Road Race, where a group of drivers race across the country in their high-powered cars, infamous for violence, gore, and innocent pedestrians being struck for bonus points.

In the year 2000, the five drivers in the 20th annual race, who all adhere to [[professional wrestling]]-style personas and drive appropriately themed cars, include ''[[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]]'', the mysterious black-garbed champion and national hero; ''Machine Gun Joe'', a Chicago tough-guy gangster; ''Calamity Jane'', a cowgirl; ''Matilda the Hun'', a neo-Nazi; and ''Nero the Hero'', a Roman gladiator. Each drives with a navigator of the opposite sex, who also implicitly functions as a love interest. The race is covered on national TV by a news team headed by the boisterous and comical Junior Bruce, seductive matron Grace Pander, and laconic commentator Harold (a parody of [[Howard Cosell]]). The game has sadistic rules, where killing babies and physically challenged people will give the player extra points. Machine Gun Joe is the main opposition to Frankenstein.
 
A resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of 1770s American Revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]], plans to rebel against Mr. President's regime by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers, and taking Frankenstein hostage as leverage against the President. The group is assisted by Paine's great-granddaughter Annie, Frankenstein's latest navigator. She plans to lure him into an ambush to be replaced by a double. Despite a pirated national broadcast made by Ms. Paine herself, the resistance's disruption of the race is covered up by the government and instead blamed on the [[France|French]], who are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and telephone system.

At first, the Resistance's plan works. Nero is killed when he runs over a booby-trapped doll planted by the Resistance, which he mistakes for a real baby and proceeds to run it over to gain points. Matilda drives off a cliff while following a fake detour set up by the Resistance. Calamity Jane, who witnessed Matilda's death, inadvertently drives over a land mine trying to leave the area. This leaves only Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe in the race.

As Frankenstein nonchalantly survives every attempt made on his life during the race, Annie comes to discover that the Frankenstein she knows is anything but a willing government stooge, nor is he the original man. The current Frankenstein is, in fact, one of a number of random wards of the state trained exclusively to race in the identity. "When one is used up, they bring in another", he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also reveals that he has his own plans: when he wins the race and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will detonate a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand (he calls it his "hand grenade"), which he has kept concealed by keeping his glove on at all times (even while undressed). His plan goes awry, however, when Machine Gun Joe attacks and Annie kills him using Frankenstein's "hand" grenade.

Having successfully outmaneuvered both the rival drivers and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original grenade attack plan. Annie instead dons Frankenstein's disguise and plans to stab Mr. President while standing in for him on the podium. As the president congratulates "Frankenstein" for his victory, in the process declaring war on the [[France|French]] and appointing Frankenstein leader of the war, Annie is mistakenly shot and wounded by her own grandmother, who is desperate for revenge against Frankenstein for having supposedly killed her during the race (he had actually just drugged her). The real Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and rams the President's stage with his car, finally fulfilling his lifelong desire to kill him.

In the [[epilogue]], Annie and Frankenstein marry. Frankenstein, now President, abolishes the race and plans to rebuild the country. However, Junior Bruce starts to protest against it. When unable to find a moral reason to continue the race and desperate to have the race perpetuate, he starts shouting that it is a way of life, to keep America satisfied, to entertain and give the people what they want. Frankenstein, annoyed, runs him over with his car and drives off with Annie to the cheers and applause of the crowd.

==Production==
[[Roger Corman]] wanted to make a futuristic action sports film to take advantage of the advance publicity of ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' (1975). He optioned a short story by [[Ib Melchior]] and hired [[Robert Thom (writer)|Robert Thom]] to adapt it. Director [[Paul Bartel]] felt this was unshootable, so [[Charles B. Griffith]] rewrote it. Corman wanted [[Peter Fonda]] to play the lead, but he was unavailable, so [[David Carradine]] was cast instead. Carradine was paid 10% of the film's gross — he and [[Ron Howard]] were the only stars of Roger Corman Productions to ever get a percentage of the gross.&lt;ref name="New World"/&gt;

Bartel later recalled "We had terrible script problems; David had to finish his 'Kung Fu' series before starting and we had bad weather. We all worked under terrible pressure. Roger and I had an essential disagreement over comedy. He took out  a lot of the comedy scenes. He may have been right and was probably more objective."&lt;ref name="la"/&gt;

Bartel later said, "Most of my guilty pleasures in this film were ripped out by the roots by Roger Corman before the film ever saw the light of day and substituted with crushed heads and blood squibs. Nevertheless, there is a joke about the French wrecking our economy and telephone system that I still find amusing. And I am pleased by the scene introducing the Girl Fan (played very effectively by my sister Wendy) who is to sacrifice herself beneath the wheels of David Carradine's race car and wants to meet him so that the gesture will have "meaning"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Paul Bartel's Guilty Pleasures|last=Bartel|first=Paul|magazine=Film Comment|edition=18.5|date=September–October 1982|pages= 60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
According to ''Variety'' the film earned $4.8 million in rentals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"All-time Film Rental Champs", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical===
Contemporary reviews were mixed. [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film had "nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked—a spectacle glorifying the car as an instrument of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Gelder |first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence Van Gelder |date=June 6, 1975 |title=The Screen: 'Death Race 2000' Is Short on Satire |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "cartoonish but effective entertainment, with some good action sequences and plenty of black humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 7, 1975 |title=Film Reviews: Death Race 2000 |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Combs of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote that the comic conceits were "too shaky to hold the movie together and tend to self-destruct some distance short of any pop allegory for America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Combs |first=Richard |date=February 1976 |title=Death Race 2000 |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=43 |issue=505 |page=27  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film one star out of four and wrote that it "may be the goofiest and sleaziest film I've seen in the last five years."  &lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (June 22, 1975). "Dismal duo for a drive-in double bill". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film as "one of the zippier little B pictures of the year," adding that "it is designed primarily as a spectacle of kinetic titillation, and on that level, it's a foregone smash hit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shales |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shales |date=June 11, 1975 |title='Death Race 2000': Smashing And Ruthless Exploitation |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=B6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was also positive, calling it "a fine little action picture with big ideas" and finding Carradine "terrific" in his role.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (May 2, 1975). "Barbarism in Big Brother Era". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film zero stars in his review, deriding its violence and lamenting its appeal to small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750427/REVIEWS/808259998/1023 |title=Roger Ebert's review |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=2014-05-27 |date=1975-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during a review of ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' on ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies]]'', Ebert named ''Death Race 2000'' as part of a "great tradition of summer drive-in movies" that embrace a "summer exploitation mentality in a clever way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJL5RJPLkKY |title=Ebert &amp; Roeper: The Fast and the Furious (Year 2001)|publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2017-07-31 |date=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ebert would go on to defend his original rating of zero stars in subsequent posts on his Movie Answers Man blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/death-be-not-so-good-still |title='Death' Be Not So Good. Still.|publisher=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=2017-07-31 |date=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/those-coen-boys-what-kidders |title=Those Coen Boys, What Kidders.|publisher=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=2017-07-31 |date=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has garnered critical acclaim over the years, having a score of 83% on the film critics site, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10, deeming it "fresh". The sites' critical consensus states, "''Death Race 2000'' is a fun, campy classic, drawing genuine thrills from its mindless ultra-violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_race_2000/|title=Death Race 2000 (1975)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has long been regarded as a cult hit,&lt;ref name="Brosnan" /&gt; and was often viewed as superior to ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'', a much more expensive major studio drama released later in the same year; another [[dystopia]]n science-fiction sports film similarly focusing on the use of dangerous sports as an "opiate".&lt;ref name="Brosnan" /&gt;

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:

==Legacy==

===Comic book series===
A [[comic book]] [[sequel]] titled ''Death Race 2020'' was published in 1995 by [[Roger Corman]]'s short-lived ''Roger Corman's Cosmic Comics'' imprint. It was written by [[Pat Mills]] of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' fame, with art by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]. The pair had already worked together on several comics, including ''[[Marshal Law (comics)|Marshal Law]]''. The comic book, as the title indicates, took place 20 years after the film ended and dealt with Frankenstein's return to the race. New racer characters introduced included [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], the Alcoholic, Happy the Clown, Steppenwolf, Rick Rhesus and Harry Carrie.

The comic book series lasted eight issues before being cancelled.

===Remake series===
[[Paul W. S. Anderson]] directed a [[Film remake|remake]] entitled ''[[Death Race (film)|Death Race]]'', which was released August 22, 2008, starring [[Jason Statham]]. The remake began production in late August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Two [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] [[prequels]] titled ''[[Death Race 2]]'' (2011) and ''[[Death Race 3: Inferno]]'' (2013) starring [[Luke Goss]], [[Tanit Phoenix]], [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Ving Rhames]] and a direct-to-DVD sequel titled ''[[Death Race: Beyond Anarchy]]'' (2018) were also produced.

===Sequel===

==Club career==
Hanif is a graduate of Brunei's [[Brunei Sports School|Sports School]], the institution that also produced Bruneian internationals such as [[Azwan Ali Rahman]] and [[Shafie Effendy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sports School opening enrollment|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/147018841@N07/31544551081/in/album-72157673926094104/|date=20 January 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his league football career with [[Najip FC]] in 2014, a team that [[2012-13 Brunei Super League|lost every game in their previous season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Najip FC looking to start afresh this season|url=http://www.nfabd.org/news/2014012102.htm|date=21 January 2014|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coached by the late [[Johari Bungsu]], Hanif achieved a third-place finish with Najip FC in the [[2014 Brunei Super League]] and also reached the final of the FA Cup that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Najip FC enters the DST FA 2014 Finals |url=http://www.rtbnews.rtb.gov.bn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24668%3Anajip-fc-enters-the-dst-fa-2014-finals&amp;Itemid=106|date=25 December 2014|publisher=Radio Televisyen Brunei|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei's football association [[National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|NFABD]] created [[Tabuan Muda]] in 2015, a league team that serves to prepare for international tournaments, mirroring [[Singapore national football team|Singapore's]] [[Young Lions FC|Young Lions]] and [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia's]] [[Harimau Muda]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Season starts next week |url=http://bruneifootball.blogspot.com/2015/03/season-starts-next-week.html|date=25 March 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanif was assigned to the Under-18s playing in the [[Brunei Premier League]] at the start of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Najip start season with a win|url=http://www.nfabd.org/news/2015040402.htm|date=4 April 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however he was promoted to the [[Brunei Super League]] team in the second half of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tabuan Muda|url=http://nfabd.org/schedules/dst-superleague-2015-teams-06.htm|date=|publisher=National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabuan Muda finished fifth in the [[2015 Brunei Super League|2015]] and [[2016 Brunei Super League|2016]] seasons of the BSL.

Hanif trialled out for and joined [[Brunei DPMM FC]]'s Under-19 team in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC Under-19 team thrash BSSSA 11-0|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/147018841@N07/31672658006/in/album-72157677869971436/|date=7 September 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was overlooked for promotion in 2016, he was handed a professional contract by [[Steve Kean]] to play for DPMM in the [[S.League]] in [[2017 S.League|2017]].

Hanif played in a 6-1 drubbing by [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]] in a friendly on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambodia put six goals past Brunei in friendly|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/cambodia-put-six-goals-past-brunei-in-friendly/|date=4 November 2015|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next callup was at the [[2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification]] matches held in [[Cambodia]] in October, and started all three matches.

'''Offermann Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] located in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It was primarily used for [[baseball]] and was the home of [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[International League]]. The ballpark had a capacity of 14,000 people and opened in 1924. It was located on the block bounded by East Ferry Street (north, third base), Masten Avenue (east, left field), Woodlawn Avenue (south, right field) and Michigan Avenue (west, first base).

==History==
The site on the corner of  East Ferry and Michigan Avenue had been in use as a baseball venue since 1889. [[Buffalo Baseball Park]] was constructed on the site in that year, replacing [[Olympic Park (Buffalo)|Olympic Park]] as the Bisons' home ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bisons History [http://buffalo.bisons.milb.com/about/page.jsp?ymd=20071210&amp;content_id=328596&amp;vkey=about_t422&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t422 bisons.com] accessed 19-APR-2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;When Baseball came to Richmond Avenue [http://www.richmondavenue.org/professional_baseball_on_richmond_ave_.htm richomndavenue.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828122026/http://www.richmondavenue.org/professional_baseball_on_richmond_ave_.htm |date=2008-08-28 }} accessed 19-APR-2008&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden stands served as the Bisons' home stadium through the 1923 season.  For 1924, a new steel-and-concrete structure was built on the site. It was initially called '''Bison Stadium''', and was renamed in memory of owner Frank J. Offermann following his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zBIuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iJgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3786%2C402079 "Montreal Gazette" Feb 4, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source, this park was the site of the first high-minor league night game, on July 3, 1930, a year in which many minor league teams resorted to lights during the heat of summer as a means of boosting attendance as the [[Great Depression]] began to take effect (the majors would not begin using lights until 1935).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2021/Buffalo%20NY%20Courier%20Express/Buffalo%20NY%20Courier%20Express%201935/Buffalo%20NY%20Courier%20Express%201935%20-%200320.pdf Buffalo Courier Express]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark had fairly cozy dimensions. It was on a rectangular block, with the diamond tilted somewhat counterclockwise relative to the streets. Left field was 321 feet, left center 345, center 400, right center 365, right field line 297. Also, it was reportedly only 33 feet to the backstop. This added up to a hitters park, and several sluggers took advantage, especially [[Luke Easter (baseball player)|Luke Easter]], who in the mid-1950s led the International League in home runs despite being over 40 years old. Earlier, in May 1938, the much-traveled [[Bob Seeds|Bob "Suitcase" Seeds]] had hit 7 home runs in two days here.

The ballpark went out with a bang and a whimper in 1960, its final season, as the Bisons made it to the [[Junior World Series]] but lost the final game, at home. The next year, they moved about ten blocks straight south on Masten to take up shop at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]].

Thus the "permanent" version of the ballpark lasted 36 seasons, whereas the "temporary" wooden version had survived for 35. The stadium was eventually demolished and in 1962, Woodlawn Junior High School (eventually renamed Buffalo Traditional School) opened on the site's grounds.  In 2008, the site became the new home of the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. In August 2012, a historical plaque was dedicated at the site in remembrance of over 72 years of baseball played on the grounds. Local Buffalo sports historian John Boutet spearheaded the project and raised the funds through the Facebook group Buffalo Sports Museum, the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bisons.

It is one of the three main venues within the Scottish Event Campus. 

Since the opening of the original buildings in 1985, the complex has undergone two major expansions; the first being the [[SEC Armadillo]] in 1997, and then the [[SSE Hydro]] in 2013. The venue's holding company SEC Limited, is 91% owned by [[Glasgow City Council]] and 9% owned by private investors. It is probably best known for hosting concerts, particularly in Hall 4 and Hall 3.

==Development history==
The [[Scottish Development Agency]] first supported the construction of an [[Exhibition center|exhibition centre]] in Glasgow in 1979. A site at the former Queen's Dock on the north bank of the Clyde at [[Finnieston]], which had closed to navigation in 1969, was selected. [[Land reclamation]] works started in 1982 using rubble from the demolished [[St Enoch railway station]]. The construction of the SECC buildings began on the site in 1983.

===Main Building===
The Main Building was completed and opened in 1985, with a concert by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] in Hall 1. It later held the Grand International Show in Hall 4 as part of the 1988 [[Glasgow Garden Festival]]. In 1990, the SECC was one of the hubs of Glasgow's year as [[European Capital of Culture|European City of Culture]], hosting concerts by [[Luciano Pavarotti]], the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Ballet and Opera]] and [[Bryan Adams]].

Upon its opening, the Centre quickly gained its nickname from the local press and thus to general usage, "The Big Red Shed", owing to its outward appearance, which resembled a giant red painted warehouse. The nickname became redundant after the Main Building was painted grey in 1997.

The SECC occupies 64 acres (260,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land – most of which is surface car parking space – and hosts numerous music concerts, exhibitions and professional conferences.  The SECC also has its own railway station, [[Exhibition Centre railway station|Exhibition Centre]], on the [[Argyle Line, Glasgow|Argyle Line]] of Glasgow's suburban railway network. The 16-storey [[Crowne Plaza Glasgow|Forum Hotel]] (now part of the Crowne Plaza chain) was opened on the site in 1989. 

In September 1996, a new 5,095&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibition hall, Hall 3, was opened. In May 1997, the conversion of Hall 1 into the Loch Suite conference venue was completed.

===SEC Armadillo===
{{main|SEC Armadillo}}
[[Image:Wfm secc auditorium.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Clyde Auditorium with the main SECC building behind it]]
In 1995, construction began on a new building – the [[SEC Armadillo]] – to become part of the SECC complex.  Designed by award-winning architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]] and often called "the [[armadillo]]" by Glaswegians, this new 3,000 capacity building was completed in 1997.

===Queens Dock 2 expansion===
{{main|SSE Hydro}}
In April 2004, the owners SEC Ltd again commissioned [[Foster and Partners]] to design a £562&amp;nbsp;million regeneration of the Queen's Dock area, under the name QD2 – so called as this is the second regeneration of the former Queen's Dock area since the centre's inception. 

This project incorporated [[SSE Hydro]], a 12,500 seat, £50&amp;nbsp;million concert arena for the SECC, which opened in September 2013. The centre is also to be served by the [[Clyde FastLink]]. The surface carparks to the West of the site will be sold for residential development and land to the east has also been identified for commercial development.

===Shows and Events===
The venue hosted the [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008]]. The SECC hosted the [[Girls' Day Out Show]] in 2009, 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girlsdayoutshow.co.uk|title=The Girls' Day Out Show at the SECC in Glasgow|accessdate=17 March 2011 |quote=SECC Events – Girls' Day Out Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; It staged The Scottish Golf Show in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishgolfshow.co.uk|title=The Scottish Golf Show at the SECC in Glasgow|accessdate=17 March 2011 |quote=SECC Events –  The Scottish Golf Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue annually stages the popular [[BBC]] Good Food Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glasgow.bbcgoodfoodshow.com/ |title=BBC Good Food Show |publisher=BBC Haymarket Exhibitions |accessdate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819181115/http://glasgow.bbcgoodfoodshow.com/ |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 15 November 2016, it played host to [[Insane Championship Wrestling]]'s biggest show of the year, ''Fear &amp; Loathing VIII'', the company's biggest sold out show to date.  It also was the biggest selling show in British wrestling history since [[Shirley Crabtree|Big Daddy]] fought [[Giant Haystacks]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C4GF7CNNv0|title=ICW Sells Out the SECC|first=|last=Insane Championship Wrestling - ICW|date=20 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SECC hosted the [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction convention]] twice, as [[53rd World Science Fiction Convention|Intersection, the 53rd World Science Fiction convention]] in 1995, and [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Interaction, the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention]] in 2005 (including the [[SEC Armadillo]]).

Irish pop band [[Westlife]] were honored at this venue with four specially commissioned bar stools which will be a permanent fixture at the venue. This marks an amazing 49 performances at SECC where they entertained over 380,000 fans over the years selling more tickets than any other act.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/scottish-tribute-to-westlifes-signature-bar-stool-move-7869025.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16145">[[File:Hemer-Landesgartenschau-Segway-Polo.JPG|thumb|European Polo Championship  2010 in [[Hemer]]]]
'''Segway polo''' is a team [[sport]] which started to gain some measure of [[popularity]] after being played by members of the [[Bay Area SEG|Bay Area Segway Enthusiasts Group]] (Bay Area SEG) in 2004. The Bay Area SEG was not the first to play polo on a [[Segway HT]]; a team sponsored by [[Mobile Entertainment]] played in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] at a [[Minnesota Vikings]] halftime show in 2003 although the Bay Area SEG members were not aware of this match at the time they first played the sport. Segway polo was developed as it is played today by the members of the Bay Area SEG and other groups and teams that have joined subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ispa.segpolo.org/polo_variants], International Segway Polo Association, retrieved 23 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Segway polo is similar to [[polo|horse polo]], except that instead of playing on [[horseback]], each player rides a [[Segway PT]] on the field. The rules have been adapted from [[bicycle polo]] and horse polo. Two teams of five players each hit a ball with their mallets, trying to get the ball into the other team's goal. The regulation field size is 200 feet (61 meters) by 128 feet (39 meters), and the goal is 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide by 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. A regulation match consists of four 8 minute quarters, known in polo as "chukkers." The ball can be struck with the mallet or any part of a player’s body or Segway but may only be directed using the mallet. A goal can not be scored off of any part of a player’s body or Segway unless it occurs accidentally.

Although not a major sport, Segway polo is gaining popularity and teams have begun forming in the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Barbados]], [[Lebanon]], the United Kingdom, Holland and [[Spain]] among others. The International Segway Polo Association (ISPA) has been established as the official [[sports governing body|governing body]] for Segway Polo.

==Woz Cup==
[[File:Kathy and Woz (2400485190) (cropped2).jpg|thumb|right|Wozniak with then-girlfriend [[Kathy Griffin]] at an April 2008 Segway Polo match]]
The Segway Polo [[world championship]] is the Woz Challenge Cup. It is named after [[Steve Wozniak | Steve "Woz" Wozniak]], cofounder of [[Apple Inc.]], and a player of Segway Polo.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite episode |airdate= 1 May 2017 |series= Daily Planet |network= Discovery Channel Canada }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Woz Cup was established in 2006 when the [[Silicon Valley]] Aftershocks played the New Zealand Pole Blacks in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. The result was a 2–2 tie.

In 2007, it was played in [[San Francisco]], California, with the Aftershocks defeating the Pole Blacks 5–0.

The 2008 Woz Cup was played in [[Indianapolis]], coincident with Segwayfest 2008.  The California Gold Rush defeated the Silicon Valley Aftershocks for the championship by a score of 3–2. The Funky-Move Turtles ([[Germany]]) placed third and the Polo Bears ([[California]]) placed fourth.

'''Stade de Genève''', also called '''Stade de Servette''', is a [[stadium]] in [[Geneva]]. It has a capacity of 30,084.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servettefc.ch/eng/infrastructures/stade-de-geneve.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216101909/http://www.servettefc.ch/eng/infrastructures/stade-de-geneve.php |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Stade de Genève 57.JPG|250px|thumb|Portugal vs Croatia, 10 June 2013]]
The stadium was completed in 2003 by [[Implenia|Zschokke Construction S.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0008232|title=Geneva Stadium|work=Structurae|accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; after nearly three years of construction. Normally the home venue of Geneva's [[Servette FC]], a Swiss [[football (soccer)|football]] team, the stadium hosted [[friendly match|international friendlies]] between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[England national football team|England]] on November 12, 2005, which England won [[Argentina v England (2005)|3-2]] and between New Zealand and Brazil on June 4, 2006, which Brazil won 4-0. The venue played host to three group-stage matches for [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group A|Group A]] during [[UEFA Euro 2008]].

A memorable match [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group A#Turkey vs Czech Republic|Turkey-Czech Republic]] was played in this stadium. The stadium was also used for [[rugby union]], with a [[2006-07 Heineken Cup]] clash between [[CS Bourgoin-Jallieu|Bourgoin]] and [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] being moved from [[Stade Pierre Rajon|Bourgoin's home ground]].

In the summer of 2016 the stadium was equipped with heated hybrid turf, Mixto Hybrid Grass by Limonta Sport to cater the needs of football and rugby clubs of Servette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Visentini|first1=Daniel|title=Le Stade de Genève dispose de la Rolls-Royce des pelouses|url=http://www.tdg.ch/sports/sfc/Le-Stade-de-Geneve-dispose-de-la-RollsRoyce-des-pelouses/story/15282147|accessdate=1 August 2016|publisher=Tribune de Genève|date=25 July 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installation of the new turf prevented Servette FC from playing home on the first three rounds of the [[2016–17 Swiss Challenge League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Visentini|first1=Daniel|title=Braizat et la défaite: «Je n’en ai pas dormi pendant deux jours|url=http://www.tdg.ch/sports/sfc/braizat-defaite-dormi-deux-jours/story/14613572|accessdate=1 August 2016|publisher=Tribune de Genène|date=28 July 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the events were held in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], annually from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Matchroom 2006" /&gt; Six notable players were selected to participate in each event, which lasted for three days.&lt;ref name="Matchroom 2006" /&gt; Despite its name, the WPA was simply an [[invitational tournament]], not a [[Sports league|league]] in the usual sporting senses. The victor in the final event was [[Dennis Orcollo]] of the [[Philippines]], 8&amp;ndash;5 over [[Niels Feijen]] of the [[Netherlands]], for a [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000 first-place prize.&lt;ref name="Matchroom 2006" /&gt;

==Format==

===Round robin stage===
The players were arranged such that each on the others once, in [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] fashion. Unlike most matches in the sport where a player has to score a required number of racks to win, players in this round play in an assigned number of racks (for example: 10 racks or 12 racks). If a player won more racks than those remaining in the match, 2 points were earned. If the match ended with two players in the same score, then both settled for a point each. The leading 4 players in the field proceeded to the semi-finals.

===Semi-finals and final===
The semi-finals were [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination (knock-out)]]. The final was played as a {{Cuegloss|Race|race}} (such as race-to-nine or race-to-eight).
