'''Aaron David Gordon''' ({{lang-he|אהרן דוד גורדון}}; &lt;span dir= "ltr"&gt;9 June 1856 – 22 February 1922&lt;/span&gt;), more commonly known as '''A. D. Gordon''', was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideologue and the spiritual force behind [[practical Zionism]] and [[Labor Zionism]]. He founded [[Hapoel Hatzair]], a movement that set the tone for the Zionist movement for many years to come. Influenced by [[Leo Tolstoy]] and others, it is said that in effect he made a religion of labor. However, he himself wrote in 1920, "Surely in our day it is possible to live without religion."

==Childhood==
Gordon was the only child of a well-to-do family of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]].&lt;ref name = Religion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/zionism-hapoel-hatzair-gordon.htm|title=zionism/hapoel-hatzair/gordon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was self-educated in both religious and general studies, and spoke several  languages.&lt;ref name=Languages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/aaron-david-gordon/|title=Aaron David Gordon Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For thirty years, he managed an estate, where he proved to be a charismatic educator and community activist. Gordon married his cousin, Faige Tartakov, at a young age and had seven children with her, though only two of them survived.

==''Aliyah''==
Gordon was an early member of the [[Hovevei Zion|Hibbat Zion]] movement and made ''[[aliyah]]'' to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1904, when he was 48, after being persuaded by his wife not to emigrate to America. His daughter Yael followed him in 1908 and his wife about a year later, but his son stayed behind to continue his religious studies{{spaced ndash}}he seems to have refused to accompany his father because of differences in their religious outlooks. Four months after she arrived in the country, his wife became ill and died. Gordon lived in [[Petah Tikva]] and [[Rishon LeZion]], before finally settling in the [[Galilee]] in 1919. He lived simply and supported himself as a hired agricultural hand, while writing his emerging philosophy at night. Although he participated in the Zionist Congress of 1911, Gordon refused to become involved in any of the Zionist political parties, out of principle.

==Views on Jews, labour, and nationhood==
Gordon believed that all of [[Jew]]ish suffering could be traced to the parasitic state of Jews in the [[Diaspora]], who were unable to participate in creative labor. To remedy this, he sought to promote physical labor and agriculture as a means of uplifting Jews spiritually. It was the experience of labor, he believed, that linked the individual to the hidden aspects of nature and being, which, in turn were the source of vision, [[poetry]], and the spiritual life. Furthermore, he also believed that working the land was a sacred task, not only for the individual but for the entire Jewish people. Agriculture would unite the people with the land and justify its continued existence there. In his own words: "The Land of Israel is acquired through labor, not through fire and not through blood." Return to the soil would transform the Jewish people and allow its rejuvenation, according to his philosophy. A.D. Gordon elaborated on these themes, writing: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jewish people has been completely cut off from nature and imprisoned within city walls for two thousand years. We have been accustomed to every form of life, except a life of labor- of labor done at our behalf and for its own sake. It will require the greatest effort of will for such a people to become normal again. We lack the principal ingredient for national life. We lack the habit of labor… for it is labor which binds a people to its soil and to its national culture, which in its turn is an outgrowth of the people's toil and the people's labor. ... We, the Jews, were the first in history to say: "For all the nations shall go each in the name of its God" and "Nations shall not lift up sword against nation" - and then we proceed to cease being a nation ourselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we now come to re-establish our path among the ways of living nations of the earth, we must make sure that we find the right path. We must create a new people, a human people whose attitude toward other peoples is informed with the sense of human brotherhood and whose attitude toward nature and all within it is inspired by noble urges of life-loving creativity. All the forces of our history, all the pain that has accumulated in our national soul, seem to impel us in that direction... we are engaged in a creative endeavor the like of which is itself not to be found in the whole history of mankind: the rebirth and rehabilitation of a people that has been uprooted and scattered to the winds...'' (A.D. Gordon, "Our Tasks Ahead" 1920)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon perceived nature as an organic unity. He preferred organic bonds in society, like those of family, community and nation, over "mechanical" bonds, like those of state, party and class. Jewish individuals were cut off from their nation, living in Diaspora, they were cut off from direct contact with nature; they were cut off from the experience of sanctity, and the existential bond with the infinite. Gordon wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e are a parasitic people. We have no roots in the soil, there is no ground beneath our feet. And we are parasites not only in an economic sense, but in spirit, in thought, in poetry, in literature, and in our virtues, our ideals, our higher human aspirations. Every alien movement sweeps us along, every wind in the world carries us. We in ourselves are almost non-existent, so of course we are nothing in the eyes of other people either''&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Praxis==
More than just a theoretician, he insisted on putting this philosophy into practice, and refused to take any clerical position that was offered to him. He was an elderly intellectual of no great physical strength and with no experience doing manual labor, but he took up the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] and worked in the fields, always focusing on the aesthetics of his work. He served as a model of the pioneering spirit, descending to the people and remaining with them no matter what the consequences were. He experienced the problems faced by the working class, suffering from [[malaria]], [[poverty]], and unemployment. But he did have admirers and followers who turned to him for advice and help. 

Gordon had always been a principled individual&amp;mdash;even as a young man he refused to allow his parents to pay the customary [[bribe]] so that he would be exempted from military service, arguing that if he did not serve, someone else would have to serve instead of him. In the end, he spent six months in the army, but was released when it was discovered that he was not in good enough physical shape. He later refused to accept payment for his articles or the classes he taught, citing the [[Mishnah]] that states "Do not turn the [[Torah]] into a source of income." At the same time, he did not lapse into dogmatism either. When [[Rachel Bluwstein|Rachel the Poet]] asked his opinion about whether she should go overseas to study, an idea that was anathema to most of the Zionist leadership, he encouraged her to do so.

==Views on religion==
Although formerly an Orthodox Jew, Gordon rejected religion later in his life. Students of his writings have found that Gordon was greatly influenced by Russian author [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as by the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic movement]] and [[Kabbalah]]. Many have also found parallels between his ideas and those of his contemporary, Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the spiritual father of [[Religious Zionism]].

==Jewish–Arab relations==
Central to Gordon's philosophy is the idea that the cosmos is a unity. This notion in which man and nature are one and all men are organic parts of the cosmos is reflected throughout his thought, including political issues, the role of women in the modern world, and Jewish attitude to the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, Samuel Hugo. ''Faith and Reason: An Introduction to Modern Jewish Thought''. B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations, Inc., 1961, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the central test for the reborn Jewish nation would be the attitude of the Jews to the Arabs. The Biblical principle regarding "the stranger that sojourns in thy midst" guided his thought on this matter. In his statutes for labor settlements, which he drew up in 1922, Gordon included a clause that said that land should be assigned to Arabs wherever new settlements were founded, to ensure their welfare. He believed that this principle of good neighborliness should be undertaken for moral reasons rather than tactical advantage, and that it would eventually lead to a spirit of universal human solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman 1961. pps.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of his thinking on Jewish-Arab relations can be found in his work ''Mibachutz'', where he wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our relations to the Arabs must rest on cosmic foundations. Our attitude toward them must be one of humanity, of moral courage which remains on the highest plane, even if the behavior of the other side is not all that is desired. Indeed their hostility is all the more a reason for our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Mibachutz'' in Gordon's ''Collected Works'', 1952, I, p.478. in Bergman 1961. p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vision==
Gordon's moods alternated between enormous frustration and great hope for the future. He believed that an idealistic new generation of creative Jews would emerge in the Land of Israel, with a high sense of morals, a deep spiritual commitment, and a commitment to their fellow human beings. Toward the end of his life, however, he preferred to isolate himself in [[Nature]]. From a letter he wrote to Rachel the Poet, it seems that he grew more and more frustrated with people's petty squabbles and selfish interests.

==Founding Hapoel Hatzair==
He founded and led [[Hapoel Hatzair]] ("The Young Worker"), a non-Marxist, Zionist movement, as opposed to the [[Poale Zion]] movement which was more Marxist in orientation and associated with [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Nahum Syrkin]].

==Death and legacy==
[[Gordonia (youth movement)|Gordonia]], a Zionist youth movement, was created to put Gordon's teachings into practice, established several [[kibbutz]]im in [[Israel]]. Gordon died of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] on Kibbutz [[Degania Alef]] at the age of 66.

'''Afshin Ellian''' (born 27 February 1966 in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]) is an [[Iran]]ian-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[professor|professor of law]], [[philosopher]], [[poet]], and [[Criticism of Islam|critic of political Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A.Berman, Freedom or Terror: Europe Faces Jihad (Stanford: Hoover Institution Press 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an expert in [[international public law]] and [[philosophy of law]].

==Biography==
In 1989, Ellian came to the [[Netherlands]] as a political [[refugee]].
Having experienced first-hand the Islamic theocratic government of [[Iran]], he writes often about how such issues are affecting the world in general and the [[Netherlands]] in particular. Due to threats on his life tied to such criticism, he is currently heavily guarded.&lt;ref&gt;For Public Figures in Netherlands, Terror Becomes a Personal Concern, Washington Post, November 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellian grew up in [[Iran]]. As a youngster, he learned the profession of journalism with one of the most prominent journalists of Iran. He was a freelance journalist for Iranian political magazines aimed at youth. During the [[Iranian Revolution]] 1978-1979 he became, like many youngsters of his age, a supporter of the Fedayan-e Khalq-e Iran. After the revolution, however, there came a split in this party. Many followers become adherents of either the majority branch of this party or supporters of the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]]. Ellian became both a member of the Tudeh Party of Iran and active with the Youth Organization of Tudeh Party of Iran. It is worth noting that the Islamic regime prohibited and suppressed all political parties and activities which were not aligned with it after the Revolution. This meant that also Ellian was in danger of being arrested which, hence, led him to go underground and finally to escape the country. He decided to escape to Pakistan.
However, there he still faced extradition back to Iran thus shortly afterwards he fled to  Afghanistan where already a community of intellectuals and activists from Iran had gathered. There he met Siavash Kasraie who was also a member of the Tudeh Party of Iran and from whom he learned poetry. Besides he studied medicine for few years in the capital, Kabul.  
Slowly on an ideological struggle occurred between him and the leaders of the Tudeh Party in Kabul who were, in Ellian’s point of view, Stalinist figures which was reason enough for him and few of his friends to break up with the Tudeh Party of Iran. In the fall of 1987, he decided to seek asylum with the Permanent Representative of the United Nations in Kabul whereupon, in 1989, he was invited to come to the Netherlands and was flown out of the country by the United Nations together with other dissidents who were also in danger.&lt;ref&gt;J. Groen, “Dichters zijn onbetrouwbaar [poets are not trustworthy]”, de Volkskrant (17 february 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Buruma]], among others, accuses Ellian of misrepresentation. On the other hand, Ibn Warraq asserts “Buruma gets these basic facts upside down. Ellian never misrepresented his identity or his past, nor did he arrive in the Netherlands under false pretenses”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newenglishreview.org/Ibn_Warraq/In_Defense_of_Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali_%26_Afshin_Ellian/&lt;/ref&gt; Spuriousness of such allegations is, for instance, also asserted by others like J. Hoeksma who, as part of the legal staff of the Dutch representation of the UNHCR at the time, also confirms the opposite of the aforementioned allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from J. Hoeksma, NRC Handelsblad, 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same grievances have been brought to the fore&lt;ref&gt;A letter had been sent by A. Ellian and F. Bolkestein to the Penguin Press as regards to the allegations made in Buruma’s book as published by this same publisher on 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; by, among others, Ellian himself and Frits Bolkestein due to which Buruma was, together with his publisher “Publishing House Penguin”, forced to make many changes and removals in later editions of his book. Other prominent persons defending the truthfulness of Ellian’s case include the Nobel Prize winner of Literature Mario Vargas Llosa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article92023/Schiessen-schneiden-stossen-Theo-van-Goghs-schrecklicher-Tod.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands Ellian started his studies of law at the [[Universiteit van Tilburg|Catholic University of Brabant]] (now the [[Universiteit van Tilburg|University of Tilburg]]). In 1996, he graduated with a degree in [[international public law]], [[criminal law]], and [[philosophy]]. He remained in Brabant as a researcher until he found a position with the ''Amsterdam Center for International Law'', of the [[University of Amsterdam]]. He obtained a PhD from the University of Tilburg in 2003, The title of his doctoral dissertation is: "A Investigation into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;A.Ellian, Een onderzoek naar de Waarheids- en Verzoeningscommissie van Zuid Afrika [A Investigation into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa] (Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Productions 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In this research he focused on the political transition sparked by the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission; questions pertaining to both international criminal law and legal philosophy. Central in his research stood the question: “why did the South Africans opt for a tribunal and the possibility of amnesty instead of a criminal tribunal that could try and punish the crimes of the past?”. It is worth to bring to attention for those who are interested in this topic that a further reading on this can be found in a later academic book wherein he has contributed by means of his article titled “Political Transition to a Democratic Regime: The South African Echoes of Forgiveness, Truth Commission and Negotiating Justice”.&lt;ref&gt;G.Molier &amp; E.Nieuwenhuys (eds), Peace, Security and Development in an Area of Globalization: The integrated security approach viewed from a multidisciplinary perspective (Dodrecht: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In his aforementioned research, he concluded that the commission was an acceptable tribunal worthy of international respect. In 2003 he became an associated professor of jurisprudence, and since 2005 he is a full professor at the law faculty of the [[University of Leiden]]. Since 2012 he is the academic director of the Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of the Law at the law faculty of Leiden.

{{Criticism of Islam sidebar}}
Ellian was a regular columnist for ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', and makes appearances on political discussion programs on Dutch television. Ellian writes articles for the magazine [[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] but also for international magazines and newspapers such as [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Le Monde]], and [[Le Figaro]].

Following the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]], Ellian wrote an open letter to [[Ali Khamenei]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]].&lt;ref name="derspiegel"&gt;{{cite news | title = Open Letter to Ayatollah Khamenei: 'Your Regime Is Finished' | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,631233,00.html | author = Afshin Ellian | publisher = Der Spiegel | date = 2009-06-18 | accessdate = 2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was published by German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], Le Monde, the Wall Street Journal,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124518163406220075#printMode&lt;/ref&gt; and Dutch newspaper [[NRC Handelsblad]].&lt;ref name="derspiegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;{{cite news | title = 'The children of the revolution will accept the ayatollah's rule no more' | url = http://www.nrc.nl/international/opinion/article2276376.ece | author = Afshin Ellian | publisher = NRC Handelsblad | date = 2009-06-18 | accessdate = 2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Der Spiegel subtitled the letter "Your Regime Is Finished" (not a direct quote from Ellian), while NRC Handelsblad subtitled it "The children of the revolution will accept the ayatollah's rule no more".&lt;ref name="derspiegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;
It is inevitable to bear in mind that Afshin Ellian is also a prominent defender of the Freedom of Speech.&lt;ref&gt;A.Ellian, G.Molier &amp; T.Zwart, Mag Ik Dit Zeggen: Beschouwingen over de Vrijheid van Meningsuiting (Den Haag: Boom Juridische Uitgeverij 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; For the most recent publication reference can be made to the book “The State of Exception and Militant Democracy in a Time of Terror”.&lt;ref&gt;A.Ellian &amp; G.Molier, The State of Exception and Militant Democracy in a Time of Terror (Dordrecht: Republic of Letters Publishing 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

*"''The extremists are afraid that if Dutch society becomes a safe haven for an intellectual discussion of political Islam, it will be very dangerous for them''" &lt;ref name="post"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/10/AR2005111002046.html For Public Figures in Netherlands, Terror Becomes a Personal Concern], ''Washington Post'', November 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*"''Free speech is in danger of being increasingly restricted by invoking “Islamophobia” and “racism”. And some intellectuals have already capitulated. For example, the opera Aisha was called off in Rotterdam in 2001, because the wife of the Prophet was depicted on stage. The production had to be cancelled because a number of actresses felt threatened.

In [[logic]] and [[philosophy]], an '''argument''' is a series of statements (in a [[natural language]]), called the premises or premisses (both spellings are acceptable) intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement, the conclusion.   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/ "Argument", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy."] "In everyday life, we often use the word "argument" to mean a verbal dispute or disagreement. This is not the way this word is usually used in philosophy. However, the two uses are related. Normally, when two people verbally disagree with each other, each person attempts to convince the other that his/her viewpoint is the right one. Unless he or she merely results to name calling or threats, he or she typically presents an argument for his or her position, in the sense described above. In philosophy, "arguments" are those statements a person makes in the attempt to convince someone of something, or present reasons for accepting a given conclusion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph H. Johnson, ''Manifest Rationality: A pragmatic theory of argument'' (New Jersey: Laurence Erlbaum, 2000), 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ralph H. Johnson, ''Manifest Rationality: A pragmatic theory of argument'' (New Jersey: Laurence Erlbaum, 2000), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. CUM, 1995 "Argument: a sequence of statements such that some of them (the premises) purport to give reason to accept another of them, the conclusion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/#3  Stanford Enc. Phil., ''Classical Logic'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[logical form]] of an argument in a natural language can be represented in a symbolic [[formal language]], and independently of natural language formally defined "arguments" can be made in math and computer science.

Logic is the study of the forms of [[reason]]ing in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/ "Argument", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy."]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deductive argument]]s can be valid or sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premisses is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premisses necessitate a true conclusion.  [[Inductive argument]]s, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength:  the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/ded-ind/ "Deductive and Inductive Arguments," Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt; The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example, the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in [[transcendental arguments]],&lt;ref&gt;hCharles Taylor, "The Validity of Transcendental Arguments", ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard, 1995), 20-33. "[Transcendental] arguments consist of a string of what one could call indispensability claims. They move from their starting points to their conclusions by showing that the condition stated in the conclusion is indispensable to the feature identified at the start… Thus we could spell out Kant's transcendental deduction in the first edition in three stages: experience must have an object, that is, be ''of'' something; for this it must be coherent; and to be coherent it must be shaped by the understanding through the categories."&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of hypotheses in [[retroduction]], or even the [[world disclosure|disclosure]] of new possibilities for thinking and acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nikolas |last=Kompridis |chapter=World Disclosing Arguments? |title=Critique and Disclosure |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |pages=116–124 |isbn=0262277425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Latin root ''arguere'' (to make bright, enlighten, make known, prove, etc.) is from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''argu-yo-'', suffixed form of ''arg-'' (to shine; white).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Argue |dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/argue |access-date=15 June 2018 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Harper |publisher=MaoningTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal and informal ==
{{Further|Informal logic|Formal logic}}

Informal arguments as studied in ''informal logic'', are presented in [[ordinary language]] and are intended for everyday [[discourse]]. Conversely, formal arguments are studied in ''formal logic'' (historically called ''symbolic logic'', more commonly referred to as ''mathematical logic'' today) and are expressed in a [[formal language]]. Informal logic may be said to emphasize the study of [[argumentation]], whereas formal logic emphasizes [[Entailment|implication]] and [[inference]].  Informal arguments are sometimes implicit.  That is, the rational structure – the relationship of claims, premises, warrants, relations of implication, and conclusion – is not always spelled out and immediately visible and must sometimes be made explicit by analysis.

==Standard types==
[[File:Argument terminology used in logic.png|thumb|400px|Argument terminology]]
There are several kinds of arguments in logic, the best-known of which are "deductive" and "inductive." An argument has one or more premises but only one conclusion. Each premise and the conclusion are [[Truthbearer|truth bearers]] or "truth-candidates", each capable of being either true or false (but not both).  These truth values bear on the terminology used with arguments.

===Deductive arguments===
*A [[Deductive reasoning|deductive argument]] asserts that the [[truth]] of the conclusion is a [[logical consequence]] of the premises. Based on the premises, the conclusion follows necessarily (with certainty). For example, given premises that A=B and B=C, then the conclusion follows necessarily that A=C. Deductive arguments are sometimes referred to as "truth-preserving" arguments.
*A deductive argument is said to be valid or invalid. If one ''assumes'' the premises to be true (ignoring their actual truth values), would the conclusion follow with certainty? If yes, the argument is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid. In determining validity, the structure of the argument is essential to the determination, not the actual truth values. For example, consider the argument that because bats can fly (premise=true), and all flying creatures are birds (premise=false), therefore bats are birds (conclusion=false).  If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion follows necessarily, and thus it is a valid argument. 
*If a deductive argument is valid and its premises are all true, then it is also referred to as sound. Otherwise, it is unsound, as in the "bats are birds" example.

===Inductive arguments===
*An [[inductive argument]], on the other hand, asserts that the truth of the conclusion is supported to some degree of probability by the premises. For example, given that the U.S. military budget is the largest in the world (premise=true), then it is probable that it will remain so for the next 10 years (conclusion=true). Arguments that involve predictions are inductive, as the future is uncertain.
*An inductive argument is said to be strong or weak. If the premises of an inductive argument are ''assumed'' true, is it probable the conclusion is also true? If so, the argument is strong. Otherwise, it is weak.  
*A strong argument is said to be cogent if it has all true premises. Otherwise, the argument is uncogent. The military budget argument example above is a strong, cogent argument.

== Deductive ==
{{Main|Deductive argument}}

A ''deductive argument'' is one that, if valid, has a conclusion that is [[Entailment|entail]]ed by its premises. In other words, the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises—if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the conclusion, because the negation of the conclusion is contradictory to the truth of the premises.

=== Validity ===
{{Main|Validity (logic)}}

Deductive arguments may be either valid or invalid. If an argument is valid, it is a valid deduction, and if its premises are true, the conclusion must be true: a valid argument cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.

An argument is formally valid if and only if the denial of the conclusion is incompatible with accepting all the premises.

The validity of an argument depends, however, not on the actual truth or falsity of its premises and conclusion, but solely on whether or not the argument has a valid [[Argument form|logical form]]. The validity of an argument is not a guarantee of the truth of its conclusion. Under a given interpretation, a valid argument may have false premises that render it inconclusive: the conclusion of a valid argument with one or more false premises may be either true or false.

Logic seeks to discover the valid forms, the forms that make arguments valid. A form of argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true under all interpretations of that argument in which the premises are true. Since the validity of an argument depends solely on its form, an argument can be shown to be invalid by showing that its form is invalid. This can be done by giving a counter example of the same form of argument with premises that are true under a given interpretation, but a conclusion that is false under that interpretation. In informal logic this is called a [[counter argument]].

The form of argument can be shown by the use of symbols. For each argument form, there is a corresponding statement form, called a [[corresponding conditional (logic)|corresponding conditional]], and an argument form is valid if and only if its corresponding conditional is a [[logical truth]]. A statement form which is logically true is also said to be a valid statement form. A statement form is a logical truth if it is true under all [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s.  A statement form can be shown to be a logical truth by either (a) showing that it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or (b) by means of a [[proof procedure]].

The corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a necessary truth (true ''in all possible worlds'') and so the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, or follows of logical necessity.  The conclusion of a valid argument is not necessarily true, it depends on whether the premises are true. If the conclusion, itself, just so happens to be a necessary truth, it is so without regard to the premises.

Some examples:
*''All Greeks are human and all humans are mortal; therefore, all Greeks are mortal.'' : Valid argument; if the premises are true the conclusion must be true.
*''Some Greeks are logicians and some logicians are tiresome; therefore, some Greeks are tiresome.'' Invalid  argument: the tiresome logicians might all be Romans (for example).
*''Either we are all doomed or we are all saved; we are not all saved; therefore, we are all doomed.'' Valid argument; the premises entail the conclusion.  (This does not mean the conclusion has to be true; it is only true if the premises are true, which they may not be!)
* ''Some men are hawkers. Some hawkers are rich. Therefore, some men are rich.'' Invalid argument. This can be easier seen by giving a counter-example with the same argument form:
** ''Some people are herbivores. ''Some herbivores are zebras. Therefore, some people are zebras.'' Invalid argument, as it is possible that the premises be true and the conclusion false.

In the above second to last case (Some men are hawkers...), the counter-example follows the same logical form as the previous argument, (Premise 1: "Some ''X'' are ''Y''." Premise 2: "Some ''Y'' are ''Z''." Conclusion: "Some ''X'' are ''Z''.") in order to demonstrate that whatever hawkers may be, they may or may not be rich, in consideration of the premises as such. ''(See also, [[existential import]]).''

The forms of argument that render deductions valid are well-established, however some invalid arguments can also be persuasive depending on their construction ([[inductive arguments]], for example). ''(See also, [[formal fallacy]] and [[informal fallacy]]).''

=== Soundness ===
{{Main|Soundness}}
A sound argument is a valid argument whose conclusion follows from its premise(s), and the premise(s) of which is/are true.

== Inductive ==
{{Main|Inductive argument}}
Non-deductive logic is  reasoning using arguments in which the premises support the conclusion but do not entail it. Forms of non-deductive logic include the [[statistical syllogism]], which argues from generalizations true for the most part, and [[inductive inference|induction]], a form of reasoning that makes generalizations based on individual instances.  An inductive argument is said to be ''cogent'' if and only if the truth of the argument's premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable (i.e., the argument is ''strong''), and the argument's premises are, in fact, true. [[Cogency]] can be considered [[inductive logic]]'s analogue to [[deductive logic]]'s "[[soundness]]."  Despite its name, [[mathematical induction]] is not a form of inductive reasoning.  The lack of deductive validity is known as the [[problem of induction]].

==Defeasible arguments and argumentation schemes==
In modern argumentation theories, arguments are regarded as defeasible passages from premises to a conclusion. [[Defeasibility]] means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments) is provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type of reasoning is referred to as [[defeasible reasoning]]. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy example: 
::Tweedy is a bird.
::Birds generally fly.
::Therefore, Tweedy (probably) flies. 
This argument is reasonable and the premises support the conclusion unless additional information indicating that the case is an exception comes in. If Tweedy is a penguin, the inference is no longer justified by the premise. Defeasible arguments are based on generalizations that hold only in the majority of cases, but are subject to exceptions and defaults.
In order to represent and assess defeasible reasoning, it is necessary to combine the logical rules (governing the acceptance of a conclusion based on the acceptance of its premises) with rules of material inference, governing how a premise can support a given conclusion (whether it is reasonable or not to draw a specific conclusion from a specific description of a state of affairs). Argumentation schemes have been developed to describe and assess the acceptability or the fallaciousness of defeasible arguments. 
Argumentation schemes are stereotypical patterns of inference, combining semantic-ontological relations with types of reasoning and logical axioms and representing the abstract structure of the most common types of natural arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macagno|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Walton|first2=Douglas|title=Classifying the patterns of natural arguments|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric  .|date=2015|volume=48|issue=1|pages=26–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argumentation schemes provided in (Walton, Reed &amp; Macagno, 2008) describe tentatively the patterns of the most typical arguments. However, the two levels of abstraction are not distinguished. For this reason, under the label of “argumentation schemes” fall indistinctly patterns of reasoning such as the abductive, analogical, or inductive ones, and types of argument such as the ones from classification or cause to effect.
A typical example is the argument from expert opinion, which has two premises and a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|last3=Macagno|first3=Fabrizio|title=Argumentation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each scheme is associated to a set of critical questions, namely criteria for assessing dialectically the reasonableness and acceptability of an argument. The matching critical questions are the standard ways of casting the argument into doubt.

|}

If an expert says that a proposition is true, this provides a reason for tentatively accepting it, in the absence of stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the expert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.

==By analogy==
Argument by [[analogy]] may be thought of as argument from the particular to particular. An argument by analogy may use a particular truth in a premise to argue towards a similar particular truth in the conclusion. For example, if A. Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then asserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning employed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular truth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.&lt;ref name="Shaw.p.74"&gt;[[#Shaw1922|Shaw 1922]]: p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other kinds==
Other kinds of arguments may have different or additional standards of validity or justification. For example, [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] writes that so-called [[transcendental arguments]] are made up of a "chain of indispensability claims" that attempt to show why something is necessarily true based on its connection to our experience,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, "The Validity of Transcendental Arguments", ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard, 1995), 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Nikolas Kompridis]] has suggested that there are two types of "fallible" arguments: one based on truth claims, and the other based on the time-responsive disclosure of possibility (see [[world disclosure]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "Two Kinds of Fallibilism", ''Critique and Disclosure'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 180-183.&lt;/ref&gt; The late French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] is said to have been a prominent advocate of this latter form of philosophical argument.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, Foucault said of his own approach that "My role ... is to show people that they are much freer than they feel, that people accept as truth, as evidence, some themes which have been built up at a certain moment during history, and that this so-called evidence can be criticized and destroyed." He also wrote that he was engaged in "the process of putting historico-critical reflection to the ''test of concrete practices''… I continue to think that this task requires work on our limits, that is, a patient labor giving form to our impatience for liberty." (emphasis added) Hubert Dreyfus, "[http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_being.html Being and Power: Heidegger and Foucault]" and Michel Foucault, [http://foucault.info/documents/whatIsEnlightenment/foucault.whatIsEnlightenment.en.html "What is Enlightenment?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In informal logic ===
Argument is an informal calculus, relating an effort to be performed or sum to be spent, to possible future gain, either economic or moral. In informal logic, an argument is a connection between
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;an ''individual'' action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through which a ''generally accepted'' good is obtained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Ex :
 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should marry Jane (individual action, individual decision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because she has the same temper as you. (generally accepted wisdom that marriage is good in itself, and it is generally accepted that people with the same character get along well).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should not smoke (individual action, individual decision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because smoking is harmful (generally accepted wisdom that health is good).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The argument is neither a) ''advice'' nor b) ''moral or economical judgement'', but the connection between the two. 
An argument always uses the connective '''because'''. 
An argument is not an '''explanation'''. It does not connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and its beneficial outcome. 
An argument is not a '''proof'''. A proof is a logical and [[cognitive]] concept; an argument is a [[praxeology|praxeologic]] concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==== Logical status ====

Argument does not belong to logic, because it is connected to a real person, a real event, and a real effort to be made.
# If you, John, will buy this stock, it will become twice as valuable in a year. 
# If you, Mary, study dance, you will become a famous ballet dancer.

The value of the argument is connected to the immediate circumstances of the person spoken to. 
If, in the first case,(1) John has no money, or knows he has only one year to live, he will not be interested in buying the stock. If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will not be interested in studying and becoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.

=== World-disclosing ===
{{Main|World disclosure}}
World-disclosing arguments are a group of philosophical arguments that are said to employ a [[world disclosure|disclosive]] approach, to reveal features of a wider [[ontology|ontological]] or cultural-linguistic understanding – a "world," in a specifically ontological sense – in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and "logical space" on which an argument implicitly depends.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "World Disclosing ''Arguments''?" in ''Critique and Disclosure'', Cambridge:MIT Press (2006), 118-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
{{Main|Explanation}}

While arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show ''why'' or ''how'' something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of ''whether'' or not Fred's cat has fleas, Joe may state: "Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe, the cat is scratching right now." Joe has made an ''argument that'' the cat has fleas. However, if Joe asks Fred, "Why is your cat scratching itself?" the explanation, "...because it has fleas." provides understanding.

Both the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that a) fleas often cause itching, and b) that one often scratches to relieve itching. The difference is in the intent: an argument attempts to settle whether or not some [[claim (logic)|claim]] is true, and an explanation attempts to provide understanding of the event. Note, that by subsuming the specific event (of Fred's cat scratching) as an instance of the general rule that "animals scratch themselves when they have fleas", Joe will no longer wonder ''why'' Fred's cat is scratching itself. Arguments address problems of belief, explanations address problems of understanding. Also note that in the argument above, the statement, "Fred's cat has fleas" is up for debate (i.e. is a claim), but in the explanation, the statement, "Fred's cat has fleas" is assumed to be true (unquestioned at this time) and just needs ''explaining''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JONATHAN F. OSBORNE, ALEXIS PATTERSON School of Education, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA Received 27 August 2010; revised 22 November 2010; accepted 29 November 2010 DOI 10.1002/sce.20438 Published online 23 May 2011 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments and explanations largely resemble each other in [[rhetoric]]al use. This is the cause of much difficulty in [[critical thinking|thinking critically]] about claims. There are several reasons for this difficulty.

* People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.
* The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.
* The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.
* Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve ''as arguments''.&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Thinking'', Parker and Moore&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, "...arguments are essential to the process of justifying the validity of any explanation as there are often multiple explanations for any given phenomenon."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Explanations and arguments are often studied in the field of [[Information Systems]] to help explain user acceptance of knowledge-based systems. Certain argument types may fit better with personality traits to enhance acceptance by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Scott Giboney, Susan Brown, and Jay F. Nunamaker Jr. (2012). "User Acceptance of Knowledge-Based System Recommendations: Explanations, Arguments, and Fit" 45th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Hawaii, January 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fallacies and nonarguments ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}

Fallacies are types of argument or expressions which are held to be of an invalid form or contain errors in reasoning. There is not as yet any general theory of fallacy or strong agreement among researchers of their definition or potential for application but the term is broadly applicable as a label to certain examples of error, and also variously applied to ambiguous candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#H5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Logic]] types of fallacy are firmly described thus:
First the premises and the conclusion must be statements, capable of being true or false. Secondly it must be asserted that the conclusion follows from the premises. In English the words ''therefore'', ''so'', ''because'' and ''hence'' typically separate the premises from the conclusion of an argument, but this is not necessarily so. Thus: ''Socrates is a man, all men are mortal therefore Socrates is mortal'' is clearly an argument (a valid one at that), because it is clear it is asserted that ''Socrates is mortal'' follows from the preceding statements. However ''I was thirsty and therefore I drank'' is NOT an argument, despite its appearance. It is not being claimed that ''I drank'' is logically entailed by ''I was thirsty''. The ''therefore'' in this sentence indicates ''for that reason'' not ''it follows that''.

;Elliptical arguments

Often an argument is invalid because there is a missing premise—the supply of which would render it valid. Speakers and writers will often leave out a strictly necessary premise in their reasonings if it is widely accepted and the writer does not wish to state the blindingly obvious.  Example: ''All metals expand when heated, therefore iron will expand when heated.'' (Missing premise: iron is a metal). On the other hand, a seemingly valid argument may be found to lack a premise – a 'hidden assumption' – which if highlighted can show a fault in reasoning.  Example: A witness reasoned: ''Nobody came out the front door except the milkman; therefore the murderer must have left by the back door.''  (Hidden assumptions- the milkman was not the murderer, and the murderer has left by the front or back door).

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}

'''BIFF''', later  sometimes '''B1FF''', was a [[pseudonym]] on, and the prototypical [[newbie]] of, [[Usenet]]. BIFF was created as and taken up as a satire of a partly amusing, partly annoying, mostly unwelcome intrusion into a then fairly rarefied community. BIFF had a Commodore Vic-20 at first and a Commodore 64 later. BIFF posts were limited to 40 character lines to look like they'd come from those machines.

== Origin ==
BIFF was created by Joe Talmadge, who abandoned the character after just two postings. From then on, Richard Sexton took over and was credited by Talmadge as popularising BIFF.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Richard Sexton:'' I make no claim to inventing BIFF. Blame Joe Talmadge. Joe wasn't too busy one year at HP and invented a whole cast of characters such as SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR MAN, Bobby Joe (Dedicated [[A Prairie Home Companion|Wobegon]] listener), Joe Supportive (soc.singles reader for 1.5 years) and of course the big bad BIFFSTER.

''Joe Talmadge:'' Oh. Hey. Don't blame me. It's Webber's fault. Anyway, I may have invented BIFF, but Richard made him famous. Richard is the Roy Crock&lt;ref&gt;Apparently a mis-remembering of [[Ray Kroc]], who came upon a single family-run "restaurant" and turned it into the global phenomenon that is [[McDonald's#History|McDonald's]]&lt;/ref&gt; of BIFF; meanwhile, I fade quietly into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/news.groups/browse_thread/thread/a01025d8dab0f46f/5a8b82cd3ab82959?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=%22joe+talmadge%22+BIFF#5a8b82cd3ab82959 USENET postings, 1990.01.08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Versions have since been posted for the amusement of the Internet at large.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Richard Sexton:'' I posted a few BIFF articles from my account at gryphon, but now there are about 20 people, well connected, posting BIFF forgeries.  You probably don't want to hear that the people doing them had to find something to occupy themselves after they dissolved the [[backbone cabal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/news.groups/browse_thread/thread/a01025d8dab0f46f/5a8b82cd3ab82959?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=%22joe+talmadge%22+BIFF#5a8b82cd3ab82959 USENET posting, 1990.01.08:1711]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Cultural significance and later decline ==
BIFF served as a satire of an exceptional behaviour in a fairly homogeneous environment.&lt;ref&gt;for an example, see [http://www.eyrie.org/~thad/strange/b1ff.html Letter from B1FF] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive growth of the web led to the rapid decline of BIFF, as Biffisms became no longer exceptional and the Internet rapidly became a much larger and much more heterogeneous environment, leading both to newcomers not being aware of BIFF's existence and to BIFF becoming less contrasting as an exception in the increasingly "noisy" Internet.

== An example Biffism ==

==B1ff the slang typography as precursor of 1337 (Leet)==
'''B1ff''' also became the name of a type of [[internet slang]] that was created in the early days of the [[Internet]] by groups who felt they were being watched by government officials or corporations. This was a major step towards full [[Leet|1337 (Leet)]]; however, they originally had different purposes. B1ff only changes words only enough so a program looking for certain words doesn't find them, whereas 1337 was created to prevent non-1337 humans from reading text.

During the early days of [[internet gaming]], a new side of b1ff took a significant rise, when scripts edited the content of instant chat conversations. Today, however, most censoring scripts can compensate for the letter-number replacement. Thus, b1ff has mainly evolved into 1337, a more involved language which, although it does include letter-number replacement, also includes letter mixing (e.g. "[[pr0n]]"), similar-sound substitution (e.g. "h4xx" for "hack"), 'building' a letter from multiple characters (e.g. x from &gt;&lt;), and the invention of new words as a substitute for common words.

===Continued existence===
In the sense of caricaturing the prototypical pre-adolescent or over-self-confident [[noob]] on the Internet, b1ff's legacy lives on, in practice if not in name.

Beyond apparently inspiring the naming and style of the precursor to [[leet]], b1ffisms continue to be seen today in many Internet forums and comment threads, both in direct posts and in deliberate ironic imitation. Every Internet user who has used leetspeek ironically ("the ph34r!") or mocked pre-teen gamers or IRCers ("OMG WTF!!!1eleven11 kthxbye") is essentially using a modernised b1ff. b1ff, like [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]], appears to be a specifically created yet immediately classic [[shibboleth]] of some fundamental human behaviour, on the part of both the parodied and the parodying.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">In [[healthcare]], '''Carper's fundamental ways of knowing''' is a typology that attempts to classify the different sources from which knowledge and beliefs in professional practice (originally specifically [[nursing]]) can be or have been derived.  It was proposed by Barbara A. Carper, a professor at the College of Nursing at [[Texas Woman's University]], in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carper Barbara A | year = 1978 | title = Fundamental Patterns of Knowing in Nursing | url = | journal = Advances in Nursing Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–24 | pmid = 110216 | doi=10.1097/00012272-197810000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Jasper (2003), ''Beginning reflective practice''. Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|0-7487-7117-4}}; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FKroWQSJ7z4C&amp;pg=PA93 93]–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The typology identifies four fundamental "patterns of knowing":
;Empirical: Factual knowledge from [[science]], or other external sources, that can be [[empirical]]ly verified.
;Personal: Knowledge and attitudes derived from personal [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-understanding]] and [[empathy]], including imagining one's self in the patient's position.
;Ethical: Attitudes and knowledge derived from an [[applied ethics|ethical]] framework, including an awareness of [[morality|moral]] questions and choices.
;Aesthetic: Awareness of the immediate situation, seated in immediate practical action; including awareness of the patient and their circumstances as uniquely individual, and of the combined wholeness of the situation. (Aesthetic in this sense is used to mean "relating to the here and now", from the Greek αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai''), meaning "I perceive, feel, sense";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aesthetic Aesthetic], [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; the reference is ''not'' to the [[aesthetics|consideration of beauty, art and taste]]).

The emphasis on ''different'' ways of knowing is presented as a tool for generating clearer and more complete thinking and learning about experiences, and broader self-integration of classroom education.  As such it helped crystallize Johns' (1995) framework for reflective investigation to develop [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22020226.x |last1=Johns |first1=C |title=Framing learning through reflection within Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=226–34 |year=1995 |pmid=7593941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typology has been seen as leading a reaction against over-emphasis on just empirically derived knowledge, so called "scientific nursing", by emphasising that attitudes and actions that are perhaps more personal and more intuitive are centrally important too, and equally fit for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Heath (1998), [http://www.uic.edu/classes/mhpe/mhpe494dcme/Heath-reflection%20&amp;%20knowing%20in%20Nursing.pdf Reflection and patterns of knowing in nursing]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331092953/http://www.uic.edu/classes/mhpe/mhpe494dcme/Heath-reflection%20%26%20knowing%20in%20Nursing.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}, ''Journal of Advanced Nursing'', '''27''', 1054–1089. {{doi|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.00593.x}} {{PMID|9637334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenna H, Cutliffe J, McKenna P (1999), [http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/documents/v14w16p3942.pdf Evidence-based practice: demolishing some myths] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315174339/http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/documents/v14w16p3942.pdf |date=March 15, 2012 }}.

'''David Jackson''' (1747 – September 17, 1801) was an [[United States|American]] apothecary and physician from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He was a delegate for Pennsylvania to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1785.

Jackson was born in Newtown-[[Limavady]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]], the son of Samuel Jackson. He attended the Philadelphia City College (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and graduated in 1768 with a bachelor's degree in medicine. He settled in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and practiced there before opening a practice in Philadelphia.

In 1776, following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson worked on behalf of the Continental Congress as a manager of a lottery held to raise funds for the [[Continental Army]]. He also served as paymaster for the [[Pennsylvania militia]]. He was forced to leave Philadelphia when British forces [[Philadelphia campaign|occupied the city]] in 1777. In 1779 he briefly served in the field with the militia as a surgeon and quartermaster. Afterwards he returned to Philadelphia to resume his medical practice and also open an apothecary shop.

After the war, Jackson was named as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1785, and attended the session from April to November that year. Leaving public service, he also gave up his medical practice and concentrated on his pharmacy business. From 1789 to 1801 he served as a trustee of the University of the State of Pennsylvania, continuing through its merger into the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Jackson was married twice; first to Jane Mather Jackson, his brother Paul's widow. After her death he married Susan Kemper, the daughter of Jacob Kemper. David and Susan had nine children: David, Susan, Samuel, Mary, Jacob Morton, Sophia, William Brown, John, Martha. David Jr. would take over his father's apothecary while Samuel became a physician and for thirty years was a professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

Jackson died in 1801, at his home in [[Oxford, Pennsylvania]] and is buried in the Oxford Cemetery in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]]. He was survived by his wife Susan and all nine children. He was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and Philadelphia's Democratic Club.

'''Direct Visual Feedback''' is a method of training used in both practical and rehabilitative settings where the attention of the trainee is tied to an external visual cue in reference to the particular [[:wikt:movement|movement]], motor function or [[exercise]] that is being performed by the trainee. 

The principle to [[Biofeedback|Bio-Feedback]] is very similar to DVF.  Bio-Feedback, which is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance by receiving rapid feedback from precise instruments which are measuring physiological activity such as [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]]s, heart function, [[breathing]], muscle activity, and skin temperature. 

Direct Visual Feedback's method applies more directly to improving exterior [[physical health]] and performance. Instead of using technically advanced [[measuring instrument]]s for feedback, DVF relies on the human eye. One method that has been used to test DVF is by placing a [[laser beam]] on the hand and connecting it to a monitor, when the trainee raises his arm from waist height to shoulder height he is focused on the external reference showing exactly what path the arm took from point A(waist height) to point B(shoulder height). Studies have shown that not only is a higher level of performance often achieved faster with an external rather than an internal attention focus, but the skill is retained better.

{{Attributes of God}}
In [[theology]], the doctrine of '''divine simplicity''' says that [[God]] is without parts. The general idea can be stated in this way: the [[being]] of God is identical to the "attributes" of God. Characteristics such as [[omnipresence]], goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a [[Substance theory|substance]]; in other words we can say that in God both [[essence]] and [[existence]] are one and the same.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of [[scholasticism]], although the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding [[apotheosis]] in [[Plotinus#Major ideas|Plotinus']] ''[[Enneads]]'' as the Simplex.&lt;ref name=plotinus1&gt;Bussanich John, Plotinus's metaphysics of the One in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, ed. Lloyd P.Gerson, p.42, 1996, Cambridge University Press, UK. For instances, see [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn129.htm Plotinus, Second Ennead, Fourth Tractate, Section 8] ([[Stephen MacKenna]]'s translation, Sacred Texts)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn450.htm Plotinus, Fifth Ennead, Fourth Tractate, Section 1 (MacKenna's translation, Sacred Texts)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn156.htm Plotinus, Second Ennead, Ninth Tractate, Section 1 (MacKenna's translation, Sacred Texts).]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Tzimtzum|Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Jewish principles of faith|Free will in Theology#In Jewish thought|Kuzari#Question of attributes}}

In [[Jewish philosophy]] and in [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]] divine simplicity is addressed via discussion of the [[Abstraction|attributes]] ({{Hebrew|תארים}}) of God, particularly by [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] within the [[Islam|Muslim]] sphere of influence such as [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Yehuda Halevi]], and [[Maimonides]], as well by [[Abraham ben David|Raabad III]] in [[Provence]]. A classic expression of this position is found in [[Maimonides]]' Guide to the Perplexed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp060.htm#page_68 |title=Moses Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, Part 1, chapter 50 |publisher=Friedländer tr. [1904], at sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If, however, you have a desire to rise to a higher state, viz., that of reflection, and truly to hold the conviction that God is One and possesses true unity, without admitting plurality or divisibility in any sense whatever, you must understand that God has no essential attribute in any form or in any sense whatever, and that the rejection of corporeality implies the rejection of essential attributes. Those who believe that God is One, and that He has many attributes, declare the unity with their lips, and assume plurality in their thoughts.}}

According to Maimonides, then, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes. Maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that God's power is greater than ours, that God's life is more permanent than ours, or that God's knowledge is broader than ours. Maimonedes believed that statements such as "God lives" or "God is powerful" are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion, but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations. Still, Maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity: God is neither this nor that, and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us. Citing Psalm 65, Maimonides concludes that the highest form of praise we can give God is silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seeskin|first=Kenneth|title=Maimonedes|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/maimonides/|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=April 2014}} identify divine simplicity as a [[corollary]] of [[Creationism|Divine Creation]]: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1). God, as creator is by definition separate from the [[universe]] and thus free of any [[Property (philosophy)|property]] (and hence an absolute unity); see [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].

For others, conversely, the [[axiom]] of [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|Divine Unity]] (see ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'') informs the understanding of divine simplicity. [[Bahya ibn Paquda]] ([[Chovot ha-Levavot#Unity of God|''Duties of the Heart'']] [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hovot/1a-2.htm 1:8]) points out that God's Oneness is "true oneness" (האחד האמת) as opposed to merely "circumstantial oneness" (האחד המקרי). He develops this idea to show that an entity which is truly one must be free of properties and thus indescribable – and unlike anything else. (Additionally such an entity would be absolutely unsubject to change, as well as utterly independent and the root of everything.) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050318170731/http://www.torah.org/learning/spiritual-excellence/classes/doh-1-8.html]

The implication – of either approach – is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous: "God is not two or more entities, but a single entity of a oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation…  He cannot be sub-divided into different parts &amp;mdash; therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one. It is a [[Mitzvah|positive commandment]] to know this, for it is written ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4) '…the Lord is our God, the Lord is one'." ([[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', [http://www.panix.com/~jjbaker/MadaYHT.html ''Mada'' 1:7].)

Despite its apparent simplicity, this concept is recognised as raising many difficulties. In particular, insofar as God's simplicity does not allow for any structure &amp;mdash; even conceptually &amp;mdash; divine simplicity appears to [[entailment|entail]] the following [[dichotomy]].

* On the one hand, God is absolutely simple, containing no element of form or structure, as above.
* On the other hand, it is understood that God's essence contains every possible element of perfection: "The First Foundation is to believe in the existence of the Creator, blessed be He. This means that there exists a Being that is perfect (complete) in all ways and He is the cause of all else that exists." ([[Maimonides]] [[Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], [http://members.aol.com/LazerA/13yesodos.html First Principle]).

The resultant [[paradox]] is famously articulated by [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] (''[[Derekh Hashem]]'' [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/1a-2.htm I:1:5]), describing the dichotomy as arising out of our inability to comprehend the idea of absolute unity:
{{quote|God’s existence is absolutely simple, without combinations or additions of any kind. All perfections are found in Him in a perfectly simple manner. However, God does not entail separate domains &amp;mdash; even though in truth there exist in God qualities which, within us, are separate…  Indeed the true nature of His essence is that it is a single attribute, (yet) one that intrinsically encompasses everything that could be considered perfection. All perfection therefore exists in God, not as something added on to His existence, but as an integral part of His intrinsic identity…  This is a concept that is very far from our ability to grasp and imagine…}}

The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] address this paradox by explaining that “God created a spiritual dimension… [through which God] interacts with the Universe... It is this dimension which makes it possible for us to speak of God’s multifaceted relationship to the universe without violating the basic principle of His unity and simplicity” ([[Aryeh Kaplan]], ''Innerspace''). The Kabbalistic approach is explained in various [[Chassidic]] writings; see for example, ''Shaar Hayichud'', below, for a detailed discussion.

==In Christian thought==
{{Thomism}}
{{see also|Classical theism|Trinity|Nontrinitarianism}}
In [[Western Christianity| Western Christian]] [[classical theism]],  God is ''simple'', not ''composite'', not ''made up of thing upon thing''. [[Thomas V. Morris|Thomas Morris]] notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims:

#God has no spatial parts (spatial simplicity).
#God has no temporal parts (temporal simplicity).
#God is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where God would have different parts which are distinct from himself (property simplicity).

In other words, property simplicity (or metaphysical simplicity) states that the characteristics of God are not parts of God that together make up God. God is simple; God is those characteristics. For example, God does not ''have'' goodness but simply ''is'' goodness. 

''Spatial simplicity'' is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional Christian theists (who do not consider God to be a physical object). ''Temporal simplicity'' is endorsed by many theists but is highly controversial among Christian theologians. Morris describes ''Property simplicity'' as the property of having no properties, and this area is more controversial still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Thomas V.|title=Our idea of God : an introduction to philosophical theology|year=1997|publisher=Regent College Pub. |page=114|location=Vancouver, B.C.|isbn=978-1573831017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval era, theologians and philosophers held to a view called "constituent ontology" whereby natures were actual constituents of things. Following Aquinas, an individual nature was more like a [[concrete object]] than an [[abstract object]]. Thus, one person's humanity was not, in this sense, the same as another person's humanity; each had his own individual human nature which was individuated by the matter (''materia signata'') out of which each man was composed. For entities which are immaterial such as angels, there is no matter to individuate their natures, so each one just is its nature. Each angel is therefore literally one of a kind, although, this claim proved [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Divine Simplicity|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/divine-simplicity|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of God [[apophatic theology|by negating]] any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it.  Thus, in quantitative or spatial terms, God is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces, present in entirety everywhere, if in fact present anywhere.  In terms of essences, God is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter, or body and soul, or mind and act, and so on. If distinctions are made when speaking of God's attributes, they are distinctions of the "modes" of God's being, rather than ''real'' or ''essential'' divisions.  And so, in terms of subjects and accidents, as in the phrase "goodness of God", divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of God and the personal attribute of goodness, but the doctrine disallows that God's identity or "character" is dependent upon goodness, and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which God participates separately from the goodness which God is.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Furthermore, according to some {{who|date=April 2014}}, as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation (the assumption of [[empiricism]]); it follows from this and divine simplicity that God's attributes can only be spoken of by [[analogy]], since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being.  Consequently, when Christian Scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity, when it says that God is good for example, it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech. God's essence is [[ineffability|inexpressible]]; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to God who simply ''is'' goodness, because humanity is a complex being composed by God "in the image and likeness of God."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Criticism===
The doctrine has been criticized by many Christian theologians, including John S. Feinberg, Thomas Morris, [[William Lane Craig]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]], who in his essay ''Does God Have a Nature?'' calls it "a dark saying indeed."&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin. "Does God Have a Nature?" in Plantinga, Alvin, and James F. Sennett. 1998. ''The analytic theist: an Alvin Plantinga reader''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 228. {{ISBN|0-8028-4229-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-8028-4229-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plantinga gives three arguments against divine simplicity. First, he argues our concepts can apply univocally to God, even if our language to describe God is limited, fragmentary, halting, and inchoate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that when we have a concept of something like being a horse, we know what it is for something to be a horse. The concept applies to an object if that object is, in fact, a horse. If none of our concepts apply to God, then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as God, and yet God does not have properties such as wisdom, being the creator, and being almighty. In fact, God would not have any properties for which we have concepts. God would not even have properties such as existing, being self-identical, or even being the referent of the term 'God.' If God transcends human experience, then we cannot say something univocal about God, since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience, and that it applies to God.

The claim that God can only be described analogically is, as Plantinga describes, a double-edged sword. If we cannot use univocal language to describe God and argue against simplicity, we are equally handicapped when it comes to the arguments for divine simplicity. If we cannot rely on our usual modes of inference in reasoning about God, we cannot argue for the conclusion that God is not distinct from his properties. Plantinga concludes "This way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for God's greatness and majesty and augustness, but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga also gives three criticisms of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity directly, stating that it is exceedingly hard to grasp or construe the doctrine, and it is difficult to see why anyone would be inclined to accept it. First, the Thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with God's essence and hence God himself. Plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from God and his essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Plantinga argues, if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with God to only the properties that God exemplifies, the doctrine is still problematic. Metaphysical simplicity states that God has no accidental (i.e. contingent) properties. Yet, it clearly does seem that God has accidental properties such as having created Adam, and knowing that Adam sinned. Some of God's characteristics characterize him in every possible world and some do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also argues that the conflation of God's actuality with his potentiality inherits all the problems of the essence-accident complexity and is furthermore vexed in its own right. Just as it seems there are characteristics that God has but could have lacked, it also seems the case that there are characteristics that God lacks but could have had. No doubt God has not created all the persons he will create. If so, there is at least one individual essence such that God does not now have, but will have the characteristic of causing that essence to be instantiated. If so, God has potentiality with respect to that characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's third critique challenges the very heart of simplicity. Metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition, meaning that there is no complexity of properties in God and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties. There are two difficulties with this view. First, if God is identical with each of his properties, then each of his properties is identical with each of his other properties, so God has only one property. This flies in the face of the idea that God has both power and mercifulness, neither of which is identical with the other. Secondly, if God is identical with his properties, then, since each of God's properties is a property, it follows that God is a property as well. In this case, God has just one property: himself. The problem is that properties do not in and of themselves cause anything. No property could have created the world, and no property could know anything at all. If God is a property, then he isn't a person but a mere abstract object, having no power, life, love, or even awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Does God have a nature?|year=2000|publisher=Marquette Univ. Press|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0874621457|edition=Reprinted|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig calls property simplicity "philosophically and theologically unacceptable." He also states that divine simplicity is open to powerful objections. On the doctrine of divine simplicity, God is absolutely similar in all [[possible worlds]]. Since the statement "God knows x" is equivalent to "x is true," it becomes inexplicable why those worlds vary if in every one God knows, loves, and wills the same things.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; Morris states that it is an idea whose implications are difficult to defend and whose advantages can be had in other ways. It is also an idea whose motivation, under close scrutiny, is not so convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Thomas V.|title=Our idea of God : an introduction to philosophical theology|year=1997|publisher=Regent College Pub. |page=115|location=Vancouver, B.C.|isbn=978-1573831017}}&lt;/ref&gt; John S. Feinberg concludes: "These philosophical problems plus the biblical considerations raised earlier lead me to conclude that simplicity is not one of the divine attributes. This doesn't mean that God has physical parts, but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=John S. Feinberg ; John S. Feinberg, general|title=No one like Him : the doctrine of God|year=2006|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton. Ill.|isbn=978-1581348118|page=335|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islamic thought==

Rigorous views of divine simplicity were championed by the [[Mu'tazili]], which resulted in a radically [[apophatic theology]]. By postulating a distinction between Existence and Essence for all created beings, which was perceived to be uniquely absent in God, [[Al-Farabi]] established another model of divine simplicity. [[Avicenna|Ibn Sinā]] supported and elaborated this position, [[Al-Ghazali]] contested this identification of Divine essence and existence, but still saw all Divine attributes and acts as enveloped in and indistinct from the Divine Essence, this latter view of divine simplicity was shared with some of the most trenchant critics of the Muslim philosophical writers, like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref name="arberry"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arberry | first = A.J. | title = Revelation and Reason in Islam | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | pages = 104–8 | date = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf09FbPPt2YC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=neo-platonic+influence+tauhid#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-platonic%20influence%20tauhid&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780415438872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19136">'''Exclusivism''' is the practice of being [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusive]]; [[mentality]] characterized by the disregard for opinions and ideas other than one's own, or the practice of organizing entities into groups by excluding those entities which possess certain traits. (for an opposite example, see [[essentialism]]).

==Religious exclusivism==
{{Main|Chosen people|One true faith}}
Religious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by [[Alan Race]] in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation. [[Diana L. Eck|Diana Eck]] states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 296.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories [[inclusivism]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]. In his 1982 ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christians-Religious-Pluralism-Christian-Religions/dp/0334019389/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521581557&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=alan+Race+religious+pluralism Christians and Religious Pluralism],'' Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale. "Religious Diversity, Theories Of." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 223-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Three-point typology ==

=== Pluralism ===
Pluralism was borne out of a criticism of exclusivism, saying that no single tradition has a monopoly on revelation or salvation, and that we have no way to judge between the salvific claims by adherents of any faith tradition.  [https://www.rsis.edu.sg/profile/paul-hedges/#.WrF9WMPFLDc Paul Hedges] suggests that each religion knows ‘transcendent reality (“God”) yet in partial perspective,’ much like the oft-quoted parable of the seven blind men and the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Paul. “A Reflection on Typologies: Negotiating a Fast-Moving Discussion.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gavin D'Costa|Gavin D’costa]]  says pluralists have two main critiques of exclusivists: people of other religions are god and loving and that they do not know their own Scriptures well enough.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]] says that pluralist’s problem with exclusivism stems from its immorality and arrogance. He quotes William Cantwell Smith: ‘Except at the cost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings: “…we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong.”’&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alan. “Pluralism: A Defense of Religious Exclusivism.” ''The Rationality of Belief and the Plurality of Faith'', Thomas D. Senor (ed). (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995): 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Smith, the leading proponent of pluralism is John Hick, who writes:

[Exclusivism], with its baleful historical influence, in validating centuries of anti-semitism, the colonial exploitation by Christian Europe of what today we call the third world, and the subordination of women within a strongly patriarchal religious system, not only causes misgivings among many Christians but also alarms many of our non-Christian neighbors, creating invisible but powerful barriers within the human community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pluralism and Particularity in Religious Belief|last=Stetson|first=Brad|publisher=Praeger|year=1994|isbn=|location=Westport CT and London|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that D’costa argued persuasively that logically, pluralism can no longer be considered a category; when it makes a declarative truth claim, it becomes another form of exclusivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Costa|first=Gavin|date=1996|title=The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions 32.2 (1996): 223-32|url=|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32:2|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivism ===
Inclusivists state that while one religion or revelation is true (Christianity), other truths can be found in fragments within other religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states it succinctly: ‘Insofar as they in good conscience practice what is good in their religion, people in other religions receive God’s grace and are “anonymous Christians,” people who are being saved through Christ, though they do not realize it.’ &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuggy|first=Dale|date=2015|title=Religious Diversity, Theories Of|url=|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusivists point to the biblical parable of the sheep and the goats in which the saved sheep show surprise at being rewarded for their service to [[Jesus]] (Matthew 25: 31-40)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2010|title=Religious Exclusivism|url=|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|volume=|pages=86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism in Christianity and other religions ===
According to Race, the history of the Abrahamic faiths’ exclusivism – as well as inclusivism – goes back to the words of the Bible and the Qur’an.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Race, Alan. “Theologies of Religions in Change: Factors in the Shape of a Debate.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian exclusivists point to John’s gospel (14: 6), which quotes Jesus as saying, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ After Jesus’ death, his disciple Peter said publicly, ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved’ (Acts 4:12). Likewise, the Qur’an (3:85) states, ‘If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).’ While Judaism does not stress salvation, the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3) is ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ Race says, ‘The tension between Christian experience and the recognition of potential authentic practice outside of the Christian revelation, in fact has always existed in Christian history from the beginning, from the words of Jesus himself in the gospel of Luke: in 9:50 he says, “He who is ''not against'' us is for us”’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daniel Strange points out what Race neglects to mention: that in the same gospel (11:23), Jesus says, ‘He who is ''not with me'' is against me.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Daniel. “Exclusivisms: ‘Indeed Their Rock is Not like Our Rock.’ ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008) 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== No salvation outside the Church ==
The exclusivist idea of ‘no salvation outside of the Christian church’ (''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'') has roots as early as [[Origen]] in the third century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And while the Bible speaks about many topics of inclusion, diversity and tolerance in both the Old and New Testament – attitudes toward the alien and stranger; the hope of Christians being drawn from all nations and languages; God’s universal care and sustaining of creation; the universal scope of the gospel and the universal mandate to take the gospel to the nations&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – the overwhelming feeling in the Church throughout most of its history mimics that of the [[Council of Florence]] in 1422: ‘The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his [sic] angels.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] continued the exclusivist theological bent: ‘For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit to create, call and gather the Christian Church, and outside it no one can come to the Lord Christ’.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the exclusivist castle opened a crack during the 20th century missionary movement, when Dutch missiologist [[Hendrik Kraemer]] wrote that Jesus is the one who has the complete authority to judge other religions’ efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting a unique contemporary take on the salvation problem, Strange introduces [[George Lindbeck]]’s contention that those who do not know the Bible cannot be condemned for their lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New wave of exclusivism ==
Mara Brecht states that the problem with classic exclusivism is that it deals mainly with Christianity and salvation (or ‘top down’). She highlights the work of the ‘New Wave of exclusivism,’ led by Griffiths, D’costa and Netland, who employ a ‘bottom up’ approach to religious diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Mara. "What's the use of Exclusivism?" ''Theological Studies'' 73.1 (2012): 34.&lt;/ref&gt; New Wave Exclusivists focus more on the religious believers’ ‘ways of knowing and understanding of religious beliefs as expressive truth,’ resulting in a broader possibility for interfaith engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Netland sets aside comparing religions’ salvation when he says dialogue should focus on the most important question all religions deal with – the question of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht reaches the conclusion that exclusivism is tenable for Christians – and by extension other religious believers – if believers come into contact with believers of other religions who can possibly ‘defeat’ their own, so they can have something to base their truth claims on. Brecht says, ‘Practically, this means that, for example, reflective Christians will consider their beliefs to be as ''probable'' as alternatives from within their own tradition, ''somewhat more probable than'' the relevant alternatives from within Judaism and ''considerably more probable than'' Buddhist alternatives. In other words, believers will weigh their beliefs against other beliefs.’&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of exclusivism ==
Douglas Pratt further defines exclusivism, dividing it into three subdivisions – open, closed and extreme. Citing t’Hooft and Kraemer, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, ‘may at least be amenably disposed toward the other,’ if only in order to know Them well enough for possible conversion. The relationship is not entered into on equal ground, therefore, nor with the openness to a significant reciprocal change of self-identity. If dialogue is entered into, it is only for mutual edification and an increase in good will.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed exclusivism offers no chance for a relationship, other than acknowledging the other’s right to exist.  An extreme, hard-line exclusivism often leads to a fundamentalist perspective. Pratt writes, ‘Fundamentalism, as a mindset, is a mentality that expresses the modern quest for universality and coherence writ large: only one truth; one authority; one authentic narrative that accounts for all; one right way to be.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The logical conclusion for this fundamentalist mindset is taking steps to eliminate the other, as one would a business competitor. Pratt writes, ‘The negation of otherness is perhaps critical, for it involves a devaluing and dismissal of the "other," whether in terms of rival community or competing alterities, ideological or otherwise. In the process of negating the other, the self is asserted as inherently superior. My God is greater than your god.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Moser]] posits two forms of exclusivism: logical religious exclusivism, which asserts that since the contradictory, foundational truth claims for each religion excludes some or many of them from being true;&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Paul K. "Religious Exclusivism." ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'' (2010): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the doxastic redemptive exclusivism based on the Athanasian Creed, which states if a person does not believe the Christian concept of the Trinity, that person is condemned. Moser further believes that a God who would exclude people from salvation for neither hearing nor understanding the concept of the Trinity does not have a moral character, and is therefore undeserving of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusivism in other religions ==
While most attention of exclusivism points toward Christianity, each religion has a branch that falls into the exclusivist category. D’costa&lt;ref&gt;D'cost, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; points out whether one considers oneself Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim – or indeed a pluralist – each version states that ‘only one single revelation or one single religion is true and all other “revelations” or religions are false.’ While acknowledging that historically, Christianity showed the most extreme forms of exclusivism, Pratt contends that many fundamentalist religions compete for that title, with Islam leading other worthy contenders&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that are not always obvious. With the purging of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] in [[Myanmar]], the Buddhist Rakhine have joined the ranks of fundamentalists willing to resort to killing to achieve dominance over competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Morgan. “Love Thy Neighbor: South Asia Christians Advocate for Rohingya Muslims.” ''Christianity Today'', Oct. 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ancient Greece==
The Decree of Diopithes (430 BCE) forbade the worship of and belief in gods other than those of the Olympian pantheon recognised by the Athenian polis. The introduction of other gods was treated as ''asebeia'', or [[impiety]], and was punishable by death. The philosophers [[Anaxagoras]], [[Protagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Stilpo]], [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Theophrastus]] were accused of impiety under this decree. Socrates was found guilty of the charge of introducing new gods and condemned to death by drinking [[conium|hemlock]].

[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], [[Selucid]] ruler of Israel, decided to Hellenize the Jews by ordering the worship of Zeus; when they refused, Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree.

According to [[Herodotus]] the Caunians, a Greek people who claimed to have originated in Crete and settled in Asia Minor, worshiped the Olympian Gods exclusively. "They determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign temples which had been established among them, but would worship their own old ancestral Gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the foreign Gods."

[[Plato]], in his Laws, advocates that the state should punish those who deny the existence of the Olympian Gods or believe that the gods exist but think they are indifferent to mankind or can be easily bought by bribes.

''[[Interpretatio graeca]]'', the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to identify foreign divinities with members of their own pantheon, can be seen as a kind of exclusivism. The [[syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic]] period whereby aspects of the cults of foreign Gods such as iconography and epithets, can also be seen as a kind of exclusivism.

=== Exclusivism and religious diversity in America ===
In a sociological survey of Americans and their relationship with religions other than Christianity, nearly 90 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed that “religious diversity has been good for America,” which reinforces the idea that Americans value diversity and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, Stephen. "Religious Diversity in a "Christian Nation": The Effects of Theological Exclusivity and Interreligious Contact on the Acceptance of Religious Diversity." ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 49.2 (2010): 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, respondents who identified in the exclusivist category or believed that the United States was a Christian nation displayed much more negative views and a decreased willingness to include other religious people in the lives of their community.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merino concludes, ‘It may be that when many Americans think of “religious diversity,” they have only Christian diversity in mind.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they also provided research to back up their statement, ''‘''Prior contact with non-Christians will be associated with more positive views of religious diversity and increased willingness to include non-Christians into social life.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism and truth ===
In answering the pluralist charge, and hearkening back to Netland, Brad Stetson baldly states, ‘It is possible exclusivism is true.’ &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this statement, he says, that upsets pluralists who charge exclusivists with arrogance and bad form. ‘It is simply not true, as pluralists imply, that disagreeing with someone […] about religious truth is tantamount to treating them badly.[…] [a]n exclusivist claim about religious truth is not defeated strictly because such claims are believed to militate against human harmony and peace.' &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hick, Smith and other pluralists balk at the idea that an all-loving God would condemn some people to hell,&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; nor that anyone actually deserves to be damned;&lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"&gt;Stetson, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; he then quotes CS Lewis: ‘The doors of hell are locked on the ''inside.’'' &lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"/&gt;

In ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|Women, Fire and Dangerous Things]]'', Lakoff has expanded on the foundation of experientialism by his research into the nature of categories.

==Basic realism==
This philosophy is especially a response to the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] tradition of transcendental truth most prominently formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Although experientialism states that there is no "purely rational" detached God's-eye view of the world which is external to human thought, it still admits that there exists what Lakoff and Johnson call "basic realism". Most importantly this involves a commitment to the existence of a real world external to human beings and the possibility of stable knowledge of the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women, Fire and Dangerous Things|last = Lakoff|first = George|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0-226-46804-6|location = Chicago and London|pages = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41783">The [[Catholic Church]] historically observes the disciplines of [[fasting]] and [[abstinence]] at various times each year. For Catholics, fasting is the reduction of one's intake of food, while abstinence refers to refraining from meat (or another type of food). The Catholic Church teaches that all people are obliged by God to perform some penance for their sins, and that these acts of penance are both personal and corporeal. The purpose of fasting is spiritual focus, self-discipline, imitation of Christ, and performing penance.{{citation needed|date = September 2017}}

==Regulations==
Contemporary Vatican legislation, which is followed by Catholics of the [[Latin Rite]] (who comprise most Catholics) is rooted in the 1966 [[Apostolic Constitution]] of Pope Paul VI, ''[[Paenitemini]]'', and codified in the 1983 ''[[Code of Canon Law]]'' (in Canons 1249–1253). According to ''Paenitemini'' and the 1983 Code of Canon Law, on [[Ash Wednesday]] and [[Good Friday]], both abstinence and fasting are required of Catholics who are not [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|exempted]] for various reasons. All Fridays of the year are days are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays that are not [[Solemnities]], while the law of fasting binds all Catholics who are aged between eighteen and sixty on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.&lt;ref name=Canon1253/&gt; Nevertheless, both ''Paenitemini'' and the 1983 Code of Canon Law permitted the Episcopal Conferences to propose adjustments of the laws on fasting and abstinence for their home territories, and most have done so. For example, in some countries, the [[Episcopal Conference|Bishops' Conferences]] have obtained from Rome the substitution of pious or charitable acts for abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year (including Fridays of [[Lent]]) except Good Friday. Others continue to abstain from eating meat on Lenten Fridays, but not on Fridays outside of Lent. Still others voluntarily abstain from meat on however, fasting may be less stringent on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html| title=Sacrosanctum Concilium| publisher=[[Vatican Secret Archive]]| date=December 4, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] are obliged to follow the discipline of their own [[particular church]]. While some Eastern Catholics try to follow the stricter rules of their Orthodox counterparts, the actual canonical obligations of Eastern Catholics to fast and abstain are usually much more lenient than those of the Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinton &amp; Ciccazo |title=Ecology of Food and Nutrition |date=20 Sep 2007 |issue=46 |pages=469-491 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03670240701486768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Personal Ordinariate]]s for former [[Anglicans]] reconciled to the [[Catholic Church]] follow the discipline of the [[Latin Rite]] (of which they are a part) including the norms established by the Council of Catholic Bishops in whose territories they are erected and of which their Ordinaries are members.  Thus in England the norm is abstinence on all Fridays of the year.&lt;ref name="Oddie"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/05/16/the-restoration-of-the-friday-fast-is-a-historic-day-for-english-and-welsh-catholics/| title=The restoration of the Friday fast is a historic day for English and Welsh Catholics| last=Oddie| first=William| newspaper=[[The Catholic Herald]]| location=London| date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop in the United States has emphasized the statements in the USCCB norms "Friday itself remains a special day of penitential observance throughout the year," and "we give first place to abstinence from flesh meat."&lt;ref name="US Conference of Catholic Bishops"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=US Conference of Catholic Bishops| date=November 18, 1966| url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/us-bishops-pastoral-statement-on-penance-and-abstinence.cfm| title=Pastoral Statement on Penance and Abstinence| accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rogation Days]] have been re-establised in the Calendar of the Ordinariates, and as long as a Solemnity does not take precedence, the Fridays in September and Advent are days of obligatory abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=2018 ORDO for the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter: Advent 2017 to Christmastide 2018| publisher=[[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]]| ISBN=9781982037147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligatory abstinence on Ember Friday in Lent is included in the universal Lenten discipline, and abstinence on Ember Friday on Whitsuntide is not required, as all days of the Octave of Pentecost are Solemnities.

==Western practice==

===History===
Rules relating to fasting pertain to the quantity of food allowed on days of fasting, while those regulating abstinence refer to the quality or type of food. The Christian tradition of fasts and abstinence developed from Old Testament practices, and were an integral part of the early church community. [[Louis Duchesne]] observed that Monday and Thursday were days of fasting among pious Jews.&lt;ref name=Oneill&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01067a.htm| title=Abstinence| work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]| last=O'Neill| first=James D.| year=1907| publisher=Robert Appleton Co.| location=New York City| accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christians practiced regular weekly fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays.&lt;ref name=stu&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stthomas.edu/mcdc/topics/fasting/| last1=Feldmeier| first1=Dr. Peter| last2=Ozdemir| first2=Dr. Adil| title=Fasting| publisher=[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102050156/https://www.stthomas.edu/mcdc/topics/fasting/| archive-date=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has always been a close connection between fasting and almsgiving; the money saved on food should be given to the poor.&lt;ref name=stu/&gt;

===Lent===
The habit of fasting before Easter developed gradually, and with considerable diversity of practice regarding duration. As late as the latter part of the second century there were differing opinions not only regarding the manner of the paschal fast, but also the proper time for keeping Easter. In 331 St. [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] enjoined upon his flock a period of forty days of fasting preliminary to, but not inclusive of, the stricter fast of Holy Week, and in 339, after having traveled to Rome and over the greater part of Europe, wrote in the strongest terms to urge this observance upon the people of Alexandria as one that was universally practiced, "to the end that while all the world is fasting, we who are in Egypt should not become a laughing-stock as the only people who do not fast but take our pleasure in those days".&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09152a.htm| title=Lent| last=Thurston| first=Herbert| work=Catholic Encyclopedia| year=1907| publisher=Robert Appleton Co.| location=New York City| accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time of Gregory the Great (590–604) there were apparently at Rome six weeks of six days each, making thirty-six fast days in all, which St. Gregory, who is followed therein by many medieval writers, describes as the spiritual tithing of the year, thirty-six days being approximately the tenth part of three hundred and sixty-five. At a later date the wish to realize the exact number of forty days led to the practice of beginning Lent on Ash Wednesday.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

The ordinary rule on fasting days was to take but one meal a day and that only in the evening, white meat and, in the early centuries, wine were entirely forbidden.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

These days were at one time observed with a [[Black Fast]] of strictly no more than one meal, without meat, dairy, oil, or wine. This Lenten fast was traditionally broken at sunset.&lt;ref name="Cléir2017"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cléir| first=Síle de| title=Popular Catholicism in 20th-Century Ireland: Locality, Identity and Culture| accessdate=21 February 2018| date=5 October 2017| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJowDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Popular+Catholicism+in+20th-Century+Ireland:+Locality,+Identity+and+Culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja1v2btoPaAhWBzIMKHSTmBwwQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=catherine%20bell&amp;f=false| publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing| language=English| isbn=978-1350020603| page=101| quote=Catherine Bell outlines the details of fasting and abstinence in a historical context, stating that the Advent fast was usually less severe than that carried out in Lent, which originally involved just one meal a day, not to be eaten until after sunset.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuérangerFromage1912"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Guéranger| first1=Prosper| last2=Fromage| first2=Lucien| title=The Liturgical Year: Lent| accessdate=21 February 2018| year=1912| publisher=Benziger Brothers| location=New York| language=English| pages=7–8| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RJDAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+liturgical+year:+lent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuw5T6tIPaAhXp34MKHdBvDDQQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=benedict&amp;f=false| quote=St. Benedict's rule prescribed a great many fasts, over and above the ecclesiastical fast of Lent; but it made this great distinction between the two: that whilst Lent obliged the monks, as well as the rest of the faithful, to abstain from food till sunset, these monastic fasts allowed the repast to be taken at the hour of None.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century the custom of taking the only meal of the day at three o'clock was introduced. In the 14th century the meal was allowed at mid-day, and soon the practice of an evening [[collation (meal)|collation]] (snack) became common. A morning collation was introduced in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02590c.htm|title=The Black Fast| work=Catholic Encyclopedia| last=O'Neill| first=James D.| volume=2| year=1907| publisher=Robert Appleton Co.| location=New York City| accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Church law prescribed fasting throughout Lent, with abstinence only on Friday and Saturday. Some countries received dispensations: Rome in 1918 allowed the bishops of [[Ireland]] to transfer the Saturday obligation to Wednesday{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}; in the United States, abstinence was not required on Saturday.  The other weekdays were simply days of "fasting without abstinence."  A similar practice (common in the United States{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}) was called "partial abstinence", which allowed meat only once during the day at the main meal. (There is nothing in current Catholic Canon Law which corresponds to "partial abstinence".) The countries of the former Spanish empire also had their own extensive dispensations from the Roman rules of fasting and abstinence, based on the "Crusader privileges" of the Spanish dominions as codified in the [[Bull of the Crusade]]. In some [[History of colonialism|European colonies]], the obligation to fast and abstain differed by race, with natives often having more lenient rules than Europeans or [[mestizos]].

While the rules of abstinence generally only allow seafood, there are a few exceptions. In parts of South America, especially in [[Venezuela]], [[capybara]] meat is popular during [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]]; in response to a question posed by French settlers in [[Quebec]] in the 17th century, [[beaver]] was classified as an exception;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chowdc.org/Papers/Saunders%202001.html| title="Oh Unnatural Murderer!": Vegetarian Trends in 18th-Century Europe and America| last=Saunders| first=Angela| date=October 14, 2001| journal=[[Nation's Restaurant News]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930112945/http://www.chowdc.org/Papers/Saunders%202001.html| archive-date=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmyakin.org/2005/02/lent_roundup.html |title=Lenten Reader Roundup |publisher=Jimmy Akin.Org |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Lacoursière| first=Jacques| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4hBdiDOv_AC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=2-89448-050-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkxoyRuYPaAhXIxYMKHT1SBNMQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=boucher%20laval&amp;f=false| title=Histoire populaire du Québec: Des origines à 1791| trans-title=People's History of Quebec From the beginning to 1791| page=122| publisher=Diffusion Dimedia| language=French| year=1995| isbn=978-2894480502}} Explains that Bishop François de Laval in the 17th century posed the question to the theologians of the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]], who ruled in favour of this decision.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Archbishop of New Orleans said that "alligator is considered in the fish family" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Ellsworth| first1=Brian| title=In Days Before Easter, Venezuelans Tuck Into Rodent-Related Delicacy| url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/in-days-before-easter-venezuelans-tuck-into/11063/| accessdate=3 December 2014| work=[[The New York Sun]]| date=March 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/56205/why-isnt-fish-considered-meat-during-lent| title=Why Isn’t Fish Considered Meat During Lent?| work=[[Mental Floss]]| date=18 April 2014| accessdate=18 February 2015| last=Reilley| first=Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal basis for the classification of beaver as fish probably rests with the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]], which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3147.htm ''The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas''] II. 147:8 provides legal foundation on which theologians argued in favour of beaver being like fish.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Lent, there were other penitential times customarily accompanied by fasting or abstinence. These included [[Advent]], the [[Ember Days]], the [[Rogation Days]], Fridays throughout the year, and [[vigil]]s of important feast days.&lt;ref name=stu/&gt;

Advent is considered a time of special self-examination, humility, and spiritual preparation in anticipation of the birth of Christ.  Fridays and Saturdays in Advent were days of abstinence, and until early in the 20th century, the Fridays of Advent were also days of fasting.

The vigils observed included the Saturday before [[Pentecost]], October 31 (the vigil of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]), December 24 ([[Christmas]] Eve), December 7 (the vigil of the [[Immaculate Conception]]) and August 14 (the vigil of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]). These vigils all required fasting; some also required abstinence. If any of these fell on a Sunday, the vigil, but not the obligation of fasting, was moved to the Saturday before. (Some other liturgical days were also known as vigils but neither fasting nor abstinence was required, particularly the vigils of feasts of the Apostles and the Vigil of the Epiphany.) By 1959 in the United States, the fast for the vigil of Christmas was moved to December 23.

[[Ember days]] occurred four times a year. The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of the ember week were days of fast and abstinence, though the Wednesday and Saturday were often only days of partial abstinence.  In addition, Roman Catholics were required to abstain from meat (but not fast) on all other Fridays, unless the Friday coincided with a [[holy day of obligation]].

The former regulations on abstinence obliged Roman Catholics starting as young as age seven, but there were many exceptions.  Large classes of people were considered exempt from fasting and abstinence, not only the sick and those with physically demanding jobs, but also people traveling and students.  The regulations were adapted to each nation, and so in most [[diocese]]s in America abstinence from meat was not required on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving]], to accommodate any meat left over from that US national holiday.

On the eve of Vatican II, fasting and abstinence requirements in numerous Catholic countries were already greatly relaxed compared to the beginning of the 20th century, with fasting often reduced to just 4 days of the year (Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, the vigil of Christmas or the day before, and the vigil either of the Immaculate Conception or of the Assumption).

===Sundays of Lent===
{{essay|date=July 2018}}
Some controversy has arisen over whether Catholics should continue to fast and abstain from the things they voluntarily gave up for Lent on the Sundays of Lent. Questions include whether the “forty days” of Lent are limited to weekdays or whether they include Sundays, and if every Sunday is like Easter.

The Latin word for ''Lent'' is ''Quadragesima'' which literally means "forty". The term imitates many biblical images of fasting for forty days (e.g. Exodus 24:18; Matthew 4:2; Luke 4:2). While all of this is true, Lenten and Easter practices varied in the East and the West as both traditions developed over time. The various Lenten fasts which developed did not always last forty days.

In the fourth century, the council of Nicaea referred to Lent as “the forty” before the Paschal feast. Although it is not entirely clear, the grammar of this phrase could be read to imply that one should prepare for forty days for the coming of Easter. One thing that is clear from the council of Nicaea is the fact that whatever the length of this penance, it did not include Sundays, since this council forbade even kneeling on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Canon V, Greek text: τῆς τεσσεράκοντῆς, ἵνα πάσῆς, Latin: quadragesimam paschae. In the Greek the word “day’ is likely implied. The construction of ἵνα with a designation of time see Arndt, W., Danker, F. W., &amp; Bauer, W. (2000). A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature (3rd ed., p. 476). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. S. B-D-F §382, 1; 393. cf. Pl. Ti. 38c: ἐξ οὖν λόγου καὶ διανοίας θεοῦ τοιαύτης πρὸς χρόνου γένεσιν, ἵνα γεννηθῇ χρόνος, ἥλιος καὶ σελήνη καὶ πέντε ἄλλα ἄστρα, ἐπίκλην ἔχοντα πλανητά, εἰς διορισμὸν καὶ φυλακὴν ἀριθμῶν χρόνου γέγονεν .&lt;/ref&gt; Sundays were treated differently by the early Christians and penitential kneeling on Sundays was strictly forbidden. This early discipline later evolved in the Western Church as our understanding of various gestures in worship shifted. Eventually in the Western tradition kneeling became a sign of reverence not of penance.

In the history of the development of Lenten traditions in the western Church there were actually two different focuses. One was on the Baptismal liturgy of catechumens who were journeying towards the Easter Vigil to be baptized and received in to the Church. The second tradition involved a rite for reconciling adult penitents. Initially these penitents were those who were excommunicated and were in the process of being reconciled to the Church. In 1091 AD, Pope Urban II changed this and required all the faithful to receive ashes in what became Ash Wednesday. Over time the penitential aspect alone became the focus of Lent.

The Second Vatican council wished to restore the original double focus on baptism and penance. The fathers note, “The season of Lent has a twofold character: primarily by recalling or preparing for baptism and by penance, it disposes the faithful, who more diligently hear the word of God and devote themselves to prayer, to celebrate the paschal mystery. This twofold character is to be brought into greater prominence both in the liturgy and by liturgical catechesis.” (''[[Sacrosanctum concilium]]'' 109).

What are the implications for the Sundays in Lent? Can we solve this with Math? According to the modern ''General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar'' (2011), “The forty days of Lent run from Ash Wednesday up to but excluding the Mass of the Lord's Supper exclusive.” If you get a calendar out you would see that this year there are 20 days of Lent in February but only 24 days (23.5?) of Lent in March for a total of 44 days. There are 6 Sundays in Lent. Using these numbers you would not achieve the ‘biblical number’ forty by subtracting the six Sundays that occur within Lenten session. Does this prove that we should fast and abstain on Sunday’s? Or perhaps two of the Sundays?

Several points need to be noted. First the definition of Lent as excluding half of Holy Thursday, the whole of Good Friday and Holy Saturday only came about in 1969. These three days are now called the Triduum and are no longer considered part of the session of Lent. In other words, the numbers did actually work until this recent change. But now is the number ‘forty,’ merely figurative?

Notice that even in the current definition of Lent, Easter waits for us to complete the Triduum, and there are two more days of serious penance in the Triduum which still brings the total to forty days of penance excluding Sundays. The penitential disciple of Lent is still forty days even if the season of Lent is now shorten by the Triduum.

We must not confuse the season on Lent with the penitential disciple of Lent. The tradition of the Church did not require equal penances on each day of Lent, and no penance was required on Sunday.

Someone might say that the Sundays of Lent are part of the season of Lent and, therefore, must continue to have a penitential meaning. This is certainly partly true. We do worship in a more reserved and sober manner on the Sundays of Lent. But the fact remains that the penitential discipline of Lent always excluded these Sundays. We might also point out that the lectionary readings of the Sundays of Lent all focus on the catechumenal journey towards the Easter Vigil and not exclusively on penance.

As was pointed out above, Lenten traditions have developed over time. One consistent feature has been that the penitential discipline of Lent excluded Sundays. This point is especially evident in the writings of St. Augustine.

In St. Augustine’s ''Letter 36'', he refutes a rigorist who insists that Christians should fast on the Sabbath (Saturday). This might initially sound tangential but it leads Augustine to our question. Augustine, by the way, argues that we are free to fast or not fast on the Sabbath, and as Christians we are not bound by the Jewish Sabbath keeping regulations.

Augustine also tells us that in his time Christians regularly fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year and not just in Lent (36.30) and that some Churches fasted as well on the Sabbath. By comparison, fasting on the Lord’s Day (Sunday) “would be a cause of no small scandal to the Church” (36.2, cf. 36.10, 29). He notes, “For in these questions on which the divine scripture has determined nothing certain, the custom of the people of God or the practices of our ancestors are to be taken as law” (36.2). He makes it clear that not fasting on the Lord’s Day was the standard practice for the Church in Rome, in Africa and in Millan. He also points out that fasting or abstaining on the Lord’s Day was a practice of the followers of the heresy of the Manichees (36.27) and Priscillianist (36.28) which the Church universally rejected.

Fasting on the Lord’s Day is a ‘scandal’ and ‘abominable’ (36.27) though Augustine allows one exception, “unless perhaps someone might be able to extend a fast beyond a week without taking any meal in order to approximate a fast of forty days” (36.27). He does not seem to have in mind someone who is merely, for example, not eating meat for forty days, but an epic fast of biblical proportions. (e.g. “without taking any meal”).

Again the point is that the penitential discipline of Lent always excluded Sundays and further St. Augustine says that fasting on Sundays is a scandal and abominable.

Finally someone might add one more layer to this discussion. The person who is asking about drinking their latte on Sundays in Lent, is really taking about their own self-imposed private devotion. It is interesting to learn about the history of this practice of private devotion.

Prior to Second Vatican Council the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the Roman Pontifical and the approved regulations for the United States (''Uniform Norms'' 1951, ''Modification'' 1956) required a rigorous scheme of fasting by all the faithful 21- 59-years-old. Abstinence could be complete or partial, and fasting allowed one full meal plus partial meals. All week days of Lent had either a fast or a fast and abstinence attached to them. It is very clear in these documents that we were discussing the weekdays of Lent, excluding Sundays.

During World War II special permission was given to local ordinaries to dispense the faithful from these rigorous daily requirements and this permission was extended again in 1949. In light of these dispensations the ''Uniform Norms'' 1951, and ''Modification'' 1956 for the US included a paragraph which exhorted the faithful to be generous in performing additional voluntary works of Christian perfection.

It seems the wide spread custom of taking on voluntary penance began in the 1950s. Prior to this people were satisfied fulfilling the demanding norms of Lent. Since these new ''voluntary acts'' are not required, it would seem the faithful can do whatever they want, but choosing to do penance on a Sunday is clearly not in the spirit of Catholic Tradition.{{tone inline|date=March 2018}}

===Contemporary application===
Contemporary legislation is rooted in the 1966 Apostolic Constitution of [[Pope Paul VI]], ''[[Paenitemini]]''.  He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. He also allowed that fasting and abstinence might be substituted with prayer and works of charity, although the norms for doing so were to be set down by the Episcopal Conferences.

Current practice of fast and abstinence is regulated by Canons 1250–1253 of the 1983 code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM |title=1983 Code of Canon Law |publisher=[[The Holy See]] |accessdate=2011-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115004422/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM |archivedate=2011-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They specify that all Fridays throughout the year, and the time of Lent are penitential times throughout the entire Church. All adults (those who have attained the 'age of majority', which is 18 years in canon law) are bound by law to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday until the beginning of their sixtieth year. All persons who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays unless they are solemnities, and again on Ash Wednesday; but in practice this requirement has been greatly reduced by the Episcopal Conferences because under Canon 1253, it is these Conferences that have the authority to set down the local norms for fasting and abstinence in their territories. (However, the precept to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday is usually not dispensed from.)

Absent any specification of the nature of "fasting" in the current [[Canon Law]], the traditional definition is obviously applicable here which is that on the days of mandatory fasting, Catholics may eat only one full meal during the day. Additionally, they may eat up to two small meals or snacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/lent/fast.htm | title=The Holy Season of Lent | first=Colin B.| last=Donovan, [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|STL]] | publisher=EWTN | accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "[[collation (meal)|collation]]s". Church requirements on fasting only relate to solid food, not to drink, so Church law does not restrict the amount of water or other beverages – even alcoholic drinks – which may be consumed.

In some Western countries, Catholics have been encouraged to adopt non-dietary forms of abstinence during Lent. For example, in 2009 Monsignor Benito Cocchi, [[Archbishop of Modena]], urged young Catholics to give up [[text messaging]] for Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10560485 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=8 March 2009 |title=To text is to sin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eucharistic Fast===
In addition to the fasts mentioned above, Roman Catholics must also observe the Eucharistic Fast, which involves taking nothing but water and medicines into the body for some time before receiving the [[Eucharist]]. The earliest recorded regular practice was to eat at home before the Lord's Supper if one was hungry ([[I Corinthians|I Corinthians 11:34]]).  The next known ancient practice was to fast from midnight until Mass that day.  As Masses after noon and in the evening became common in the West, this was soon modified to fasting for three hours. The latest Code of Canon Law reduced the Eucharistic Fast to the current one-hour requirement for the Roman Rite. Particular law in some Eastern Catholic Churches also requires a one-hour Eucharistic fast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===By country===
====Australia====
The [[Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference]] decreed on Friday 4 October 1985 that Fridays throughout the year, including in Lent (other than Good Friday) are not obligatory days of abstinence from meat, provided an alternative form of penance is practised.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.catholic.org.au/acbc-media/downloads/all-downloads/bishops-1/handbook-1/1401-complementary-legislation-for-australia-1/file| title=Complementary Legislation for Australia| publisher=Australian Catholic Bishops Conference| date=4 October 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this remains the case to this day, support for the return of obligatory Friday abstinence has been gradually increasing since England and Wales returned to Friday abstinence in 2011, with some Australian bishops expressing interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/some-australian-bishops-suggest-restoring-year-round-friday-abstinence| last=Biddle| first=Matthew| title=Some Australian bishops suggest restoring year-round Friday abstinence| agency=[[Catholic News Service]]| date=March 17, 2014| newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]]| location=Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://catholicleader.com.au/analysis/appetite-for-friday-abstinence-returns| title=Appetite for Friday abstinence returns| newspaper=[[The Catholic Leader (Brisbane)|The Catholic Leader]]| location=Brisbane| date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
The [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]] decrees that the days of fast and abstinence in Canada are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, and specifies that Fridays are days of abstinence. This includes all Fridays year round, not just Fridays of Lent.  Catholics, however, can substitute special acts of charity or piety on these days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cccb.ca/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2319&amp;Itemid=1226| publisher=Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops| title=Keeping Friday| date=September 28, 2006| accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
Current norms for England and Wales, issued by the Bishops' Conference in May 2011, re-introduced the expectation that all Catholics able to do so should abstain from meat on all Fridays of the year, effective Friday, September 16, 2011.&lt;ref name="Oddie"/&gt;

==== Ireland ====
On 25 November 2010 the Irish Bishops’ Conference published the resource leaflet  ''Friday Penance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicbishops.ie/wp-content/uploads/images/stories/features/Friday_penance/penace_friday_for%20web.pdf |date=23 November 2010 |title=Friday Penance |publisher=Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It followed from the March 2010 [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland#Pastoral letter from Pope Benedict XVI|Pastoral Letter to the Catholics of Ireland]] from Pope Benedict XVI suggesting initiatives to support renewal in the Church in Ireland. He asked that Irish Catholics offer their Friday Penances “for an outpouring of God’s mercy and the Holy Spirit’s gifts of holiness and strength,” and that fasting, prayer, reading of Scripture and works of mercy be offered in order to obtain healing and renewal for the Church in Ireland.

The leaflet states that Penance "arises from the Lord’s call to conversion and repentance" and describes that it is an "essential part of all genuine Christian living":
* in memory of the passion and death of the Lord
* as a sharing in Christ’s suffering
* as an expression of inner conversion
* as a form of reparation for sin

''Friday Penance'' also explains why penance is important: “Declaring some days throughout the year as days of fast and abstinence (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday) is meant to intensify penances of the Christian. Lent is the traditional season for renewal and penance but Catholics also observe each Friday of the year as days of penance. The link between Friday and penance is extremely ancient and is even reflected in the [[Irish language]] word for Friday: ''An Aoine'' (''The Fast'').”{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The leaflet suggests ways of fulfilling Friday penance such as abstaining from meat or alcohol, visiting the Blessed Sacrament or helping the poor, sick and lonely as well as other suggestions.

====United States====

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) produced a statement in 1966 called ''Pastoral Statement on Penance and Abstinence'',&lt;ref name="US Conference of Catholic Bishops"/&gt; which was modified slightly in 1983.&lt;ref name=Canon1253&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2018-03-23| title=Canon 1253 – Observance of Fast and Abstinence| url=http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/canon-law/complementary-norms/canons-1252-and-1253-observance-of-fast-and-abstinence.cfm| date=October 21, 1983| publisher=USCCB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer has summarized the U.S. rules as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| accessdate=2018-03-23| title=The Connection Between Lent and Fasting| url=https://www.thoughtco.com/rules-for-fasting-and-abstinence-542167| last=Richert| first=Scott P.| date=September 17, 2017| newspaper=[[Dotdash#2017–present: closure and rebranding|ThoughtCo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United States, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has declared that "the age of fasting is from the completion of the eighteenth year to the beginning of the sixtieth." The USCCB also allows the substitution of some other form of penance for abstinence on all of the Fridays of the year, except for those Fridays in Lent. Thus, the rules for fasting and abstinence in the United States are:
*Every person 18 years or older must abstain from meat (and items made with meat) on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and all the Fridays of Lent.
*Every person between the age of 18 and 59 (beginning of 60th year) must fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
*Every person 18 years of age or older must abstain from meat (and items made with meat) on all other Fridays of the year, unless he or she substitutes some other form of penance for abstinence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the USCCB:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Abstinence laws consider that meat comes only from animals such as chickens, cows, sheep or pigs --- all of which live on land. Birds are also considered meat. Abstinence does not include meat juices and liquid foods made from meat.  Thus, such foods as chicken broth, consomme, soups cooked or flavored with meat, meat gravies or sauces, as well as seasonings or condiments made from animal fat are technically not forbidden.  However, moral theologians have traditionally taught that we should abstain from all animal-derived products (except foods such as gelatin, butter, cheese and eggs, which do not have any meat taste).  Fish are a different category of animal.  Salt and freshwater species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, (cold-blooded animals) and shellfish are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Questions and Answers about Lent and Lenten Practices| url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/questions-and-answers-about-lent.cfm| publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops| accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of this, some Catholic parishes in the United States sponsor a [[fish fry]] during Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Connie| last=Mabin| date=March 2, 2007| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201304.html| title=For Lent, Parishes Lighten Up Fish Fry| work=[[The Washington Post]]| accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In predominantly Roman Catholic areas, restaurants may adjust their menus during Lent by adding seafood items to the menu in an attempt to appeal to Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Bill| last=Carlino| date=February 19, 1990| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n8_v24/ai_8552611| title=Seafood promos aimed to 'lure' Lenten observers| work=Nation's Restaurant News| accessdate=2009-02-25}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same USCCB website says that:&lt;blockquote&gt;While fish, lobster and other shellfish are not considered meat and can be consumed on days of abstinence, indulging in the lavish buffet at your favorite seafood place sort of misses the point.  Abstaining from meat and other indulgences during Lent is a penitential practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The USCCB also states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Those that are excused from fast and abstinence outside the age limits include the physically or mentally ill including individuals suffering from chronic illnesses such as diabetes.  Also excluded are pregnant or nursing women.  In all cases, common sense should prevail, and ill persons should not further jeopardize their health by fasting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Archbishop of New Orleans]] [[Gregory Michael Aymond]] clarified that [[alligator]] is also considered seafood, saying "Yes, the alligator's considered in the fish family, and I agree with you — God has created a magnificent creature that is important to the state of Louisiana, and it is considered seafood."  This was in response to a letter from a local alligator wrangler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| first=Tina| last=Antolini| date=March 25, 2013| url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/03/27/175058833/forget-fish-fridays-in-louisiana-gator-is-on-the-lenten-menu| title=Forget Fish Fridays: In Louisiana, Gator Is On The Lenten Menu| network=[[NPR]]| accessdate=2014-03-31| series=[[All Things Considered]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern practice==
To fast customarily means to only eat one meal during the day, and to avoid animal products.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Eastern Christians view fasting as one part of repentance and supporting a spiritual change of heart. Eastern Christians observe two major times of fasting, the "Great Fast" before Easter, and "Phillip's Fast" before the Nativity.

During the Great Fast, meat, eggs, dairy products, fish and oil are avoided.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The fast period before Christmas is called "Philip's Fast" because it begins after the feast day of St. Philip. Specific practices vary, but on some days during the week meat, dairy products and (in some countries) oil are avoided, while on other days there is no restriction. During approximately the last week before the Nativity, typically meat, dairy, eggs and oil are avoided on all days, meals are moderate in quantity, and no food is taken between meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Our Lady of Fatima Byzantine Catholic Church |url=http://www.byzantinecatholic.org/Feasts/FastNativity1.html |title=Phillip's Fast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208234402/http://www.byzantinecatholic.org/Feasts/FastNativity1.html |archivedate=2010-12-08 |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolutionary biology]], '''genetic anthropomorphism''' refers to "thinking like a [[gene]]". The central question is "if I were a gene, what would I do in order to reproduce myself". The question is an obvious [[fallacy]] since genes are incapable of [[thought]]. However, [[natural selection]] does act in such a way that those that are most successful at reproducing themselves (by following the optimum [[strategy]]) prosper. Thinking like a gene enables the results to be visualised. This is related to a philosophical tool known as the [[intentional stance]].

The most notable genetic anthropomorphist was the British biologist, [[W. D. Hamilton]]. Hamilton's friend, [[Richard Dawkins]], popularised the idea.

Anthropomorphism has been criticised on a number of grounds, including that it is [[reductionist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9814">'''Gustav Naan''' ({{lang-ru|Густав Иоганнович Наан}}, ''Gustav Iogannovich Naan''; 17 May 1919 near [[Vladivostok]] – 12 January 1994 in [[Tallinn]]) was an [[Estonia]]n [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]]. According to the Estonian Encyclopedia's definition, he "wrote plenty of [[irritation|irritating]] publicist articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://entsyklopeedia.ee/artikkel/naan_gustav&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Naan was born in [[RSFSR|Russian SFSR]] in a village near [[Vladivostok]] to a family of Estonian settlers. He graduated from the [[Leningrad]] State University in 1941. He took part in [[World War II]] and joined the [[CPSU]] in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the [[Occupation of Baltic states|USSR annexed Estonia]], Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946) published a number of [[Stalinist]]-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. "Eesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus″ ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947). In 1948, Naan published an article in ''Voprosy filosofii''&lt;ref&gt;G. I. Naan, "Sovremennyi 'fizicheskii' idealizm v SShA i Anglii na sluzhbe popovshchiny i reaktsii," Voprosy filosofii, No. 2 ( 1948), pp. 290 ff&lt;/ref&gt; on the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, criticizing 'physical idealists' of the US and Britain;&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Graham, Science and Philosophy in the Soviet Union (New York: Knopf, 1972), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1951, however, he published an article that decried vulgar materialist critics of the relativity theory whilst being ″tolerant on philosophic questions to a striking degree in Stalinist Russia, considering its place and time of publication″.&lt;ref&gt;Graham 1972:118.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors who followed Naan's article into discussion were almost universally critical of Naan's position. In 1952, which was the most intense year of the debate, three different authors&lt;ref&gt;V. Shtern, K voprosu o filosofskoi storone teorii otnositel'nosti; D. I. Blokhintsev , Za leninskoe uchenie o dvizhenii; G. A. Kursanov, "K kriticheskoi otsenke teorii otnositel'nosti"; Voprosy filosofii, No. 1 ( 1952), pp. 175-81, 181-3, 169-74.&lt;/ref&gt; published against Naan in the 1952 first issue of ''Voprosy filosofii'' alone.&lt;ref&gt;Graham 1972:119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naan was the director of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1950–1951), Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1951–1964). From 1964, Naan worked at the [[Tartu_Observatory|Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics]] of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on [[cosmology]], [[cybernetics]] and [[demography]], he often rejected [[taboo]]s of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He often juxtaposed what he saw as a science-based world-view with a trivial thinking (Estonian: "argimõtlemine"), which he saw both among common people, the intelligentsia as well as the ruling classes. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the [[theory of relativity]] at the time this was still considered [[pseudoscience]] by the Soviet authorities. The influential 1968 article "Võim ja vaim" (roughly "The Power and the Mind") was widely read among the liberal intelligentsia, who interpreted it as a critique of the administrative/bureaucratic socialism and [[command economy]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://7eedb014-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/balticahps/ETBL-IIIosa.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crQCnb-7xCAsKo51ZkTBR5BqDarOi1HdFBwnKaSMz5uvyxN8LnhDKwW5VWAZBBMEGBimsgo70To2_hp-UxxmhIG92KMguWctQmGOGZ-4_9rsS9rEwsaYsa0eroAd5yUZ5pTBuyrzg3MdwGNLJgMLXa-zVt6DYJ4td08Bnt6sJCBZwldr2jfFnbVEGDEgYP08L5psE98wERN_L7uEeY2T0d8v-viJw%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0 Article on Naan in the Estonian Biographical Lexicon of Science] (p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt;. His articles such as this enjoyed popularity in Russia, too. In 1960s and 1970s he often held lectures either in the assembly hall of the [[Tallinn University of Technology|Tallinn Polytechnical Institute]] or (as initiated on his own initiative) in [[Tõravere]] as seminars of philosophy, often balancing between the permissible by the authorities and impermissible.

He also proposed the [[Multiverse|Symmetric Universe]] hypothesis, according to which, side by side with the ordinary world, there is an [[Antimatter|anti-world]].&lt;ref&gt;'Any quantity of energy can be trapped from vacuum if the corresponding mechanism provides a simultaneous trapping of the same quantity of energy in the anti-world. The total sum energy is equal to zero.' Gustav Naan, 'Symmetrical universe', 1964, Tartu, Estonia.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas have been characterized as "viewpoints that have been recognized as valuable from the scientific point of view"&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [https://books.google.ee/books?id=aerFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=gustav+naan+estonians+nation&amp;hl=et&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDtKOpioXbAhWLKFAKHX9cDAg4ChDoAQhBMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20naan%20estonians%20nation&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Naan was editor-in-chief of ''Eesti nõukogude entsüklopeedia'' (literally: ''Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia''), the first edition of which started in the late 1960s. The encyclopedia was highly successful in Estonia.

In terms of political affiliations, Naan remained a staunch supporter of the Soviet system (initially an enthusiastic supporter of [[Perestroika]] though) and was a devote opponent of Estonia's pro-independence movement&lt;ref&gt;In an ironic piece of warning written after the Estonian youth rebellion of 1980, he put it thus: Estonia as nation developed only one hundred years ago and will disappear "in the coming centuries" - Г. Наан "Многообразие единого" - "Коммунист Эстонии", 1983, номер 1, с. 228. Cited in [https://books.google.ee/books?id=EHf-TI84_I8C&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=gustav+naan+estonian+nation+disappear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix9YOgh4bbAhXOZlAKHfB2BgQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20naan%20estonian%20nation%20disappear&amp;f=false Sowjetsystem und Ostrecht By Georg Brunner, p. 274]&lt;/ref&gt;; Naan supported the (pro-Moscow) [[Intermovement|Internationalist Movement]]. Having gained much public support in the 1970s for his relatively bold opinion pieces on topics like family, the rising divorce rate (that he argued was more or less a normal development), morals and sex (the importance of which, he argued, was being downplayed out of pseudomoralistic argumentation), he soon became a despised figure for his anti-independence stance, which was reflected in his newspaper articles of the time (e.g. his article «С ног на голову» ('From (standing on) Feet to (standing on) Head', Estonian title "Kõik pea peale″), condemning the [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration]] passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, was published in ''[[Pravda]]'', 23. November 1988.). He also published a number of articles where he either tried to downplay or rationalize Stalinist repressions. His stance almost led to his expulsion from the Academy of Sciences.

*Academician [[Hans Trass]]: "How terrible, that a man, who could inspiringly write about the predominance of the mind over the power developed into a justificator of the reign of terror. Such a person is an example of a broken, deformed mentality, that was shaped by the Stalinist antihumanism and obedience to fear."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
*Literary criticist [[Vaapo Vaher]]: "Naan could be treated as a Soviet dandy, a Soviet [[Dorian Gray]]. ... During his days of glory the academician had on the local intellectual society an impression of some exotic creature ... Dorian Gray and his creator [[Oscar Wilde]] can be treated as marthyrs of esthetism, Naan was destroyed by the evil of [[dogmaticism]]. Add to this [his] personal vanity.

Similar to the [[Cadet Honor Code]]s of the [[United States Military Academy]] and [[United States Air Force Academy]], the Concept formalizes the requirement for midshipmen to demonstrate integrity while refusing to lie, cheat or steal.&lt;ref name=USNAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treatise adopts the use of first-person point of view, becoming a personal call to obey the letter and spirit of the Concept amongst midshipmen of the brigade.&lt;ref name=USNATreatise&gt;''Honor Treatise'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] utilizes a similar Honor Concept to impart the same call to integrity for its corps of cadets.&lt;ref name=USCGAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USCGA website, Cadet Life section&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other service academies' honor codes, the Honor Concept allows a midshipman to confront someone committing an honor violation without formally reporting it.  At the other academies, failure to formally report an honor violation is construed as tolerating it, which is itself a violation of the code.

Penalties for violating the Honor Concept can be severe, up to and including expulsion from the Academy.

{{quote|Midshipmen are persons of integrity: We stand for that which is right.

We tell the truth and ensure that the full truth is known. We do not lie.

We embrace fairness in all actions. We ensure that work submitted as our own is our own, and that assistance received from any source is authorized and properly documented. We do not cheat.

We respect the property of others and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their own property. We do not steal.|Honor Concept|USNA Brigade Honor Program&lt;ref name=USNAConcept/&gt;}}

==History==
The principles of the Honor Concept are as old as the Academy itself, revolving around the principle that an officer's word is his bond.  However, examination of the past academy honor practices by 1953 USNA class president [[Ross Perot]] discovered "no uniform policy for dealing with midshipmen who had violated their class's conception of honor."&lt;ref name=Gelfand191&gt;Gelfand, ''Sea change at Annapolis'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting to ''irreverence'' as an "inescapable trait of midshipmen," brigade leaders like Perot, [[William P. Lawrence]] and [[James Sagerholm]] worked with Brigade Captain [[Charles Dobony]] and academy superintendent [[Harry W. Hill]] to create the Honor Concept.&lt;ref name=Gelfand192&gt;Gelfand, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''identi.ca''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] [[social networking]] and [[micro-blogging]] service based on the [[pump.io]] software, using the [[Activity Streams]] protocol. Identi.ca stopped accepting new registrations in 2013, but continues to operate alongside several other pump.io-based hosts provided by E14N which continue to accept new registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://status.net/2013/03/26/no-more-new-registrations-on-identi-ca |title=No more new registrations on identi.ca |author=Evan Prodromou |date=26 Mar 2013 |accessdate=2 Jan 2015 |publisher=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229192010/http://status.net/2013/03/26/no-more-new-registrations-on-identi-ca |archivedate=December 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Identi.ca running on pump.io is similar to social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Google+]], allowing unlimited length status updates, rich text and images.  The Activity Streams protocol supports many kinds of activities such as games. OpenFarmGame is a prototype application for an Activity Streams-based game. [[Hashtag]]s, groups and global search are not supported

== History ==

=== StatusNet ===

The service received more than 8,000 registrations and 19,000 updates within the first 24 hours of publicly launching on July 2, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://identi.ca/notice/19345 |publisher=identi.ca |accessdate=2008-07-03 |title=identi.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708073815/http://identi.ca/notice/19345 |archivedate=July 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its 1,000,000th notice on November 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://identi.ca/notice/1000000 identi.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106143933/http://identi.ca/notice/1000000 |date=2008-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://status.net/2012/07/03/four-more-years|title=FOUR MORE YEARS|author=Evan Prodromou|date=3 Jul 2012|accessdate=8 Aug 2013|publisher=status.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JFHikezH?url=http://status.net/2012/07/03/four-more-years|archivedate=2013-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, identi.ca received investment funds from [[venture capital]] group Montreal Start Up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croll|first=Alastair|title=Identi.ca Gets Funding to Make Open-source Twitter Variant|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/01/14/identica-gets-funding-to-make-open-source-twitter-variant/|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2009, Control Yourself (since renamed StatusNet Inc) announced that Identi.ca was to become part of a hosted microblogging service called status.net to be launched in May 2009. Status.net offers individual microblogs under a subdomain to be chosen by the customer. Identi.ca will remain a free service. All notices will be published under the [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution]] 3.0 license by default, but paying customers will be free to choose a different license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://controlyourself.ca/2009/03/30/statusnet-coming-soon/ |title=status.net coming soon |publisher=controlyourself.ca |date=March 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401164906/http://controlyourself.ca/2009/03/30/statusnet-coming-soon/ |archivedate=April 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly based on [[StatusNet]], a micro-blogging software package built on the [[OStatus]] specification (and earlier based on the [[OpenMicroBlogging]] specification), Identi.ca allowed users to send text updates (known as "notices") up to 140 characters long. While similar to [[Twitter]] in both concept and operation, Identi.ca/StatusNet provided many features not currently implemented by Twitter, including [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] support and personal [[tag clouds]]. In addition, Identi.ca/StatusNet allowed free export and exchange of personal and "friend" data based on the [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] standard; therefore, notices could be fed into a Twitter account or other service, and also ported in to a private system similar to [[Yammer]].

=== pump.io ===

Developer [[Evan Prodromou]] chose to change the site to the [[pump.io]] software platform in development, because pump.io offers more features and is technically more advanced.&lt;ref name="lwn-transitioning"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/544347/ | title=StatusNet, Identi.ca, and transitioning to pump.io | publisher=LWN.net | date=March 27, 2013 | accessdate=2013-05-07 | author=Nathan Willis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://opensource.com/life/13/7/pump-io | title=pump.io: the decentralized social network that's really fun | publisher=opensource.com | date=July 15, 2013 | accessdate=2013-07-15 | author=Bryan Behrenshausen}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Registration on Identi.ca was closed in December 2012 in preparation for the switch to pump.io software (the popularity of Identi.ca and "official" Status.net hosting were considered a hindrance to the creation of a [[federated social network]]).&lt;ref name="lwn-transitioning"/&gt; The conversion was completed on 12 July 2013.

The 140 character per post limit was removed (in StatusNet, it was a setting, not an inherent limitation); now the blog posts can contain formatting and images. Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/299|title=Groups|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hashtag]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/245|title=Automatically link hash tags|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and page listing popular posts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/655|title=Popular|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not yet implemented in pump.io. &lt;!-- Identi.ca's web pages are a client for identi.ca the pump.io server. --&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}
The doctrine or theory of '''immanence''' holds that the [[divine]] encompasses or is manifested in the material world. It is held by some [[philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] theories of [[divine presence]]. Immanence is usually applied in [[monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[Pandeism|pandeistic]], or [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the [[Wikt:mundane|mundane]]. It is often contrasted with theories of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.

Major faiths commonly devote significant philosophical efforts to explaining the relationship between immanence and transcendence but do so in different ways, such as:
* casting immanence as a characteristic of a transcendent God (common in [[Abrahamic religion]]s), 
* subsuming immanent [[personal god]]s in a greater transcendent being (such as with [[Brahman]] in [[Hinduism]]), or
* approaching the question of transcendence as something which can only be answered through an appraisal of immanence.

== Ancient Greek philosophy ==
Another meaning of immanence is the quality of being contained within, or remaining within the boundaries of a person, of the world, or of the mind. This meaning is more common within Christian and other monotheist theology, in which the one God is considered to transcend his creation.

[[Pythagoreanism]] says that the ''[[nous]]'' is an intelligent principle of the world acting with a specific [[intention]]. This is the divine reason regarded in [[Neoplatonism]] as the first [[Emanationism|emanation]] of the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofiatopia.org/equiaeon/divine.htm Sofiatopia.org], Divine Reason. Noetic (from Greek ''nous'') is usually translated as "mind", "understanding", "intellect", or "reason".&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''nous'' emerges the [[Anima mundi|world soul]], which gives rise to the manifest realm. Pythagoreanism goes on to say the [[Deity|Godhead]] is the Father, Mother, and Son (Zeus). In the mind of Zeus, the ''ideas'' are distinctly articulated and become the [[Logos]] by which he creates the world. These ideas become active in the Mind (''nous'') of Zeus. With him is the Power and from him is the ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#creationdemiurge Utk.edu], Demiurge Creation&lt;/ref&gt; This theology further explains that Zeus is called [[Demiurge]] (''Dêmiourgos'', Creator), Maker (''Poiêtês''), and Craftsman (''Technitês'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#craftsman Utk.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The nous of the demiurge proceeds outward into manifestation becoming living ideas. They give rise to a lineage of mortal human souls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020817035344/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/V.html#basicprinciples Utk.edu], Basic Principles&lt;/ref&gt; The components of the soul are&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#creationothers Utk.edu], Components of the Soul&lt;/ref&gt; 1) the higher soul, seat of the intuitive mind (''divine nous''); 2) the rational soul (''logistiko''n) (seat of discursive reason / ''dianoia''); 3) the nonrational soul (''alogia''), responsible for the senses, appetites, and motion. Zeus thinks the articulated ideas (Logos). The ''idea of ideas'' (''Eidos - Eidôn''), provides a model of the Paradigm of the Universe, which the Demiurge contemplates in his articulation of the ''ideas'' and his creation of the world according to the Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#selfcontemplating Utk.edu], Self Contemplating Nous&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Buddhism]] and [[Dzogchen]] posit a non-dual basis for both experience and reality that could be considered an exposition of a philosophy of immanence that has a history on the subcontinent of India from early CE to the present. A paradoxical  [[nondualism|non-dual]] awareness or ''[[rigpa]]'' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] — ''vidya'' in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]) — is said to be the 'self perfected state' of all beings. Scholarly works differentiate these traditions from [[monism]]. The non-dual is said to be not immanent and not transcendent, not neither, nor both. One classical exposition is the [[Madhyamaka]] refutation of extremes that the philosopher-adept [[Nagarjuna]] propounded.

Exponents of this non-dual tradition emphasize the importance of a direct experience of non-duality through both meditative practice and philosophical investigation. In one version, one maintains awareness as thoughts arise and dissolve within the 'field' of [[mind]], one does not accept or reject them, rather one lets the mind wander as it will until a subtle sense of immanence dawns. Vipassana or insight is the integration of one's 'presence of awareness' with that which arises in mind. Non-duality or rigpa is said to be the recognition that both the quiet, calm abiding state as found in samatha and the movement or arising of phenomena as found in vipassana are not separate. In this way it could be stated that Dzogchen is a method for the recognition of a 'pure immanence' analogous to what [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] theorized about.

==Christianity==

=== Catholicism and Eastern Christianity ===
{{Attributes of God}}
According to Christian theology, the transcendent [[God]], who cannot be approached or seen in essence or being, becomes immanent primarily in the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] [[Jesus]] the [[Christ]], who is the [[incarnate]] Second Person of the [[Trinity]]. In [[Byzantine Rite]] theology the immanence of God is expressed as the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]] or energies of God, who in his essence is incomprehensible and transcendent. In Catholic theology, Christ and the Holy Spirit immanently reveal themselves; God the Father only reveals himself immanently vicariously through the Son and Spirit, and the Divine Nature, the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] is wholly transcendent and unable to be comprehended.

This is expressed in [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]'s letter to the Philippians, where he writes:

:who, although He  existed in the  form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
:but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and  being made in the likeness of men.
: Being found in appearance as a man,  He humbled Himself by becoming  obedient to the point of death, even  death on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;Philippians 2:6–8, (NASB)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holy Spirit is also expressed as an immanence of God.
:and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=3&amp;verse=22&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse Luke 3:22], [[BibleGateway.com]], ([[New International Version]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The immanence of the triune God is celebrated in the Catholic Church and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]] during the liturgical calendar feast as the [[Theophany]] of God (see [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Theophany]]).

[[Pope Pius X]] wrote at length about philosophical-theological controversies over immanence in his encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]''.

In the theology of [[Karl Rahner]], it is said that "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." That is to say, God communicates Himself to humanity ("economic" Trinity) as He really is in the divine Life ("immanent" Trinity).

== Mormonism ==
According to [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] theology, all of material creation is filled with immanence, known as the [[Light of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|light of Christ]]. It is also responsible for the intuitive conscience born into man. The Light of Christ is the source of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, and is the means by which God is in and through all things.&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants Section 88:6-13. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716025030/http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/88 Lds.org]&lt;/ref&gt; LDS scriptures identify the divine Light with the mind of God, the source of all truth and conveyor of the characteristics of the divine nature through God’s goodness.

== Continental philosophy ==
[[Giordano Bruno]]'s, [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s and, it may be argued, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophies were philosophies of immanence versus philosophies of transcendence such as [[Thomism]] or [[Aristotle|Aristotelian tradition]].  Kant's "transcendental" critique can be contrasted to Hegel's "immanent dialectics."&lt;ref&gt;For further information on Hegel's immanent dialectics, see J. T. Fraser, F. C. Haber, G. H. Müller (eds.), ''The Study of Time: Proceedings of the First Conference of the International Society for the Study of Time Oberwolfach (Black Forest) — West Germany, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] qualified [[Spinoza]] as the "prince of philosophers" for his theory of immanence, which Spinoza resumed by "''[[Deus sive Natura]]''" ("God or Nature"). Such a theory considers that there is no [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] principle or external cause to the world, and that the process of life production is contained in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Negri]], ''The Savage Anomaly: The Power of Spinoza's Metaphysics and Politics'' (transl. 1991, Minnesota University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; When compounded with [[Idealism]], the immanence theory qualifies itself away from "the world" to there being no external cause to one's mind.

[[Giovanni Gentile]]'s [[actual idealism]], sometimes called "philosophy of immanence" and the metaphysics of the "I", "affirms the organic synthesis of dialectical opposites that are immanent within actual or present awareness".&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;M. E. Moss, ''Mussolini's Fascist Philosopher: Giovanni Gentile Reconsidered'', Peter Lang, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His so-called method of immanence "attempted to avoid: (1) the postulate of an independently existing world or a Kantian ''Ding-an-sich'' ([[thing-in-itself]]), and (2) the tendency of neo-Hegelian philosophy to lose the particular self in an Absolute that amounts to a kind of mystical reality without distinctions."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] used the term in his book ''[[Politische Theologie]]'' (1922), meaning a power within some thought, which makes it obvious for the people to accept it, without needing to claim being justified.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schmitt: ''Political Theology'', 1922, found in: ''Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The immanence of some political system or a part of it comes from the reigning contemporary definer of ''Weltanschauung'', namely religion (or any similar system of beliefs, such as rationalistic or relativistic world-view). The [[Nazi]]s took advantage of this theory creating, or resurrecting, basically religious [[mythology]] of race, its heroes, and its destiny to motivate people and to make their reign unquestionable, which it became.&lt;ref&gt;Lacoue-Labarthe, Philippe &amp; Nancy, Jean-Luc: ''The Nazi Myth'' (1990), ''Critical Inquiry'' 16:2 (winter), 291-312: the University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The French 20th-century philosopher Gilles Deleuze used the term immanence to refer to his "[[empiricist]] philosophy", which was obliged to create action and results rather than establish transcendents. His final text was titled ''Immanence: a life...'' and spoke of a [[plane of immanence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/library/gilles-deleuze/biography/ Gilles Deleuze.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611135900/http://www.egs.edu/library/gilles-deleuze/biography |date=2010-06-11 }} Profile in Philosophical Library. [[European Graduate School]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Russian Formalist film theorists perceived immanence as a specific method of discussing the limits of ability for a technological object. Specifically, this is the scope of potential uses of an object outside of the limits prescribed by culture or convention, and is instead simply the empirical spectrum of function for a technological artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stam, ''Film Theory'', 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{Main|Tzimtzum}}
Traditional Jewish religious thought can be divided into ''[[Nigleh]]'' ("Revealed") and ''[[Nistar]]'' ("Hidden") dimensions. Hebrew [[Scripture]] is, in the [[Kabbalistic]] tradition, explained using the four level [[exegesis]] method of ''[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]]''. In this system, the first three approaches, Simple, Hinted and Homiletical interpretations, characterise the revealed aspects. The fourth approach, the Secret meaning, characterises a hidden aspect. Among the classic texts of Jewish tradition, some Jewish Bible commentators, the ''[[Midrash]]'', the ''[[Talmud]]'', and mainstream [[Jewish philosophy]] use revealed approaches. Other Bible commentators, the [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidic philosophy]], use hidden approaches. Both dimensions are seen by adherents as united and complementary. In this way, ideas in Jewish thought are given a variety of ascending meanings. Explanations of a concept in ''Nigleh'', are given inherent, inner, mystical contexts from ''Nistar''.

Descriptions of Divine immanence can be seen in ''Nigleh'', from the Bible to Rabbinic Judaism. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], God makes a personal covenant with the forefathers [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. Daily Jewish prayers refer to this inherited closeness and personal relationship with the Divine, for their descendants, as "the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob". To [[Moses]], God reveals his [[Tetragrammaton]] name, that more fully captures Divine descriptions of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. Each of the Biblical names for God, describe different Divine manifestations. The most important prayer in Judaism, that forms part of the Scriptural narrative to Moses, says "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." This declaration combines different Divine names, and themes of immanence{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and transcendence. Perhaps the most personal example of a Jewish prayer that combines both themes is the invocation repeatedly voiced during the time in the Jewish calendar devoted to ''[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]]'' (Return, often inaccurately translated as Repentance), ''Avinu Malkeinu'' ("Our Father, Our King"). Much of the later Hebrew Biblical narrative recounts the reciprocal relationship and national drama of the unfolding of themes of immanence and transcendence. Kabbalistic, or Hasidic Jewish thought and philosophy describe and articulate these interconnected aspects of the Divine-human relationship.

Jewish Mysticism gives explanations of greater depth and spirituality, to the interconnected aspects of God's immanence and transcendence. The main expression of mysticism, the Kabbalah, began to be taught in 12th Century Europe, and reached a new systemisation in 16th Century Israel. The Kabbalah gives the full, subtle, traditional system of Jewish [[metaphysics]]. In the Medieval Kabbalah, new doctrines described the 10 ''[[Sephirot]]'' (Divine emanations) through which the Infinite, unknowable Divine essence reveals, emanates, and continuously creates existence. The Kabbalists identified the final, feminine ''Sefirah'' with the earlier, traditional Jewish concept of the ''[[Shekhinah]]'' (immanent Divine Presence). This gave great spirituality to earlier ideas in Jewish thought, such as the theological explanations of suffering ([[theodicy]]). In this example, the Kabbalists described the ''Shekhinah'' accompanying the children of Israel in their exile, being exiled alongside them, and yearning for Her redemption. Such a concept derives from the Kabbalistic theology that the physical World, and also the Upper spiritual Worlds, are continuously recreated from nothing by the ''Shefa'' (flow) of Divine will, which emanates through the ''Sefirot''. As a result, within all creations are Divine sparks of vitality that sustain them. Medieval ''Kabbalah'' describes two forms of Divine emanation, a "light that fills all worlds", representing this immanent Divine creative power, and a "light that surrounds all worlds", representing transcendent expressions of Divinity.

The new doctrines of [[Isaac Luria]] in the 16th Century completed the Kabbalistic system of explanation. Lurianic Kabbalah describes the process of ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' (צמצום meaning "Contraction" or "Constriction") in the Kabbalistic theory of creation, where God "contracted" his infinite essence in order to allow for a "conceptual space" in which a finite, independent world could exist. This has received different later interpretations in Jewish mysticism, from the literal to the metaphorical. In this process, creation unfolds within the Divine reality. Luria offered a daring cosmic theology that explained the reasons for the ''Tzimtzum'', the primordial catastrophe of ''[[Shevirat Hakelim]]'' (the "Breaking of the Vessels" of the ''Sefirot'' in the first existence), and the messianic ''[[Tikkun olam|Tikkun]]'' ("Fixing") of this by every individual through their sanctification of physicality. The concept of ''Tzimtzum'' contains a built-in [[paradox]], as it requires that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent:

* On the one hand, if the Infinite did not "restrict itself", then nothing could exist. There would be no limits, as the infinite essence of God, and also His primordial infinite light (Kabbalistic sources discuss God being able to reign alone, a revealed "light" of the ''Sefirah'' of Kingship, "before" creation) would comprise all reality. Any existence would be nullified into the Divine Infinity. Therefore, we could not have the variety of limited, finite things that comprise the creations in the Universe that we inhabit. (The number of such creations could still be potentially limitless, if the physical [[Universe]], or [[Multiverse]] had no end). Because each limited thing results from a restriction of God's completeness, God Himself must transcend (exist beyond) these various limited things. This idea can be interpreted in various ways. In its ultimate articulation, by the Hasidic leader [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], in the intellectual Hasidic method of [[Chabad]], the ''Tzimtzum'' is only metaphorical, an illusion from the perspective of man. Creation is [[panentheism|panentheistic]] (taking place fully "within God"), and [[acosmic]] (Illusionary) from the Divine perspective. God Himself, and even His light, is unrestricted by ''Tzimtzum'', from God's perspective. The ''Tzimtzum'' is merely the hiding of this unchanged reality from Creation. Shneur Zalman distinguishes between the "Upper Level Unity" of God's existence from the Divine perspective, with the "Lower Level Unity" of God's existence as creation perceives Him. Because God can be above logic, both perspectives of this paradox are true, from their alternative views. The dimension of the ''Tzimtzum'', which implies Divine transcendence, corresponds to the Upper Level Unity. In this perspective, because God is the true, ultimate Infinity, then Creation (even if its physical and spiritual realms should extend without limit) is completely nullified into literal non-existence by the Divine. There is no change in the complete unity of God as all Reality, before or after creation. This is the ultimate level of Divine transcendence.
* On the other hand, in Lurianic ''Kabbalah'', the ''Tzimtzum'' has an immanent Divine dimension. The ''Tzimtzum'' formed a "space" (in Lurianic terminology, the ''Halal'', "Vacuum") in which to allow creation to take place. The first act of creation was the emanation of a new light (''Kav'', "Ray") into the vacated space, from the ultimate Divine reality "outside", or unaffected, by the space. The purpose of the ''Tzimtzum'' was that the vacated space allowed this new light to be suited to the needs and capacities of the new creations, without their being subsumed in the primordial Divine Infinity. Kabbalistic theology offers metaphysical explanations of how Divine and spiritual processes unfold. In earlier, mainstream Jewish philosophy, logical descriptions of creation ''ex nihilo'' (from nothing) describe the new existence of creation, compared to the preceding absence. ''Kabbalah'', however, seeks to explain how the spiritual, metaphysical processes unfold. Therefore, in the Kabbalistic system, God is the ultimate reality, so that creation only exists because it is continuously sustained by the will of God. Creation is formed from the emanated "light" of the Divine Will, as it unfolds through the later ''Sefirot''. The light that originated with the ''Kav'' later underwent further contractions that diminished it, so that this immanent expression of Divinity could itself create the various levels of Spiritual, and ultimately, Physical existence. The terms of "light" and temporal descriptions of time are metaphorical, in a language accessible to grasp. In this immanent Divine dimension, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. In Shneur Zalman's explanation, this corresponds to the conscious perception by Creation of "Lower Level Unity" of God. In this perspective, Creation is real, and not an illusion, but is utterly nullified to the immanent Divine life force that continuously sustains and recreates it. It may not perceive its complete dependence on Divinity, as in our present World, that feels its own existence as independent reality. However, this derives from the great concealments of Godliness in our present World. "The Divine life-force which brings all creatures into existence must constantly be present within them ... were this life-force to forsake any created being for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ...". (''[[Tanya]], Shaar Hayichud'', Chapter 2-3. Shneur Zalman of Liadi).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9789">'''Islamic bioethics''', or Islamic [[medical ethics]], ({{lang-ar|الأخلاق الطبية}} ''al-akhlaq al-tibbiyyah'') refers to Islamic guidance on [[ethics|ethical]] or [[morality|moral]] issues relating to medical and scientific fields, in particular, those dealing with human life.&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction ==
In Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from [[Allah|God]], and should therefore be both respected and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in many [[Qur’an]]ic verses or ''[[ayat]]'', one of the most important being:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind."(Qur’an 5:32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:
# Saving a life is obligatory.
# Unjustified taking of a life is classified as [[murder]] and, thus, forbidden.

Though [[Muslim]]s recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them [[reason]], [[free will]], the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13).&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"/&gt; With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources==
The fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law ([[shari’a]]) and [[Islamic ethics]]. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or [[fatwa]]s regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as [[bid‘ah]] (innovation) and, therefore, is [[haram]] (impermissible).&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, 

* Qur’an,
* [[Hadith]] or [[Sunnah]]
* [[Ijtihad]]
** In [[Sunni]] Islam, ijtihad includes [[qiyas]] (analogy), [[ijma]] (consensus), [[maslaha]] (public welfare) and ‘[[urf]] (customary practice)
** In [[Shi’a]] Islam it is composed solely of al-[['aql]] (reason)

==Principles==
Principles of [[bioethics]] in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James F. Childress]], in their book, ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These bioethical principles: [[autonomy]], [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], [[non-maleficence]] and [[justice]] have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the ''Oath of the Muslim Doctor'' [http://www.islamset.com/ethics/code/oath.html] and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hathery, Shabib. "The Muslim Doctor: Duties and Responsibilities." ''Islamic Medical Association Conference, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.'' Ed. Khan, Y. and H. Bouagada. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority ==
Formulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority ([[mufti]]) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory ([[wajib]]/[[fard]]), recommended ([[mustahabb]]), neutral ([[mubah]]), discouraged ([[makruh]]) or forbidden ([[haram]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
As health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many [[Islamic countries]] which work together with [[ulema]] to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of [[bioethics]] is jeopardized.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include [[abortion]], [[fertility treatment]]s, [[family planning]], [[euthanasia]], [[genetic research]], [[cloning]], [[stem cell research]] among many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics Project==
The [http://engage.bioethics.georgetown.edu/imse Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project] is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/collections/islamic/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Project staff members at two [[Georgetown University]] libraries, the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics|Bioethics Research Library]] (Washington) and the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar#Library|School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library]] (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF), a member of the [[Qatar Foundation|Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnrf.org/nl/research_news/index.php?ELEMEID=1646&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy''' (May 19, 1920 – January 28, 2007) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-American [[psychiatrist]] and one of the founders of the field of [[family therapy]]. Born '''Iván Nagy''', his family name was changed to '''Böszörményi-Nagy''' during his childhood. He emigrated from Hungary to the [[United States]] in 1950, and he simplified his name to '''Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy''' at the time of his naturalization as a US citizen.

==Contextual therapy&lt;!--linked from 'Family therapy'--&gt;==

Boszormenyi-Nagy is best known for developing the ''Contextual'' approach to [[family therapy]] and individual [[psychotherapy]]. It is a comprehensive model which [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrates]] ''individual psychological'', ''interpersonal'', [[existential]], [[systems theory|systemic]], and ''intergenerational'' dimensions of individual and [[family]] life and development.

The contextual model, in its most well-known formulation, proposes four dimensions of relational reality, both as a guide for conducting therapy and for conceptualizing relational reality in general: 
:(1) '''Facts''' (e.g., genetic input, physical health, [[Ethnic group|ethnic]]-[[Culture|cultural]] background, [[socioeconomic status]], basic historical facts, events in a person's life cycle, etc)
:(2) '''Individual psychology''' (the domain of most individual psychotherapies)
:(3) '''Systemic transactions''' (the domain covered by classical systemic family therapy: e.g., rules, power, alignments, triangles, feedback, etc)
:(4) '''Relational ethics'''.
These dimensions are taken to be inter-linked, but not equatable or reducible to one another.&lt;ref name=legoff&gt;Le Goff, J.F. (2001). Boszormenyi-Nagy and Contextual Therapy: An Overview, [http://www.anzjft.com/pages/contents_abstracts.php?id=46 ''ANZJFT'', 22 (3)]: 147–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ducommun-Nagy, C. (2003). Can Giving Heal? Contextual Therapy and Biological Psychiatry. In P.S. Prosky &amp; D.V. Keith (Eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXe7ljRGW2IC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Contextual+Therapy+and+Biological+Psychiatry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o0IiQQa4ES&amp;sig=cAv8bVRypO1GRh6WaI02MTdDRPM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2V2KS5T7E4ri7AOnpIy0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Contextual%20Therapy%20and%20Biological%20Psychiatry%22&amp;f=false ''Family Therapy as an Alternative to Medication: An Appraisal of Pharmland.''] New York: Brunner-Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual model proposes ''relational ethics''&amp;mdash;the [[ethics|ethical]] or "[[justice]]" dimension of close relationships&amp;mdash;as an overarching integrative conceptual and methodological principle. Relational ethics focuses in particular on the nature and roles of ''connectedness'', ''caring'', [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]], [[loyalty]], ''legacy'', [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], fairness, [[accountability]], and [[trustworthiness]] - within and between [[Generation|generations]]. It is taken to represent not just a set of prescriptive [[Normative ethics|norms]], nor simply [[psychology|psychological]] phenomena, [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s, or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructions]]. Rather, relational ethics is seen as (1) having some objective [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]] basis by virtue of being derived from basic [[needs]] and from real [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s that have concrete consequences (i.e., as distinct from [[Abstraction|abstract]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|"value" ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;Boszormenyi-Nagy, I. (1997). [https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-11602159/response-to-are-trustworthiness-and-fairness-enough Response to "are trustworthiness and fairness enough? Contextual family therapy and the good family"]. ''Journal of Marital and Family Therapy'', Apr.&lt;/ref&gt;); and (2) as being significant [[explanation|explanatory]] and [[motivational]] dynamics operating - in both beneficial and destructive ways - in individuals, families, [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], and broader [[society]]. The construct validity and significance of relational ethics in clinical and educational contexts have been supported by a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;Grames HA, Miller RB, Robinson WB, Higgins DJ, &amp; Hinton WJ.

Cunningham &amp; N. Fretwell (eds.) ''Lifelong Learning and Active Citizenship''. London: CiCe, pp. 632-640&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[Ethics#Relational ethics|Relational ethics]]''.)

In a later formulation of the contextual model, Boszormenyi-Nagy proposed a fifth dimension - the ''ontic dimension'' - which was implicit in the earlier formulations, but which considers more explicitly the nature of the interconnection between people that allows an individual to exist decisively as a ''person'', and not just a ''self''.&lt;ref&gt;Ducommun-Nagy, C. (2002). Contextual Therapy. In F. Kaslow, R. Massey, &amp; S. Massey (Eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks2z9zkHrVwC&amp;pg=PA662&amp;dq=isbn:0471214396&amp;sig=HJHU67cJNqlxXnRElBxEeCLQsPE#PPA463,M1 ''Comprehensive handbook of psychotherapy, Vol. 3: Interpersonal/humanistic/existential.''] New York; Chichester: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[Intersubjectivity]] and [[Philosophy of dialogue]].)''

===Methodology===
''Multidirected partiality'' is the main methodological principle of contextual therapy. Its aim is to evoke a [[dialogue]] of responsible mutual position-taking among family members. It consists of a sequential, [[empathy|empathic]] turning towards member after member (even absent members), in which both acknowledgement and expectation are directed at them. It is an alternative to the more common 'neutrality' or unilateral [[wikt:partiality|partiality]] of other approaches. It requires an appreciation of the 'ledger' from each person's point of view, even that of the current [[wikt:victimize|victimizer]].&lt;ref name=legoff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, B. &amp; Stricker,G. (1983) Handbook of Family and Marital Therapy. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a family comes into therapy desiring to fix their son's outbursts and [[oppositional defiant disorder|oppositional defiant]] behavior. The therapist (and possibly a co-therapist where appropriate) would first seek basic information (including any relevant clinical or medical information), construct a [[genogram]] if possible, and have each family member explain their side of the story (either conjointly or in individual sessions as appropriate), in order to begin to understand the problem in terms of background facts, the relational context (i.e., ''intergenerational'', ''interpersonal'', and [[systems theory|systemic]]), and deeper [[motivational]] factors (e.g., psychological processes, hidden ''loyalties'' and ''legacies'', ''ledger'' imbalances, ''destructive entitlement'' resulting from real or perceived injustices, ''[[scapegoating]]'', ''[[parentification]]'' of the child, etc.), and not simply (as is commonly done in some other approaches) in terms of the '[[behaviour modification|behaviour]]', '[[systemic therapy|systemic interactions]]', '[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitions]]', or '[[Narrative therapy|narratives]]' of the family and the son.

Having gained this preliminary understanding of the situation, the therapist would firstly address any issues requiring urgent attention (e.g., physical welfare, prevention of violence, etc.), especially in relation to the interests of the most vulnerable member(s), whether or not they are present at the therapy sessions. The therapist would then go further, carefully and sequentially 'taking the side' of each member (while seeking to maintain overall balance, but not 'joining' the family as occurs, for example, in [[structural family therapy|structural therapy]]), the aim being to begin a genuine dialogue of mutual accountability, to reduce the reliance on [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] [[Acting out|acting-out]], and to find resources (e.g., hope, [[wikt:will|will]]) for rebuilding relationships through mutual acknowledgement of both entitlements and obligations, shifts in attitude and intention (but not 'relabeling' as in [[strategic therapy|strategic]] or [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] approaches), fair [[wikt:exoneration|exoneration]], and redemptive or ''rejunctive'' (i.e., 'trust-building') actions, that will in turn build individual and relational maturity and integrity (i.e., ''self-validation'' and ''self-delineation'' -  contextual counterparts of [[Murray Bowen|Bowen's]] ''differentiation''), and ''trustworthiness'', which contextual therapists see as the ultimate relational resource for individual and family well-being.

The approach would be adapted - although the basic principles would remain the same - according to the particular case; for example: adults having problems with their siblings or elderly parents; [[relationship counseling|couples issues]]; [[Conflict resolution|conflicts]] associated with [[blended families]], [[adoption]], [[fostering]], [[gamete donation (disambiguation)|gamete donation]] and [[surrogacy]]; [[Human migration|migration]] and [[cross-cultural]] issues; different [[mental disorder]]s; [[addiction]] and [[substance abuse]]; [[criminal behavior]], [[domestic violence]], and so on.

The contextual approach allows for the inclusion of many significant aspects of other approaches to psychotherapy and family therapy, provided that they are consistent with the overarching contextual principle of multilateral therapeutic ethical concern and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Boszormenyi-Nagy, I., Grunebaum, J., &amp; Ulrich, D.

'''Jean-Pierre de Crousaz''' (13 April 1663{{snd}}22 March 1750) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[philosopher]]. He is now remembered more for his letters of commentary than his formal works.

==Life==
De Crousaz was born in [[Lausanne]]. He was a many-sided man, whose numerous works on many subjects had a great vogue in their day, but are now forgotten. He has been described as an ''initiateur plutôt qu'un créateur'' (an initiator rather than a creator), chiefly because he introduced the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] to Lausanne in opposition to the reigning [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]], and also as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] pedant (for he was a pastor) of the French abbés of the 18th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=512}}

He studied in [[Geneva]], [[Leiden]], and [[Paris]], before becoming professor of philosophy and mathematics at the [[University of Lausanne|academy of Lausanne]] in 1700. He was rector of the academy four times before 1724, when theological disputes led him to accept a chair of philosophy and mathematics at [[Groningen (city)|Gröningen]]. In 1726 he was appointed governor to the young prince [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick of Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), and in 1735 returned to Lausanne with a good pension. In 1737 he was reinstated in his old chair, which he retained to his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=512}}

[[Edward Gibbon]], describing his first stay at Lausanne (1752–1755), writes in [[Memoirs of My Life and Writings|his autobiography]], "The logic of de Crousaz had prepared me to engage with his master [[John Locke|Locke]] and his antagonist [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=512}}

==Works==
The most important of his works are:
* ''Nouvel Essai de logique'' (1712)
* ''Géométrie des lignes et des surfaces rectilignes et circulaires'' (1712)
* ''Traité du beau'' (1714)
* ''Examen du traité de la liberté de penser d'Antoine Collins (1718)
* ''De l'éducation des enfants'' (1722, dedicated to the [[Caroline of Ansbach|then Princess of Wales]])
* ''Examen du pyrrhonisme ancien et moderne'' (1733, an attack chiefly on Bayle)
* ''Examen de l'essai de M. Pope sur l'homme'' (1737, an attack on the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibnitzian]] theory of [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] poem ''[[Essay on Man]]'')
* ''Logique'' (6 vols., 1741)
* ''De l'ésprit humain'' (1741)
* ''Réflexions sur l'ouvrage intitulé: La Belle Wolfienne'' (1743){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Jennifer Whiting''' is an American philosopher who teaches at the University of Pittsburgh. She has also taught at Harvard and Cornell, and was (from 2003 to 2015) Chancellor Jackman Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Jennifer Whiting profile page, Pittsburgh|url =http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/person/jennifer-whiting|website = www.philosophy.pitt.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Whiting earned a B.A. in Philosophy at [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] in 1978, receiving the Williamson Medal, the highest honor awarded by the faculty, for "character, leadership, and scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/dean/award-history/williamson-medal-recipients|title =Williamson Medal Recipients|date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a member of Franklin and Marshall’s first women’s squash team, lettered all four years, was MVP her junior and senior years, and achieved Honorable Mention All-American status in 1978.  She was later inducted into Franklin and Marshall’s Athletic Hall of Fame, partly on the basis of her subsequent record.  She was ranked for three consecutive years by the United States Squash Racquets Association among the nation’s top twenty women, placing 19th in 1979 (when she lost to Diana Nyad in the first round of the Women’s National Tournament), 15th in 1980, and 10th in 1981 (when she finished eighth in the National Tournament).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://godiplomats.com/trad/hall/bios/Jennifer_Whiting|title = Franklin &amp; Marshall College Athletics |date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiting did graduate work in Philosophy at Cornell, earning an M.A. in 1981 and a Ph.D. in 1984 (with a dissertation on ''Individual Forms in Aristotle,'' supervised by T.H. Irwin).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://philpapers.org/rec/WHIIFI|title = Works of Jennifer Whiting on Philpapers|date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Harvard from 1983 to 1986, then moved to the University of Pittsburgh, where she was granted tenure in 1991.  She left for Cornell in 1997, and moved from there to the University of Toronto in 2003.  She returned to Pittsburgh in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/person/jennifer-whiting|title = Jennifer Whiting profile page, Pittsburgh|date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiting has been a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and Cornell’s Society for Humanities.  She has also received fellowships from the ACLS, the Howard Foundation, and the NEH; was co-director (with psychologist Louis Sass of Rutgers) of an NEH Summer Institute on Mind, Self, and Psychopathology; and co-director (with her Pittsburgh colleague Stephen Engstrom) of an NEH conference that led to the publication of their co-edited volume: ''Aristotle, Kant, and the Stoics: Rethinking Happiness and Duty'' (Cambridge UP, 1996).

In 2007, Whiting received the Konrad Adenauer Research Award, given annually by the Alexander von Humboldt Association, in cooperation with the Royal Society of Canada, to recognize "the entire academic record to date of an internationally renowned Canadian researcher in the Humanities or Social Sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/adenauer-award.html|title =Humboldt Foundation|date = |access-date = 2016-02-21|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She spent 2007-08 doing research at the Humboldt University in Berlin, where she also co-taught a summer seminar on Aristotle’s Hylomorphism with faculty from Berlin, Oxford, Paris and Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2008-PDF-of-Philosophy-News.pdf|title = Philosophy News, University of Toronto|date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, she was made an Honorary Doctor of Science at Franklin and Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/news/for-news-media/press-releases/abc-anchor-stephanopoulos-to-deliver-f-m-commencement-address|title = ABC Anchor Stephanopoulos to Deliver F&amp;M Commencement Address|date = |access-date =2016-02-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research areas ==
Whiting has lectured widely in North America and Europe.  Though her teaching interests range widely, and include Philosophy and Literature as well as Feminism, her publications are divided mainly between work in ancient philosophy and work on contemporary issues at the intersection of ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.  Though most of her work in ancient philosophy has been on Aristotle, she has recently started to work on Plato, and published a radical re-reading of his allegedly tripartite psychology: "Psychic Contingency in the ''Republic''" (in ''Plato on the Divided Self,'' Barney, Brennan, and Brittain eds., Oxford UP 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ancient-philosophy.hu-berlin.de/en/ancient-philosophy/apsn/uot/jenniferwhiting|title = Jennifer Whiting, Humboldt University|date = |access-date =2017-04-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiting’s work on personal identity takes concern for one’s future selves as a ''component'' of psychological continuity, and has been reprinted (alongside of work on that topic by philosophers ranging from Plato and Locke through Derek Parfit and Thomas Nagel) in a highly acclaimed anthology of readings in Metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=16+11+4294922390+4294949403&amp;Ntk=P_EPI&amp;Ntt=125130385712498352617808613841191180064&amp;Ntx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial|date = |access-date =2016-03-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has worked closely with Sydney Shoemaker, and was co-editor (with Richard Moran and Alan Sidelle) of a double-issue of ''Philosophical Topics'' devoted to his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moran|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Sidelle|editor2-first=Alan|editor3-last=Whiting|editor3-first=Jennifer|title=The Philosophy of Sydney Shoemaker|date=2000|publisher=University of Arkansas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked closely with Annette Baier and has published two pieces celebrating Baier’s career.  One piece, drawing on the work of Virginia Woolf, appears in a volume Whiting co-edited with two of Baier’s former students on whose committees she also served (Joyce Jenkins and Christopher Williams).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24967-persons-and-passions-essays-in-honor-of-annette-baier/|title = Book Review: Persons and Passions: Essays in Honor of Annette Baier/|date = |access-date =2017-04-21 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford University Press is publishing three volumes of Whiting’s papers.  ''First, Second, and Other Selves: Essays on Friendship and Personal Identity'' is in press and scheduled to appear in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/first-second-and-other-selves-9780199967919?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Oxford University Press|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Thinking and Acting Together: Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics'' is scheduled to appear in 2017, with ''Body and Soul: Essays on Aristotle’s Hylomorphism'' following in 2018.

{{Gnosticism}}
{{New Testament Apocrypha}}
The '''Letter of Peter to Philip''' is a gnostic Christian epistle found in the Nag Hammadi Library in Egypt. It was dated to be written around late 2nd century to early 3rd century CE and focuses on a post-crucifixion appearance and teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] to the apostles on the [[Mount of Olives|Mount of Olives, or Mount Olivet]].

== Overview ==
The Letter of Peter to Philip, found in the cache of texts at [[Nag Hammadi]] and bound into Codex VIII, contains a brief letter purporting to be from [[Saint Peter]] to [[Philip the Apostle|Saint Philip]], followed by a narrative and [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] discourse upon the nature of Christ. It was probably written in the late 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd, originally in Greek, but translated into [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in the Nag Hammadi text. The title of the Letter is originally "The Letter of Peter Which He Sent to Philip", but is commonly simplified to "The Letter of Peter to Philip".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another copy of the letter has more recently been found in the [[Codex Tchacos]] and is titled plainly as "The Letter of Peter to Philip".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The Nag Hammadi Library ===
The [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi Library]] is a collection of thirteen codices that was found near the Egyptian city of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. Many writings found in this library are referred to as “Gnostic Gospels” because most of the documents contain [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] teachings that conflicted with the beliefs of [[proto-orthodox Christianity]], which at the time was becoming the predominant form of Christianity.  Therefore, most were rejected from the canon as [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity]] was formed in the early centuries C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nag Hammadi Library|url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html|website = www.gnosis.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary of the Text ==
The Letter of Peter to Philip begins with a greeting from the apostle Peter, the presumed author of this letter. It continues with Peter speaking directly to Philip, expressing his (Peter’s) wish that Philip rejoin the apostles in their evangelization mission. When Philip and the apostles meet on the Mount Olives, they prayed together twice, each time emphasizing light as a symbol of Jesus. After their prayers, the apostles are visited by a great light from the sky identifying itself as “Jesus Christ who is with you forever”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;“The Letter of Peter to Philip.” Trans. Frederik Wisse. The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. Ed. James M Robinson. San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1990. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching the apostles of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons]] and their [[pleroma]], followed by a series of questions from apostles about their struggles against the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|archons]] and how much they must suffer for the sake of their faith. Once the light disappeared from them, the apostles left the Mount Olives to go to Jerusalem, continuing their evangelization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Analysis and Scholarly Reception ==
The Letter of Peter to Philip is the last concluding tractate of the Nag Hammadi Codex VIII. Its predecessor is the [[Sethianism|Sethian]] text, ''[[Zostrianos]]''. It is speculated by scholars that the Letter of Peter to Philip was chosen as the last tractate for its convenience of brevity. This is supported by the fact that the Letter and ''Zostrianos'' share little theological or literary relationship. The Letter uses passages that are reminiscent of the [[Gospel of John]] and [[Acts of the Apostles]] which indicates that the author may have attempted to classify the text as one of the acts of the apostles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nag Hammadi Scriptures|last = Marvin|first = Meyer|publisher = HarperCollins Publishers|year = 2009|isbn = 9780062046369|location = |pages = 585|last2 = Robinson|first2 = James M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letter is considered to be Petrine in nature because of Peter's position as the leader of the apostles. The addressee of the Letter, Saint Philip, is portrayed as submissive, answering to Saint Peter's authority. In early Christianity, there was a conflict between the traditions associated with Peter and Philip. This letter is supposed by some scholars to be a "Petrine document designed to promote Peter's primacy in the early church." In addition, this document attempts to claim true apostolic authority by connecting the teachings Jesus gives in this post-crucifixion appearance with those he delivered during his earthly ministry. This would have been a bold assertion in the face of the proto-orthodox Christianity that was gaining power over other types of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Os, Bas van. “The Role of the Apostles in the Letter of Peter to Philip.” Annali di storia dell’esegesi 29.2 (2012): 155-60.

'''Lionel Gossman''' (born 1929) is a Scottish-American scholar of French literature. He taught Romance Languages at Johns Hopkins University and Princeton University, and has written extensively on the history, theory and practice of [[historiography]],&lt;ref&gt;For evaluations of Gossman's contributions to the field of historiography, see:

''Princeton Weekly Bulletin''. 24 May 1999. [http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/99/0524/emeriti.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gossman was born in Glasgow, Scotland and educated in public schools in the city, and during World War II, the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he graduated with an M.A. (Hons.) degree in French and German literature from the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he obtained the ''Diplôme d'Études Supérieures'' at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, France, and wrote his thesis "The Idea of the Golden Age in ''Le Roman de la Rose.''"&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952-1954, Gossman served in the Royal Navy where he was trained to be a simultaneous English-Russian translator.&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of national service in 1954, he entered the then newly founded [[St. Antony's College]], the first exclusively graduate college of Oxford University. In 1958 he completed a doctoral dissertation on scholarly research and writing on the Middle Ages during the French Enlightenment ("The World and Work of ''La Curne de Sainte-Palaye''").&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief stint as Assistant Lecturer at the University of Glasgow (1957–1958), Gossman accepted a teaching position in the Department of Romance Languages at [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland. He rose through the ranks, becoming professor in 1966, head of the French section of the Department in 1968, and chair in 1975. Gossman says he was fortunate to have as colleagues and friends in those years [[René Girard]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Lucien Goldmann]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Michel Serres]] and [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Gossman recalls in his autobiography:

{{quote| It was a time of enormous intellectual ferment, much of it the work of French thinkers and writers […]. As [[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]] were challenged by [[structuralism]] and structuralism in turn by "[[post-structuralism]]", we in the French section of the  Romance Languages Department found ourselves in the role of mediators between our colleagues in the other disciplines and the French ''maîtres penseurs'' to whom we had direct access and whose aura illuminated us too to some extent. Curious physicists and puzzled English professors looked respectfully to us to provide explanations of the latest trends. French in those years was an extraordinarily lively discipline at the very center of the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 1976, Gossman moved to [[Princeton University]], where he spent 23 "calm, happy, productive and personally and intellectually fulfilling years." He served on key university committees, and from 1991-1996 chaired the Romance Languages Department. In 1990 he received Princeton's Howard T. Berhman Award for distinguished service in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he was made an Officer in the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]]; in 1996, he was elected a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]]; and in 2005 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities from Princeton University.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;"Lionel Gossman." Princeton University: Department of French and Italian. [http://www.princeton.edu/fit/people/display_person.xml?netid=lgossman&amp;display=All]&lt;/ref&gt; Gossman has also served on the editorial boards of The Johns Hopkins University Press, the Princeton University Press and the American Philosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/fit/people/data/l/lgossman/CV.pdf "CV." Gossman, Jeffrey Lionel. Princeton University, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since retiring in 1999, Gossman has resumed his undergraduate studies of German culture. He has written a number of articles on aspects of 19th-century German art and cultural politics, including several studies of the [[Nazarene movement]].&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; On the Nazarenes, he has authored the study "Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Painters of the Nineteenth Century"&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, Lionel. "Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Painters of the Nineteenth Century." Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide. 2.3 (Autumn 2003). [http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=273:unwilling-moderns-the-nazarene-painters-of-the-nineteenth-century&amp;catid=73:autumn03article&amp;Itemid=84]&lt;/ref&gt; and the book "The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/publications/current/item/344 "Current Publications." ''American Philosophical Society.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annotated bibliography==
Along with articles on a wide range of topics, as of April 2010 Gossman has published 14 books. Here are summaries and reviews of some of his best-known books:

*'''Orpheus Philologus: Bachofen versus Mommsen on the Study of Antiquity''' (1983) ({{ISBN|9781422374672}})

Though the great German classical scholar [[Theodor Mommsen]] was probably unaware of it, he was the object of the passionate and enduring hatred of [[J. J. Bachofen]], an obscure Swiss philologist in the provincial city of Basle. Bachofen, not well known in the English-speaking world, is mentioned by anthropologists for his contribution to the popular 19th-century theory of "[[matriarchy]]", and by classicists such as [[George Derwent Thomson]] for his contributions to the study of Greek myth and tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;"Description: Orpheus Philologus: Bachofen versus Mommsen on the Study of Antiquity." Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, Transactions 73:5 (1983)." Diane Publishing Co.: American Philosophical Society. [http://www.dianepublishing.net/Orpheus_Philologus_p/142237467x.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Arnaldo Momigliano writes in ''The Journal of Modern History:

{{quote| Gossman's monograph, penetrating and well informed […] will help enormously to place Bachofen in his time and to indicate his interest for our time. Gossman sees him as the lonely heir of a previous generation and tradition […] whose philological interpretation of individual texts had been characterized by a deep suspicion of the modernization of ancient views and by a predisposition to an intuitive global understanding of the wisdom of classical and preclassical stories.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, Arnaldo.

*'''Towards a Rational Historiography''' (1989) ({{ISBN|9780871690005}})

Gossman maintains that underlying the argument that [[historiography]] cannot be subsumed under a poetics or a rhetoric is a larger claim, namely that a wide range of activities, from literary criticism, through legal debate, theology, ethics, politics, psychology, and medicine to the natural sciences, all constitute rational practices, even if there is considerable variation in the degree of formalism and rigor and in the type of argument most commonly employed in each of these different fields of inquiry.

Hence Gossman emphasizes the practice or process of doing history rather than the product. What appeals to him in the idea of reason as a practice is its open, liberal, and democratic character. Historiography as a rational practice supposes a community of participants rather than the "anomie" of a world in which every man is his own historian that appears to be implied by privileging the historical "text." &lt;ref&gt;"Towards a Rational Historiography; Transactions, American Philosophical Society (vol. 79, Part 3)." Diane Publishing Co.: American Philosophical Society. [http://www.dianepublishing.net/Towards_a_Rational_Historiography_p/0871690004.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Berenson writes in his book "The Trial of Madame Caillaux:"

{{quote| Unlike many recent critics of historians and historical practice, especially those influenced by French literary theory, Gossman grounds his discussion in a solid sense of what historians 'actually do', not just when they write their narratives but when they perform their research, integrate and evaluate the work of others, revise and reconceptualize their scholarship in the face of new evidence and critical scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Berenson, Edward.

*'''Between History and Literature''' (1990) ({{ISBN|9780674068155}})
Drawing on English, German and French scholarship, the essays in this volume illuminate the many facets of the problematic relationship between history and literature, and show how each discipline both challenges and undermines the other's absolutist pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?recid=30616 "Between History and Literature."

*'''Basel in the Age of Burckhardt: A Study in Unseasonable Ideas''' (2000) ({{ISBN|9780226305004}})

After co-teaching with [[Carl Schorske]] an undergraduate seminar on the civic culture of 19th century [[Basel]], Switzerland, Gossman worked on this book for 20 years. Gossman argues that the peculiar, somewhat anachronistic political and social structure of Basel made it a favorable haven for "untimely" ideas that challenged the positivism and optimistic progressivism of the time: the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]], the historiography of [[Bachofen]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]], and the theology of [[Franz Overbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Gossman, "In the Footsteps of Giants", p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Awarded the American Historical Association's 2001 George L.

*'''The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania'''' (2007) ({{ISBN|9780871699756}})

Gossman focuses on [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]]'s painting "Italia and Germania" to discuss the importance of religious conversion in [[Romanticism|Romantic thought]]. This book serves as a thoughtful introduction to the way of thinking of one of the most important of the [[Nazarene movement]] painters. It treats the evolution of the Nazarene artists’ preoccupation with religious issues in an engaging manner and offers a social-historical and theological context to Overbeck's painting.&lt;ref&gt;"Description: The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania.'"

*'''Brownshirt Princess: A Study of the 'Nazi Conscience'''' (2009) ({{doi|10.11647/OBP.0003}})

[[Marie Adelheid]], Prinzessin Reuß-zur Lippe, was a rebellious young woman and aspiring writer from an ancient princely family who became a fervent Nazi. [[Heinrich Vogeler]] was a well-regarded ''[[Jugendstil]]'' (Art Nouveau) artist who joined the [[German Communist Party]] and later emigrated to the Soviet Union. [[Ludwig Roselius]] was a successful Bremen businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee.

What was it about the revolutionary climate following Germany's defeat in World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry - entitled ''Gott in mir (God in Me)'' - about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study provides insight into the sources and character of the "Nazi Conscience." &lt;ref&gt;Gossman, Lionel. "Brownshirt Princess: A Study of the 'Nazi Conscience'" Open Book Publishers. [https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0003]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hermynia Zur Mühlen. The End and the Beginning: The Book of My Life'''' (2010)({{doi=10.11647/OBP.0010}})
First published in Germany in 1929, this is a new and corrected English translation of a memoir recounting a rebellious young woman's struggle to achieve independence. Born in 1883 into a wealthy aristocratic society of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hermynia Zur Mühlen spent much of her childhood traveling in Europe and North Africa with her diplomat father. After five years on her German husband's estate in Czarist Russia, she broke with both her family and her husband and set out on a precarious career as a professional writer. She also became a convinced and passionate socialist and devoted her considerable literary talent to the propagation of socialism and the struggle against Nazism and anti-Semitism. The author of novels (most of them translated into English), short stories, and highly successful "proletarian" children's fairy tales, she also translated from French, Russian, and English (notably most of the works of Upton Sinclair) into German. Because of her outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she had to flee first Germany in 1933, then her native Austria in 1938, and seek refuge in England, where she died, virtually penniless in 1951. This edition of her memoir is accompanied by thumbnail sketches of the many individuals and events mentioned in it and thus evokes an entire vanished age. In addition, Gossman contributes a comprehensive study of Zur Mühlen's life and work in the form of a "Tribute" to a talented and unjustly neglected woman writer.

*'''Figuring History''''(2011)({{ISBN|9781606180143}})

In the past half-century the writing of history has been the object of much critical scrutiny on the part of literary scholars, philosophers, and historians. History painting has traditionally been an important topic in art history. The illustration of history books in contrast, has not attracted much attention. "Figuring History" is a preliminary inquiry into the changing ways in which graphics, ranging from representational images to statistical charts, have been used to enhance or illuminate historical texts.

*'''The Passion of Max von Oppenheim: Archaeology and Intrigue in the Middle East from Wilhelm II to Hitler'''' (2013)({{doi|10.11647/OBP.0030}})

Born into a prominent German Jewish banking family, Baron Max von Oppenheim (1860-1946)was a keen amateur archaeologist and ethnographer. His discovery and excavation of Tell Halaf in Syria was a major contribution to knowledge of the ancient Middle East; his massive study of the Bedouins is still consulted by scholars today. Oppenheim was also an ardent German patriot, eager to secure for his country its "place in the sun." Excluded by his part-Jewish ancestry from the regular German diplomatic service, he earned a reputation among the British and the French as "the Kaiser's spy" because of his intriguing with nationalist groups in Egypt and North Africa and his plan, on the outbreak of World War I, to incite Muslims under British, French, and Russian rule to a jihad against their rulers. Despite being "half-Jewish" according to the Nuremberg Laws, Oppenheim was not molested by the Nazis. In fact, he placed his knowledge of the Middle East and his contacts with Muslim leaders at the service of the regime. "The Passion of Max von Oppenheim" tells the unsettling story of one part-Jewish man's passion for his country in the face of persistent and, in his later years, genocidal anti-Semitism. Its focus is on the political attitudes of highly acculturated and wealthy German Jews in the Kaiserzeit and in the face of National Socialism.

*'''Andre Maurois (1885-1967): Fortunes and Misfortunes of a Moderate''''(2014)({{ISBN|9781137402691}})

Respected by his peers and hugely successful internationally in the first half of the twentieth century—in 1935 the English translation of one of his fifteen major biographies was the first book to be published in Allen Lane's pioneering Penguin paperback series (Penguin #1) -- Maurois is now hardly read. His liberal humanism, his moderate and conciliatory stance in everything from politics to his lucid and elegant writing style, his "politeness" as he put it himself, appealed in his own time to a broad educated public. As manners values, and society have changed, and unquestioning respect for a shared European cultural tradition has diminished, have the very characteristics that once ensured Maurois' popularity caused new generations of readers to find his work, when they are aware of it, outdated and of little interest?

''''Jules Michelet: On History''''(2014)({{ISBN|9781909254725}})

Three programmatic essays on history by one of the greatest of Romantic historians, interest in whose work was revived by the celebrated modern "Annales" school. The first, translated by Flora Kimmich, and the second, translated by Lionel Gossman, are available here for the first time in English translation; the third, the Preface to the 1869 edition of the Histoire de France, originally published in its first English translation by Edward K. Kaplan in 1977, has been revised by the translator for this volume. Edited and with a foreword by Lionel Gossman.

Gossman continues to work on a book-length study of Heinrich Vogeler, a successful turn-of-the-century German artist and illustrator and a friend of the poet [[Rilke]]. Gossman is interested in Vogeler's transformation from a dandy and aesthete in the years before World War I into a left-wing anarchist and then Communist in the years following the war, and in his dogged search for an artistic form appropriate to his changed convictions and worldview.

'''Luc Ferry''' ({{IPA-fr|fɛʁi|lang}}; born January 1, 1951) is a [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and politician, and a proponent of [[secular humanism]]. He is a former member of the [[Saint-Simon Foundation]] think-tank.

He received an Agrégation de philosophie (1975), a Doctorat d’Etat en science politique (1981), and an Agrégation de science politique (1982).
As a Professor of political science and political philosophy, Luc Ferry taught at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Lyon]] (1982–1988) &amp;mdash; during which time he also taught and directed graduate research at the [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne|Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] &amp;mdash;, then at [[Caen University]] (1989–96). He finally was a professor at [[Paris Diderot University]] from 1996 until he resigned in 2011 when asked to actually teach there.

From 2002 and until 2004 he served as the [[Minister of Education (France)|Minister of Education]] on the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] led by the conservative Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]. During his tenure, he was the minister in charge of the implementation of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. He received the award of Docteur honoris causa from the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] ([[Canada]]). He is the 2013 Telesio Galilei Academy of science Laureate for Philosophy.

He was created Chevalier De La Dive Bouteille De Gaillac on the 20 March 2012 together with Max Karoubi and Francesco Fucilla.

In June 2011, Ferry announced on television that he knew about a former government minister who had sexually abused little boys in an orgy in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://economicsnewspaper.com/policy/french/minister-pedophile-ferry-heard-at-the-juvenile-30611.html "Minister pedophile: Ferry heard at the juvenile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815112734/http://economicsnewspaper.com/policy/french/minister-pedophile-ferry-heard-at-the-juvenile-30611.html |date=2011-08-15 }}, economicsnewspaper.com.

June 2, 2011. Accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the case was known at the highest levels of the French state, but he provided no specifics as to the persons involved, citing the risk of being sued for [[libel]]. A criminal investigation was then opened and he was asked to cooperate with the prosecutors.

In June 2011, ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', ''[[Le Monde]]'' and other media&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 7 juin 2011, [http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/06/07/avec-la-loi-sur-l-autonomie-luc-ferry-ne-peut-plus-secher-ses-cours_1533221_823448.html « Avec la loi sur l'autonomie, Luc Ferry ne peut plus sécher ses cours »]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Libération'', 8 juin 2011, [http://www.liberation.fr/societe/01012342062-luc-ferry-seche-ses-cours-de-philo-a-la-fac « Luc Ferry sèche ses cours de philo à la fac  »]&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that Luc Ferry, a professor at [[Paris Diderot University]] since 1996 (or 1997, depending on sources) had not ever taught there — when he was minister, he was on leave, and when not on leave his obligation to teach was waived in order for him to undertake other official duties. Some of those came with compensation pay, while he was still paid as a professor. In 2010, however, a change in legislation (introduced by minister [[Valérie Pécresse]]) made the University financially autonomous.  It did not want to have professors on its payroll that did not teach, which may have made its president liable for misuse of public funds; it then required Luc Ferry to do his allocated teaching share, which he declined to do. In 2011, according to some sources, the university is threatening to get him to refund his salary (€4500 per month).{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''Mangong''' (만공, 1871&amp;ndash;1946) or '''Song Mangong''' was a [[Korea]]n [[Buddhist]] monk, independence activist, scholar, poet, writer and philosopher, in the period of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese Occupation]] of Korea. ManGong was born in Jeong Eup, Jeonbuk Province in 1871 and was ordained at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Wolmyeon Mangong| url=http://www.ibulgyo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=63691

'''Marcantonio Zimara''' (c. 1460–1532 CE), was an Italian philosopher.

==Life==
He was born in [[San Pietro in Galatina|Galatina]] (Lecce) and from 1497 studied philosophy at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Agostino Nifo]] and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]. He subsequently taught logic while studying medicine at Padua (1501–1505), and in 1509 was appointed professor of natural philosophy. From 1509 to 1518 Zimara lived in San Pietro in Galatina, after which he taught in [[University of Salerno|Salerno]] (1518–1522), [[University of Naples Federico II|Naples]] (1522–1523), and again at Padua (1525–1528).

Zimara edited works by medieval philosophers (notably [[Albertus Magnus]]) and edited and wrote commentaries on [[Aristotle]] and [[Averroës]]. His ''Tabula dilucidationum in dictis Aristotelis et Averrois'' (1537), became the principal scholarly tool for searching the works of Aristotle and Averroës.

{{Utilitarianism |expanded=Problems}}

The '''mere addition paradox''', also known as the '''repugnant conclusion''', is a problem in [[ethics]], identified by [[Derek Parfit]] and discussed in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.

==The paradox==

Consider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the [[happiness]] of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.

[[Image:MereAddition.svg|center]]

How do these populations compare in value? 

Parfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).

Next, Parfit suggests that ii) B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.

Then, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that B− is better than A+, (c) that B− is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.

==Criticisms and responses==
Some scholars, such as [[Larry Temkin]] and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the "better than" relation is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that B− is better than A+ it simply does not follow that B− is better than A.

[[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbjorn|first=Tannsjo|date=January 2009|title=Why We Ought to Accept the Repugnant Conclusion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/why-we-ought-to-accept-the-repugnant-conclusion/F60DB3A1B9CA4460650EA5DF9AA0540D|journal=Utilitas|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0953820800003642|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Huemer]] also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| title=In Defence of Repugnance| first=Michael| last=Huemer| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109034025/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| archivedate=2016-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|isbn=019824908X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term ''mere addition paradox'' was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-120/ |title=Another Mere Addition Paradox? Some Reflections on Variable Population Poverty Measurement |publisher=UNU-WIDER |date=November 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |isbn=978-92-9230-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a ''no mere addition axiom'' to be used for judging such statistical measures: "merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

This same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game. Thus, if 10,000 people download the demo of a game and 2,000 buy it, the game is a borderline success; however, it would be rendered a failure by an extra 500 people downloading the demo and not buying, even though this "mere addition" changes nothing with regard to income or consumer satisfaction from the previous situation.

{{nihongo|'''Mushi-dokugo'''|無師独悟}}, sometimes called {{nihongo|'''jigo-jishō'''|自悟自証||self-enlightened and self-certified}}, is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term used in [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] which expresses the phenomenon known as "awakening alone, without a master".&lt;ref name ="Faure48"&gt;Faure, 48&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Faure: "Keizan's attitude is ambiguous. Sometimes, like Dogen in his hardly veiled criticism of the Darumashu, het insists on the importance of a face-to-face transmission between master and disciple, authenticated by a certificate of succession. At other times he seems to admit the possibility of "awakening alone, without a master" (''mushi-dokugo''), as [[Nōnin]] was said to have done".&lt;ref name ="Faure48" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=179, note 25}}

==Etymology==
''Mushi-dokugo'' (無師独悟) is a Japanese term composed of four Chinese characters, or [[kanji]], meaning "independent realization without a master." The character ''mu'' (無) means "without" or "no", ''shi'' (師) means "master" or "teacher", ''doku'' (独) means "independent" or "alone", and ''go'' (悟) means "realization" or "understanding" ([[satoru]]), also translated as "enlightenment" ([[satori]]). When strung together, the characters literally read, "no (無) master (師) independent (独) understanding (悟)." The equivalent Chinese pronunciation is ''wúshī dúwù.''

==Examples of mushi-dokugo==
[[Nōnin]] (died 1196) is an example of mushi-dokugo:&lt;ref name ="Faure48" /&gt;
{{quote|Nonin initially studied [[Tendai]] Buddhism, but he apparently became dissatisfied with it, even abandoning the traditional teacher-disciple relationship by declaring himself to be a self-enlightened Zen rōshi.{{sfn|Grigg|2012|p=145-146}}}}

During the [[Edo period]] in [[Japan]], there were a great many priests who proclaimed to be "self-enlightened." These included "such notables as the [[Myōshin-ji]] masters Daigu, Ungo, Isshi and the [[Sōtō]] priest [[Suzuki Shōsan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Haskel, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Korean master [[Jinul]] could also be seen as an example.

==Statements on mushi-dokugo==
According to [[William Bodiford]], it is "usually considered suspect since the risk of self-delusion or "fake-Zen" is always high. ... To guarantee that his experience of the truth of Buddhism is genuine, the Zen disciple relies upon his teacher to authenticate and formally acknowledge his enlightenment."{{sfn|Bodiford|1991}}

[[Dōgen]], the founder of the [[Sōtō]] school of [[Japanese Zen]], acknowledged in his lifetime that such a phenomenon exists. According to Hee-Jin Kim,
{{quote|... enlightenment-by-oneself, without a teacher ''(mushi-dokugo)'', [is] the ultimate Zen principle that every practitioner had to actualize, even while studying under competent teachers and reading the sutras for a number of years. Dōgen provided this well known dictum with a specific methodological/[[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] key that allowed one to unlock the mystery of existence—that is, to open the self and the universe. That key amounted, in essence, to critical, reflective thinking as an integral part of meditation. Without this key, it was impossible to attain one's own salvific independence ... Meditation and wisdom alike had to be subjected to critical scrutiny and reassessed in the changing situation.{{sfn|Kim|2010}}}}
Critical, reflective thinking as an integral part of meditation is mentioned in the fascicles of the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]''.{{sfn|Kim|2010}} Anyone practising alone or together, without dharma transmission, may be regarded a dharma practitioner:
{{quote|So although [[Dharma transmission|shiho]] alone is not much, no shiho at all qualifies you for nothing but being a dharma practitioner in your own right, a follower of the buddha way who may practice on his own or along with others. You may even teach the dharma, but you should not pose as an authorized representative of a lineage or school. Believe it or not, that happens all the time. If you teach without shiho, you should make clear that you are not part of one of the existing schools, but the founder of your own school (which is OK of course, as long as you state so).&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.org/en/english-what-does-it-take-to-become-a-full-fledged-soto-shu-priest-and-is-it-really-worth-the-whole-deal-1/english-what-does-it-take-to-become-a-full-fledged-soto-shu-priest-and-is-it-really-worth-the-whole-deal-part-2-ten-points-to-keep-in-mind-about-dharma-transmission/ Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Occasionalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory about [[Causality|causation]] which says that created substances cannot be [[efficient cause]]s of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by [[God]]. (A related theory, which has been called "occasional causation", also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, 'The Occasionalism of Louis de la Forge', in Nadler (ed.), ''Causation in Early Modern Philosophy'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 57–73;  Nadler, 'Descartes and Occasional Causation', ''British Journal for the History of Philosophy'', 2 (1994) 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event ''causes'' God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other.

== Islamic theological schools ==
The doctrine first reached prominence in the [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] schools of [[Iraq]], especially in [[Basra]]. The ninth century theologian [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] argued that there is no [[Secondary Causation]] in the created order.  The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the world is in a constant state of recreation by God.

The most famous proponent of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] occasionalist doctrine was [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]], an 11th-century theologian based in [[Baghdad]]. In ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank | last = Griffel | title = Al-Ghazali's Philosophical Theology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2015}} Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]-influenced [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]. In response to the philosophers' claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an [[ontological]] and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|using logic]]. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], using his expertise in the [[Science in medieval Islam|natural sciences]] of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] and [[Physics in medieval Islam|physics]].

Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[physical law|laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that ''appears'' unusual ''to us''. Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles.

In 1993, Karen Harding's paper "Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory" described several "remarkable" similarities between Ghazali's concept of occasionalism and the (disputed) [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. She stated: "In both cases, and contrary to common sense, objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence. In order for an object to exist, it must be brought into being either by God (al Ghazili) or by an observer (the Copenhagen Interpretation)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harding | first = Karen | title = Causality Then and Now: Al Ghazali and Quantum Theory | date = Summer 1993 | journal = The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences | url = http://www.ghazali.org/articles/harding-V10N2-Summer-93.pdf | volume = 10 | number = 2 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 article in ''[[Studia Islamica]]'', Lenn Goodman asks the question, "Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?"&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan. “Did Al-Ghazâlî Deny Causality?” Studia Islamica, no. 47, 1978, pp. 83–120. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1595550.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrates that Ghazali did not deny the existence of observed, "worldly" causation. According to Goodman's analysis, Ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect: rather, Ghazali argues that there is no ''necessary'' link between observed cause and effect.

== Dualism ==
One of the motivations for the theory is the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their [[essence]]s that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary.

The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 299–305.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: [[Johannes Clauberg]], [[Claude Clerselier]], [[Gerauld de Cordemoy]], [[Arnold Geulincx]], [[Louis de La Forge]], [[François Lamy (theologian)|François Lamy]], and (most notably), [[Nicolas Malebranche]].

== Hume's arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz ==
These occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, was anticipated by certain arguments of [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that "We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', sect. 7, pt. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. [[George Berkeley]] was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, "visibly inactive".&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', sect. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in ''itself''. The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the [[pre-established harmony]] between the alterations produced immanently within different substances.

'''Octavio Paz Lozano'''{{efn|Spanish pronunciation: {{IPA-es|okˈtaβjo pas loˈsano|}}, &lt;small&gt;{{Audio|Octavio Paz.ogg|audio}}&lt;/small&gt;.}} (1914–1998) was a Mexican poet and diplomat. For his body of work, he was awarded the 1981 [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], the 1982 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], and the 1990 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

==Early life==
Born March 31, 1914, Octavio Paz was introduced to literature early in his life through the influence of his grandfather's library, filled with classic Mexican and European literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guillermo Sheridan]]: ''Poeta con paisaje: ensayos sobre la vida de Octavio Paz''. México: ERA, 2004. p. 27. {{ISBN|968411575X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, he discovered [[Gerardo Diego]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], and [[Antonio Machado]], Spanish writers who had a great influence on his early writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaime Perales Contreras]]: "Octavio Paz y el circulo de la revista Vuelta". Ann Arbor, Michigan: Proquest, 2007. pp.46&amp;ndash;47. UMI Number 3256542&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager in 1931, Paz published his first poems, including "Cabellera". Two years later, at the age of 19, he published ''Luna Silvestre'' ("Wild Moon"), a collection of poems. In 1932, with some friends, he founded his first literary review, ''Barandal''. In 1937 at the age of 23, Paz abandoned his law studies and left Mexico City for [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to work at a school in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], set up for the sons of peasants and workers.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan: ''Poeta con paisaje'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; There, he began working on the first of his long, ambitious poems, "Entre la piedra y la flor" ("Between the Stone and the Flower") (1941, revised in 1976). Influenced by the work of [[T. S. Eliot]], it explores the situation of the Mexican peasant under the domineering landlords of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Octavio Paz |last= Wilson |first= Jason |authorlink=  |year= 1986 |publisher= G. K. Hall |location= Boston |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Paz was invited to the Second International Writers Congress in Defense of Culture in Spain during the country's [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]; he showed his solidarity with the Republican side and against [[fascism]]. Upon his return to Mexico, Paz co-founded a literary journal, ''Taller'' ("Workshop") in 1938, and wrote for the magazine until 1941. In 1937 he married [[Elena Garro]], who is considered one of Mexico's finest writers. They had met in 1935. They had one daughter, Helena, and were divorced in 1959.

In 1943, Paz received a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] and used it to study at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in the United States. Two years later he entered the Mexican diplomatic service, and was assigned for a time to New York City. In 1945, he was sent to Paris, where he wrote ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude|El Laberinto de la Soledad]]'' ("The Labyrinth of Solitude"). ''The New York Times'' later described it as "an analysis of modern Mexico and the Mexican personality in which he described his fellow countrymen as instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude and ceremoniousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Octavio Paz, Mexican Poet, Wins Nobel Prize|last= Rule|first=Sheila|work=New York Times|location=New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/12/books/octavio-paz-mexican-poet-wins-nobel-prize.html|date=October 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he travelled to India for the first time. That same year, he went to Tokyo, as [[chargé d'affaires]]. He next was assigned to [[Geneva]], Switzerland. He returned to Mexico City in 1954, where he wrote his great poem "Piedra de sol" ("Sunstone") in 1957, and published ''Libertad bajo palabra'' (''Liberty under Oath''), a compilation of his poetry up to that time. He was sent again to Paris in 1959. In 1962, he was named Mexico's ambassador to India.

==Later life==
In India, Paz completed several works, including ''El mono gramático'' (''The Monkey Grammarian'') and ''Ladera este'' (''Eastern Slope''). While in India, he met numerous writers of a group known as the [[Hungry Generation]] and had a profound influence on them.
He met his first wife [[Elena Garro]] a writer in Mexico City and was married to her in 1937, they were together until 1959. They had a daughter Helena Laura Paz Garro.

In 1965, he married Marie-José Tramini, a French woman who would be his wife for the rest of his life. In October 1968, he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest of the Mexican government's [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of student demonstrators]] in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]].&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz: 1957–1987'' by Eliot Weignberger&lt;/ref&gt;

After staying in Paris for refuge, he returned to Mexico in 1969. He founded his magazine ''Plural'' (1970–1976) with a group of liberal Mexican and Latin American writers.

From 1969 to 1970 he was [[Simón Bolívar Professor of Latin-American Studies|Simón Bolívar Professor]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He was also a visiting lecturer during the late 1960s and the [[A. D. White]] Professor-at-Large from 1972 to 1974 at [[Cornell University]]. In 1974 he lectured at [[Harvard University]] as [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer]]. His book ''Los hijos del limo'' ("Children of the Mire") was the result of those lectures. After the Mexican government closed ''Plural'' in 1975, Paz founded ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'', another cultural magazine. He was editor of that until his death in 1998, when the magazine closed.

He won the 1977 [[Jerusalem Prize]] for literature on the theme of individual freedom. In 1980, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard, and in 1982, he won the [[Neustadt Prize]]. Once good friends with novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]], Paz became estranged from him in the 1980s in a disagreement over the [[Sandinistas]], whom Paz opposed and Fuentes supported.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/books/carlos-fuentes-mexican-novelist-dies-at-83.html |title=Carlos Fuentes, Mexican Man of Letters, Dies at 83 |author=Anthony DePalma |date=May 15, 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Paz's magazine ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'' published criticism of Fuentes by [[Enrique Krauze]], resulting in estrangement between Paz and Fuentes, who had long been friends.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/carlos-fuentes-mexican-novelist-dies-at-83/2012/05/15/gIQAx7dxRU_story.html |title=Carlos Fuentes, Mexican novelist, dies at 83 |author=Marcela Valdes |date=May 16, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of Paz's poems (written between 1957 and 1987) was published in 1990. In 1990, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Literature 1990"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1990|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1990|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of cancer on April 19, 1998, in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1951-23163-24439-71?cc=1923424&amp;wc=M9W1-L3L:1513580468 |title=Civil Death Registration |author=México, Distrito Federal, Registro Civil |date=20 Apr 1998 |website=FamilySearch.org  |publisher=Genealogical Society of Utah. 2002 |accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arana-Ward |first1=Marie |year=1998 |title=Octavio Paz, Mexico's Great Idea Man  |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/paz.htm |accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kandell |first1=Jonathan |year=1998 |title=Octavio Paz, Mexico's Man of Letters, Dies at 84  |journal=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/21/books/octavio-paz-mexico-s-man-of-letters-dies-at-84.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillermo Sheridan]], who was named by Paz as director of the Octavio Paz Foundation in 1998, published a book, ''Poeta con paisaje'' (2004) with several biographical essays about the poet's life up to 1998, when he died.

==Aesthetics==
"The poetry of Octavio Paz", wrote the critic [[Ramón Xirau]], "does not hesitate between language and silence; it leads into the realm of silence where true language lives."&lt;ref&gt;Xirau, Ramón (2004) ''Entre La Poesia y El Conocimiento: Antologia de Ensayos Criticos Sobre Poetas y Poesia Iberoamericanos''. Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Económica p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
A prolific author and poet, Paz published scores of works during his lifetime, many of which have been translated into other languages. His poetry has been translated into English by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Charles Tomlinson]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]] and [[Mark Strand]]. His early poetry was influenced by [[Marxism]], [[surrealism]], and [[existentialism]], as well as religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. His poem, "Piedra de sol" ("Sunstone"), written in 1957, was praised as a "magnificent" example of surrealist poetry in the presentation speech of his Nobel Prize.

His later poetry dealt with love and eroticism, the nature of time, and Buddhism. He also wrote poetry about his other passion, modern painting, dedicating poems to the work of [[Balthus]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. As an essayist Paz wrote on topics such as [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]] and [[Economy of Mexico|economics]], [[Pre-Columbian art|Aztec art]], [[anthropology]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. His book-length essay, ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (Spanish: ''El laberinto de la soledad''), delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude. Due to their [[History of Mexico|history]], their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either. A key work in understanding [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]], it greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as [[Carlos Fuentes]]. Ilan Stavans wrote that he was "the quintessential surveyor, a [[Dante]]'s Virgil, a Renaissance man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Paz wrote the play ''La hija de Rappaccini'' in 1956. The plot centers around a young Italian student who wanders about Professor Rappaccini's beautiful gardens where he spies the professor's daughter Beatrice. He is horrified to discover the poisonous nature of the garden's beauty. Paz adapted the play from an 1844 short story by American writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], which was also entitled "[[Rappaccini's Daughter]]". He combined Hawthorne's story with sources from the Indian poet [[Vishakadatta]] and influences from Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, Spanish ''[[autos sacramentales]]'', and the poetry of [[William Butler Yeats]]. The play's opening performance was designed by the Mexican painter [[Leonora Carrington]]. In 1972, Surrealist author [[André Pieyre de Mandiargues]] translated the play into French as ''La fille de Rappaccini '' (Editions Mercure de France). First performed in English in 1996 at the [[Gate Theatre]] in London, the play was translated and directed by [[Sebastian Doggart]] and starred [[Sarah Alexander]] as Beatrice.

The Mexican composer Daniel Catán adapted the play as an opera in 1992.

Paz's other works translated into English include several volumes of essays, some of the more prominent of which are ''Alternating Current'' (tr. 1973), ''Configurations'' (tr. 1971), in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/lit/rep/pop.php?fnc=record&amp;lng=en_GB&amp;record=5821 Configurations], Historical Collection: UNESCO Culture Sector, [[UNESCO]] official website&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (tr. 1963), ''The Other Mexico'' (tr. 1972); and ''El Arco y la Lira'' (1956; tr. ''The Bow and the Lyre'', 1973). In the United States, [[Helen Lane]]'s translation of ''Alternating Current'' won a [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name=nba1974&gt;

There was a [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Translation|National Book Award category Translation]] from 1967 to 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with these are volumes of critical studies and biographies, including of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] (both, tr. 1970), and ''The Traps of Faith'', an analytical biography of [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]], the Mexican 17th-century nun, feminist poet, mathematician, and thinker.

His works include the poetry collections ''¿Águila o sol?'' (1951), ''La Estación Violenta'', (1956), ''Piedra de Sol'' (1957), and in English translation the most prominent include two volumes that include most of Paz in English: ''Early Poems: 1935–1955'' (tr. 1974), and ''Collected Poems, 1957–1987'' (1987). Many of these volumes have been edited and translated by [[Eliot Weinberger]], who is Paz's principal translator into American English.

==Political thought==
Originally Paz supported the Republicans during the [[Spanish Civil War]], but after learning of the murder of one of his friends by the Republicans, he became gradually disillusioned. While in Paris in the early 1950s, influenced by [[David Rousset]], [[André Breton]] and [[Albert Camus]], he started publishing his critical views on totalitarianism in general, and particularly against [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union.

In his magazines ''Plural'' and ''Vuelta'', Paz exposed the [[Human rights|violations of human rights]] in communist regimes, including [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuba]]. This brought him much animosity from sectors of the Latin American left. In the prologue to Volume IX of his complete works, Paz stated that from the time when he abandoned communist dogma, the mistrust of many in the Mexican [[intelligentsia]] started to transform into an intense and open enmity. Paz continued to consider himself a man of the left, the democratic, "liberal" left, not the dogmatic and illiberal one. He also criticized the Mexican government and leading party that dominated the nation for most of the 20th century.

Politically, Paz was basically a [[social democracy|social democrat]], who became increasingly supportive of liberal ideas without ever renouncing to his initial leftist and romantic views. In fact, Paz was "very slippery for anyone thinking in rigid ideological categories," Yvon Grenier wrote in his book on Paz's political thought. "Paz was simultaneously a romantic who spurned materialism and reason, a liberal who championed freedom and democracy, a conservative who respected tradition, and a socialist who lamented the withering of fraternity and equality. An advocate of fundamental transformation in the way we see ourselves and modern society, Paz was also a promoter of incremental change, not revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Yvon Grenier, ''From Art to Politics: Octavio Paz and the Pursuit of Freedom'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 1991); Spanish trans. ''Del arte a la política, Octavio Paz y la busquedad de la libertad'' (Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, during the aftermath of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin wall]], Paz and his ''Vuelta'' colleagues invited several of the world's writers and intellectuals to Mexico City to discuss the collapse of communism. Writers included [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], [[Daniel Bell]], [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[Jean-François Revel]], [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Jorge Edwards]] and [[Carlos Franqui]]. The encounter was called ''The experience of freedom'' (Spanish: ''La experiencia de la libertad'') and broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letraslibres.com/revista/convivio/memorias-del-encuentro-la-experiencia-de-la-libertad |title=Memorias del encuentro: "La experiencia de la libertad" |author=Christopher Domínguez Michael |date=November 2009 |work=Letras Libres (in Spanish)| accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paz criticized the Zapatista uprising in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Huffschmid (2004) pp127-151&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke broadly in favor of a "military solution" to the uprising of January 1994, and hoped that the "army would soon restore order in the region". With respect to President Zedillo's offensive in February 1995, he signed an open letter that described the offensive as a "legitimate government action" to reestablish the "sovereignty of the nation" and to bring "[[Chiapas]] peace and Mexicans tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Huffschmid (2004) p145&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First literary experiences ===
Paz was dazzled by ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]], in Enrique Munguia's translation as ''El Páramo'' which was published in the magazine ''Contemporaries'' in 1930. As a result of this, although he maintained his primary interest in poetry, he had an unavoidable outlook on prose: "Literally, this dual practice was for me a game of reflections between poetry and prose".

Worried about confirming the existence of a link between [[morals]] and [[poetry]], in 1931, at the age of 16, he wrote what would be his first published article, "Ethics of the Artist", where he planted the question about the duty of an artist among what would be deemed art of thesis, or pure art, which disqualifies the second as a result of the teaching of tradition. Assimilating a language that resembles a religious style and, paradoxically, a Marxist style, finds the true value of art in its purpose and meaning, for which, the followers of pure art, of which he's not one, are found in an isolated position and favor the kantiana idea of the "man that loses all relation with the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Paz|first= Octavio|author-link= |title= Primeras letras (1931–1943)|url = |access-date= |year= 1988|publisher= Vuelta|isbn = |editor = |location= |page= 114|language= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''Barandal'' appeared in August 1931, put together by [[Rafael López Malo]], Salvador Toscano, [[Arnulfo Martínez Lavalle]] and Octavio Paz. All of them were not yet in their youth except for Salvador Toscano, who was a renowned writer thanks to his parents. Rafael López participated in the magazine, "Modern" and, as well as [[Miguel D. Martínez Rendón]], in the [[movimiento de los agoristas]], although it was more commented on and known by the high school students, over all for his poem, "''The Golden Beast''". Octavio Paz Solórzano became known in his circle as the occasional author of literary narratives that appeared in the Sunday newspaper add-in [[El Universal (México)|El Universal]], as well as [[Ireneo Paz]] which was the name that gave a street in [[Mixcoac]] identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">"'''On the Pathos of Truth'''" ([[German language|German]]: ''Über das Pathos der Wahrheit'') is a short essay by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] concerning the motivation of [[philosopher]]s to seek [[knowledge]] as an [[end in itself]].  Nietzsche identifies this motivation with [[pride]].&lt;ref name=wilkinson2006p101&gt;Wilkinson, Dale, ''Nietzsche and the Greeks'' ([[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2006), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  On this point the essay prefigures theories concerning a destructive "will to truth" that Nietzsche discusses in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Stack1983p53&gt;Stack, George J., ''Lange and Nietzsche'' ([[Walter de Gruyter]], 1983), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an illustration of a motivated seeker of truth, Nietzsche takes [[Heraclitus]], although he also discusses [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]].&lt;ref name=Stack1983p53 /&gt;  He recounts Heraclitus as being psychologically distant from other people, due to being aware of truth while others are not:&lt;ref name=Berry2013p93&gt;Berry, Jessica N., "Nietzsche and the Greeks" in Gemes &amp; Richardson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2013), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|"...no one will be able to imagine such regal self-esteem, such boundless conviction that one is the sole fortunate wooer of truth.  Men of this sort live within their own solar system, and that is where they must be sought....Such a being might seem more comprehensible in a remote shrine, among images of the gods and amidst cold, sublime architecture."}}

Nietzsche's focus is on the psychology and social life of the philosopher, identifying [[misanthropy]] and [[seclusion]] as the result of being motivated toward knowledge itself, regardless of any features of the philosopher's [[cosmology]], [[physics]], or [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name=Berry2013p93 /&gt;

Nietzsche concludes the essay by identifying a need to have [[art]] along with knowledge.   Art is necessary because it adds [[emotion]] and [[purpose]] to society. Knowledge is limited; for example, a knowledge of matter and motion will not reveal any purpose in the universe.  While the motivation for knowledge in itself brings about insights which help society, art allows constant variation which can affirm a sense a purposiveness, which is an emotional need of individuals.&lt;ref name=wilkinson2006p101 /&gt;

"On the Pathos of Truth" was written in 1872, and was intended to be a [[preface]] or [[foreword]], but no book was ever written to follow it.  Nietzsche, however, did collect it, along with four other such prefaces to unwritten books, and gave the edition to [[Cosima Wagner]] as a [[Christmas]] present.&lt;ref&gt;See the back cover of Nietzsche, ''Prefaces to Unwritten Works'', edited by Michael W. Grenke (St. Augustine's Press, 2005), which reproduces all of these prefaces.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peace News''''' ('''''PN''''') is a [[pacifist]] magazine first published on 6 June 1936 to serve the peace movement in the [[United Kingdom]]. From later in 1936 to April 1961 it was the official paper of the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU), and from 1990 to 2004 was co-published with [[War Resisters' International]].

==History==
===Founding and early days===
''Peace News'' was begun by [[Humphrey Moore]] who was a [[Quaker]] and in 1933 had become editor of the [[National Peace Council]]'s publications. Working with a peace group in [[Wood Green]], London, Moore and his wife, Kathleen (playing the role of business manager), launched ''Peace News'' with a free trial issue in June 1936. With distribution through Moore’s contacts with the National Peace Council, the new magazine rapidly attracted attention. Within six weeks, [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]], founder of the Peace Pledge Union, proposed to Moore that ''Peace News'' should become the PPU’s paper.&lt;ref name=HumphreyMoore&gt;Harry Mister, [http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2395/pn239525.htm "Humphrey Moore 1909-1995"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181545/http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2395/pn239525.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}, ''Peace News'' No. 2395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;Harry Mister and Stephen Moore, "Brave Fighter for Peace" (obituary of Humphrey Moore). ''The Guardian'', September 1995, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Early contributors to this new organ of the PPU included [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[George Lansbury]], and illustrator [[Arthur Wragg]].&lt;ref name="hm" /&gt; ''Peace News'' also had a large number of women contributors, including [[Vera Brittain]], [[Storm Jameson]], [[Rose Macaulay]], [[Ethel Mannin]], [[Ruth Fry]], [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] and [[Sybil Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gail Chester and Andrew Rigby, ''Articles of Peace: Celebrating Fifty Years of Peace News''. Prism, 1986, pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contributors were so sympathetic to the grievances of [[Nazi Germany]] that one sceptical  member found it difficult to distinguish between letters to ''Peace News'' and those in the newspaper of the [[British Union of Fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank McDonough, ''Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement, and the British Road to War'', Manchester University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Mark Gilbert (historian)|Mark Gilbert]] has argued that "With the exception of ''Action'', the journal of the British Union of Fascists, it is hard to think of another British newspaper which was so consistent an apologist for Nazi Germany as ''Peace News''."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gilbert, "Pacifist attitudes to Nazi Germany, 1936-45", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', January 1992, Vol. 27, pp. 493-511.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Juliet Gardiner has noted that ''Peace News'' also urged the British government to give sanctuary to [[Jewish]] refugees from Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Juilet Gardiner, ''The Thirties: An Intimate History''. HarperPress, 2010, p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that some PN contributors were supporting appeasement and excusing Nazi actions caused PN contributor [[David Spreckley]] to express fears that "in their scramble for peace", they were gaining  "some questionable allies".&lt;ref&gt;Peace News, 10 November 1939 (p. 9), quoted in Martin Ceadel, ''Semi-Detached Idealists:the British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'' Oxford University Press, 2000 (p. 398).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of ''Peace News'' peaked at around 40,000 during the so-called [[Phoney War]] between September 1939 and May 1940. In that month in the face of demands in parliament for the banning of the paper, the printer and distributors stopped working with ''Peace News''. However, with help from the typographer [[Eric Gill]], [[Hugh Brock]] and many others, Moore continued to publish ''Peace News'' and arrange for distribution around the UK.&lt;ref name=HumphreyMoore/&gt;

Humphrey Moore’s emphasis on ''Peace News'' having a single-minded anti-war policy was increasingly being challenged. Others wanted greater emphasis on building a peaceful society once hostilities ended. In 1940 the PPU asked Moore to step aside in the post of assistant editor (which post he held until 1944), and appointed [[John Middleton Murry]] as editor.&lt;ref name=Encyc&gt;"Peace News" in Peter Barberis, John McHugh &amp; Mike Tyldesley (eds), ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''. Continuum, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8264-5814-9}} (p. 344).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1946 Murry had abandoned pacifism and resigned.

[[Hugh Brock]] took on the role of assistant editor of Peace News in 1946 and became editor in 1955, lasting until 1964. During his period of tenure the magazine separated from the PPU as it had widened its focus into areas not directly related to absolute pacifism.&lt;ref name=Encyc/&gt; ''Peace News'' in the 1940s published material from American journalist [[Dwight Macdonald]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Radical Chapters: Pacifist Bookseller Roy Kepler and the Paperback Revolution''.Syracuse University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|0815610068}} (p. 84).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Cranston]] (later to become a noted philosopher).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-maurice-cranston-1503237.html Obituary:Professor Maurice Cranston] Alan Eden-Green, ''The Independent'', 10 November 1993. Retrieved 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1940s on, ''Peace News'' began to take a strongly critical line towards British rule in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Howe, ''Anticolonialism in British politics: The Left and the End of Empire, 1918-1964'', Clarendon Press, 1993, pp. 206, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also established links with African [[anti-colonial]] activists [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Kenneth Kaunda]], and "''Peace News''′ close involvement with the [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] struggle...led to the banning of the paper in South Africa in 1959".&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, ''Peace News'' contributors included such noted activists as [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]], [[Martin Niemöller]], [[Fenner Brockway]], [[A. J. Muste]], [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard B. Gregg]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Donald Soper, Baron Soper|Donald Soper]], [[Michael Scott (activist)|Michael Scott]], [[Leslie Hall (politician)|Leslie Hall]], M.P., [[Muriel Lester]], [[Emrys Hughes]], M.P., [[Wilfred Wellock]],&lt;ref&gt;"Peace News-the World Pacifist Weekly" (Advertisement on back cover of pamphlet ''NATO: A Critical Examination of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation'', by Roy Sherwood, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Esmé Wynne-Tyson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959 to 1969===

In 1959 a gift of £5,700 from Tom Willis enabled ''Peace News'' to buy 5 [[Caledonian Road, London|Caledonian Road]], London, N1. This became its office and printing press and was also shared with [[Laurence Housman#Housmans Bookshop|Housmans Bookshop]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Willis and Emily Johns, [http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2516/25160302.html "The man who made it all possible"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181618/http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2516/25160302.html |date=27 September 2011 }}, ''Peace News'', No. 2516.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the ''Peace News'' office that the Nuclear Disarmament/Peace symbol was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/ed/cnd_sym.html CND-The disarmament symbol]&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the British pacifist tradition in the 1950s, [[David Widgery]] wrote "at its most likeable it was the sombre decency of ''Peace News'', then a [[vegetarian]] tabloid with a [[Quaker]] emphasis on active witness".&lt;ref&gt;David Widgery, "Don't You Hear The H-Bomb's Thunder?" in ''The Left in Britain'', Penguin, 1976 (p. 100).&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine campaigned against [[nuclear weapons]], often working with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Brock brought to ''Peace News'' "a staff of writer-activists committed to developing [[Gandhian]] [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] action in the anti-militarist cause", including [[Pat Arrowsmith]], [[Richard Boston]], [[April Carter]], [[Alan Lovell]], [[Michael Randle]], [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and the American [[Gene Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Brock's successor in 1964 was [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. S. Taylor, ''Against the Bomb: the British Peace Movement, 1958-1965''. Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 118, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a Caribbean Quaker and ''PN'' writer, [[Marion Glean]], "contributed to a series of statements by [[post-colonial]] activists on 'race' in the run-up to the 1964 election, published by Theodore Roszak, editor of ''Peace News''."&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;Kalbir Shukra, ''The Changing Pattern of Black Politics in Britain''. Pluto Press, 1998, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Ramdin, ''The Making of the Black Working Class'', Gower, 1987, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Glean helped bring together several activists, including [[David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead|David Pitt]], [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Ranjana Ash]] to form the [[Campaign Against Racial Discrimination]].&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt; Throughout the 1960s, ''Peace News'' covered issues such as opposition to the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] and the Biafran issue in the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. The magazine's coverage of the Vietnam War was notable for its support for the protests of the [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhists]], who it argued could become a nonviolent "Third Force" independent of both the Saigon and Hanoi governments.&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peace News'' also ran lengthy analysis of left-wing thinkers, including [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson's]] two-part study of [[C. Wright Mills]]&lt;ref&gt;“C. Wright Mills: The Responsible Craftsman”, ''Peace News'' 22 November 1963 and 29 November 1963. Reprinted in slightly different form in Thompsons' ''The Heavy Dancers'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and Theodore Roszak's assessment of [[Lewis Mumford]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roszak, "Mumford and the Megamachine", ''Peace News'', 29 December 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970 to 2014===

In 1971 it added to its masthead the words "for nonviolent revolution".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1974, the paper moved its main office to Nottingham, where it remained until 1990.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1978, one worker at Housmans was injured after a bomb was sent to the ''Peace News'' offices, (allegedly by the [[neo-Nazi]] organisation [[Column 88]]) as part of a series of attacks on left-wing organisations (similar attacks were made on the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] and [[Anti-Nazi League]] offices before this occurred).&lt;ref&gt;"Bomb Explodes At Peace News", ''Irish Times'', 5 July 1978, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peace News'' suspended publication at the end of 1987, intending to relaunch after a period of rethinking and planning. In May 1989 the paper resumed publication, but quickly ran into financial difficulties. In 1990 it became linked to [[War Resisters' International]] and was co-published as a monthly until 1999, then as a quarterly with a British-oriented ''Nonviolent Action'' published in the intervening months. ''Peace News'' came out strongly [[Criticism of the Iraq War|against the Iraq War]] while at the same time condemning [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;"...here it becomes important to make the distinction between one man and his military cronies and a population of 22.5 million people. Unless proven otherwise, all people are our allies. And just because you don't want to see 22.5 million people have their basic infrastructure bombed, or see the poor conscripts being massacred, doesn't mean you support Saddam."

Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Peace News'' resumed monthly publication, as an independent British publication and in a tabloid format.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In June 2014, ''Peace News'' ran an article calling for a "Yes" vote in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish Independence Referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://peacenews.info/node/7672/yes-independence Yes To Independence"], Pete Ramand and James Foley.

===Present day===
''Peace News'' continues to be published in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] size print media and as a website by Peace News Ltd. It describes its editorial objectives as: to support and connect nonviolent and anti-militarist movements; provide a forum for such movements to develop common perspectives; take up issues suitable for campaigning; promote nonviolent, antimilitarist and pacifist analyses and strategies; stimulate thinking about the revolutionary implications of nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/info/about/editorial_objectives.html peace News Editorial policy], ''Peace News'' website.

[[Tony Benn]] has described ''Peace News'' as " a paper that gives us hope...(it) should be widely read".&lt;ref&gt;Benn quoted in ''Housmans Peace Diary 2012'', Housmans Bookshop, 2012, {{ISBN|9780852832714}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns and trials==

''Peace News'' has been associated with initiating numerous campaigns, and a number of its staffmembers have been arrested for taking part in peace actions. In November 1957 Hugh Brock was one of three founders of the [[Direct Action Committee]] Against Nuclear War, which was run from the ''Peace News'' office and involved  many ''Peace News'' staff. The DAC produced the first badges with the Nuclear Disarmament/Peace symbol,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The CND symbol | work = Hugh Brock Papers | url = http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/cwlhbp.php | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090722095242/http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/cwlhbp.php | archivedate = 22 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organised various actions of civil disobedience against nuclear weapons and also the first of the [[Aldermaston Marches]] in Easter 1958.

In 1971 ''Peace News'', together with [[War Resisters' International]], initiated a nonviolent direct action project, [[Operation Omega to Bangladesh]], to challenge the Pakistani military blockade of then [[East Pakistan]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In the same year ''Peace News'' criticised the attempt to ban the sex education book ''[[The Little Red Schoolbook]]'', and reprinted extensive extracts from the publication in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;D. Limond, ''The UK Edition of The Little Red Schoolbook: A paper tiger reflects'', ''Sex Education'', 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 ''Peace News'' co-editor [[Howard Clark (pacifist)|Howard Clark]], after meeting activists from the [[Greenpeace Canada|Canadian Greenpeace]] boats, initiated the group that became [[London Greenpeace]], at first campaigning against French nuclear tests.

In 1973 ''Peace News'' played a central role in launching the [[British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign]] (BWNIC) and in supporting the "BWNIC 14", fourteen activists, including a member of the ''Peace News'' collective, charged with "conspiracy to incite disaffection" via a leaflet "Some Information for Discontented Soldiers". After an 11-week trial, a jury acquitted the BWNIC 14 in 1975, although two members of ''Peace News'' collective were fined for helping two AWOL soldiers go to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;"British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign"
in ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'' by Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley. London : Continuum, 2005,{{ISBN|0-8264-5814-9}} (p.330).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, together with [[Nicholas Albery]] of [[BIT (alternative information centre)|BIT]] Information Service, ''Peace News'' began publishing the [[Community Levy for Alternative Projects]], an invitation to supply funds for, generally, fledgling alternative projects, partly targeting shops and businesses that identified with counter-cultural ideas and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Shipley,''Revolutionaries in Modern Britain'', Bodley Head,
1976, (p. 203)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1974, ''Peace News'' published a special edition revealing and printing in full Colonel [[David Stirling]]'s plans to establish
a strike-breaking "private army", "Great Britain 1975". By arrangement ''[[The Guardian]]'' led with this story on the day of publication, ''Peace News'' won the 1974 "Scoop of the Year" award from  [[Granada Television]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester and Rigby, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Dorril]] and Robin Ramsey, 
''Smear! Wilson and the Secret State'', Fourth Estate, 1991, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, ''Peace News'', together with ''[[The Leveller]]'' magazine revealed the identity of [[Colonel B]], a witness in the [[ABC Trial]]. ''Peace News'' fought its conviction for "contempt of court" right up to appeal in the House of Lords, where the Lord Chief Justice's "guilty" verdict was finally overturned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacenews.info/issues/2474/chronology.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, ''Peace News'', together with [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]], was sued for libel by the Covert &amp; Operational Procurement Exhibition (COPEX) for repeating allegations that the exhibition was serving as a meeting place for buyers and sellers of torture implements. The High Court struck out the case when COPEX failed to show in court and the peace groups were awarded costs.
&lt;ref&gt;"In 1995/96, PN successfully fought off a libel case brought by COPEX, a British high tech and arms exhibition organiser."

{{Renaissance}}
{{histphil}}
The designation "'''Renaissance philosophy'''" is used by scholars of [[History of ideas|intellectual history]] to refer to the thought of the period running in Europe roughly between 1355 and 1650 (the dates shift forward for central and northern Europe and for areas such as Spanish America, India, Japan, and China under European influence). It therefore overlaps both with late [[medieval philosophy]], which in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was influenced by notable figures such as [[Albert the Great]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[William of Ockham]], and [[Marsilius of Padua]], and early modern philosophy, which conventionally starts with [[René Descartes]] and his publication of the ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' in 1637. Philosophers usually divide the period less finely, jumping from medieval to early modern philosophy, on the assumption that no radical shifts in perspective took place in the centuries immediately before Descartes. Intellectual historians, however, take into considerations factors such as sources, approaches, audience, language, and literary genres in addition to ideas. This article reviews both the changes in context and content of [[Renaissance]] philosophy and its remarkable continuities with the past.

== Continuities ==
The structure, sources, method, and topics of philosophy in the Renaissance had much in common with those of previous centuries.

=== Structure of philosophy ===
Particularly since the recovery of a great portion of Aristotelian writings in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it became clear that, in addition to Aristotle's writings on logic, which had already been known, there were numerous others roughly having to do with natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. These areas provided the structure for the philosophy curriculum of the emerging universities. The general assumption was that the most 'scientific' branches of philosophy were those that were more theoretical and therefore more widely applicable. During the Renaissance too, many thinkers saw these as the main philosophical areas, with logic providing a training of the mind to approach the other three.

=== Sources of philosophy ===
A similar continuity can be seen in the case of sources. Although Aristotle was never an unquestioned authority&lt;ref&gt;Luca Bianchi, '“Aristotele fu un uomo e poté errare”: sulle origini medievali della critica al “principio di autorità”', in idem, ''Studi sull'aristotelismo del Rinascimento'' (Padua: Il Poligrafo, 2003), pp. 101–24.&lt;/ref&gt; (he was more often than not a springboard for discussion, and his opinions were often discussed along those of others, or the teaching of Holy Scripture), medieval lectures in physics consisted of reading Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', lessons in moral philosophy consisted of examinations of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (and often his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''), and metaphysics was approached through his ''Metaphysics''. The assumption that Aristotle's works were foundational to an understanding of philosophy did not wane during the Renaissance, which saw a flourishing of new translations, commentaries, and other interpretations of his works, both in Latin and in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt, ''Aristotle and the Renaissance'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of method, philosophy was considered during the late Middle Ages as a subject that required robust enquiry on the part of people trained in the subject's technical vocabulary. Philosophical texts and problems were typically approached through university lectures and 'questions'. The latter, similar in some ways to modern debates, examined the pros and cons of particular philosophical positions or interpretations. They were one of the cornerstones of the '[[scholarly method|scholastic method]]', made students who proposed or responded to questions quick on their feet, and required a deep familiarity with all of the known philosophical tradition, which would often be invoked in support of or against specific arguments. This style of philosophy continued to have a strong following in the Renaissance. Pico della Mirandola's ''Disputations'', for instance, depended directly on this tradition, which was not at all limited to university lecture halls.

=== Topics in philosophy ===
Given the remarkable range of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], it was possible to discuss all kinds of issues in medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Aristotle had treated directly problems such as the trajectory of missiles, the habits of animals, how knowledge is acquired, the freedom of the will, how virtue is connected with happiness, the relationship of the lunar and the sublunar worlds. Indirectly he had stimulated discussion on two points that were particularly of concern to Christians: the immortality of the soul and the eternity of the world. All of these continued to be of considerable interest to Renaissance thinkers, but we shall see that in some cases the solutions offered were significantly different because of changing cultural and religious landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Helpful if weighty guides to philosophical topics in the period are ''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy'', ed. by Norman Kretzman et al., and ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', ed. by Charles B. Schmitt et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinuities ==
Having established that many aspects of philosophy were held in common during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it will now be useful to discuss in what areas changes were afoot. The same outline as above will be used, to show that within trends of continuity one can also find surprising differences.

=== Sources of philosophy ===
It is therefore useful to reconsider what was mentioned above about philosophical sources. The Renaissance saw a significant broadening of source material. Plato, known directly only through two and a half dialogues in the Middle Ages, came to be known through numerous Latin translations in fifteenth century Italy, culminating in the hugely influential translation of his complete works by Marsilio Ficino in Florence in 1484.&lt;ref&gt;James Hankins, ''Plato in the Italian Renaissance'', 2 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1990, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Petrarch]] was not able to read Plato directly, but he greatly admired him. Petrarch was also a great admirer of Roman poets such as Virgil and Horace and of Cicero for Latin prose writing.  Not all humanists followed his example in all things, but Petrarch contributed to a broadening of his time's 'canon' (pagan poetry had previously been considered frivolous and dangerous), something that happened in philosophy as well. In the sixteenth century anyone who considered himself 'au fait' read Plato as well as Aristotle, trying as much as possible (and not always very successfully) to reconcile the two with each other and with Christianity. This is probably the main reason why [[Donato Acciaiuoli|Donato Acciaiuoli's]] commentary on Aristotle's Ethics (first published in 1478) was so successful: it blended the three traditions beautifully. Other movements from ancient philosophy also re-entered the mainstream. This was never really the case for Epicureanism, which was almost always caricatured and considered with suspicion, but Scepticism and Pyrrhonism did make a comeback thanks to writers like [[Michel Montaigne]], and the movement of Stoicism made an impressive re-appearance in the writings of [[Justus Lipsius]].&lt;ref&gt;On the melding of various traditions in moral philosophy see especially Jill Kraye, 'Moral Philosophy', in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these cases it is impossible to separate the pagan philosophical doctrines from the Christian filter through which they were approached and made legitimate.

=== Structure of philosophy ===
While generally the Aristotelian structure of the branches of philosophy stayed in place, interesting developments and tensions were taking place within them. In moral philosophy, for instance, a position consistently held by Thomas Aquinas and his numerous followers was that its three subfields (ethics, economics, politics) were related to progressively wider spheres (the individual, the family and the community). Politics, Thomas thought, is more important than ethics because it considers the good of the greater number. This position came under increasing strain in the Renaissance, as various thinkers claimed that Thomas's classifications were inaccurate, and that ethics were the most important part of morality.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Lines, ''Aristotle's 'Ethics' in the Italian Renaissance (ca. 1300-1650): The Universities and the Problem of Moral Education'' (Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 271-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures, such as [[Francesco Petrarca]] (Petrarch) (1304-1374), questioned the whole assumption that the theoretical aspects of philosophy were the more important ones. He insisted, for instance, on the value of the practical aspects of ethics. Petrarch's position, expressed both strongly and amusingly in his invective ''On His Own Ignorance and That of Many Others'' (''De sui ipsius ac multorum ignorantia'') is also important for another reason: it represents the conviction that philosophy should let itself be guided by rhetoric, that the purpose of philosophy is therefore not so much to reveal the truth, but to encourage people to pursue the good. This perspective, so typical of Italian humanism, could easily lead to reducing all philosophy to ethics, in a move reminiscent of Plato's Socrates and of Cicero.

=== Method of philosophy ===
If, as mentioned above, [[scholasticism]] continued to flourish, the Italian humanists (i.e., lovers and practitioners of the humanities) challenged its supremacy. As we have seen, they believed that philosophy could be brought under the wing of rhetoric. They also thought that the scholarly discourse of their time needed to return to the elegance and precision of its classical models. They therefore tried dressing philosophy in a more appealing garb than had their predecessors, whose translations and commentaries were in technical Latin and sometimes simply transliterated the Greek. In 1416/1417 Leonardo Bruni, the pre-eminent [[renaissance humanism|humanist]] of his time and chancellor of Florence, re-translated Aristotle's ''Ethics'' into a more flowing, idiomatic and classical Latin. He hoped to communicate the elegance of Aristotle's Greek while also making the text more accessible to those without a philosophical education. Others, including Nicolò Tignosi in Florence around 1460, and the Frenchman Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples in Paris in the 1490s, tried to please the humanists either by including in their commentaries on Aristotle appealing historical examples or quotations from poetry, or by avoiding the standard scholastic format of questions, or both. The driving conviction was that philosophy should be freed of its technical jargon so that more people would be able to read it. At the same time, all kinds of summaries, paraphrases, and dialogues dealing with philosophical issues were prepared, in order to give their topics a wider dissemination. Humanists also encouraged the study of Aristotle and other writers of antiquity in the original. [[Desiderius Erasmus]], the great Dutch humanist, even prepared a Greek edition of Aristotle, and eventually those teaching philosophy in the universities had to at least pretend that they knew Greek. Humanists were not, however, great fans of the vernacular. There is only a handful of examples of dialogues or translations of Aristotle's works into Italian during the fifteenth century. Once it had been determined, however, that Italian was a language with literary merit and that it could carry the weight of philosophical discussion, numerous efforts in this direction started to appear, particularly from the 1540s onward. Alessandro Piccolomini had a programme to translate or paraphrase the entire Aristotelian corpus into the vernacular. Other important figures were Benedetto Varchi, Bernardo Segni and Giambattista Gelli, all of them active in Florence. Efforts got underway to present Plato's doctrines in the vernacular as well. This rise of vernacular philosophy, which quite predated the Cartesian approach, is a new field of research whose contours are only now beginning to be clarified.&lt;ref&gt;For now see Luca Bianchi, 'Per una storia dell'aristotelismo “volgare” nel Rinascimento: problemi e prospettive di ricerca', ''Bruniana &amp; Campanelliana'', 15.2 (2009), 367-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topics in philosophy ===
It is very hard to generalize about the ways in which discussions of philosophical topics shifted in the Renaissance, mainly because to do so requires a detailed map of the period, something we do not yet have. We know that debates about the [[free will|freedom of the will]] continued to flare up (for instance, in the famous exchanges between [[Erasmus]] and [[Martin Luther]]), that Spanish thinkers were increasingly obsessed with the notion of nobility, that duelling was a practice that generated a large literature in the sixteenth century (was it permissible or not?).

Earlier histories gave perhaps undue attention to [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]'s pronouncements on the immortality of the soul as a question that could not be resolved philosophically in a way consistent with Christianity, or to Pico della Mirandola's ''Oration'' on the dignity of man, as if these were signals of the period's increasing secularism or even atheism. In fact, the most successful compendium of natural philosophy in the period (''Compendium philosophiae naturalis'', first published in 1530) was authored by Frans Titelmans, a Franciscan friar from the Low Countries whose work has a very strong religious flavour.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Lines, 'Teaching Physics in Louvain and Bologna: Frans Titelmans and Ulisse Aldrovandi', in ''Scholarly Knowledge: Textbooks in Early Modern Europe'', ed. by Emidio Campi, Simone De Angelis, Anja-Silvia Goeing, Anthony T. Grafton in cooperation with Rita Casale, Jürgen Oelkers and Daniel Tröhler (Geneva: Droz, 2008), 183–203.&lt;/ref&gt; We must not forget that most philosophers of the time were at least nominal, if not devout, Christians, that the sixteenth century saw both the Protestant and the Catholic reformations, and that Renaissance philosophy culminates with the period of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). In other words, religion had a massive importance in the period, and one can hardly study philosophy without remembering this.

This is true among others for the philosophy of [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499), who reinterpreted Plato in the light of his early Greek commentators and also of Christianity. Ficino hoped that a purified philosophy would bring about a religious renewal in his society and therefore transformed distasteful aspects of Platonic philosophy (for instance, the homosexual love exalted in the Symposium) into spiritual love (i.e., [[Platonic love]]), something later transformed by Pietro Bembo and Baldassar Castiglione in the early sixteenth century as something also applicable to relationships between men and women. Ficino and his followers also had an interest in 'hidden knowledge', mainly because of his belief that all of ancient knowledge was interconnected (Moses, for instance, had received his insights from the Greeks, who in turn had received them from others, all according to God's plan and therefore mutually consistent; [[Hermeticism]] is relevant here). Although Ficino's interest in and practice of astrology was not uncommon in his time, one should not necessarily associate it with philosophy, as the two were usually considered to be quite separate and often in contradiction with each other.

In conclusion, like any other moment in the history of thought Renaissance philosophy cannot be considered to have provided something entirely new nor to have continued for centuries to repeat the conclusions of its predecessors. Historians call this period the 'Renaissance' in order to indicate the rebirth that took place of ancient (particularly classical) perspectives, sources, attitudes toward literature and the arts. At the same time, we realize that every reappropriation is constrained and even guided by contemporary concerns and biases. It was no different for the period considered here: the old was mixed with and changed by the new, but while no claims can be made for a revolutionary new starting point in philosophy, in many ways the synthesis of Christianity, Aristotelianism, and Platonism offered by [[Thomas Aquinas]] was torn apart in order to make way for a new one, based on more complete and varied sources, often in the original, and certainly attuned to new social and religious realities and a much broader public.

'''Sergio Eduardo Stuparich Clementi''' (born December 14, 1943) is a [[Chile]]an author and philosopher descending from Italian immigrants from the Adriatic island of [[Lussin]], [[Croatia]].

==Biography and career==

Stuparich was born and raised in the capital Santiago. An alumni at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and the [[University of Chile]], he worked as a philosophy teacher at Santiago University of Technology (now [[University of Santiago, Chile | Usach]]) before the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état | 1973 military coup]]. At the same time, he was active in the Socialist Party and was therefore forced to put himself in safety at Italy's embassy when the military took over &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/28047774@N04/23727925636 "Roberto Kozak con refugiados en la embajada de Italia"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camacho Padilla, Jorge.

In the meantime, he wrote the novel ''Chile: Comprometerse con una clase'', which was published later in exile.

After 1973, Stuparich was exiled in Italy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20150604/54432071315/bachelet-recuerda-en-roma-a-chilenos-exiliados-en-italia-durante-la-dictadura.html "Bachelet recuerda en Roma a chilenos exiliados en Italia durante la dictadura"], ''[[La Vanguardia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;, where he continued to teach and obtained a PhD qualification, Dottore in Filosofia from the [[University of Turin]]. He eventually came to live in [[Sweden]].

During his time in Sweden, Sergio Stuparich undertook research at the Master level in Theoretical Philosophy at [[Lund University]]. He also produced the selection of the anthology ''Uppbrott'' (1982) and ''Vote from Latin America'' (1986), followed by books on Philosophy, ''Del Homo al Hombre'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://niramarteditorial.espacioniram.com/?s=stuparich&amp;searchsubmit= "Editorial NIRAM Art"]&lt;/ref&gt; (2011) and ''El Pensamiento del Siglo XXI'' (2012), and two memoirs, ''La Guarida'' (2008) and ''Exilio Italiano'' (2016). 
 
He is now residing in [[Malmö]], Sweden.

The '''''Siribhoovalaya''''' ({{lang-kn|ಸಿರಿಭೂವಲಯ}}) is a work of multi-lingual [[Kannada literature|literature]] written by [[Kumudendu Muni]], a [[Jainism|Jain]] [[monk]]. The work is unique in that it employs not alphabets, but is composed entirely in [[Kannada script#Numbers|Kannada numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.pustakshakti.com/siribhoovalaya_news_item_-_17.htm|title= Introduction to '''Siribhoovalaya''', from Deccan Herald|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065505/http://www.pustakshakti.com/siribhoovalaya_news_item_-_17.htm|archivedate= 28 September 2007|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Saangathya'' [[meter (poetry)|metre]] of [[Kannada poetry]] is employed in the work. It uses numerals 1 through 64 and employs various patterns or ''bandhas'' in a frame of 729 (27×27) squares to represent alphabets in nearly 18 scripts and over 700 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.pustakshakti.com/siribhoovalaya_news_item_-_6.htm|title= Usage of ''Saangathya'' and frame of 729, from The Hindu newspaper|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065432/http://www.pustakshakti.com/siribhoovalaya_news_item_-_6.htm|archivedate= 28 September 2007|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the patterns used include the ''Chakrabandha'', ''Hamsabandha'', ''Varapadmabandha'', ''Sagarabandha'', ''Sarasabandha'', ''Kruanchabandha'', ''Mayurabandha'', ''Ramapadabandha'', ''Nakhabandha'', etc. As each of these patterns are identified and decoded, the contents can be read.

The work is said to have around 600,000 verses, nearly 6 times as big as the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Totally there are 26 chapters constituting it a big volume of which only three have been decoded.The author expounds that many philosophies which existed in the Jain classics are eloquently and skillfully interpreted in the work.  It is also claimed to consist of works in several languages including [[Sanskrit]], Marathi, Telugu, Tamil,  [[Prakrit]], etc., apart from [[Kannada]]. Different languages can be realised by assigning different alphabets to different numbers.

It is also believed to contain valuable information about various sciences including  [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[history]], [[spaceflight|space travel]], etc. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, has claimed that the work contains instructions for travel in water and space travel. It is also said that the work contains information about the production of modern weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pustakshakti.com/prod02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206222031/http://www.pustakshakti.com/prod02.htm |archivedate= 6 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though written in Kannada its numerical enunciation enables the people of other languages to comprehend it.

==Author==
The work is attributed to Jain bolis [[Kumudendu Muni]]. He claims that he was guru of amoghavarsha of Manyakheta and a disciple of virasena and jinasena of Dhavala. However, not much is known about this monk. Scholars are divided about when he lived. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, claims that the work may have been composed around 800 AD. Dr Venkatachala Sastry, however, dates him and his work to the 15th century. He also claims that Kumudendu Muni belonged to a village called Yalavalli near Nandidurga in Chikkaballapura Taluk in Kolar district. He further dates the work to around the 1550-1600 period and suggests it might be even more recent.

There are 16,000 ''chakras'' in all. Out of which only 1,270 chakras are available. There are 9 khanda's in all. The available 1270 chakra"s belong to Prathama khanda (I)called Mangala Prabhruta. (This is only a syllabus of the Siri Bhoovalaya which contains 59 chapters). Remaining 8 Khanda's work not available. The number of letters (in the form numerals) used are 14 [[lakhs]]. It has been claimed that it is possible to decipher 6 lakh Shlokas or verses.

Since no contemporary [[pandit]] is conversant with the esoteric metres employed in the work, the work of deciphering is being done with the help of computers. The whereabouts of remaining chakra's (16,000 - 1,270) = 14,730 are not known.

In [[logic]], a '''slingshot argument''' is one of a group of [[logical argument|argument]]s claiming to show that all [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s stand for the same thing.

This type of argument was dubbed the "[[slingshot]]" by [[philosopher]]s [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (1981) due to its disarming simplicity.  It is usually said that versions of the slingshot argument have been given by [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Alonzo Church]], [[W. V. Quine]], and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. However, it has been disputed by [[Lorenz Krüger]] (1995) that there is much unity in this tradition. Moreover, Krüger rejects Davidson's claim that the argument can refute the correspondence theory of [[truth]]. [[Stephen Neale]] (1995) claims, controversially, that the most compelling version was suggested by [[Kurt Gödel]] (1944).

These arguments are sometimes modified to support the alternative, and evidently stronger, conclusion that there is only one  ''[[fact]]'', or one true ''[[proposition]]'', ''[[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]'', ''[[truth condition]]'', ''[[truthmaker]]'', and so on.

==The argument==
One version of the argument (Perry 1996) proceeds as follows.

'''Assumptions''':
# '''Substitution'''.  If two terms designate the same thing, then substituting one for another in a sentence does not change the designation of that sentence.
# '''Redistribution'''.  Rearranging the parts of a sentence does not change the designation of that sentence, provided the truth conditions of the sentence do not change.
# Every sentence is equivalent to a sentence of the form ''F''(''a'').   In other words, every sentence has the same designation as some sentence that attributes a property to something.  (For example, "All men are mortal" is equivalent to "The number 1 has the property of being such that all men are mortal".)
# For any two objects there is a relation that holds uniquely between them.  (For example, if the objects in question are denoted by "''a''" and "''b''", the relation in question might be ''R''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), which is stipulated to hold just in case ''x'' = ''a'' and ''y'' = ''b''.)

Let ''S'' and ''T'' be arbitrary true sentences, designating ''Des''(''S'') and ''Des''(''T''), respectively.  (No assumptions are made about what kinds of things ''Des''(''S'') and ''Des''(''T'') are.)  It is now shown by a series of designation-preserving transformations that ''Des''(''S'') = ''Des''(''T'').  Here, "&lt;math&gt;\iota x&lt;/math&gt;" can be read as "the ''x'' such that".

{| align=center
|-
| 1.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;||
|-
| 2.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;\phi (a)&lt;/math&gt;||assumption 3
|-
| 3.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;a = \iota x (\phi (x) \land x=a)&lt;/math&gt;||redistribution
|-
| 4.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;a = \iota x (\pi (x,b) \land x=a)&lt;/math&gt;||substitution, assumption 4
|-
| 5.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;\pi (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;||redistribution
|-
| 6.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt; b = \iota x (\pi (a,x) \land x=b ) &lt;/math&gt;||redistribution
|-
| 7.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt; b = \iota x (\psi (x) \land x=b  )&lt;/math&gt;||substitution, assumption 3
|-
| 8.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt; \psi (b)&lt;/math&gt;||redistribution
|-
| 9.||style="padding-right:1em"|&lt;math&gt;T  &lt;/math&gt;||assumption 3
|}

Note that (1)-(9) is not a derivation of ''T'' from ''S''.  Rather, it is a series of (allegedly) designation-preserving transformation steps.

==Responses to the argument==

As Gödel (1944) observed, the slingshot argument does not go through if [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous account of [[definite description]]s is assumed.  Russell claimed that the proper logical interpretation of a sentence of the form "The ''F'' is ''G''" is:

: Exactly one thing is ''F'', and that thing is also ''G''.

Or, in the language of [[first-order logic]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y (F(y) \leftrightarrow y = x) \land G(x))&lt;/math&gt;

When the sentences above containing &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;-expressions are expanded out to their proper form, the steps involving substitution are seen to be illegitimate.  Consider, for example, the move from (3) to (4).  On Russell's account, (3) and (4) are shorthand for:
{|
|-
| 3'.
| &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y ((\phi(y) \land y=a) \leftrightarrow y = x) \land a = x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 4'.
| &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y ((\pi (y,b) \land y=a) \leftrightarrow y = x) \land a = x)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Clearly the substitution principle and assumption 4 do not license the move from (3') to (4').  Thus, one way to look at the slingshot is as simply another argument in favor of Russell's theory of definite descriptions.

If one is not willing to accept Russell's theory, then it seems wise to challenge either ''substitution'' or ''redistribution'', which seem to be the other weakest points in the argument.  Perry (1996), for example, rejects both of these principles, proposing to replace them with certain weaker, qualified versions that do not allow the slingshot argument to go through.
Gaetano Licata (2011) rejected the slingshot argument showing that the concept of identity (=) employed in the Davidson's and Gödel's demonstration is very problematic, because Gödel (following Russell) uses the Leibniz's principle of indiscernability of identicals{{page needed|date=March 2018}}, which suffer from the criticism proposed by Wittgenstein: to state that x=y when all properties of x are also properties of y is false because y and x are different signs, while to state that x=x when all properties of x are also properties of x is a nonsense{{page needed|date=April 2018}}. Licata's thesis is that the sign = (usually employed between numbers) needs a logical foundation before being employed between objects and properties.

'''Sokei-an Shigetsu Sasaki''' (佐々木 指月 (曹渓庵); March 10, 1882 – May 17, 1945), born '''Yeita Sasaki''' (佐々木 栄多), was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Rinzai]]  [[monk]] who founded the [[Buddhist Society of America]] (now the First Zen Institute of America) in [[New York City]] in 1930. Influential in the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] in the [[United States]], Sokei-an was one of the first Japanese masters to live and teach in America. In 1944 he married American [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]]. He died in May 1945 without leaving behind a [[Dharma heir]]. One of his better known students  was [[Alan Watts]], who studied under him briefly. Watts stayed for two weeks as a student of Sokei-an [http://sweepingzen.com/alan-watts-bio/]  in the late 1930s.

==Biography==
Sokei-an was born in [[Japan]] in 1882 as Yeita Sasaki. He was raised by his father, a [[Shinto]] priest, and his father's wife, though his [[birth mother]] was his father's [[concubine]]. Beginning at age four, his father taught him [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and soon had him reading [[Confucian]] texts.&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"&gt;Stirling, 31-35&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of his father when he was fifteen, he became an apprentice [[sculptor]] and came to study under [[Japan]]'s renowned [[Koun Takamura]] at the Imperial Academy of Art in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; While in school he began his study of [[Rinzai]] Zen under [[Tetsuo Sokatsu|Sokatsu Shaku]], (a [[Dharma heir]] of [[Soyen Shaku]]), graduating from the academy in 1905.&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"/&gt; Following graduation he was [[Conscription|drafted]] by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] and served briefly during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] on the border of [[Manchuria]]. Sasaki was discharged when the war ended shortly after in 1906, and soon married his first wife, Tomé, a fellow student of Sokatsu.&lt;ref name="lopez"&gt;Lopez&lt;/ref&gt; The newlyweds followed Sokatsu to [[San Francisco, California]] that year as part of a delegation of fourteen. The couple soon had their first child, Shintaro. In California with the hope of establishing a [[Zen]] community, the group farmed [[strawberries]] in [[Hayward, California]] with little success. Sasaki then studied painting under Richard Partington&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"/&gt; at the California Institute of Art, where he met [[Nyogen Senzaki]].&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; By 1910 the delegation's Zen community had proven unsuccessful. All members of the original fourteen, with the exception of Sasaki, made return trips back to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt;

Sokei-an then moved to [[Oregon]] without Tomé and Shintaro to work for a short while, being rejoined by them in [[Seattle Washington]] (where his wife gave birth to their second child, Seiko,&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"/&gt; a girl). In Seattle, Sasaki worked as a [[Picture frame|picture frame maker]]&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"/&gt; and wrote various articles and essays for [[Japanese language|Japanese]] publications such as ''[[Chuo Koron]]'' and ''Hokubei Shinpo''. He traveled the [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] countrysides selling subscriptions to ''Hokubei Shinpo''.&lt;ref name="stirlingthree"/&gt; His wife, who had become pregnant again, moved back to [[Japan]] in 1913 to raise their children. Over the next few years he made a living doing various jobs, when in 1916 he moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in [[Manhattan, New York]], where he encountered the poet and magus [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;The International [v12 # 2 and 4, 1918] ed. George Sylvester Viereck&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime during this period he was interviewed by the US Army but not drafted due to lingering allegiances to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sasaki, "Excluded Japanese and Exclusionary Americans" in Rediscovering America, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In New York he worked both as a [[janitor]] and a [[translator]] for [[Maxwell Bodenheim]]. He also began to write [[poetry]] during his free time.&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; He returned to [[Japan]] in 1920 to continue his [[koan]] studies, first under [[Soyen Shaku]] and then with Sokatsu.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; In 1922 he returned to the [[United States]] and in 1924 or 1925 began giving talks on [[Buddhism]] at the Orientalia Bookstore on E. 58th Street in [[New York City]], having received [[laity|lay]] teaching credentials from Sokatsu.[http://www.firstzen.org/history.php] In 1928 he received [[Dharma transmission|inka]] from Sokatsu in Japan, the "final seal" of approval in the [[Rinzai school]].&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; Then, on May 11, 1930, Sokei-an and some American students founded the [[Buddhist Society of America]], subsequently incorporated in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, 10&lt;/ref&gt; at 63 West 70th Street (originally with just four members).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Novack; 150-151&lt;/ref&gt; Here he offered [[sanzen]] interviews and gave [[Dharma talks]], also working on various translations of important Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; He made part of his living by sculpting Buddhist images and repairing art for [[Tiffany's]].&lt;ref name="stirlingtwo"&gt;Stirling, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 his future wife, Ruth Fuller Everett, began studying under him and received her [[Buddhist name]] (Eryu); her daughter, Eleanor, was then the wife of [[Alan Watts]] (who also studied under Sokei-an that same year).&lt;ref name="tweti"&gt;Tweti&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 Ruth purchased an apartment at 124 E. 65th Street in [[New York City]], which also served as living quarters for Sokei-an and became the new home for the [[Buddhist Society of America]] (opened on December 6). Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Sokei-an was arrested by the [[FBI]] as an "[[enemy alien]]"&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; taken to [[Ellis Island]] on June 15 and then [[interned]] at a camp in [[Fort Meade, Maryland]] on October 2, 1942 (where he suffered from [[high blood pressure]] and several [[stroke]]s).[http://www.ralphmag.org/CO/the-lotus.html] He was released from the [[internment camp]] on August 17, 1943 following the pleas of his students and returned to  the Buddhist Society of America in New York City. In 1944 he divorced his wife in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], with whom he had been separated for several years. Soon after, on July 10, 1944, Sokei-an married Ruth Fuller Sasaki in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. Sokei-an died on May 17, 1945 after years of bad health.&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; His ashes are [[interred]] at [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Bronx, New York]].&lt;ref name="stirling"&gt;Stirling, 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Society of America underwent a name change following his death in 1945, becoming the First Zen Institute of America.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Miller, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching style==

Sokei-an's primary way of teaching [[Zen Buddhism]] was by means of [[sanzen]], "an interview during which the teacher would set the student a [[koan]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lachman, 114&lt;/ref&gt;—and his [[Dharma talks]] were often delivered in the form of a [[Buddhist terms and concepts#T|t]]eisho.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner Keller, 638&lt;/ref&gt; Sokei-an did not provide instruction in [[zazen]] or hold [[sesshin]]s at the Buddhist Society of America. His primary focus was on [[koans]] and [[sanzen]], relying on the [[Hakuin]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 134&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mary Farkas]], "Sokei-an had no interest in reproducing the features of Japanese Zen monasticism, the strict and regimented training that aims at making people 'forget self.' In these establishments, individuality is stamped out, novices move together like a school of fish, their cross-legged position corrected with an ever-ready stick."&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
Dwight Goddard (author of "A Buddhist Bible") has described Sokei-an as, "being from the autocratic and blunt 'old school' of Zen masters."&lt;ref name="stirlingtwo"/&gt; According to writer Robert Lopez, "Sokei-an lectured on Zen and Buddhism in English. But he communicated the essence of the Buddha’s teaching and in his daily life by his presence alone, in silence, and in a radiance achieved through, as he once said, 'nature’s orders.'"&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; [[Alan Watts]] has said of Sokei-an, "I felt that he was basically on the same team as I; that he bridged the spiritual and the earthy, and that he was as humorously earthy as he was spiritually awakened."&lt;ref name="tweti"/&gt; In his autobiography, Watts had this to say, "When he began to teach Zen he was still, as I understand, more the artist than the priest, but in the course of time he shaved his head and 'sobered up.' Yet not really. For Ruth was often apologizing for him and telling us not to take him too literally or too seriously when, for example, he would say that Zen is to realize that life is simply nonsense, without meaning other than itself or future purpose beyond itself. The trick was to dig the nonsense, for—as Tibetans say—you can tell the true yogi by his laugh."&lt;ref name=watts&gt;Watts, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Zen master [[Dae Gak]] has said, "Sokei-An has a good understanding of Western culture and this, combined with his enlightened perspective, is a trustworthy bridge from Zen in the East to Zen in the West. He finds that place where "East" and "West" no longer exist and articulates this wisdom brilliantly for all beings. A true bodhisattva."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Augustine}}
The '''''Soliloquies of Augustine''''' is a two-book document written by the 4th-century saint [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Soliloquies: Augustine's Inner Dialogue'' by Boniface Ramsey 2000 {{ISBN|978-1-56548-142-8}} page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has the form of an "inner dialogue" in which questions are posed, discussions take place and answers are provided, leading to self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustine's Inner Dialogue: The Philosophical Soliloquy in Late Antiquity'' by Brian Stock 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-521-19031-2}} page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The first book begins with an inner dialogue which seeks to know a soul. In the second book it becomes clear that the soul Augustine wants to get to know is his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge companion to Augustine'' by Eleonore Stump, Norman Kretzmann 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-65985-X}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Srećko Horvat''' (born 1983) is a philosopher, author, and political activist. The German weekly ''[[Der Freitag]]'' called him as "one of the most exciting voices of his generation" &lt;ref&gt;Der Freitag, "Occupy ist Lifestyle", 2014 https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/occupy-ist-lifestyle&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been described as a "fiery voice of dissent in the Post-Yugoslav landscape" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeout.com/croatia/art/five-contemporary-croatian-icons&lt;/ref&gt;  His writing has appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', [[Der_Spiegel|Der Spiegel]], [[Newsweek]] and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==Life==
Horvat was born in [[Osijek]], Croatia, but lived for the first eight years of his life in exile in Germany, before returning to Croatia in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/exq84m/profile-srecko-horvat-876&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Croatia, he was involved in the [[Hardcore_punk|hardcore punk scene]] of the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/exq84m/profile-srecko-horvat-876&lt;/ref&gt; graduated philosophy and general linguistics at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jutarnji.hr/globus/srecko-horvat-da-ja-sam-lud-jer-danas-u-ovakvoj-europi-koja-je-u-ratu-koja-se-raspada-u-kojoj-se-guse-slobode-bilo-bi-ludo-ne-biti-lud/4046088/&lt;/ref&gt; started writing for Croatian magazines such as [[Zarez]] and with 25 years published two books, ''Protiv političke korektnosti'' (Against Political Correctness) and ''Znakovi postmodernog grada'' (Signs of the Postmodern City) in Croatia and Serbia. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/exq84m/profile-srecko-horvat-876&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has written several books in Croatian, and all his subsequent work in English (''Poetry from the Future, The Radicality of Love, Subversion!''), which was translated into dozens of languages, including Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Turkish, German and others. In 2008 he co-founded the Subversive Festival, where he served as program director until 2013. In 2016 he co-founded the [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025|Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM 2025)]] along with [[Yanis Varoufakis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Press Conference: Yanis Varoufakis &amp;  Democracy in Europe Movement 25|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcptJkd87uQ|date = 2016-02-10|accessdate = 2016-02-17|last = acTVism Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political thought and activity==
Horvat is regarded as one of the "central figures of the new left in post-Yugoslavia".&lt;ref&gt;"Für manche Serben ist Europa eine Bedrohung", Stuttgarter Nachrichten, January 2014 http://m.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.eu-beitritt-fuer-manche-serben-ist-europa-eine-bedrohung.ca9e72c4-d5fb-4ab0-9e62-c3893781146b.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has participated in different activist movements across the world, including the [[2009_student_protests_in_Croatia|2009 student protests in Croatia]], [[Occupy_Wall_Street|Occupy Wall Street]] in 2011, and World Social Forum in Senegal and Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2016/03/21/news/srecko-horvat-why-we-urgently-need-to-restore-democracy-in-europe-1.254619&lt;/ref&gt; He has visited the [[2017_G20_Hamburg_summit|2017 G20 Hamburg summit]]  which he described as a „dystopian nightmare“, claiming that „the real problem is the dogmatic slumber of the leaders of the free world, represented at this G20 summit by Merkel, May and others, which is the origin of our current dystopian nightmare (wars, terrorism, the refugee crisis and climate change“. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/06/hamburg-protest-g20-dystopian-nightmare-security-disunity-politics&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016 he has been claiming that „the need for a progressive international movement was never as urgent as today“.&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalcritique.org/world/usa/2016/srecko-on-trump/ &lt;/ref&gt; Asked about what the [[Facebook–Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal|Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]] meant for the future of politics, he claims that „in the near future this will be remembered as the early days of a much more radical transformation of what we understand under politics“ &lt;ref&gt;https://magazine.areweeurope.com/silentrevolutions/stories/ellyn-valkengoed-protesting-in-the-age-of-social-media&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==The Subversive Festival==
He was one of the founders of the [[Subversive Festival]] in 2008{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}, an annual festival which included [[Oliver Stone]], [[Alexis Tsipras]], [[Aleida Guevara]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], [[David Harvey]], [[Saskia Sassen]], etc. In 2013 together with the programme team he left the Subversive Festival "due to differences in understanding the goals and direction of the activist platforms within Subversive Forum and, more generally, the general purpose of Subversive Festival".&lt;ref&gt;"Open letter to friends of Subversive Festival", 2013 http://www.subversivefestival.com/newsiteml/3/262/en/open-letter-to-friends-of-subversive-festival&lt;/ref&gt; The influence and significance of the Subversive Festival was often paralleled to the [[Praxis_School|Praxis School]], the Marxist humanist philosophical movement that originated in the [[Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], during the 1960s. In 2017 Horvat published the book ''Subversion!'' which the American linguist and social critic [[Noam_Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] praised as a book "based on rich personal experience and participation in constructive subversion, along with wide reading from classics to the latest dreams of artificial intelligence" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zero-books.net/books/advancing-conversations-srecko-horvat&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, "Horvat leads us on a whirlwind tour of the maladies and discontents of modern civilization and the many ways to right what is wrong and achieve a better future" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zero-books.net/books/advancing-conversations-srecko-horvat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical Theater==
In 2014 Horvat launched a project called Philosophical Theatre (''Filozofski Teatar'') at Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. The underlying idea was to reestablish the close relationship between philosophy and theatre. &lt;ref&gt;https://festival.bitef.rs/Side-program/734/Philosophical-theatre.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; It is a monthly series of public debates with thinkers and artists. His guests included [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A]]., [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Margarethe von Trotta]], [[Adam Curtis]], [[Herta Müller]], [[Hito Steyerl]], [[Mladen Dolar]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Eva Illouz]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Bobby Gillespie]], [[Thomas Piketty]] and others. According to the Croatian National Theater, the complete number of visitors of the program from 2014 since 2018 was around 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hnk.hr/hr/filozofski-teatar/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation of 'Sane Society' television program==
During 2013 Horvat was the host and author of an intellectual TV show on Croatian National Television called ''Zdravo Društvo'' (Sane Society) which tried to recreate the Balkan cultural space and hosted many intellectuals such as [[Renata Salecl]], [[Rade Šerbedžija]], [[Andrej Nikolaidis]], [[Viktor Ivančić]], etc. Officially it was called off by the management because of “austerity measures”. However, the Bosnian writer [[Miljenko Jergović]] wrote that the TV show likely would not have been removed if not for an opinion piece Horvat wrote in the [[Guardian (UK)|Guardian]] that criticized an anti-gay-marriage referendum and, more generally, the movement of Croatian society in a culturally conservative if not fascistic direction.&lt;ref name="Croatia gay marriage vote"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horvat|first=Srećko|title=Croatia's vote forbidding gay marriage: a sign of the rotten heart of Europe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/04/croatia-gay-marriage-vote-europe-rotten-heart|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jergović wrote, "If he had written it in 1942 he would've ended up in [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. If he had written it in 1972 he would've ended up in [[Lepoglava prison]].

{{Bible sidebar |expanded=studies}}

The [[gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] are referred to as the '''Synoptic Gospels''' because they include many of the same stories, often in a similar sequence and in similar or sometimes identical wording. They stand in contrast to [[Gospel of John|John]], whose content is comparatively distinct. The term ''synoptic'' ({{lang-la|synopticus}}; {{Lang-el|συνοπτικός|translit=synoptikós}}) comes via Latin from the Greek {{lang|grc|σύνοψις}}, ''synopsis'', i.e. "(a) seeing all together, synopsis";{{refn|group=n|Both Greek words, ''synoptikos'' and ''synopsis'', derive from {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'' ([[preposition|prep.]]), meaning "together, with", and etymologically related words pertaining to sight, vision, appearance, i.e. {{lang|grc|ὀπτικός}} ''optikos'' ([[adjective|adj.]]; [[cf.]] English ''optic''), meaning "of ''or'' for sight", and {{lang|grc|ὄψις}} ''opsis'' ([[noun|n.]]), meaning "appearance, sight, vision, view".&lt;ref name="etymology"/&gt;}} the sense of the word in English, the one specifically applied to these three gospels, of "giving an account of the events from the same point of view or under the same general aspect" is a modern one.&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;{{OED|synoptic}} {{OEtymD|synoptic}} {{OEtymD|synopsis}} {{OEtymD|optic}} {{LSJ|su/n|σύν}}, {{LSJ|o)pto/s2|ὄπτός}}, {{LSJ|o)ptiko/s|ὀπτικός}}, {{LSJ|o)/yis|ὄψις}}, {{LSJ|sunoptiko/s|συνοπτικός}}, {{LSJ|su/noyis|σύνοψις|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This strong [[Parallel passage|parallelism]] among the three gospels in content, arrangement, and specific language is widely attributed to literary interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/synopticproblemw00good | title=The Synoptic Problem: A Way Through the Maze | last=Goodacre | first=Mark | authorlink=Mark Goodacre | year=2001 | page=16 | isbn=0567080560 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of the precise nature of their literary relationship—the [[#The synoptic problem|synoptic problem]]—has been a topic of lively debate for centuries and has been described as "the most fascinating literary enigma of all time".{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=32}} The longstanding majority view favors [[Marcan priority]], in which both Matthew and Luke have made direct use of the Gospel of Mark as a source, and further holds that Matthew and Luke also drew from an additional hypothetical document, called ''[[Q source|Q]]''.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=20–21}}

== Structure ==

[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|thumb|360px|Over three-quarters of Mark's content is found in both Matthew and Luke, and nearly all of Mark is found in at least one of the other two synoptic gospels. Additionally, Matthew and Luke have material in common that is not found in Mark.]]

=== Common features ===

Broadly speaking, the synoptic gospels are similar to John: all are composed in [[Koine Greek]], have a similar length, and were completed within a century of Jesus' death. They also differ from non-canonical sources, such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]], in that they belong to the ancient genre of biography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony | last=Bauckham | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Bauckham | year=2006 | page=220 | isbn=0802831621 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Synoptic Gospels | last=Perkins | first=Pheme | authorlink=Pheme Perkins | year=2009 | pages=2–11 | isbn=0802865534 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; collecting not only Jesus' teachings, but recounting in an orderly way his origins, his ministry and miracles, and his passion and resurrection.

In content and in wording, though, the synoptics diverge widely from John but have a great deal in common with each other. Though each gospel includes some unique material, the majority of Mark and roughly half of Matthew and Luke coincide in content, in much the same sequence, often nearly verbatim. This common material is termed the ''triple tradition''.

=== The triple tradition ===

The triple tradition, the material included by all three synoptic gospels, includes many stories and teachings:

{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|
* [[John the Baptist]]
* [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and [[Temptation of Jesus|temptation]] of Jesus
* [[First disciples of Jesus]]
* [[Hometown rejection of Jesus]]

* The [[Last Supper]], [[Passion of Christ|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and [[Entombment of Christ|entombment]]
* [[empty tomb|The empty tomb and resurrected Jesus]]
* [[Great Commission]]

}}

Furthermore, the triple tradition's [[pericopae]] (passages) tend to be arranged in much the same order in all three gospels. This stands in contrast to the material found in only two of the gospels, which is much more variable in order.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=38}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mark's Gospel&amp;nbsp;– Prior Or Posterior?: A Reappraisal of the Phenomenon of Order | last=Neville | first=David | year=2002 | isbn=1841272655 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of text as belonging to the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather on the degree of similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the [[cursing the fig tree|cursing of the fig tree]]{{bibleref2c|Mt|21:18–22|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Mk|11:12–24|NRSV}}, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the [[parable of the barren fig tree]]{{bibleref2c|Lk|13:6–9|NRSV}}, in a different point of the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.

More than half the wording in this passage is identical. Just as interesting, though, is that each gospel includes words absent in the other two and omits something included by the other two.

=== Relation to Mark ===

It has been observed that the triple tradition itself constitutes a complete gospel quite similar to the shortest gospel, Mark.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=38}}

Mark, unlike Matthew and Luke, adds relatively little to the triple tradition. Pericopae unique to Mark are scarce, notably two [[Deaf mute of Decapolis|healings]] involving [[Blind man of Bethsaida|saliva]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|7:33–36; 8:22–26|NRSV}} and the [[Naked fugitive|naked runaway]].{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:51–52|NRSV}} Mark's [[Gospel of Mark#Other characteristics unique to Mark|additions]] within the triple tradition tend to be explanatory elaborations (e.g., "the stone was rolled back, ''for it was very large''{{-"}}{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:4|NASB}}) or [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaisms]] (e.g., "''Talitha kum''!"{{bibleref2c|Mk|5:41|NASB}}). The pericopae Mark shares with only Luke are also quite few: the [[Exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum|Capernaum exorcism]]{{bibleref2c|Mk|1:23–28|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Lk|4:33–37|NRSV}} and departure from Capernaum,{{bibleref2c|Mk|1:35–38|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Lk|4:42–43|NRSV}} the [[strange exorcist]],{{bibleref2c|Mk|9:38–41|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Lk|9:49–50|NRSV}} and the [[widow's mite]]s.{{bibleref2c|Mk|12:41–44|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Lk|21:1–4|NRSV}} A greater number, but still not many, are shared with only Matthew, most notably the so-called "Great Omission"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Luke: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture | last=Stein | first=Robert H. | year=1992 | pages=29–30 | isbn=0805401245 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Luke of {{bibleref2|Mk|6:45–8:26|NRSV}}.

Most scholars take these observations as a strong clue to the literary relationship among the synoptics and Mark's special place in that relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Excavating Q: The History and Setting of the Sayings Gospel | last=Kloppenborg | first=John S. | year=2000 | pages=20–28 | isbn=1451411553 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis favored by most experts is ''[[Marcan priority]]'', that Mark was composed first and that Matthew and Luke each used Mark and incorporated most of it, with adaptations, into their own gospels. A leading alternative hypothesis is ''[[Marcan posteriority]]'', that Mark was formed primarily by extracting what Matthew and Luke shared in common.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=81}}

=== The double tradition ===

[[File:Synoptic word-for-word.png|right|thumb|320px|The preaching of John the Baptist in Matthew and Luke, with '''differences''' rendered in black.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt|3:7–10|NRSV}} &amp; {{bibleref2|Lk|3:7–9|NRSV}}. Text from 1894 Scrivener New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the two texts agree verbatim, with an isolated exception, for a span of over sixty words. Mark has no parallel.]] An extensive set of material—some two hundred verses or roughly half the length of the triple tradition—are the pericopae shared between Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. This is termed the ''double tradition''.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=39 ff}} Parables and other sayings predominate in the double tradition, but it also includes narrative elements:{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=40–41, 151–52}}
{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|
* Preaching of [[John the Baptist]]
* [[Temptation of Jesus]] (which Mark summarizes in two verses)
* The [[Sermon on the Mount]] (Matthew) or [[Sermon on the Plain|Plain]] (Luke)
* The [[Centurion's servant]]
* [[Messengers from John the Baptist]]
* [[Woes to the unrepentant cities]]
* Jesus thanks his Father
* Return of the unclean spirit
* Parables of [[The Leaven|the leaven]], the [[The Lost Sheep|lost sheep]], the [[The Great Banquet|great banquet]], the [[parable of the talents|talents]], and the [[Parable of the Faithful Servant|faithful servant]]
* [[Woes of the Pharisees|Discourse against the scribes and Pharisees]]
* Lament over Jerusalem

}}

Unlike triple-tradition material, double-tradition material is very differently arranged in the two gospels. Matthew's lengthy [[Sermon on the Mount]], for example, is paralleled by Luke's shorter [[Sermon on the Plain]], with the remainder of its content scattered throughout Luke. This is consistent with the general pattern of Matthew collecting sayings into large blocks, while Luke does the opposite and intersperses them with narrative.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=124–26}}

Besides the double-tradition proper, Matthew and Luke often agree against Mark within the triple tradition to varying extents, sometimes including several additional verses, sometimes differing by a single word. These are termed the ''major and minor agreements'' (the distinction is imprecise{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=148–51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/mark-q-overlaps-iv-back-to-continuum.html | title=Mark-Q Overlaps IV: Back to the Continuum | work=NT Blog | date=2007-11-14 | accessdate=2013-11-24 | last=Goodacre | first=Mark | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;). One example is in the passion narrative, where Mark has simply, "Prophesy!"{{bibleref2c|Mk|14:65|NRSV}} while Matthew and Luke both add, "Who is it that struck you?"{{bibleref2c|Mt|26:68|NRSV}}{{bibleref2c|Lk|22:64|NRSV}}{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp=145–46}}

The double-tradition's origin, with its major and minor agreements, is a key facet of the synoptic problem. The simplest hypothesis is that Luke relied on Matthew's work or vice versa. But many experts, on various grounds, maintain that neither Matthew nor Luke used the other's work. If this is the case, they must have drawn from some common source, distinct from Mark, that provided the double-tradition material and overlapped with Mark's content where major agreements occur. This hypothetical document is termed ''[[Q source|Q]]'', for the German ''Quelle'', meaning "source".{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|p=108}}

=== Special Matthew and Special Luke ===

Matthew and Luke contain a large amount of material found in no other gospel. These materials are sometimes called ''Special Matthew'' or ''[[M source|M]]'' and ''Special Luke'' or ''[[L source|L]]''.

Both Special Matthew and Special Luke include distinct opening [[Nativity of Jesus|infancy narratives]] and distinct post-resurrection conclusions (with Luke continuing the story in his second book [[Acts]]). In between, Special Matthew includes mostly parables, while Special Luke includes both parables and healings.

Special Luke is notable for containing a greater concentration of [[Semitism (linguistics)|Semitisms]] than any other gospel material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Edwards | first=James R. | authorlink=James R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed.{{bibleref2c|Lk|1:1–4|NRSV|Lk 1:1–4 (NRSV)}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The synoptic problem&lt;!--'Synoptic problem' links here--&gt; ==

The "synoptic problem" is the question of the specific literary relationship among the three synoptic gospels—that is, the question as to the source or sources upon which each synoptic gospel depended when it was written.

The texts of the three synoptic gospels often agree very closely in wording and order, both in quotations and in narration. Most scholars ascribe this to ''documentary dependence'', direct or indirect, meaning the close agreements among synoptic gospels are due to one gospel's drawing from the text of another, or from some written source that another gospel also drew from.{{cn|date=June 2014}}

=== Controversies ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The synoptic problem hinges on several interrelated points of controversy:
* '''Priority:''' Which gospel was written first? (Clearly, where one text draws from another, the source must have been composed first.)
* '''Successive dependence:''' Did each of the synoptic gospels draw from each of its predecessors? (If not, clearly the frequent agreements between the two independent gospels against the third must originate elsewhere.)
* '''Lost written sources:''' Did any of the gospels draw from some earlier document that has not been preserved (e.g., the hypothetical "[[Q source|Q]]", or an earlier edition of another gospel)?
* '''Oral sources:''' To what extent did each evangelist draw from personal knowledge, eyewitness accounts, liturgy, or other [[Oral gospel traditions | oral traditions]] to produce an original written account?
* '''Translation:''' Jesus and others quoted in the gospels spoke primarily in [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]], but the gospels themselves in their oldest available form are each written in Koine Greek. Who performed the translations, and at what point?
* '''Redaction:''' How and why did those who put the gospels in their final form expand, abridge, alter, or rearrange their sources?

Furthermore, some theories try to explain the relation of the synoptic gospels to [[Gospel of John|John]]; to non-canonical gospels such as [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], [[Gospel of Peter|Peter]], and [[Egerton Gospel|Egerton]]; to the [[Didache]]; and to lost documents such as the [[logia| Hebrew logia]] mentioned by [[Papias of Hierapolis |Papias]], the [[Jewish–Christian gospels]], and the [[Gospel of Marcion]].

=== History ===

[[File:Griesbach - Synopsis Evangeliorum p24.jpg|thumb| A page of Griesbach's ''Synopsis Evangeliorum'', which presents the texts of the synoptic gospels arranged in columns.]]

Ancient sources virtually unanimously ascribe the synoptic gospels to the apostle [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], to [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s interpreter [[Mark the Evangelist |Mark]], and to [[Saint Paul|Paul]]'s companion [[Luke the Evangelist |Luke]] - hence their respective canonical names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The four Gospels and the one Gospel of Jesus Christ: an investigation of the collection and origin of the Canonical Gospels | last= Hengel | first= Martin | authorlink= Martin Hengel | year= 2000 | pages= 34–115 | isbn= 1563383004 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remark by [[Augustine of Hippo| Augustine]] at the beginning of the fifth century presents the gospels as composed in their canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with each evangelist thoughtfully building upon and supplementing the work of his predecessors—the [[Augustinian hypothesis]] (Matthew–Mark).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A history of the synoptic problem: the canon, the text, the composition and the interpretation of the Gospels | last= Dungan | first= David L. | authorlink= David Laird Dungan | year= 1999 | pages= 112–44 | isbn= 0385471920 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view (when any model of dependence was considered at all) seldom came into question until the late eighteenth century, when [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] published in 1776 a [[Johann Jakob Griesbach#Gospel Synopsis|''synopsis'']] of the synoptic gospels. Instead of [[Gospel harmony| harmonizing]] them, he displayed their texts side by side, making both similarities and divergences apparent. Griesbach, noticing the special place of Mark in the synopsis, hypothesized Marcan posteriority and advanced (as [[Henry Owen]] had a few years earlier&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;) the [[two-gospel hypothesis]] (Matthew–Luke).

In the nineteenth century, researchers applied the tools of [[literary criticism]] to the synoptic problem in earnest, especially in German scholarship. Early work revolved around a hypothetical [[Proto-Gospel hypothesis |proto-gospel]] (''Ur-Gospel''), possibly in [[Aramaic]], underlying the synoptics. From this line of inquiry, however, a consensus emerged that Mark itself served as the principal source for the other two gospels—[[Marcan priority]].

In a theory first proposed by [[Christian Hermann Weisse| Weisse]] in 1838, the double tradition was explained by Matthew and Luke independently using two sources—thus, the [[Two-source theory |two-source (Mark-Q) theory]]—which supplemented Mark with another hypothetical source consisting mostly of sayings. This additional source was at first seen as the ''[[logia]]'' (sayings) spoken of by [[Papias of Hierapolis |Papias]] and thus called "Λ", but later it became more generally known as [[Q source | "Q"]], from the German ''Quelle'', meaning ''source''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Gospel Behind the Gospels: Current Studies on Q | last= Lührmann | first= Dieter | year= 1995 | editor-last= Piper | editor-first= Ronald Allen | chapter= Q: Sayings of Jesus or Logia? | pages= 97–102 | isbn= 9004097376 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-source theory eventually won wide acceptance and was seldom questioned until the late twentieth century; most scholars simply took this new orthodoxy for granted and directed their efforts toward Q itself, and this is {{as of | 2018 | alt = still}} largely the case.{{Citation needed|date= January 2017}}

The theory is also well known in a more elaborate form set forth by [[Burnett Hillman Streeter| Streeter]] in 1924, which additionally hypothesized written sources [[M source| "M"]] and [[L source| "L"]] (for "Special Matthew" and "Special Luke" respectively)—hence the influential [[four-document hypothesis]]. This exemplifies the prevailing scholarship of the time,  which saw the canonical gospels as late products, dating from well into the second century, composed by unsophisticated cut-and-paste redactors out of a progression of written sources, and derived in turn from oral traditions and from [[folklore]] that had [[evolutionary literary criticism | evolved]] in various communities.{{sfnp|Goodacre|2001|pp= 160–61}} More recently,{{when?|date=October 2018}} however, as this view has gradually fallen into disfavor, so too has the centrality of documentary interdependence and hypothetical documentary sources as an explanation for all aspects of the synoptic problem.{{Citation needed|date= January 2017}}

In recent decades, weaknesses of the two-source theory have been more widely recognized,{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} and debate has reignited. Many have independently argued that Luke did make some use of Matthew after all—the [[Common Sayings Source]]. British scholars went further and dispensed with Q entirely, ascribing the double tradition to Luke's direct use of Matthew—the [[Farrer hypothesis]] of 1955.&lt;ref&gt;

St. Luke, in turn, will be found to presuppose St. Matthew and St. Mark, and St. John to presuppose the three others. The whole literary history of the canonical Gospel tradition will be found to be contained in the fourfold canon itself, except in so far as it lies in the Old Testament, the Pseudepigrapha, and the other New Testament writings. [...] Once rid of Q, we are rid of a progeny of nameless chimaeras, and free to let St. Matthew write as he is moved.

&lt;/ref&gt;
New attention is also being given{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to the [[Wilke hypothesis]] of 1838 which, like Farrer, dispenses with Q but ascribes the double tradition to Matthew's direct use of Luke.  Meanwhile, the Augustinian hypothesis has also made a comeback, especially in American scholarship. The [[Jerusalem school hypothesis]] has also attracted fresh advocates, as has the [[Independence hypothesis]], which denies documentary relationships altogether.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On this collapse of consensus, Wenham observed: "I found myself in the Synoptic Problem Seminar of the Society for New Testament Studies, whose members were in disagreement over every aspect of the subject. When this international group disbanded in 1982 they had sadly to confess that after twelve years' work they had not reached a common mind on a single issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Redating Matthew, Mark, &amp; Luke | last= Wenham | first= John | authorlink= John Wenham | year= 1992 | page= xxi | isbn= 0830817603 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Essential Shinran: A Buddhist Path of True Entrusting''' is a compilation of passages from the writings and life story of [[Shinran Shonin]].  Shinran, who wrote during the [[Kamakura Period]], was a [[Japan]]ese [[monk]] who founded [[Jodo Shinshu]] [[Buddhism]], which eventually became the largest Buddhist sect in Japan.

The book (compiled by [[Alfred Bloom (Buddhist)|Alfred Bloom]], with a foreword by [[Ruben L.F. Habito]]) is divided into three major sections: 
*Shinran’s Life and Legacy
*What Do We Know of Shinran in the Ancient Sources?
*Shinran Interprets Pure Land Teaching.

The book is an attempt to bring Pure Land Buddhism to the attention of a Western audience.  {{cquote|''Essential Shinran'' has the potential to dramatically increase Western appreciation of one of the largest, yet least understood forms of Buddhism. As such, the book ranks among the most important publications on Pure Land Buddhism of the past decade, valuable to scholars and Buddhist practitioners alike.”|20px|20px |[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Abstract&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=1&amp;id=BA3AB0054BD24AB8BCB890194F32A3E2&amp;Author=&amp;ReturnUrl=dirmod%2Easp%3Fsid%3D%26nm%3D%26type%3DPublishing%26mod%3DPublications%253A%253AArticle%26mid%3D8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791%26tier%3D4%26id%3DBA3AB0054BD24AB8BCB890194F32A3E2 Essential and Pure]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Theistic evolution''', '''theistic evolutionism''', '''evolutionary creationism''' or '''God-guided evolution''' are views that regard religious teachings about [[God]] as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. Theistic evolution is not in itself a [[scientific theory]], but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.

Supporters of theistic evolution generally harmonize evolutionary thought with belief in God, rejecting the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}} they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

[[Francis Collins]] describes theistic evolution as the position that "evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God",&lt;ref name=collins-def&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1038/442110a|title= Building bridges|year= 2006|journal= Nature|volume= 442|issue= 7099|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characterizes it as accepting "that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God".&lt;ref&gt;Stipe, Claude E., "Scientific Creationism and Evangelical Christianity", ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 87, No. 1 (Mar., 1985), p. 149, Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/677678 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]] in the United States of America, [[Eugenie Scott]], has used the term to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the [[theology|theological]] view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching [[deism]] in rejecting the concept of continued intervention.

Just as different types of evolutionary explanations have evolved, so there are different types of theistic evolution. Creationists [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John D. Morris]], point out that there are different terms which have been used to describe different positions: ''"'''[[Orthogenesis]]"''' (goal-directed evolution), '''"[[Lev_Berg#Nomogenesis|nomogenesis]]"''' (evolution according to fixed law), '''"[[emergent evolution]]"''', '''"[[creative evolution (disambiguation)|creative evolution]]"''', and others''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Creation Trilogy'' (1998), New Leaf Publishing Group, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that one should read the creation story in the book of Genesis only metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last=Glover | first=Gordon J. | year=2007 | title=Beyond the Firmament: Understanding Science and the Theology of Creation | location= Chesapeake, VA| publisher=Watertree | isbn=0-9787186-1-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others see "evolutionary creation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/3EvoCr.htm|title=Evolutionary Creation|work=ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EC, also referred to by some observers as "evolutionary creationism") as the belief that God, as Creator, uses evolution to bring about his plan. The Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881-1955) was an influential proponent of God-directed evolution or "orthogenesis", in which man will eventually evolve to the "[[omega point]]" of union with the Creator. [[Eugenie Scott]] states in ''Evolution Vs. Creationism'' that it is a type of evolution rather than creationism, despite its name, and that it is "hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution".&lt;ref name=EvC/&gt; According to evolutionary creationist [[Denis Lamoureux]], although referring to the same view, the word arrangement in the term "theistic evolution" places "the process of evolution as the primary term, and makes the Creator secondary as merely a qualifying adjective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/uploads/projects/Lamoureux_Scholarly_Essay.pdf|title=Evolutionary Creation: A Christian Approach to Evolution|author=Denis O. Lamoureux|year=2003|publisher=University of Alberta|quote=The most important word in the term evolutionary creation is the noun "creation". These Christian evolutionists are first and foremost thoroughly committed and unapologetic creationists. They believe that the world is a creation that is absolutely dependent for every instant of its existence on the will and grace of the Creator. The qualifying word in this category is the adjective "evolutionary", indicating simply the method through which the Lord made the cosmos and living organisms. This view of origins is often referred to as "theistic evolution". However, such a word arrangement places the process of evolution as the primary term, and makes the Creator secondary as merely a qualifying adjective.|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also uses the term "theistic evolutionism" interchangeably with "theistic evolution".&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott, 271&lt;/ref&gt; Divine intervention is seen at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of [[speciation]], with similarities to the ideas of [[progressive creationism]] that God created "kinds" of animals sequentially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/1593_the_creationevolution_continu_12_7_2000.asp The Creation/Evolution Continuum] by [[Eugenie Scott]], December 2000, [[National Center for Science Education]]; see also Scott, 271 for another definition&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the embracing of Darwinian evolution, historian [[Ronald Numbers]] describes the position of the late 19th-century geologist [[George Frederick Wright]] as "Christian Darwinism".&lt;ref&gt;

Historians of science (and authors of pre-evolutionary ideas) have pointed out that scientists had considered the concept of biological change well before Darwin.

In the 17th century, the English [[nonconformist]]/[[Anglican]] priest and botanist [[John Ray]], in his book ''The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692)'', had wondered "why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1960/JASA6-60Marsh.html On the Origins of New Forms of Life, A new Theory], by Eugene M. McCarthy.&lt;/ref&gt;

18th-century scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707-1778) published ''Systema Naturae'' (1735- ), a book in which he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of immutability of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it. Yet, as a Christian, he still defended "special creation", the belief that God created "every living creature" at the beginning, as read in Genesis, with the peculiarity a set of original species of which all the present species have descended.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last1= Garner |first1= Paul A. |chapter= 1: Evolving Christian Views of Species |editor1-last= Wood |editor1-first= Todd Charles |editor2-last=Garner |editor2-first=Paul A. |title= Genesis Kinds: Creationism and the Origin of Species |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8wpMAwAAQBAJ |series= Issues in creation |volume= Center for Origins Research Issues in Creation: 5 |issue= 5 |location= Eugene, Oregon|publisher= Wipf and Stock |publication-date= 2009-01-16 |page=16 |isbn=9781606084908 |quote=In his ''Disquisitio de Sexu Plantarum'' (1756), Linnaeus had argued that the genera were the original units of creation and that the species within them had originated by subsequent hybridization. In 1766, he dropped his famous maxim about the permanance of species from the final edition of the ''Systema Naturae''. Glass (1959b, p. 151) summarizes his mature views this way: 'In the end he believed in the evolution of the smaller systematic categories, of the species as he knew species, and maybe of the genera. But the original Creation was still that of a multitude of forms, distinct then and forever.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus wrote:
{{Quote|Let us suppose that the Divine Being in the beginning progressed from the simpler to the complex; from few to many; similarly that He in the beginning of the plant kingdom created as many plants as there were natural orders. These plant orders He Himself, there from producing, mixed among themselves until from them originated those plants which today exist as genera. Nature then mixed up these plant genera among themselves through generations -of double origin (hybrids) and multiplied them into existing species, as many as possible (whereby the flower structures were not changed) excluding from the number of species the almost sterile hybrids, which are produced by the same mode of origin.|''Systema Vegetabilium'' (1774)&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Cameron Crombie, Michael A. Hoskin (1988), ''"History of Science"'' Science History Publications. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaeus attributed the active process of biological change to God himself, as he stated:

{{Quote|We imagine that the Creator at the actual time of creation made only one single species for each natural order of plants, this species being different in habit and fructification from all the rest. That he made these mutually fertile, whence out of their progeny, fructification having been somewhat changed, Genera of natural classes have arisen as many in number as the different parents, and since this is not carried further, we regard this also as having been done by His Omnipotent hand directly in the beginning; thus all Genera were primeval and constituted a single Species. That as many Genera having arisen as there were individuals in the beginning, these plants in course of time became fertilised by others of different sort and thus arose Species until so many were produced as now exist ... these Species were sometimes fertilised out of congeners, that is other Species of the same Genus, whence have arisen Varieties.|From his '' Fundamenta fructificationis'' (1742)&lt;ref&gt;As quoted from Ramsbottom, (1938); in David Briggs (1997), ''"Plant Variation and Evolution"'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jens Christian Clausen (1967), refers to Linnaeus' theory as a "forgotten evolutionary theory [that] antedates Darwin's by nearly 100 years", and reports that he was a pioneer in doing experiments about hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Christian Clausen (1967), "Stages in the Evolution of Plant Species", Harper, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later observations by Protestant botanists [[Carl Friedrich von Gärtner]] (1772-1850) and [[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter]] (1733-1806) denied the immutability of species, which (according to Christian apologists{{which?|date=April 2017}}) the Bible never teaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v4/n1/species-change|title= Do Species Change?|work= Answers in Genesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kölreuter used the term "[[transmutation of species]]" to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization,&lt;ref name="plorenzano.files.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plorenzano.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/xxi-joseph-gottlieb-kc3b6lreuter-plorenzano.pdf |format= PDF |title= An Analysis of the Work of Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter and its Relation to Gregor Mendel's Work |author= Pablo Lorenzano |publisher= Plorenzano.files.wordpress.com |accessdate= 2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=January 2018}} although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not be responsible for the introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822-1884), aligning himself with the "new doctrine of special creation" proposed by Linnaeus,&lt;ref name="plorenzano.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s analysis of fossils and discovery of [[extinction]] disrupted static views of nature in the early 19th century, confirming geology as showing a historical sequence of life. British [[natural theology]], which sought examples of [[adaptation]] to show design by a benevolent Creator, adopted [[catastrophism]] to show earlier organisms being replaced in a series of creations by new organisms better adapted to a changed environment. [[Charles Lyell]] (1797-1875) also saw adaptation to changing environments as a sign of a benevolent Creator, but his [[uniformitarianism]] envisaged continuing extinctions and replacements.{{cn|date=April 2017}} As seen in correspondence between Lyell and [[John Herschel]], scientists were looking for creation by laws rather than by miraculous interventions. In continental Europe, the idealism of philosophers including [[Lorenz Oken]] (1779-1851) developed a ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' in which patterns of development from [[archetype]]s were a purposeful divine plan aimed at forming humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=108–109, 113–118, 133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists rejected [[transmutation of species]] as [[materialism|materialist]]&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=120–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|van Wyhe|2007|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] threatening the established hierarchies of society. The idealist [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807-1873), a persistent opponent of transmutation, saw mankind as the goal of a sequence of creations, but his concepts were the first to be adapted{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} into a scheme of theistic evolutionism. In ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' published in 1844, its anonymous author ([[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]) set out goal-centred progressive development as the Creator's divine plan, programmed to unfold without direct intervention or miracles. The book became a best-seller and popularised the idea of transmutation in a designed "law of progression". The scientific establishment strongly attacked ''Vestiges''  at the time, but later more sophisticated theistic evolutionists followed the same approach of looking for patterns of development as evidence of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparative anatomist [[Richard Owen]] (1804-1892), a prominent figure in the Victorian era scientific establishment, opposed transmutation throughout his life. When formulating [[Homology (biology)|homology]] he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his ''On the Nature of Limbs'' of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist [[Hewett Watson]] (1804-1881) and the Reverend [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] (1796-1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp= 125–126, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] said that in "continuous operation of Creative power" through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a "successive and continuous fashion" through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''On the Origin of Species''===
{{See also|Religious views of Charles Darwin}}
When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, many [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] accepted evolution provided it was reconciled with divine design. The clergymen [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Frederick Temple]], both conservative Christians in the [[Church of England]], promoted a theology of creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] welcomed the idea of [[natural selection]], as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity could be seen as a fallen race needing salvation. [[Aubrey Moore]] also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin's friend [[Asa Gray]] defended natural selection as compatible with design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin himself, in his second edition of the ''Origin'' (January 1860), had written in the conclusion:
{{Quote|I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator. |Chapter XIV: "Conclusions", page 428}}

Within a decade most scientists had started espousing evolution, but from the outset some expressed opposition to the concept of natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 [[Richard Owen]] attacked Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' in an anonymous review while praising "Professor Owen" for "the establishment of the axiom of ''the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things''".&lt;ref&gt;[Owen, Richard]. 1860. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=12&amp;itemID=A30&amp;viewtype=text Review of Origin &amp; other works.] ''Edinburgh Review'' 111: 487-532, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Herschel]] apparently dismissed Darwin's book as "the law of higgledy-pigglety&lt;!--sic, t not d--&gt;", and in 1861 he wrote of evolution that "An intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change–to regulate their amount–to limit their divergence–and to continue them in a definite course". He added "On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=186, 204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian scientist [[Sir David Brewster]] wrote an article called "[[s:The Facts and Fancies of Mr. Darwin|The Facts and Fancies of Mr. Darwin]]" in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God's perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin's book contained both "much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation", although accepting that "every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D8khAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22every+part+of+the+human+frame+has+been+fashioned+by+the+same+Divine+hand+%22&amp;dq=%22every+part+of+the+human+frame+has+been+fashioned+by+the+same+Divine+hand+%22&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yRe2Uvv4CMrs2wX8gYHwCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA Good Words]'' (1862), Volume 3. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s theistic evolutionism became a popular compromise in science, and gained widespread support from the general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]] insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] published ''The Reign of Law'', which explained beauty in [[plumage]] without any [[adaptation|adaptive benefit]] as design generated by the Creator's laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared  [[Vestigiality|rudimentary organs]] for a future need.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=204–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]], wrote in 1868: "Mr Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill ... and I do not [see] that 'the accidental evolution of organic beings' is inconsistent with divine design — It is accidental to us, not to God."&lt;ref&gt;[Letter of John Henry Newman to J. Walker of Scarborough, The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman, edited by C.S. Dessain and T. Gornall, vol. XXIV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp. 77-78. http://www.inters.org/Newman-Scarborough-Darwin-Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Darwin published his own research on human ancestry in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', concluding that humans were "descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears", which would be classified amongst the [[Quadrumana]] along with monkeys, and in turn descended "through a long line of diversified forms" going back to something like the larvae of [[Ascidiacea|sea squirts]].{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=406&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text 389]}} Critics promptly complained that this "degrading" image "tears the crown from our heads", but there is little evidence that it led to loss of faith. Among the few who did record the impact of Darwin's writings, the naturalist [[Joseph LeConte]] struggled with "distress and doubt" following the death of his daughter in 1861, before enthusiastically saying in the late 1870s there was "not a single philosophical question connected with our highest and dearest religious and spiritual interests that is fundamentally affected, or even put in any new light, by the theory of evolution", and in the late 1880s embracing the view that "evolution is entirely consistent with a rational theism." Similarly, [[George Frederick Wright]] responded to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' and [[Charles Lyell]]'s 1963 ''Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man'' by turning to Asa Gray's belief, that God had set the rules at the start and only intervened on rare occasions, as a way to harmonise evolution with theology. Wright's faith was not seriously shaken by evolution, but he later suffered a crisis when confronted with [[historical criticism]] of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/107-wrestling-with-doubt/|title= Wrestling with doubt - Christian History Magazine|work=Christian History Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance==
{{Main|Acceptance of evolution by religious groups}}
According to [[Eugenie Scott]]: "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of [[mainline Protestant]] [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church."&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; Studies show that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan; among 34 countries sampled, only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate of acceptance than the United States.&lt;ref name=miller-et-al&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1126746 |title=Science Communication: Public Acceptance of Evolution |year=2006 |last1=Miller|first1=J. D.|journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5788| pages=765–6 |pmid=16902112 |last2=Scott |first2=E. C. |last3=Okamoto |first3=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionism has been described as arguing for [[Relationship between religion and science|compatibility between science and religion]], and as such it is viewed with disdain both by some [[atheism|atheists]] and many [[creationism|creationists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0034412500024380|title=Creation and Evolution|year=2008|last1=Devine|first1=Philip E.|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32|issue=3|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hominization==
[[wikt:Hominization|Hominization]], in both science and religion, involves the process or the purpose of becoming [[human]]. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the [[Abrahamic religions]], which hold as a core belief that animals do not have [[Immortality of the soul|immortal]] [[soul]]s but that humans do.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] attributed "soul" (''anima'') to all organisms but taught that only human souls are immortal. See: Peter Eardley and Carl Still, ''Aquinas: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 34–35. In contrast, [[Dharmic religions]] (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) teach that all biological organisms have souls which pass from one life to another in the [[Transmigration of souls]]. See [http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html "Soul"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052029/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html |date=July 9, 2008 }}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07. Retrieved 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a [[special creation]] consisting of at least the addition of a [[soul]] just for the human species.&lt;ref&gt;Including the [[Catholic Church]], see Rahner, section "Hominization" by Karl Rahner in entry on "Evolution", 484-485; Scott, 271-272. Note that "special creation of man" in Catholic references is a far more restricted concept than "[[special creation]]" (q.v.) in typical Creationist usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific accounts of the [[origin of the universe]], the [[origin of life]], and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and to account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Theistic evolution typically postulates a point at which a population of [[hominid]]s who had (or may have) evolved by a process of natural evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to [[Adam and Eve]], or indeed to [[Mitochondrial Eve]], although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which such an event occurred should essentially be the same as in [[paleoanthropology]] and [[archeology]], but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term "[[special transformism]]" is sometimes used to refer to theories that there was a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.&lt;ref&gt;Rahner, 484-488; see also Artigas, 19, 23, 24, 35 etc&lt;/ref&gt;

Several 19th-century theologians and evolutionists attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics [[John Augustine Zahm]] and [[St. George Jackson Mivart]], but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps.&lt;ref&gt;The six leading examples are the subject of Artigas's book. Each of these has a chapter in Artigas: Léroy, Zahm, Bonomelli, Mivart, the English Bishop John Hedley, and Raffaello Caverni. All are also covered by Brundell.&lt;/ref&gt; and 20th-century thinking tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote = Meanwhile, theology had withdrawn from asserting the direct creation of the whole world by God: first to the direct creation of the human body (not from the animal world); then to that of the human soul (in contrast to the human body). Finally - it seems today - a direct intervention in the development of the world and human beings is dispensed with altogether. The English philosopher Antony Flew was unfortunately right when he stated that through this constantly repeated strategy of protection and withdrawal with which we are familiar (and which for long decades kept young Catholics especially from the study of biology 'which endangers the faith'), the hypothesis of God was being 'killed by inches, the death of a thousand qualifications.' [...] Is such an attitude credible belief in God? It isn't surprising that it is increasingly being put in question.

==Relationship to other positions==

===19th-century 'theistic evolution'===
{{See also|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection#Theistic evolution}}

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution" in a now-obsolete sense for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref name=Larson2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial [[mutation]]s to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution ([[orthogenesis]]) by specifying the laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.&lt;ref name=Larson2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |authorlink=Edward Larson |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of Scientific Theory |publisher=Modern Library |year=2004 |isbn=0-679-64288-9 |pages=125–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=George |title=The Reign of Law |date=1867 |publisher=Strahan |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Edward J.

===Non-theistic evolution===

===Young Earth creationism===
[[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] including [[Ken Ham]] criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds,&lt;ref&gt;[https://answersingenesis.org/theistic-evolution/god-and-evolution/couldnt-god-have-used-evolution/ Chapter 3: Couldn’t God Have Used Evolution?] Ham, Ken (2006).

They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of treating it as historical. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call "[[Atheism|atheistic]]" [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] will confine [[God of the gaps|God to the gaps]] in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] through [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Gitt, Werner (2006).

'''William Ritchie Sorley''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɔr|l|i}}; 4 November 1855 – 28 July 1935), usually cited as '''W. R. Sorley''', was a Scottish philosopher. A [[Gifford Lecturer]], he was one of the [[British Idealist]] school of thinkers, with interests in [[ethics]].

==Life and career==
William Ritchie Sorley was born in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], Scotland, the son of Anna Ritchie and William Sorley, a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister.  He was educated first at [[Edinburgh University]], where he took a degree in philosophy and mathematics. This was followed by  [[New College, Edinburgh]] where he studied Theology with the intention of training for the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=G.F.|title=W. R. Sorley (1855-1935)|journal=Mind|date=1936|volume=45|issue=177|pages=123–125|jstor=2250299}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave this up, and after winning the Shaw Fellowship he spent a year at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he took Part II of the Moral Sciences Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=SRLY880WR|name=Sorley, William Ritchie}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently spent several years at Cambridge where he was lecturer and in 1883 he was elected a Fellow at Trinity.

In 1886, he was appointed to a post at University College, London. After two years he was appointed to a professorship at [[Cardiff University|University College Cardiff]], succeeding [[Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison|Andrew Seth]] as Professor of Logic and Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SORLEY, William Ritchie|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U217373|website=Who was Who|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 he was appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, and finally in 1900 he succeeded [[Henry Sidgwick]] in the [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge Professorship]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He held this post until his retirement in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mander|first1=W.J.|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Stuart|chapter=Sorley, William Ritchie (1855-1935)|title=Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Philosophers|date=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|page=983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[honorary degree]] ''[[Legum Doctor]]'' (LL.D.) from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in March 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Saturday |date=3 March 1900 |page_number=8 |issue=36080| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1905.

Sorley's main philosophical interest was the place of moral values in the constitution of the universe. He thought that moral values are objective- a view he explains in his [[Gifford lectures]] and in his earlv work on the ethics of naturalism. What is morally good is what we are morally bound to pursue within our ability to do so. If it does not lie within our power to act in a certain way, then we are not bound to pursue it and it cannot be a moral value.

He is now remembered for his [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryofenglis00sorluoft ''A History of British Philosophy to 1900''], published in 1920, with its idiosyncratic slant, as a retrospective view from the point of view of British Idealism. Among his other published works are: [https://archive.org/details/ethicsofnaturali029110mbp ''The Ethics of Naturalism: a Criticism''] (second edition 1904), [https://archive.org/details/themorallifeandm00sorluoft ''The Moral Life and Moral Worth''] (1911), and his [[Gifford Lectures]] which he gave in 1914-15 and were published under the title [https://archive.org/details/moralvaluesideao00sorlrich ''Moral Values and the Idea of God''] (second edition 1921). In his obituary, J.H. Muirhead said of this: "I can remember the sense of freshness and power that this book gave us all at the time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muirhead|first1=J.H.|title=William Ritchie Sorley|journal=Philosophy|date=1936|volume=11|issue=41|pages=120–121|doi=10.1017/S0031819100033465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Charles Sorley]] was his son.

During the long argument about admitting women as students at Cambridge, there were votes by the Senate in 1897 and again in 1920, following intense public debates among lecturers and undergraduates, and the circulation of many flysheets propounding arguments for and against. Sorley was persistently hostile to any presence of women in Cambridge and argued that they were not after equality but sought power and would damage university life. He authored several flysheets with Prof. Ridgeway - both wanted women totally excluded from Cambridge and instead a separate women's university set up for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McWilliams-Tullberg|first1=Rita|title=Women at Cambridge: A Men's University, though of a Mixed Type|publisher=Gollancz|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Cambridge on 28 July 1935 aged 79, following a bout of pneumonia.
