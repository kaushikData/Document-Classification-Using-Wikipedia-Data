The '''24-hour clock''' is the convention of time keeping in which the [[day]] runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 [[hours]], indicated by the hours passed since midnight, from 0 to 23. This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,&lt;ref name="cldr"&gt;See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time notation by country]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].&lt;ref name="iso8601"&gt;International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 3rd ed., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited number of countries, particularly English-speaking, use the [[12-hour clock]], or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is still dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]] the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] and a handful of other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.&lt;ref name=cldr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

==Description==
[[File:Russian Polar Expedition watch from 1969 (front).jpg|left|thumb|upright|A Russian 24 hour watch for polar expeditions from 1969, made by Soviet watchmaker [[Raketa]]. Polar nights or days make it necessary to use a 24-hour scale instead of 12.]]
A time of day is written in the 24-hour notation in the form hh:mm (for example 01:23) or hh:mm:ss (for example, 01:23:45), where hh (00 to 23) is the number of full hours that have passed since [[midnight]], mm (00 to 59) is the number of full minutes that have passed since the last full hour, and ss (00 to 59) is the number of seconds since the last full minute. In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specifications require it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).

Where subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, "2359".

===Midnight 00:00 and 24:00===

In the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.

The notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. "00:00–24:00", "07:00–24:00"). Similarly, some railway timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.

While the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.&lt;ref name=acp121&gt;"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions – General] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07 }}", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3–6, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010&lt;!--IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.&lt;ref name=acp121/&gt;  In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps formerly specified 0001 to 2400.&lt;ref name="http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf"&gt;SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.  Expressing Military Time.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual was updated in June 2015 to use 0000 to 2359.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/SECNAV%20M%205216.5.pdf |title=Manual |date=June 2015 |website=/www.marines.mil |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Times after 24:00===
{{See also|Date and time notation in Japan#Time}}
[[Image:Klippekort.jpg|thumb|upright|Danish multi-ride ticket with non-standard timestamp "27:45".]]
Time-of-day notations beyond 24:00 (such as 24:01 or 25:00 instead of 00:01 or 01:00) are not commonly used and not covered by the relevant standards. However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the UK, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.

===Computer support===
In most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. Programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24 hour format.

===Military time===
In [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.

Military usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:
*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example "0340Z").
*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&amp;nbsp;a.m. is spoken "zero five forty-three" (casually) or "zero five four three" (military radio), as opposed to "five forty-three" or "five four three".
*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and thus given word designations via the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC−5) would be written "0600R" and spoken "zero six hundred Romeo".
*Local time is designated as  zone J or "[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]". "1200J" ("twelve hundred Juliett") is noon local time.
*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (or [[Coordinated Universal Time]]) is designated time zone Z, and thus called "Zulu time".
*Hours are always "hundred", never "thousand"; 1000 is "ten hundred" not "one thousand"; 2000 is "twenty hundred" not "two thousand".

==History==
[[Image:Florence-Duomo-Clock.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Face with Four Prophets/Evangelists'' (1443) in the [[Florence Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Clock 24 J.jpg|thumb|The 24 hour tower clock in [[Venice]] that lists hours 1 to 12 twice]]
The 24-hour time system has its origins in the Egyptian astronomical system of [[decans]], and has been used for centuries by scientists, astronomers, navigators, and [[horologists]]. In [[East Asia]], time notation was 24-hour before westernization in modern times. Western-made clocks were changed into 12 dual-hours style when they were shipped to [[China]] in the [[Qing dynasty]]. There are many surviving examples of clocks built using the 24-hour system, including the famous [[Orloj]] in [[Prague]], and the [[Shepherd Gate Clock]] at [[Greenwich]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The first mechanical public clocks introduced in Italy were [[24-hour analog dial|mechanical 24-hour clocks]] which counted the 24 hours of the day from one half hour after sundown to the evening of the following day. The 24th hour was the last hour of day time.&lt;ref name="Rossum"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dohrn-Van Rossum |first=Gerhard |date=1996 |title=History of the Hour. Clock and Modern Temporal Orders |url= |location= |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page=114 |isbn=0226155110}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, striking clocks had to produce 300 strokes each day which required a lot of rope, and wore out the mechanism quickly, so some localities switched to ringing sequences of 1 to 12 twice (156 strokes), or even 1 to 6 repeated 4 times (84 strokes).&lt;ref name="Rossum"/&gt;

After missing a train while travelling in [[Ireland]] in 1876 because a printed schedule listed p.m. instead of a.m., [[Sir Sandford Fleming]] proposed a single 24-hour clock for the entire world, located at the centre of the Earth, not linked to any surface meridian – a predecessor to [[Coordinated Universal Time]].&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 1| pages = 345–366| last = Fleming| first = Sandford| title = Time-reckoning for the twentieth century| journal = Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution| date = 1886| url = https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/annualreportofbo18861smit}} Reprinted in 1889: {{Internet Archive|timereckoningfor00flem|''Time-reckoning for the twentieth century''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blaise |first1=Clark |title=Time lord: Sir Sandford Fleming and the creation of standard time |date=2001 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-375-40176-3 |pages=81–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early proponent of using the 24-hour clock as part of a programme to reform timekeeping, which also included establishing [[time zones]] and a standard [[prime meridian]].&lt;ref name="Creet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Creet |first1=Mario |title=Sandford Fleming and Universal Time |journal=Scientia Canadensis: Canadian Journal of the History of Science, Technology and Medicine |date=1990 |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=66–89 |doi=10.7202/800302ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was among the first organizations to adopt the 24-hour clock, at [[midsummer]] 1886.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' reports on a timetable using the 24-hour clock on a trip from [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]: {{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= A Canadian Tour |date= 2 October 1886 |page_number=8 |issue=31880 |column=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[International Meridian Conference]] in 1884, [[Lewis M. Rutherfurd]] proposed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That this universal day is to be a mean solar day; is to begin for all the world at the moment of midnight of the initial meridian coinciding with the beginning of the civil day and date of that meridian, and is to be counted from zero up to twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=imc&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference Held at Washington for the Purpose of Fixing a Prime Meridian and a Universal Day.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This resolution was adopted by the conference.&lt;ref name=imc/&gt;

A report by a government committee in the United Kingdom noted Italy as the first country among those mentioned to adopt 24-hour time nationally, in 1893.&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7736214|title=Memorandum CAB 24/110/21 (CP 1721), 'Report of the Committee upon the 24 hour method of expressing time'|date=4 August 1920|location=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], [[Kew]], [[UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries followed: France adopted it in 1912 (the French army in 1909), followed by Denmark (1916), and Greece (1917). By 1920, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Switzerland had switched, followed by Turkey (1925), and Germany (1927). By the early 1920s, many countries in Latin America had also adopted the 24-hour clock.{{citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Cite does not support many of these countries.}} Some of the railways in India had switched before the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref name="baird" /&gt;

During [[World War I]], the British Royal Navy adopted the 24-hour clock in 1915, and the Allied armed forces followed soon after,&lt;ref name="baird" /&gt; with the British Army switching officially in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'': 1918 September 19, p.  3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian armed forces first started to use the 24-hour clock in late 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Dancocks, Daniel G. ''Gallant Canadians: The Story of the 10th Canadian Infantry Battalion 1914–1919''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the [[US Navy]] was the first US organization to adopt the system; the [[US Army]], however, did not officially adopt the 24-hour clock until [[World War II]], on July 1, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pittsburgh Press'', 1942 July 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the [[24-hour clock in the United Kingdom]] has grown steadily since the beginning of the 20th century, although attempts to make the system official failed more than once.&lt;ref name="counting-time"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boardman |first=Peter |date=July 2011 |url=http://clock24.nfshost.com/counting-time.html |title=Counting Time: a brief history of the 24-hour clock}}{{Self-published source|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the [[BBC]] switched to the 24-hour clock for broadcast announcements and programme listings. The experiment was halted after five months following a lack of enthusiasm from the public, and the BBC continued using the 12-hour clock.&lt;ref name="counting-time"/&gt; In the same year, the US airlines [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American World Airways Corporation]] and [[Western Airlines]] both adopted the 24-hour clock.&lt;ref&gt;Sarasota Herald Tribune 1943 May 14&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the BBC uses a mixture of both the 12-hour and the 24-hour clock.&lt;ref name="counting-time"/&gt; [[British Rail]] and [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] switched to the 24-hour clock for timetables in 1964.&lt;ref name="counting-time" /&gt; A mixture of the 12- and 24-hour clocks similarly prevails in other English-speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries: French speakers have adopted the [[24-hour clock in Canada]] much more broadly than English speakers, and [[date and time notation in Australia|Australia]] also uses both systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">The '''ACM Computing Classification System''' ('''CCS''') is a subject classification system for [[computing]] devised by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM). The system is comparable to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) in scope, aims, and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area.

=={{anchor|CRCS 1964|CCS 1982|CCS 1983|CCS 1987|CCS 1991|CCS 1998|CCS 2012}}History==
The system has gone through seven revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, 1998, and the now current version in 2012.

==Structure==
The ACM Computing Classification System, version 2012, has a revolutionary change in some areas, for example, in "Software" that now is called "Software and its engineering" which has three main subjects:
* Software organization and properties. This subject addresses properties of the software itself. 
* Software notations and tools. This subject covers programming languages and other tools for writing programs.
* Software creation and management. This subject covers human activities including software management.

It is hierarchically structured in four levels. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains:
: Computing methodologies
:: [[Artificial intelligence]]
::: [[Knowledge representation and reasoning]]
:::: [[Ontology engineering]]

'''''A Satire of the Three Estates''''' ([[Middle Scots]]: ''Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis''), is a [[satirical]] [[morality play]] in [[Middle Scots]], written by [[makar]] [[David Lyndsay|Sir David Lyndsay]]. The complete play was first performed outside in the playing field at [[Cupar]], [[Fife]] in June 1552 during the Midsummer holiday, where the action took place under Castle Hill. It was subsequently performed in [[Edinburgh]], also outdoors, in 1554. The full text was first printed in 1602 and extracts were copied into the ''[[Bannatyne Manuscript]]''. The ''Satire'' is an attack on the [[Three Estates#The Three Estates|Three Estates]] represented in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] – the clergy, lords and burgh representatives, symbolised by the characters ''Spiritualitie'', ''Temporalitie'' and ''Merchant''. The clergy come in for the strongest criticism. The work portrays the social tensions present at this pivotal moment in [[Scottish history]].

==Synopsis==
A complete version of the play was printed by Robert Charteris as, ''Ane (Pleasant) Satyre of the Thrie Estaits, in Commendation of Vertew and Vituperation of Vyce'', Edinburgh (1602).&lt;ref&gt;"Pleasant" appears in the title on the first page of the play, not on the title-page of Charteris's (1602) edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part there are 27 different characters. In the second part seven more are added. The key characters are; King Humanity, Divine Correction, Sensuality, Spirituality, Temporality, Gude Counsel and Chastity.

The play opens with Diligence delivering a sermon on good kingship. The main character, young King Humanity, then appears and is at first led astray by Sensuality and the Vices. His false counsellors introduce him to a mistress, Sensuality, which is the starting point of his disconnection from the moral way of life. He is then fooled by three disguised liars. Gude Counsel is sent to prison by the liars who already have taken control of King Humanitie's mind. With the beginning of his lecherous new life the king forgets about the moral virtues and can no longer judge properly. He consigns Charity and Verity to the stocks. In the course of the following scenes the audience sees how the three so called Vices (Discretion, Devotion and Sapience) try to get rid of everything and everyone who could be dangerous to them. For instance Lady Chastitie, who is homeless since the church in Scotland is not as it was meant to be, begs for shelter from Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and finally the People but is rejected in each case. In the end when Lady Chastitie is sent to prison by the Vices, Divine Correction enters the stage. This is the moment when the vices know that their time has come to an end and they flee and take away the king’s treasure box. Correction frees Gude Counsel, Chastitie and Vertie. He advises the young king to call a parliament and gives him advice regarding a successful reign.

The second part starts with an interruption. A member of the King's realm, known only as The Poor Man, emerges from the audience, establishes an alliance with John Commonweal to demand reform, and Diligence reappears to announce that the King will seek to improve his realm. Afterwards the Pardoner enters the scene and tries to sell pardoners. Poor Man hears that and buys pardoners worth ‘ane groat’. But Poor Man is not satisfied and gets angry and so they start to argue. In the following scene Diligence opens parliament and King Humanitie, Correction, the king’s courtiers and the virtues enter. The three estates greet the king and parliament is opened. John Commonweal stands up and talks to the King and Correction. He reveals all the failures of the estates. In the course of the following hearing Temporalitie gets punished but as this estate wants to cooperate this is just a short episode. Spiritualitie does not agree on what is said about their estate and fights back. But there are too many accusations against this estate and therefore they also have to give in. The three Vices are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Flatterie tried to get away by betraying his fellows Falsehood and Deceit but this did not work. In the end of the second part the three vices Deceit, Falsehood and Flatterie are allowed to say something before they are hanged. After the execution of the vices  and a rousing speech by Folie, Diligence closes the play and advises the audience to go their ways and enjoy their time.&lt;ref&gt;Edington, Carol, ''Court &amp; Culture in Renaissance Scotland'', pp.221-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixteenth century performances==

===Interlude at Linlithgow, 1540===
[[File:Linlithgowpalace 180609 - 03.jpg|thumb| The 1540 interlude was performed in the hall of [[Linlithgow Palace]]]]
The 1931 edition of Lindsay's works by Douglas Hamer hypothesized different forms of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount'', vol.2, Scottish Text Society (1931-4), pp.1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The critic John MacQueen proposed the play might have composed by Lindsay as early as 1532 for the court of the young [[James V of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, ''Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', ''SSL''(1965-6), 129-43.&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of the play is recorded in the [[Treasurer of Scotland|royal treasurer's accounts]] and an English agent's report to [[Thomas Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.7 (1907), pp.276-7, purchase of costumes in Jan. 1540&lt;/ref&gt; This short play or 'interlude' performed in January 1540 used characters who later appeared in the ''Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', and had the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Spencer Kantrowitz, ''Dramatic Allegory:Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', University of Nebraska Press, 1975.  Greg Walker,'Sir David Lindsay's Ane Satire of the Thrie Estaitis,' ''Scottish Literary Journal'', 16.2 (Nov. 1989); Roderick Lyall, ''Ane Satyre of The Thrie Estaitis'', edited with an introduction and commentary, Canongate Classics 18, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by the Englishman [[William Eure, 1st Baron Eure|William Eure]] to [[Thomas Cromwell]] on 26 January 1540 gives a description of the interlude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=76159 ''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol.15 (1894), no.114], link to British History Online, does not include synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; Eure, a Border Warden and Privy Councillor, had spoken to [[Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule|Sir Thomas Bellenden]] at [[Coldstream]], who described the performance at [[Linlithgow Palace]] before James, his wife [[Mary of Guise]] and his bishops and council on the feast of the Epiphany. As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, Eure obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact who saw the play at Linlithgow, and enclosed in his letter the synopsis written by his spy .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2zYIAQAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846)], pp.279-285&lt;/ref&gt; This description corresponds with the expanded later text of Lindsay's play. A king was shown with his courtiers, Placebo, Picthanke, and Flatterye. A Poor Man made his complaint, and was answered by a Burgess, a Man at Arms and a Bishop, who represented the three estates of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. The Poor Man mentioned the real events of James V executing both [[Johnnie Armstrong|John Armstrong]] (of Staplegordon; in ballads the Laird o'[[Gilnockie Tower|Gilnockie]]), hanged in July 1530, and 'Sym the Laird,' who was hanged in February 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Jamie, ''James V'', (1998), pp.77-83&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the poor man was described in the spy's synopsis;&lt;blockquote&gt;"After them come a poor Man, who did go up and down the scaffald, making a heavy complaint that he was harried (chased) through the Courtier's place, where through he hade strayled (lost) his house, his wife and children beggyng thair bread, and so of many thousand in Scotland, whiche would make the Kyng's Grace lose of men if his Grace stod neide (required), saying there was no remedy to be gotten, for though he would suite to the King's Grace, he was neither acquainted with Controller nor Treasurer, and without them might no man get no goodness of the King. And after, he spered (asked) for the King, and when he was shewed the Man that was King in the play, he answered and said he was no King, for there was but one King, which made all and governethe all, who is eternal, to whom he and all earthly Kings are but officers, of the which they must make reckoning. And so forth much more to that effect. And then he looked to the King, and said he was not the King of Scotland, for there was another King in Scotland that hanged John Armestrang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other more, which had pacified the country, and stanched theft, but he had left one thing undone, which pertained as well to his charge as th'other. And when he was asked what that was, he made a long narration of the oppression of the poor, by the taking of the 'corse presaunte beists' (animals due as [[tithes]] at funerals), and of the harrying of poor men by [[Consistory court|Consistory law]], and of many other abussions of the spiritualitie and Churche, with many long stories and authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846), 283-5 (here modernized)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eure said he had talked with Bellenden, a member of the council of [[James V of Scotland]] about the possibility of a [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation of the 'spirituality' in Scotland]]. The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dI_AAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Pinkerton, John, ''The History Of Scotland From The Accession Of The House Of Stuart To That Of Mary'', vol.2, (1791), pp.494-497]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cupar Banns, 1552===
The performance at Cupar on 7 June 1552 was heralded by a short piece called the ''Cupar Banns'' announcing the play, presumably also written by Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=86UlAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s David Lyndsay's ''Cupar Banns'' in, John Pinkerton, ''Scottish Poems Reprinted From Scarce Editions'', vol.2 (1792)]&lt;/ref&gt; This has three sections of comic drama as a foretaste of the ''Satire''; the Cotter and his wife, Bessy and the Auld Man, and Fynlaw of the Foot Band, introduced by the 'Nuncius' and linked by the Fool. The characters of the three parts are supposed to be members of the ''Satire's'' audience. The ''Banns'' with some stage directions are found only in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript."&lt;ref&gt;Newlyn, Evelyn S., 'Traditions of Myth in The Cupar Banns', in, ''The European Sun'', Tuckwell (1993), pp.355-367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh, 1554, and the Charteris synopsis===
Some preparations for the Edinburgh performance on Sunday 14 August 1554 were made by the Burgh Council. [[William MacDowall]] with six carpenters built a stage of boards, a seat for [[Mary of Guise]] and the French ambassador [[Henri Cleutin]], and a 'Convoy House', at the [[Calton Hill|Greenside playfield]], with the [[gallows|gallows, 'jebbettis,']] used in the final scene.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, ''The Renaissance in Scotland'', Brill (1994), p.206&lt;/ref&gt; The town council paid the wages of 12 minstrels, and after the play treated the actors to dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/edinburghrecord01edingoog#page/n150/mode/2up Adam, Robert, ed., ''Edinburgh Records: The Burgh Accounts'', vol.1 (1899), p.110]: ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer'', vol.10 (1913), p.232:[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58529 Marwick, ed., ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1528-1557'', (1871), entries from 1554] via British History Online, (The other play event mentioned on 15 June 1554 was the entry of Guise as Regent)&lt;/ref&gt;

The printer Henry Charteris mentioned the Edinburgh performance in his introduction to Lindsay's ''Warkis'' (1568), saying how the clergy were surprised by the play and considered taking revenge. Charteris gave this summary of the ''Satire'';&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in the presence of the Quene Regent, and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane exceeding greit nowmber of pepill. lestand fra 9 houris afoir none till 6 houris at evin, quhair, amangis mony baith grave materis and merie trickis, he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Persone (Parson), ane Freir, and ane Nun, deckit up in their papisticall ornamentis and maner of raiment. And theirefter broicht in King Correction, quha reformand sindie deformities in his realme, passit to the tryall of the Clergie. And findand thame to be altogether Idiotis, unworthie of ony functioun ecclesiasticall, dicernit thame to be degradit of their dignateis, and spulzeit (deprived) of their offices, quhilk beand executit, thay war fund bot verray fulis, hypocrites, flatteris &amp; nouchtie persones."&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of David Lindsay'', vol.1, STS (1931), p.398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' contains only selected "merry interludes" from the 1554 Greenside performance, the copyist George Bannatyne omitted the "grave matter" because the church had been reformed in reality in the 1560 [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]], and he noted, "the samyne abuse is weill reformit in Scotland." Stage directions in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' mention the settings of "houses", the "King's seat" and "palyeoun" tent, and props for the scene of the Poor Man and the [[Indulgence|Pardoner]], "Heir thay feight togeddir and the puir man sall cast doun the burd and cast the [[relic|rillickis]] in the watter."&lt;ref&gt;Tod Ritchie, W. ed., ''Banntyne Manuscript'', 4 vols., STS: ''Facsimile Bannatyne Manuscript'', NLS / Scolar Press (1980), f.182: Pinkerton, ed., ''Scottish Poems: the Bannatyne Interludes'', (1792), pp.23, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
The play's first complete modern production occurred on August 24, 1948, at the Edinburgh Festival with a modernised text by [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]] and directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], featuring [[Stanley Baxter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=9621 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1948 production]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Callow]] and [[Fulton Mackay]] acted in a 1973 Edinburgh Festival production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=16770 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1973 production]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thrie Estaitis banner 1982.JPG|thumb|300p|New College, Edinburgh was the venue for the 1982 production]]

Mary McCluskey directed a performance by young people in July 1996 as part of Scottish Youth Theatre's Summer Festival. The script was translated into modern Scots by Fiona McGarry, and the play was performed in the round in The Cottier Theatre, Glasgow, with an original score.

[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] adapted the play as a contemporary morality ''A Satire of the Four Estaites'', which was presented by [[Wildcat Theatre Company]] at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], also in 1996.&lt;ref name=mcgrath&gt;From the programme to the production.&lt;/ref&gt; This production opened on 16 August 1996 and starred [[Sylvester McCoy]].&lt;ref name=mcgrath/&gt;

The play was quoted at the opening of the new [[Scottish Parliament]], a mark illustrating its importance to modern Scots.

A new performance at Linlithgow Palace and [[Stirling Castle]] based on the story of the 1540 interlude took place in 2013 using a cast drawn from stage and screen.  In Linlithgow an open-air stage was erected on the Peel looking out across the loch for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/performing-arts/play-that-shook-king-returns-to-linlithgow-palace-1-2783441 ''Scotsman Newspaper'': Plans for 40-player presentation of the ''Satire'' at Linlithgow Peel, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The ''Satire'' is notable for being one of the earliest recorded instances of ''[[fuck]],'' predating any English language forms but preceded in the [[Scots language]] by the [[makar]] [[William Dunbar]] (Oxford English Dictionary entry.)

==Excerpt from the 1602 text==
A complete version of the play was printed in 1602, see external links for an edition of the text. In this extract Diligence meets the Pauper, who begins his complaint, including the practice of the parish priest claiming livestock at funerals which was mentioned in the 1540 interlude, (Lines 1954-2028);&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Fitzedward, ed., ''Ane Satire'', EETS, pp.459-252&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A priori'' and ''a posteriori''}}
The [[Latin]] phrases '''''a priori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the earlier") and '''''a posteriori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the later") are [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[term of art|terms of art]] popularized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (first published in 1781, second edition in 1787), one of the most influential works in the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Birdarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham Bird |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=439 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in their Latin forms they appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|BCE}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

These terms are used with respect to reasoning ([[epistemology]]) to distinguish "necessary conclusions from first premises" (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from "conclusions based on [[sense observation]]" which must follow it. Thus, the two kinds of [[knowledge]], [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]], or [[argument]], may be glossed:

*''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of [[experience]], as with [[mathematics]] (3 + 2 = 5), [[tautology (grammar)|tautologies]] ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[pure reason]] (e.g., [[Ontological argument|ontological proofs]]).{{refn|[[Galen Strawson]] has stated that an ''a priori'' argument is one in which "you can see that it is [[Truth|true]] just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref name="Galen Strawson interviewed by Tamler Sommers"&gt;{{harvnb|Sommers|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
*[[A posteriori knowledge|''A posteriori'' knowledge]] or justification depends on [[experience]] or [[empirical evidence]], as with most aspects of [[science]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal knowledge]].

There are many points of view on these two types of knowledge, and their relationship gives rise to one of the oldest problems in [[modern philosophy]].

The terms ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' are primarily used as [[adjective]]s to modify the [[noun]] "knowledge" (for example, "''a priori'' knowledge"). However, "''a priori''" is sometimes used to modify other nouns, such as "truth". Philosophers also may use "apriority" and "aprioricity" as nouns to refer (approximately) to the quality of being "''a priori''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

Although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labeled two separate epistemological notions. See also the related distinctions: [[deductive reasoning|deductive]]/[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|necessary/contingent]].

==Examples==
The intuitive distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge (or justification) is best seen via examples, as below:

;''A priori''
:Consider the proposition, "If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days."  This is something that one knows ''a priori'', because it expresses a statement that one ''can'' derive by reason alone. 
;''A posteriori''
:Compare this with the [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] expressed by the sentence, "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936."  This is something that (if true) one must come to know ''a posteriori'', because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.

==Analyticity and necessity==
===Relation to the analytic-synthetic===
{{details|Analytic-synthetic distinction}}

Several philosophers reacting to Kant sought to explain ''a priori'' knowledge without appealing to, as [[Paul Boghossian]] (MD) explains, "a special faculty ... that has never been described in satisfactory terms."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Boghossian|2003|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, popular among the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the "analytic explanation of the a priori."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996" /&gt; The distinction between [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic and synthetic propositions]] was first introduced by Kant. While Kant's original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of the distinction primarily involves, as the American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] put it, the notions of "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact."&lt;ref name=Q21&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone, while ''a posteriori analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning ''and'' certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the ''a priori'', all ''a priori'' knowledge is analytic; so ''a priori'' knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition, since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question.  In short, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity.

However, the analytic explanation of ''a priori'' knowledge has undergone several criticisms.  Most notably, Quine argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate. Quine states: "But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the soundness of Quine's critique is highly disputed, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the ''a priori'' in terms of the analytic.

===Relation to the necessary and contingent===
The metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge. A proposition that is ''[[Modal logic|necessarily true]]'' is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, it is said to be true in every [[possible world]]). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is ''contingently true'' is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is ''not'' true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known ''a priori'', because "[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, "[[logical positivism|Positivism]], in particular, took it for granted that ''a priori'' truths must be necessary...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fodor|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic propositions]] were largely taken to be "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact",&lt;ref name=Q21/&gt; while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the [[truth-value]] of synthetic propositions.

Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. The American philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), for example, provided strong arguments against this position.  Kripke argued that there are necessary ''a posteriori'' truths, such as the proposition that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (if it is true). According to Kripke, this statement is necessarily true (since water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary) and ''a posteriori'' (since it is known only through empirical investigation). Following such considerations of Kripke and others (such as [[Hilary Putnam]]), philosophers tend to distinguish more clearly the notion of aprioricity from that of necessity and analyticity.

Kripke's definitions of these terms, however, diverge in subtle ways from those of Kant. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and ''a priori'' would, according to Stephen Palmquist, best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it "analytic a posteriori".{{refn|group=nb |In this pair of articles, Stephen Palmquist demonstrates that the context often determines how a particular proposition should be classified. A proposition that is synthetic ''a posteriori'' in one context might be analytic ''a priori'' in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmquist|1987|pp=269, 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Aaron Sloman]] presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical and necessary/contingent) in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=A.|date=1965-10-01|title='Necessary', 'a priori' and 'analytic'|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/26.1.12|journal=Analysis|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=12–16|doi=10.1093/analys/26.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It did not assume "possible world semantics" for the third distinction, merely that some part of ''this'' world might have been different.

Thus, the relationship between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity is not easy to discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the ''a priori''/''a posteriori'' distinction is [[epistemology|epistemological]], the analytic/synthetic distinction is [[linguistics|linguistic]], and the necessary/contingent distinction is [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early uses===
The phrases "''a priori''" and "''a posteriori''" are [[Latin]] for "from what comes before" and "from what comes later" (or, less literally, "from first principles, before experience" and "after experience"). They appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of ''a priori'' knowledge (though not called by that name) is [[Plato]]'s [[Innatism|theory of recollection]], related in the  dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' (380&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), according to which something like ''a priori'' knowledge is knowledge inherent, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] in the human mind.

[[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], a 14th-century logician, wrote on both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. W. Leibniz]] introduced a distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' criteria for the possibility of a notion in his (1684) short treatise "Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' arguments for the existence of God appear in his ''[[Monadology]]'' (1714).&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[George Berkeley]] outlined the distinction in his 1710 work ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (para. XXI).

===Immanuel Kant===
The 18th-century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1781) advocated a blend of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] theories. Kant says, "Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises [is caused by] from experience"&lt;ref name="kant_1781"&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1781|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, ''a priori'' cognition is [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], or based on the ''form'' of all possible experience, while ''a posteriori'' cognition is empirical, based on the ''content'' of experience. Kant states, "[…] it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving merely the ''occasion'' [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect]."&lt;ref name="kant_1781"/&gt; Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. And unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the [[condition of possibility|conditions of possible experience]]. These ''a priori'', or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that ''a priori'' intuitions can be "triggered" by experience). 

Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a [[transcendental logic]] with which to consider the deduction of the ''a priori'' in its pure form. [[Space]], [[time]] and [[causality]] are considered pure ''a priori'' intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure ''a priori'' intuitions are established via his [[transcendental aesthetic]] and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these ''a priori'' forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.&amp;nbsp;e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental deduction]] and it is the central argument of his major work, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the ''a priori'', this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of [[subjectivity]],  what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.

===Johann Fichte===
After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of [[German Idealism]]. One of these philosophers was [[Johann Fichte]]. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], accused him of rejecting the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge:

{{Quote|... Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

[[File:Flammablecabinet.jpg|thumb|right|In English, "inflammable" means "combustible", but can be taken to mean "non-flammable" by people who wrongly treat the "in-" as meaning "not",&lt;ref name=strunk&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk and White|title=The Elements of Style|year=1979|publisher=MacMillan|location=New York|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; so English safety labels typically use "flammable".]]

An '''auto-antonym''' or '''autantonym''', also called a '''contronym''' or '''contranym''',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/nym_autoantonyms.html|title=Nym Words &gt; Autoantonyms|website=www.fun-with-words.com|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word with multiple meanings ([[word sense|senses]]) of which one is the reverse of another. For example, the word ''[[wikt:cleave|cleave]]'' can mean "to cut apart" or "to bind together". This phenomenon is called '''enantiosemy''',&lt;ref&gt;Pages 11 and 77 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003, where "enantiosemy" is mentioned along with "auto-opposite".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/09/simpleton-capsize-kibosh-hobo-bragi-sanction-coleslaw/|title=Etymology gleanings for September 2013|last=Liberman|first=Anatoly|date=25 September 2013|work=Oxford Etymologist|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=The coexistence of two opposite meanings in a word is called enantiosemy, and the examples are rather numerous.|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''enantionymy''' or '''antilogy''' (''[[wikt:enantio-#Prefix|enantio-]]'' means "opposite"). An enantiosemic term is necessarily [[polysemy|polysemic]].

== Nomenclature ==
The terms "autantonym" and "contronym" were coined by [[Joseph Twadell Shipley]] in 1960 and [[Jack Herring]] in 1962, respectively. An auto-antonym is alternatively called an '''antagonym''', '''Janus word''' (after [[Janus|the Roman god with two faces]]),&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; '''enantiodrome''', '''self-antonym''', '''antilogy''', or '''addad''' (Arabic, singular '''didd''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Addad' : a study of homo-polysemous opposites in Arabic|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3849764|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gall|first=Nick|title=Antagonyms|url=http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/2003/11/antagonyms.html|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic mechanisms ==
Some pairs of contronyms are true [[homograph]]s, i.e., distinct words with different [[etymology]] which happen to have the same form.  For instance ''cleave'' "separate" is from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''clēofan'', while ''cleave'' "adhere" is from Old English ''clifian'', which was pronounced differently. The [[King James Bible]] often uses "let" in the sense of "forbid", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb ''lettan'' 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning "allow", which is derived from the Old English verb ''lǣtan'' 'leave, allow, let on lease (etc.)'. Still, the alternate meaning of "let" can be found today in the legal phrase "without let or hindrance" and in ball games such as [[tennis#Play of a single point|tennis]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[table tennis]], and [[racquetball]].

Other contronyms are a form of [[polysemy]], but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, ''sanction''—"permit" or "[[sanctions (law)|penalize]]"; ''bolt'' (originally from [[crossbow]]s)—"leave quickly" or "fix/immobilize"; ''fast''—"moving rapidly" or "unmoving".  Some [[English language|English]] examples result from [[noun]]s being [[Conversion (word formation)|verbed]] in the patterns of "add &lt;noun&gt; to" and "remove &lt;noun&gt; from"; e.g. ''dust'', ''seed'', ''stone''. [[Denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s can drift or branch over centuries. An [[apocrypha]]l story relates how [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles II]] (or sometimes [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]) described [[St Paul's Cathedral]] (using contemporaneous English) as "awful, pompous, and artificial," with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of "awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/10/31/st-pauls-cathedral/|title=St Paul’s Cathedral Is Amusing, Awful, and Artificial|last=O’Toole|first=Garson|date=31 October 2012|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative words such as ''bad'' and ''sick'' sometimes acquire ironic senses referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (''that outfit is bad as hell''; ''lyrics full of sick burns'').

Some contronyms result from differences in [[varieties of English]]. For example, to ''[[table (verb)|table]]'' a bill means "to put it up for debate" in [[British English]], while it means "to remove it from debate" in [[Comparison of American and British English#Words and phrases with different meanings|American English]] (where British English would have "shelve"). To ''[[barrack (verb)|barrack]]'' for anyone in [[Australian English]] is to loudly demonstrate your support, while it expresses disapproval and contempt in [[American English]] and [[British English]].

Some words contain simultaneous opposing or competing meanings in the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include [[blend word]]s such as ''[[coopetition]]'' (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition), ''[[frenemy]]'' (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy), ''[[interdependence]]'', ''[[glocalization]]'' etc. These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings.

Auto-antonyms exist in many languages, as the following examples show.

In [[Latin language|Latin]], ''[[wikt:sacer#Latin|sacer]]'' has the double meaning "sacred, holy" and "accursed, infamous". Greek [[wikt:δημιουργός#Greek|δημιουργός]] gave Latin its ''[[wikt:demiurgus#Latin|demiurgus]]'', from which English got its ''[[wikt:demiurge#English|demiurge]]'', which can refer either to [[God]] as the [[creator deity|creator]] or to the [[devil]], depending on philosophical context.

In many languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so it can refer to any of the doings or persons on either side of the transaction, that is, to the action of either the subject or the object, or to either the person who does something or the person to whom (or for whom) it is done. Other cues nail down the aspects of subject versus object. Thus there is a simple logic involved, despite that discussions of such words sometimes fixate on a superficial appearance of illogic (that is, "how can one word mean both?!"). Examples: 
* Verbs
** The [[German language|German]] verb ''[[wikt:ausleihen|ausleihen]]'' and the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] verb ''[[wikt:lainata|lainata]]'' can mean either "to lend" or "to borrow", with [[grammatical case|case]], pronouns, and mention of persons making the sense clear. The verb stem conveys that "a lending-and-borrowing event is occurring", and the other cues convey who is lending to whom. This makes sense because anytime lending is occurring, borrowing is simultaneously occurring; one cannot happen without the other.
** The English verb ''[[wikt:appropriate#Verb|appropriate]]'' has several senses with a unitary theme of assets being assigned; it can thus refer either to one giving assets to someone else or one taking assets for oneself. The superficial "contradiction" is that giving and taking are "opposites", but the unity is on the level of "assets being assigned". This is comparable to the German example with the lending-and-borrowing event: similarly, "opposite" sides of a single coin are (figuratively) involved. The coin analogy is useful because it reveals another latent English example of the same cognitive unity: One could ask why "[[coin flipping|flipping a coin]]" in English can "paradoxically" refer to either flipping and getting heads or flipping and getting tails. We don't have separate words, *''heads-ing'' and *''tails-ing''; rather, we have the one word, ''flipping''. Thus ''I flipped him for it'' at the same time that ''he flipped me for it''; it is not [[idiom (language structure)|the idiomatic nature]] of English to say that ''I *heads-ed him for it'' whereas ''he *tails-ed me for it'', although any language could potentially develop that contrasting pair. In the German example, the comparable thought is that ''I lendborrowed to him'' at the same time that ''he lendborrowed from me''—despite that English cannot idiomatically translate it that way because [[accidental gap|English currently lacks such a word as ''*lendborrow'']]. 
** The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] verb ''a închiria'' means "to rent" (as the [[wikt:lessee#English|lessee]] does) as well as "to let" (as the [[wikt:lessor#English|lessor]] does). 
** The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] verb ''kutoa'' means both "to remove" and "to add". 
** In his ''Limited Views: Essays on Ideas and Letters'', [[Qian Zhongshu]] gave some examples of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] auto-antonyms, like "廢" meaning both "to abolish" and "to establish". He named this kind of phenomenon "reverse symbolism"(反象以徵). 
* Adverbs
** {{lang-hi|कल}} and {{lang-ur|کل}} (''kal'' {{IPA-hns|kəl|}}) may mean either "yesterday" or "tomorrow" (disambiguated by the verb in the sentence). 
* Agent nouns
** The [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] [[cognates]], ''[[wikt:ospite|ospite]]'' and ''[[wikt:hôte|hôte]]'', respectively, also can mean "host" or "guest". Both words derive from the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:hospes|hospes]]'', which also carries both meanings.
* Adjectives
** Latin ''[[wikt:altus#Latin|altus]]'' can be translated to English as either "high" (↑) or "deep" (↓), whereas in Latin it has the single meaning "large in the vertical dimension" (↕) in English.
** English ''awesome'' can mean "inducing awe/respect" or "cool, splendid"

Contemporary English has some auto-antonym adjectives that are used for evaluating: ''sick'' can mean "ill" or "extremely good"; ''bad'' can mean "bad" or "excellent"; words like ''cool'' or ''in'' may be evaluate something that is "warm" or "out", respectively ("This new fireplace is cool." or "Outdoor activities are in, now."). We may hear evaluations like "pretty ugly", "ridiculously serious", "insanely rational", "incredibly trustworthy", "impossibly doable", "super sub-par".

Among [[profanity|profanities]], adjective or article decides its meaning, for example:
* "I'm not gonna be a bitch - I'm gonna be the bitch!"
* "Don't be an ass - be bad ass!"
* "The first pizza was shit; the second one, though, was the shit."
* "She thinks she's hot shit but she's not shit."

Seeming auto-antonyms can occur from translation. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], for example, ''[[wikt:aloha|aloha]]'' is translated both as “hello” and as “goodbye”, but the essential meaning of the word is "love," whether used as a greeting or farewell.  The [[Italian language|Italian]] greeting ''[[wikt:ciao|ciao]]'' is translated as "hello" or "goodbye" depending on the context; however, the original meaning was “(I'm your) slave."

'''Automated species identification''' is a method of making the expertise of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] available to ecologists, [[parataxonomy|parataxonomists]] and others via computers and other digital technology through [[artificial intelligence]].

== Introduction ==
The '''automated identification''' of biological objects such as [[insects]] (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., [[species]], guilds, characters) has been a dream among [[systematics|systematists]] for centuries. The goal of some of the first [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[biometric]] methods was to address the perennial problem of [[group discrimination]] and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological [[identification (biology)|identification]] has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 [[Daniel Janzen|Dan Janzen]]

updated the dream for a new audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spaceship lands. He steps out. He points it around. It says ‘friendly–unfriendly—edible–poisonous—safe– dangerous—living–inanimate’. On the next sweep it says ‘''Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides''—serpentine’. This has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a century ago.{{clarify|reason=how is this relevant?|date=January 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janzen’s preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their [[DNA]]. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen’s vision in the hands of the [[systematics]] and [[computer science]] community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for creating [[DNA barcode]]s, but also for identification based on [[digital images]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies why automated species identification had not become widely employed at this time and whether it would be a realistic option for the future. The authors found that "a small but growing number of studies sought to develop automated species identification systems based on morphological characters". An overview of 20 studies analyzing species’ structures, such as cells, pollen, wings, and genitalia, shows identification success rates between 40% and 100% on training sets with 1 to 72 species. However, they also identified four fundamental problems with these systems: (1) training sets—were too small (5-10 specimens per species) and their extension especially for rare species may be difficult, (2) errors in identification—are not sufficiently studied to handle them and to find systematics, (3) scaling—studies consider only small numbers of species (&lt;200 species), and (4) novel species — systems are restricted to the species they have been trained for and will classify any novel observation as one of the known species.

These studies propose a wealth of [[computer vision]] approaches, i.e., [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] reducing the high-dimensionality of the pixel-based image data while preserving the characteristic information as well as classification methods.  The vast majority of these studies analyzes [[Leaf|leaves]] for identification, while only 13 studies propose methods for [[flower]]-based identification. The reasons being that leaves can easier be collected and imaged and are available for most of the year. Proposed [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] capture generic object characteristic, i.e., [[shape]], texture, and [[color]] as well as leaf-specific characteristics, i.e., [[Leaf|venation]] and margin. The majority of studies still used datasets for evaluation that contained no more than 250 [[species]]. However, there is progress in this regard, one study uses a dataset with &gt;2k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joly|first=Alexis|last2=Goëau|first2=Hervé|last3=Bonnet|first3=Pierre|last4=Bakić|first4=Vera|last5=Barbe|first5=Julien|last6=Selmi|first6=Souheil|last7=Yahiaoui|first7=Itheri|last8=Carré|first8=Jennifer|last9=Mouysset|first9=Elise|date=2014-09-01|title=Interactive plant identification based on social image data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495411300071X|journal=Ecological Informatics|series=Special Issue on Multimedia in Ecology and Environment|volume=23|pages=22–34|doi=10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another with &gt;20k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Huisi|last2=Wang|first2=Lei|last3=Zhang|first3=Feng|last4=Wen|first4=Zhenkun|date=2015-08-01|title=Automatic Leaf Recognition from a Big Hierarchical Image Database|journal=International Journal of Intelligent Systems|language=en|volume=30|issue=8|pages=871–886|doi=10.1002/int.21729|issn=1098-111X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[species]].

These developments could not have come at a better time. As the [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very [[biodiversity]] whose preservation has become a global concern. In commenting on this problem in [[palaeontology]] as long ago as 1993, [[Roger Kaesler]] &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; recognized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have contributed so much to its success.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., [[agriculture]], [[biostratigraphy]]) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., [[Conservation biology|conservation]], biological [[oceanography]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]]). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.

[[Systematics]] too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many have identified use of the [[Internet]]— especially via the [[World Wide Web]] — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, [[GenBank]]-like system for accessing [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the [[taxonomic impediment]] or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.

Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and [[gene sequence]]s) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5615">The '''Blogger's Code of Conduct''' is a proposal by [[Tim O'Reilly]] for [[blog]]gers to enforce civility on their blogs by being civil themselves and moderating comments on their blog.  The code was proposed in 2007 due to threats made to blogger [[Kathy Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html|title=Call for a Blogger's Code of Conduct|publisher=O'Reilly Radar|first=Tim |last=O'Reilly|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|date=March 3, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409153021/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html |archivedate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the code was first reported by [[BBC News]], who quoted O'Reilly saying, "I do think we need some code of conduct around what is acceptable behaviour, I would hope that it doesn't come through any kind of regulation it would come through self-regulation.".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6502643.stm|title=Call for blogging code of conduct|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland the proposal for a code was raised in an article in [[Sunday Business Post]] in 2009 by [[Simon Palmer]], a radio presenter and PR consultant in Dublin, after false details in relation to a client had appeared on Irish blogs [http://www.businesspost.ie/#!search/simon%2520palmer Time To Raise Above Blog Standard]. After his comments he was subjected to sustained on line abuse from Irish bloggers and anonymous trolls and even received death threats.

In Nepal, 10 prominent bloggers signed a Code of Ethics for Bloggers, first proposed by [[Ujjwal Acharya]] and finalized after discussion among bloggers, on July 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalivoices.com/nepal-blog/2011/07/27/historic-bloggers-sign-code-of-ethics/|title=Historic: Bloggers sign Code of Ethics|publisher=The Radiant Star|first=Ujjwal |last=Acharya|authorlink=Ujjwal Acharya|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', O'Reilly and [[Jimmy Wales]] based their preliminary list on one developed by the [[BlogHer]] women's blogging support network&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Call for Manners in the World of Nasty Blogs| first=Brad |last=Stone|date=April 9, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/technology/09blog.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1346347088-tgkihQi2p1Jn13oBc48IFA}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, working with others, came up with a list of seven proposed ideas:
#Take responsibility not just for your own words, but for the comments you allow on your blog.
#Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.
#Consider eliminating anonymous comments.
#Don't feed the [[troll (internet)|troll]]s.
#Take the conversation offline, and talk directly, or find an intermediary who can do so.
#If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.
#Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.

Reaction to the proposal was internationally widespread among bloggers and media writers. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', the [[blogosphere]] described it as "excessive, unworkable and an open door to censorship."&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Braid 4perm.png|right|260px|thumbnail|The 24 elements of a [[permutation group]] on 4 elements as braids. All crossings shown are of the left-over-right type, but other choices are possible. Changing the order of the operations can change the result, meaning that the operations are non-commutative.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''braid group on {{math|''n''}} strands''' (denoted {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}), also known as the '''Artin braid group''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BraidGroup.html|title=Braid Group|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|date=|website=Wolfram Mathworld|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the group whose elements are equivalence classes of [[Braid theory|{{mvar|n}}-braids]] (e.g. under [[ambient isotopy]]), and whose [[group operation]] is composition of braids (see {{Section link||Introduction}}). Example applications of braid groups include [[knot theory]], where any knot may be represented as the closure of certain braids (a result known as [[Alexander's theorem]]); in [[mathematical physics]] where Artin's canonical presentation of the braid group corresponds to the [[Yang–Baxter equation]] (see {{Section link||Basic properties}}); and in [[monodromy]] invariants of algebraic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Daniel|last2=Suciu|first2=Alexander|date=1997|title=The Braid Monodromy of Plane Algebraic Curves and Hyperplane Arrangements|journal=Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici|volume=72|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s000140050017|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=285–315|arxiv=alg-geom/9608001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

===Intuitive description===
In this introduction let {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}; the generalization to other values of {{math|''n''}} will be straightforward. Consider two sets of four items lying on a table, with the items in each set being arranged in a vertical line, and such that one set sits next to the other. (In the illustrations below, these are the black dots.)  Using four strands, each item of the first set is connected with an item of the second set so that a one-to-one correspondence results. Such a connection is called a ''braid''. Often some strands will have to pass over or under others, and this is crucial: the following two connections are ''different'' braids:
:
{| valign="centre"
|-----
| [[File:braid s1 inv.png|The braid sigma 1^(-1)]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is different from&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:braid s1.png|The braid sigma 1]]
|}

On the other hand, two such connections which can be made to look the same by "pulling the strands" are considered ''the same'' braid:
:
{| valign="centre"
|-----
| [[File:braid s1 inv.png|The braid sigma 1^(-1)]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is the same as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:braid s1 inv alt.png|Another representation of sigma 1^(-1)]]
|}

All strands are required to move from left to right; knots like the following are ''not'' considered braids:
:
{| valign="centre"
|-----
| [[File:braid nobraid.png|Not a braid]]
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is not a braid
|}

Any two braids can be ''composed'' by drawing the first next to the second, identifying the four items in the middle, and connecting corresponding strands:
:
{| valign="centre"
|-----
| [[File:braid s3.png]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; composed with &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[File:braid s2.png]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; yields &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:braid s3s2.png]]
|}

Another example:
:
{| valign="centre"
|-----
| [[File:braid s1 inv s3 inv.png]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; composed with &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[File:braid s1 s3 inv.png]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; yields &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[File:braid s3 inv squared.png]]
|}
The composition of the braids {{math|σ}} and {{math|τ}} is written as {{math|στ}}.

The set of all braids on four strands is denoted by {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The above composition of braids is indeed a [[group (mathematics)|group]] operation. The [[identity element]] is the braid consisting of four parallel horizontal strands, and the [[inverse element|inverse]] of a braid consists of that braid which "undoes" whatever the first braid did, which is obtained by flipping a diagram such as the ones above across a vertical line going through its centre. (The first two example braids above are inverses of each other.)

===Formal treatment===

{{Main|Braid theory#Braids and configuration spaces|Configuration space (mathematics)#Connection to braid groups}}

To put the above informal discussion of braid groups on firm ground, one needs to use the [[homotopy]] concept of [[algebraic topology]], defining braid groups as [[fundamental group]]s of a [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]. Alternatively, one can define the braid group purely algebraically via the braid relations, keeping the pictures in mind only to guide the intuition.

===History===
Braid groups were introduced explicitly by [[Emil Artin]] in 1925, although (as [[Wilhelm Magnus]] pointed out in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume=372 |first=Wilhelm |last=Magnus|authorlink=Wilhelm Magnus |chapter=Braid groups: A survey |chapterurl=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2w7lp1402314k343/?p=8ca127a073654ea182c15cbecdeca393&amp;pi=3 |title=Proceedings of the Second International Conference on the Theory of Groups |publisher=Springer |year=1974 |isbn=978-3-540-06845-7 |pages=463–487 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) they were already implicit in [[Adolf Hurwitz]]'s work on [[monodromy]] from 1891.  In fact, as Magnus says, Hurwitz gave the interpretation of a braid group as the fundamental group of a configuration space (cf. [[braid theory]]), an interpretation that was lost from view until it was rediscovered by [[Ralph Fox]] and Lee Neuwirth in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Ralph|author1-link=Ralph Fox|last2= Neuwirth|first2= Lee|title=The braid groups|journal=Mathematica Scandinavica|volume= 10|year= 1962|pages= 119–126|mr=0150755|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-10518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic properties==

===Generators and relations===
Consider the following three braids:

{|
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:braid s1.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:braid s2.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:braid s3.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-----
&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Every braid in &lt;math&gt;B_4&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a composition of a number of these braids and their inverses. In other words, these three braids [[generating set of a group|generate]] the group &lt;math&gt;B_4&lt;/math&gt;.  To see this, an arbitrary braid is scanned from left to right for crossings; beginning at the top, whenever a crossing of strands &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt; is encountered, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is written down, depending on whether strand &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; moves under or over strand &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt;. Upon  reaching the right end, the braid has been written as a product of the σ's and their inverses.

It is clear that

::(i) {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}},

while the following two relations are not quite as obvious:

::(iia) {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}},
::(iib) {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}

(these relations can be appreciated best by drawing the braid on a piece of paper).  It can be shown that all other relations among the braids &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; already follow from these relations and the group axioms.

Generalising this example to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; strands, the group &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; can be abstractly defined via the following [[presentation of a group|presentation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n= \left \langle \sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_{n-1}| \sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i=\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}, \sigma_i\sigma_j=\sigma_j\sigma_i \right \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;

where in the first group of relations {{math|1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''−2}} and in the second group of relations, {{math|{{!}}''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''j''{{!}} ≥ 2}}. This presentation leads to generalisations of braid groups called [[Artin group]]s. The cubic relations, known as the '''braid relations''', play an important role in the theory of [[Yang–Baxter equation]].

===Further properties===
* The braid group {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[trivial group|trivial]], {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an infinite [[cyclic group]] {{math|'''Z'''}}, and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is isomorphic to the [[knot group]] of the [[trefoil knot]] – in particular, it is an infinite [[abelian group|non-abelian group]].
* The {{math|''n''}}-strand braid group {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} embeds as a [[subgroup]] into the {{math|(''n''+1)}}-strand braid group {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} by adding an extra strand that does not cross any of the first {{math|''n''}} strands. The increasing union of the braid groups with all {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} is the '''infinite braid group''' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* All non-identity elements of {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} have infinite [[order (group theory)|order]]; i.e., {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]].
*There is a left-invariant [[linear order]] on {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} called the [[Dehornoy order]].
* For {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} contains a subgroup isomorphic to the [[free group]] on two generators.
* There is a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → '''Z'''}} defined by {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ 1}}. So for instance, the braid {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is mapped to {{math|1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 {{=}} 3}}. This map corresponds to the [[abelianization]] of the braid group.

==Interactions==

===Relation with symmetric group and the pure braid group===
By forgetting how the strands twist and cross, every braid on {{math|''n''}} strands determines a [[permutation]] on {{math|''n''}} elements. This assignment is onto, compatible with composition, and therefore becomes a [[surjective]] [[group homomorphism]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from the braid group into the [[symmetric group]]. The image of the braid σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the transposition {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''i'', ''i''+1) ∈ ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. These transpositions generate the symmetric group, satisfy the braid group relations, and have order 2. This transforms the Artin presentation of the braid group into the [[Coxeter group|Coxeter presentation]] of the symmetric group:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \left \langle s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}| s_i s_{i+1} s_i=s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1}, s_i s_j = s_j s_i \text{ for } |i-j|\geq 2, s_i^2=1 \right\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the homomorphism {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the subgroup of {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} called the '''pure braid group on {{math|''n''}} strands''' and denoted {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In a pure braid, the beginning and the end of each strand are in the same position. Pure braid groups fit into a [[short exact sequence]]

: &lt;math&gt;1\to F_{n-1} \to P_n \to P_{n-1}\to 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This sequence splits and therefore pure braid groups are realized as iterated [[semidirect product|semi-direct products]] of free groups.

===Relation between {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the modular group===
[[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|thumb|376px|{{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[universal central extension]] of the modular group.]]

The braid group {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[universal central extension]] of the [[modular group]] {{math|PSL(2, '''Z''')}}, with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbf{R})} \to \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbf{R}).&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the modular group has trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the [[quotient group]] of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo its [[center (group theory)|center]], {{math|''Z''(''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and equivalently, to the group of [[inner automorphism]]s of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Here is a construction of this [[isomorphic|isomorphism]]. Define

:&lt;math&gt;a = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_1, \quad b = \sigma_1 \sigma_2.&lt;/math&gt;

From the braid relations it follows that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Denoting this latter product as {{math|''c''}}, one may verify from the braid relations that

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 c \sigma_1^{-1} = \sigma_2 c \sigma_2^{-1}=c&lt;/math&gt;

implying that {{math|''c''}} is in the center of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let {{math|''C''}} denote the [[subgroup]] of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[group generator|generated]] by {{math|''c''}}, since {{math|''C''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''Z''(''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, it is a [[normal subgroup]] and one may take the [[quotient group]] {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''C''}}. We claim {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''C'' ≅ PSL(2, '''Z''')}}; this isomorphism can be given an explicit form. The [[coset]]s {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''C''}} and {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''C''}} map to

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1C \mapsto R=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \sigma_2C \mapsto L^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the standard left and right moves on the [[Stern–Brocot tree]]; it is well known that these moves generate the modular group.

Alternately, one common [[presentation of a group|presentation]] for the modular group is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle v,p\, |\, v^2=p^3=1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;v=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad p=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Mapping {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''b''}} to {{math|''p''}} yields a surjective group homomorphism {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → PSL(2, '''Z''')}}.

The center of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to {{math|''C''}}, a consequence of the facts that {{math|''c''}} is in the center, the modular group has trivial center, and the above surjective homomorphism has [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] {{math|''C''}}.

===Relationship to the mapping class group and classification of braids===
The braid group {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} can be shown to be isomorphic to the [[mapping class group]] of a [[punctured disk]] with {{math|''n''}} punctures. This is most easily visualized by imagining each puncture as being connected by a string to the boundary of the disk; each mapping homomorphism that permutes two of the punctures can then be seen to be a homotopy of the strings, that is, a braiding of these strings.

Via this mapping class group interpretation of braids, each braid may be classified as [[Nielsen-Thurston classification|periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov]].

===Connection to knot theory===
If a braid is given and one connects the first left-hand item to the first right-hand item using a new string, the second left-hand item to the second right-hand item etc. (without creating any braids in the new strings), one obtains a [[link (knot theory)|link]], and sometimes a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]. [[Alexander's theorem]] in [[braid theory]] states that the converse is true as well: every [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] and every [[link (knot theory)|link]] arises in this fashion from at least one braid; such a braid can be obtained by cutting the link. Since braids can be concretely given as words in the generators {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this is often the preferred method of entering knots into computer programs.

=== Computational aspects ===
The [[word problem for groups|word problem]] for the braid relations is efficiently solvable and there exists a [[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]] for elements of {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in terms of the generators {{math|σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. (In essence, computing the normal form of a braid is the algebraic analogue of "pulling the strands" as illustrated in our second set of images above.) The free [[GAP (computer algebra system)|GAP computer algebra system]] can carry out computations in {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if the elements are given in terms of these generators. There is also a package called ''CHEVIE'' for GAP3 with special support for braid groups. The word problem is also efficiently solved via the [[Lawrence–Krammer representation]].

In addition to the word problem, there are several known hard computational problems that could implement braid groups, applications in [[cryptography]] have been suggested.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}}

==Actions==
In analogy with the action of the symmetric group by permutations, in various mathematical settings there exists a natural action of the braid group on {{math|''n''}}-tuples of objects or on the {{math|''n''}}-folded [[tensor product]] that involves some "twists". Consider an arbitrary group {{math|''G''}} and let {{math|''X''}} be the set of all {{math|''n''}}-tuples of elements of {{math|''G''}} whose product is the [[identity element]] of {{math|''G''}}. Then {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} [[group action|acts]] on {{math|''X''}} in the following fashion:

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i \left (x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_i, x_{i+1},\ldots, x_n \right)= \left (x_1,\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, x_{i+1}^{-1}x_i x_{i+1}, x_{i+2},\ldots,x_n \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the elements {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} exchange places and, in addition, {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is twisted by the [[inner automorphism]] corresponding to {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} — this ensures that the product of the components  of {{math|''x''}} remains the identity element. It may be checked that the braid group relations are satisfied and this formula indeed defines a group action of {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on {{math|''X''}}. As another example, a [[braided monoidal category]] is a [[monoidal category]] with a braid group action. Such structures play an important role in modern [[mathematical physics]] and lead to quantum [[knot invariant]]s.

===Representations===
Elements of the braid group {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} can be represented more concretely by matrices. One classical such [[group representation|representation]] is [[Burau representation]], where the matrix entries are single variable [[Laurent polynomial]]s. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was [[faithful representation|faithful]], but the answer turned out to be negative for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5}}. More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were [[linear group|linear]]. In 1990, [[Ruth Lawrence]] described a family of more general "Lawrence representations" depending on several parameters. In 1996, C. Nayak and [[Frank Wilczek]] posited that in analogy to projective representations of {{math|SO(3)}}, the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the [[fractional quantum hall effect]]. Around 2001 [[Stephen Bigelow]] and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the [[Lawrence–Krammer representation]] of dimension {{math|''n''(''n''−1)/2}} depending on the variables {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''t''}}. By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} may be realized as a subgroup of the [[general linear group]] over the [[complex numbers]].

==Infinitely generated braid groups==
There are many ways to generalize this notion to an infinite number of strands.  The simplest way is to take the [[direct limit]] of braid groups, where the attaching maps &lt;math&gt;f \colon B_n \to B_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; send the &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; generators of &lt;math&gt;B_{n}&lt;/math&gt; to the first &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;  generators of &lt;math&gt;B_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., by attaching a trivial strand). Fabel has shown that there are two [[topological space|topologies]] that can be imposed on the resulting group each of whose [[complete metric space|completion]] yields a different group. One is a very tame group and is isomorphic to the [[mapping class group]] of the infinitely punctured disk&amp;mdash;a discrete set of punctures limiting to the boundary of the [[unit disk|disk]].

The second group can be thought of the same as with finite braid groups.  Place a strand at each of the points &lt;math&gt;(0, 1/n)&lt;/math&gt; and the set of all braids&amp;mdash;where a braid is defined to be a collection of paths from the points &lt;math&gt;(0, 1/n, 0)&lt;/math&gt; to the points &lt;math&gt;(0, 1/n, 1)&lt;/math&gt; so that the function yields a permutation on endpoints&amp;mdash;is isomorphic to this wilder group.  An interesting fact is that the pure braid group in this group is isomorphic to both the [[inverse limit]] of finite pure braid groups &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; and to the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hilbert cube]] minus the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x_i)_{i\in \Bbb{N}} \mid x_i=x_j\text{ for some }i\ne j\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cohomology==
{{See also|Configuration space (mathematics)#Connection to braid groups}}

The [[Group cohomology|cohomology of a group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the cohomology of the corresponding [[Eilenberg–MacLane space|Eilenberg–MacLane]] [[classifying space]], &lt;math&gt;K(G, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[CW complex]] uniquely determined by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; up to homotopy. A classifying space for the braid group &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is the {{var|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; unordered [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; distinct unordered points in the plane:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814291415_0004|title=Braids|last=Ghrist|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Ghrist|date=2009-12-01|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789814291408|series=Lecture Notes Series, Institute for Mathematical Sciences, National University of Singapore|volume=Volume 19|pages=263–304|doi=10.1142/9789814291415_0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{UConf}_n(\mathbb{R}^2) = \{ \{u_1, ..., u_n\} : u_i \in \mathbb{R}^2, u_i \neq u_j \text{ for } i \neq j \}&lt;/math&gt;.
So by definition
:&lt;math&gt; H^*(B_n) = H^*(K(B_n, 1)) = H^*(\operatorname{UConf}_n(\mathbb{R}^2)) &lt;/math&gt;.

The calculations for coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; can be found in {{harvnb|Fuchs|1970}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuks|first=Dmitry B.| author-link=Dmitry Fuchs|title=Cohomology of the braid group mod 2| journal=Functional Analysis and its Applications |volume=4|year=1970 |pages=143–151| doi=10.1007/BF01094491| mr=0274463| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01094491|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a classifying space for the pure braid group &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\mathbb{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt;, the {{var|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ''ordered'' [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. In 1968 [[Vladimir Arnold]] showed that the integral cohomology of the pure braid group &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of the [[exterior algebra]] generated by the collection of degree-one classes &lt;math&gt;\omega_{ij} \; \; 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the relations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnol'd|first=Vladimir|authorlink=Vladimir Arnold|title=The cohomology ring of the colored braid group|url=http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/arnold_MZ69e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Circulus''' was a [[socioeconomics]] doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] [[socialist]] [[Pierre Leroux]] (1797-1871), who proposed that human [[excrement]] be collected by the state in the form of a [[tax]] and used as [[fertiliser]], thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

== The theory ==
According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] ''Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux'' [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Revue de l'ordre social'' (No. 1, 1850, p.&amp;nbsp;6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait ''religieusement'' son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).

== Origin and history of the theory ==
Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations'', Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" (Madame, give me dung).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Laporte, ''Histoire de la Merde'', Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite public ridicule,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in ''Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes'' (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: "M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste).&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in [[Jersey]] after the fall of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digression on the sewers of Paris in ''[[Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"L'intestin de Léviathan", Book Five, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is "a misunderstanding" ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a negligent waste ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"), and that were the "givens of a new social economy" ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Misérables'', ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685.&lt;/ref&gt; But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]], who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing "the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''closed-ended question''' refers to any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html|website=''yourdictionary.com''|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a [[Declarative sentence|statement]] which requires a response.

A closed-ended question contrasts with an [[open-ended question]], which cannot easily be answered with specific information.

Examples of close-ended questions which may elicit a "yes" or "no" response include:
*Were you born in {{CURRENTYEAR}}?
*Is [[Lyon]] the capital of France?
*Did you steal the money?

Similarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:
*On what day were you born? ("[[{{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}]].")
*What is the capital of France? ("Paris.")
*Where did you steal the money? ("From the bank.")

At the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: "Have you stopped taking heroin?" (if you never took it) or "Who told you to take heroin?"; see "[[loaded question]]".

A study by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of [[social pressure]], using [[Contextual learning|context clues]] to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional [[Metallic Metals Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=18 December 2015 |publisher=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date= 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-ended questions in education ==
Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking "bad" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are "grammatically closed, but conceptually open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=3 December 2016|title=Ariadne's Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in standard parlance, "is it ever right to lie?" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be "opened up" by the questioner ("why do you think that?", "Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, "gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=19 April 2017|work=Tes|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed questions, simply require "opening up" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention "Open Questioning Mindset" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls "guess what's in my head" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=29 November 2015|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPNN has English, French and Spanish/Portuguese sections.  Articles in the French section or in the Spanish/Portuguese section are always paired with a translation in the English section so that all articles are available in English. 

At the beginning of each month a bulletin, available on the CPNN website, summarizes the major developments for a culture of peace and is sent by email to mailing lists in English, French and Spanish.

CPNN is an all-volunteer initiative; additional reporters are encouraged.

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}

Popularized by the American sociologist [[Barry Glassner]], '''culture of fear''' (or '''climate of fear''') is the concept that people may incite [[fear]] in the general public to achieve political or workplace goals through [[emotional bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffery|title=Filtering the news: essays on Herman and [[Chomsky]]'s propaganda model|year=2005|publisher=[[Black Rose Books]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A largely unrelated concept in sociology is the "fear culture" on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other.  An [[Authoritarian leadership style|authoritarian style of leadership]] may create a climate of fear, with little or no room for dialogue and with complaining being considered futile.&lt;ref&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying"  in 
Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of [[public-sector union]] members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place.  Rayner explained the figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had been tolerated previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

Individual differences in sensitivity to [[Reward system|reward]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and [[motivation]] have been studied under the premises of [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] and have also been [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory#Workplace performance|applied to workplace performance]].

A culture of fear at the workplace runs contrary to the "key principles" established by [[W. Edwards Deming]] for managers to transform business effectiveness.  One of his [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|fourteen principles]] is to drive out fear in order to allow everyone to work effectively for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points|title=The W. Edwards Deming Institute|last=Acquate|website=deming.org|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{main article|Fear mongering|fascism}}
Nazi leader [[Hermann Göring]] explains how people can be made fearful and to support a war they otherwise would oppose:

{{quote|The people don't want [[war]], but they can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  This is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and [[denunciation|denounce]] the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in every country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]] (1947) ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book "State and Opposition in Military Brazil," Maria Helena Moreira Alves found a "culture of fear" was implemented as part of [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|political repression since 1964]].  She used the term to describe methods implemented by the [[national security]] apparatus of Brazil in its effort to equate political participation with risk of [[arrest]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alves|first1=Maria|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|date=1985|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Brazil|page=352|accessdate=14 June 2015|ref=Alves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassação (English: cassation) is one such mechanism used to punish members of the military by legally declaring them dead.  This enhanced the potential for political control through intensifying the culture of fear as a deterrent to opposition.&lt;ref name=Alves1&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves found the changes of the [[National Security Law (Brazil)|National Security Law]] of 1969, as beginning the use of "[[economic exploitation]], physical [[political repression|repression]], political control, and strict [[censorship]]" to establish a "culture of fear" in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Alves2&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three psychological components of the culture of fear included silence through censorship, sense of isolation, and a "generalized belief that all channels of opposition were closed."  A "feeling of complete [[hopelessness]]," prevailed, in addition to  "withdrawal from opposition activity."&lt;ref name=Alves3&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former US National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] argues that the use of the term [[War on Terror]] was intended to generate a culture of fear deliberately because it "obscures reason, intensifies emotions and makes it easier for [[demagogic]] politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html |title=Terrorized by 'War on Terror' by Brzezinski |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= March 25, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecC12&gt;{{cite news

[[Frank Furedi]], a former professor of Sociology and writer for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' magazine, says that today's culture of fear did not begin with the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  Long before September 11, he argues, public [[panic]]s were widespread – on everything from [[GM crops]] to mobile phones, from [[global warming]] to [[foot-and-mouth disease]].  Like Durodié, Furedi argues that perceptions of risk, ideas about safety and controversies over health, the environment and technology have little to do with science or [[empirical evidence]].  Rather, they are shaped by cultural assumptions about human [[vulnerability]].  Furedi say that "we need a grown-up discussion about our post-September 11 world, based on a reasoned evaluation of all the available evidence rather than on [[irrational]] fears for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Furedi |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D46C.htm |title=Epidemic of fear |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British academics Gabe Mythen and Sandra Walklate argue that following terrorist attacks in New York, the Pentagon, Madrid, and London, government agencies developed a discourse of "new terrorism" in a cultural climate of [[fear, uncertainty and doubt|fear and uncertainty]].  UK researchers argued that these processes reduced notions of [[public safety]] and created the [[simplistic]] image of a non-white "terroristic other" that has negative consequences for ethnic minority groups in the UK.&lt;ref name="Gabe Mythen1 and Sandra Walklate"&gt;[http://cmc.sagepub.com/content/2/2/123.abstract#aff-1 Communicating the terrorist risk: Harnessing a culture of fear?] Gabe Mythen [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], UK, Sandra Walklate [[University of Liverpool]], UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 BBC documentary film series, ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', subtitled ''The Rise of the Politics of Fear'', the journalist [[Adam Curtis]] argues that politicians have used our fears to increase their power and control over society.  Though he does not use the term "culture of fear," what Curtis describes in his film is a reflection of this concept.  He looks at the American [[neo-conservative]] movement and its depiction of the [[threat]] first from the [[Soviet Union]] and then from radical [[Islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="bbcpower"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Power of Nightmares: Your comments |newspaper=[[BBC]] |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/4016713.stm |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis insists there has been a largely illusory fear of terrorism in the west since the [[September 11 attacks]] and that politicians such as [[George W Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] had stumbled on a new force to restore their power and authority; using the fear of an organised "web of evil" from which they could protect their people.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"&gt;{{cite news |title=The film US TV networks dare not show |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/12/cannes2005.cannesfilmfestival4 |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtis's film castigated the media, security forces and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] for expanding their power in this way.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"/&gt; The film features [[Bill Durodié]], then Director of the International Centre for Security Analysis, and Senior [[Research Fellow]] in the International Policy Institute, [[King's College London]], saying that to call this network an "invention" would be too strong a term, but he asserts that it probably does not exist and is largely a "([[psychological projection|projection]]) of our own worst fears, and that what we see is a fantasy that's been created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html|title=Exploring The Best Pro hormone Stacks|website=www.daanspeak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the media  ==
The consumption of mass media has had a profound effect on instilling the fear of terrorism in the United States, though acts of terror are a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nellis|first=Ashley Marie|last2=Savage|first2=Joanne|date=2012-09-10|title=Does Watching the News Affect Fear of Terrorism?

According to Gerbner, television and other forms of mass media create a worldview that is reflective of “recurrent media messages”, rather than one that is based on reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93|journal=Sociological Perspectives|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Americans are exposed to some form of media on a daily basis, with television and social media platforms being the most used methods to receive both local and international news, and as such this is how most receive news and details that center around violent crime and acts of terror.  With the rise in use of smartphones and social media, people are bombarded with constant news updates, and able to read stories related to terrorism, stories that come from all corners of the globe.  Media fuels fear of terrorism and other threats to national security, all of which have negative psychological effects on the population, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Politicians conduct interviews, televised or otherwise, and utilize their social media platforms immediately after violent crimes and terrorist acts, to further cement the fear of terrorism into the minds of their constituents.

The '''donkey''' or '''ass''' (''Equus africanus asinus'')&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] member of the horse family, [[Equidae]]. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the [[African wild ass]], ''E. africanus''. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as draught or [[pack animal]]s. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.

A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;&lt;ref name=oad/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncd/&gt;&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; a young donkey is a [[foal]].&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female [[horse]]s to produce [[mule]]s; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a [[stallion]] and jenny as its parents instead, is called a [[hinny]].

Asses were first [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, probably in [[Egypt]] or [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rossel/&gt;  and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass is an [[endangered species]]. As [[Working animal|beasts of burden]] and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.

==Scientific and common names==
Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus asinus asinus'' based on the [[Priority (nomenclature)|principle of priority]] used for scientific names of animals. However, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled in 2003 that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies.&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus africanus asinus'' when it is considered a subspecies, and ''Equus asinus'' when it is considered a species.

At one time, the [[synonym]] ''ass'' was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of ''donkey'' was in either 1784&lt;ref name=fairman/&gt; or 1785.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; While the word ''ass'' has [[cognate]]s in most other [[Indo-European languages]], ''donkey'' is an [[etymology|etymologically]] obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:
* Perhaps from Spanish, for its [[Don (honorific)|don]]-like gravity; the donkey was also known as "the King of Spain's trumpeter"&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;
* Perhaps a diminutive of ''[[dun gene|dun]]'' (dull grayish-brown), a typical donkey colour.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;
* Perhaps from the name ''Duncan''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey"/&gt;
* Perhaps of imitative origin.&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey" /&gt;
From the 18th century, ''donkey'' gradually replaced ''ass'', and ''jenny'' replaced ''she-ass'', which is now considered archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eselin |website=German-English Dictionary |url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Eselin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of ''[[rooster]]'' for ''cock'', or that of ''rabbit'' for ''coney'', which was formerly [[homophone|homophonic]] with ''[[cunny]]''. By the end of the 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ''ass'' and ''[[buttocks|arse]]'' had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include ''cuddy'' in Scotland, ''neddy'' in southwest England and ''dicky'' in the southeast;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; ''moke'' is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.

==Characteristics==
{{See also| List of donkey breeds}}
[[File:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|upright|Classic British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]]]]  Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the [[withers]] ranges from {{hands|7.3|to|15.3}}, and the weight from {{convert|80|to|480|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years;&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys are adapted to marginal [[desert]] lands. Unlike [[wild horse|wild]] and [[feral horse]]s, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form [[Harem (zoology)|harems]]. Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack.&lt;ref name=svend3/&gt; The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds&lt;ref name=canacoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehead/&gt; and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/wells_kels/Adapation.htm|title = Adaption of Donkeys|date = |accessdate =May 4, 2015|website = BioWeb|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mikesdonkeys.co.uk/facts.html|title = Donkey Facts|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Mike's Donkeys|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs.

===Breeding===
[[File:Equus asinus Kadzidłowo 001.jpg|thumb|left|A 3-week-old donkey]]
A jenny is normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to 14 months,&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;[http://www.albertadonkeyandmule.com/pdfs/foaling-out-the-jennet.pdf Sewell, Sybil E.  "Foaling out the Donkey Jennet," ''Alberta Donkey and Mule.com''.  Web page accessed March 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and usually gives birth to a single foal. Births of twins are rare, though less so than in horses.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; About 1.7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins; both foals survive in about 14 percent of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ramshornstudio.com/donkeys.htm|title = Twins and Donkeys|accessdate = May 4, 2015 |website = Rams Horn Studio|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses (''i.e.'' less than the 60–65% rate for mares).&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;

Although jennies come into heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their fertility remains low, and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Thus it is usual to wait one or two further [[oestrous]] cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their [[foal]]s, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side.&lt;ref name="Rachau"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |title=Rachau,  Jeanine A. "Gestation and Foaling of Donkeys" |access-date=2015-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412031614/http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |archive-date=2009-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys can interbreed with other members of the family Equidae, and are commonly interbred with horses. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a jack and a [[mare]] is a [[mule]], valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the [[Asino di Martina Franca]], the [[Baudet de Poitou]] and the [[American mammoth donkey|Mammoth Jack]] are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a [[stallion]] and a jenny is a [[hinny]], and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Donkeys can also breed with [[zebra]]s in which the offspring is called a [[Zebroid|zonkey]] (among other names).

===Behaviour===
Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of [[self-preservation]] than exhibited by horses.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hartshorsemanship.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=controller.viewPageThoughtDetail&amp;thoughtUuid=BE68EBFE-4063-C7B3-5EB13796296E636C|title = Training Donkeys|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Harts Horsemanship|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formal studies of their [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[animal cognition|cognition]] are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livestockoftheworld.com/Donkeys/AboutDonkeys.asp|title=About Donkeys {{!}} Breeds of Donkeys|last=World|first=Livestock Of The|website=www.livestockoftheworld.com|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Evolution of the horse}}
[[File:Equus eisenmannae.JPG|thumb|Skull of a giant extinct horse, ''Equus eisenmannae'']]
The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''Equus livenzovensis'' documented from western Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name = "Azzaroli1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus ''Equus'') lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recalibrating ''Equus evolution'' using the genome sequence of an early Middle Pleistocene horse |last1=Orlando|first1= L.|last2=Ginolhac|first2= A.|last3=Zhang|first3= G.|last4=Froese|first4= D.|last5=Albrechtsen|first5= A.|last6=Stiller|first6= M.|last7=Schubert|first7= M.|last8=Cappellini|first8= E.|last9=Petersen|first9= B.|journal=Nature|date=4 July 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12323 |pmid=23803765 |volume=499 |issue=7456 |pages=74–8|display-authors=etal|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/recalibrating-equus-evolution-using-the-genome-sequence-of-an-early-middle-pleistocene-horse(f4a404d6-2202-4a92-90c7-d113aee17b2d).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus ''E. ([[Asinus]])'', including the [[Turkmenian kulan|kulan]], [[onager]], and [[kiang]]), followed by the African zebras (subgenera ''E. ([[Dolichohippus]])'', and ''E. ([[Hippotigris]])''). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] forms) belong to the subgenus ''E. ([[Equus (genus)|Equus]])'' which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.&lt;ref name = "WeinstockMolecularPerspective"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinstock |first=J. |year=2005 |title=Evolution, systematics, and phylogeography of Pleistocene horses in the New World: a molecular perspective |journal=[[PLoS Biology]] |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e241 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030241 |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030241&amp;ct=1 |accessdate=2008-12-19 |pmid=15974804 |pmc=1159165 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of the modern donkey are the [[Nubia]]n and [[Somalia]]n subspecies of [[African wild ass]].&lt;ref name=Clut/&gt; 
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Panehsi 001.jpg|thumb|Donkey in an [[Egypt]]ian painting c. 1298–1235 BC]] [[File:Henderson and the donkey.jpg|thumb|upright|Lt. Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson using a donkey to carry a wounded soldier at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]].]]
&lt;ref name=Albano/&gt; Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in [[Ma'adi]] in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in [[Nubia]], and they supplanted the [[ox]] as the chief pack animal of that culture. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to [[chewing the cud|chew their cud]], and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the [[Dynasty IV]] era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;  In 2003, the tomb of either [[Narmer|King Narmer]] or [[Hor-Aha|King Hor-Aha]] (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;
[[File:Wild Burros.jpg|thumb|[[Feral]] burros in [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]]|left]]
By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding center had shifted to [[Mesopotamia]] by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made [[Damascus]] famous{{Citation_needed|date=April 2016}}, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy [[horse gait|gait]]. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in [[Arabia]]. By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as [[viticulture]] was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, [[Dionysus]]. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

The first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the [[Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|Second Voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and were landed at [[Hispaniola]] in 1495.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the United States may have crossed the [[Rio Grande]] with [[Juan de Oñate]] in April 1598.&lt;ref name=burro/&gt; From that time on they spread northward, finding use in missions and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679. By the [[Gold Rush]] years of the 19th century, the burro was the [[Pack animal|beast of burden]] of choice of early [[Prospecting|prospectors]] in the western United States. With the end of the [[placer mining]] boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a [[Feral organism|feral]] population established itself.

==Present status==
About 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; [[China]] had the most with 11 million, followed by [[Pakistan]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Mexico]]. As of 2017, however, the Chinese population was reported to have dropped to 3 million, with African populations under pressure as well, due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Donkeys face 'biggest ever crisis'|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=2017-10-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; The number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the FAO's world regions was in 2006:&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

In 1997 the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blench 2000"/&gt;
Since then, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.7 million to 43.5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; The fall in population is pronounced in developed countries; in Europe, the total number of donkeys fell from 3 million in 1944 to just over 1 million in 1994.&lt;ref name=svend5/&gt;

The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; In 2000 the number of [[List of donkey breeds|breeds of donkey]] recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries. In France, for example, only one breed, the Baudet de Poitou, was recognised prior to the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.&lt;ref name=inra/&gt;

In prosperous countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up. The largest is [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] near Sidmouth, England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, [[Kenya]], and Mexico.&lt;ref name="DS 2006"/&gt;

==Uses==

===Economic use===
[[File:104 Donkeys in Tayrona Park Colombia.JPG|thumb|Donkeys bring supplies through the jungle to a camp outpost in [[Tayrona National Natural Park]] in northern [[Colombia]]]] [[File:Esel auf Ydra.jpg|thumb|On [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|the island of Hydra]], because cars are outlawed, donkeys and mules form virtually the sole method of heavy goods transport.]] [[File:Carisbrooke_Castle_well_house_3.jpg|thumb|A donkey operating a water well at [[Carisbrooke Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].]]
The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture. After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power.&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt; They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Some cultures that prohibit women from working with [[oxen]] in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.&lt;ref name=ifad/&gt;

In developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared, donkeys are used to sire mules, to guard [[sheep]],&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=dohner/&gt; for [[donkey rides]] for children or tourists, and as pets. Donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses. If a donkey is introduced to a [[Mare (horse)|mare]] and [[foal]], the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.&lt;ref name=ypte/&gt;

A few donkeys are milked or raised for meat;&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; in Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; [[Asses' milk]] may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was €15 per litre,&lt;ref name=latte/&gt; and a price of €6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of [[parchment]].&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In 2017, the UK based charity [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] estimated that 1.8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Why are donkeys facing their 'biggest ever crisis'?|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=7 October 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and [[Guo Li Zhuang]] restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. [[Donkey-hide gelatin]] is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product. [[Donkey-hide gelatin|Ejiao]], the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilo, at October 2017 prices.

In 2017, a drop in the number of Chinese donkeys, combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, [[Kenya]] opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkeys' well-being, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], and [[Senegal]]) banning China from buying their donkey products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In warfare===
During World War I [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a British stretcher bearer serving with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], and Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson of the [[New Zealand Medical Corps]] used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref name=anzac/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt;

According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], donkeys were used in the [[Italian Army]]. The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to [[pack animal|carry]] their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be [[horsemeat|eaten]].&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt;

Donkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and others.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

==Care==

===Shoeing===
Donkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses, and do not naturally wear down as fast. Regular clipping may be required; neglect can lead to permanent damage.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Working donkeys may need to be shod. Donkey shoes are similar to [[horseshoe]]s, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nutrition===

In their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub.&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; The donkey has a tough [[digestive system]] in which roughage is efficiently broken down by [[hind gut fermentation]], microbial action in the [[caecum]] and [[large intestine]].&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight,&lt;ref name=smith2008/&gt; approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter,&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt; compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;[http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/uc099.pdf Hall, Marvin H. and Patricia M. Comerford. "Pasture and Hay for Horses - Argonomy facts 32," 1992 University of Pennsylvania, Cooperative Extension Service.]  Web site accessed February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys are also less prone to [[colic]].&lt;ref name=svendsen/&gt; The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different [[intestinal flora]] to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

[[File:Baudet.jpg|thumb|[[Baudet de Poitou|Poitou donkeys]].]]
Donkeys obtain most of their energy from [[Dietary fiber|structural carbohydrates]]. Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only [[straw]] (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or [[hay]] in the winter,&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals,&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; and others advise against feeding straw.&lt;ref name=blm/&gt;   They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Aganga, A.A., ''et al.'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063807/http://www.cipav.org.co/lrrd/lrrd12/2/agan122.htm "Feeding donkeys"] ''Livestock Research for Rural Development'' 12 (2) 2000. Department of Animal Science and Production, Botswana College of Agriculture. Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder ([[laminitis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071119104524/http://www.dengie.com/pages/feeding-horses/nutritional-advice/feeding-your-donkey.php "Feeding Your Donkey"]  Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[hyperlipaemia]],&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; or to [[gastric ulcers]].&lt;ref name=Burden2009/&gt;

Throughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the [[Third World]] are under-nourished and over-worked.&lt;ref name=svend4/&gt;

==Burro==
[[File:DonkeyCartCarnHuejot2.JPG|thumb|A burro pulling a cart during the [[Carnival of Huejotzingo]]]]
In the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Americas]], a '''{{lang|es|burro}}''' is a small donkey.  The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] lists the burro as a specific breed of ass.&lt;ref name="dadburro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dad.fao.org/cgi-bin/EfabisWeb.cgi?sid=1b9408faaf38cf3a67973ce670aa7736,reportsreport13_50000044 |title=Breeds from species: Ass |website=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |accessdate=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]], the donkey population is estimated at three million.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Garcia-Navarro, Lourdes (8 May 2005) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4635078 "Celebrating the Burro in Mexico"] (transcript of radio broadcast). Accessed February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also substantial ''burro'' populations in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Nicaragua]].

''Burro'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for donkey. In Spanish, burros may also be called ''{{lang|es|burro {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}'' ('Mexican donkey'), ''{{lang|es|burro criollo}}'' ('[[Criollo people|Criollo]] donkey'), or ''{{lang|es|burro criollo {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}''. In the United States, "burro" is used as a [[Loanword|loan word]] by English speakers to describe any small donkey used primarily as a pack animal, as well as to describe the [[Feral organism|feral]] donkeys that live in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Texas]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="blm" /&gt;

Among donkeys, burros tend to be on the small side. A study of working burros in central Mexico found a weight range of {{convert|50|–|186|kg}}, with an average weight of {{convert|122|kg|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|112|kg|abbr=on}} for females. Height at the [[withers]] varied from {{convert|87|–|120|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of approximately {{convert|108|cm|abbr=on}}, and girth measurements ranged from {{convert|88|–|152|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of about {{convert|120|cm|abbr=on}}. The average age of the burros in the study was 6.4 years; evaluated by their [[horse teeth|teeth]], they ranged from 1 to 17 years old.&lt;ref name="aluja" /&gt; They are gray in color. Mexican burros tend to be smaller than their counterparts in the USA, which are both larger and more robust. To strengthen their bloodstock, in May 2005, the state of [[Jalisco]] imported 11 male and female donkeys from Kentucky.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

==Feral donkeys and wild asses==
In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established [[feral]] populations such as those of the [[Burro]] of North America and the [[Asinara donkey]] of [[Sardinia]], Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of [[equid]], such as Hawaii.&lt;ref name="feral"/&gt; In Australia, where there may be 5 million [[Feral donkeys in Australia|feral donkeys]],&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

===Wild asses, onagers, and kiangs===
Few species of ass exist in the wild. The [[African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus'', has two subspecies, the [[Equus africanus somaliensis|Somali wild ass]], ''Equus africanus somaliensis'', and the [[Equus africanus africanus|Nubian wild ass]], ''Equus africanus africanus'',&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; Both are critically endangered.&lt;ref name=iucn2/&gt; Extinct species include the [[European ass]], ''Equus hydruntinus'', which became extinct during the [[Neolithic]], and the [[Equus africanus atlanticus|North African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus atlanticus'', which became extinct in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

There are five subspecies of Asiatic wild ass or [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus'', and three subspecies of the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang'', of the Himalayan upland.

==Donkey hybrids==
A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with a female horse to produce a [[mule]]. A male horse can be crossed with a female donkey to produce a [[hinny]].

Horse-donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are almost always [[infertility|sterile]] because horses have 64 [[chromosome]]s whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes. Mules are much more common than hinnies. This is believed to be caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jenney). {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different [[mating]] behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys. Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce.{{Citation needed|reason=to make this statement, one needs data indicating the greater prevalence of mules|date=August 2009}}

The offspring of a [[zebra]]-donkey cross is called a zonkey, [[zebroid]], zebrass, or zedonk;&lt;ref name=zorse/&gt; ''zebra mule'' is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. ''Zebra hinny, zebret'' and ''zebrinny'' all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras.&lt;ref name=zedonk/&gt; There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.

==Cultural references==
The long history of human donkey use has created a rich store of cultural references:

===Religion, myth and folklore===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Procession in the Streets of Jerusalem (Le cortège dans les rues de Jérusalem) - James Tissot.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Jesus]] rode on a donkey in his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]]]
Due to its widespread domestication and use, the donkey is referred to in myth and folklore around the world.  In classical and ancient cultures, donkeys had a part. The donkey was the symbol of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] .&lt;ref name=gauding/&gt; In [[Greek myth]], [[Silenus]] is pictured in Classical Antiquity and during the Renaissance (''illustration, left'') drunken and riding a donkey, and [[Midas]] was given the ears of an ass after misjudging a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]], beginning in the first book and continuing through both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, so they became part of Judeo-Christian tradition. They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by [[cavalry]] or pulling [[chariot]]s. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys&amp;nbsp;— for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.&lt;ref name=forti/&gt; They are used as a measure of wealth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:43,&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt; and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of [[Shechem]] (the modern [[Nablus]]) is named Hamor ("donkey" in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=gen34/&gt;

[[File:Piero di Cosimo - La Découverte du miel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Silenus on a donkey, detail from ''The Discovery of Honey'' (c. 1500) by [[Piero di Cosimo]]]]
According to Old Testament prophecy, the [[Messiah]] is said to arrive on a donkey: "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey!" ([[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9:9). According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when [[Jesus]] entered [[Jerusalem]] riding on the animal ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 21:4-7, [[Gospel of John|John]] 12:14-15). Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16).

In the [[Jewish]] religion, the donkey is not a [[kosher]] animal. In the [[Zohar]], it is considered ''avi avot hatuma'' or the ultimate impure animal, and doubly "[[Unclean animals|impure]]", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed. However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the [[mitzvah]] (commandment) of firstborn  ("[[bechor]]") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See [[Petter Chamor]]). In Jewish [[Talmud|Oral Tradition]] ([[Talmud Bavli]]), the [[Messiah|son of David]] was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|tribes of Israel]] are undeserving of redemption.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;

In contemporary [[Israel]], the term "[[The Messiah's Donkey|Messiah's Donkey]]" (Chamoro Shel Mashiach חמורו של משיח) stands at the center of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed "task" of secular [[Zionists]] to build up a [[Jewish State]], but once the state is established they are fated to give place to [[Orthodox Jews|the Religious]] who are ordained to lead the state. The secularists in this analogy are "The Donkey" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective "Messiach". A book on the subject, published in 1998 by the militant secularist Sefi Rechlevsky, aroused a major controversy in the Israeli public opinion.&lt;ref name=wurm/&gt;

With the rise of Christianity, some believers came to see the cross-shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders as a symbol of the animal's bearing Jesus into [[Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]].  During the Middle Ages, Europeans used hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) as [[folk remedies]] to treat illness, including [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref name=oliver/&gt; Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for [[scorpion]] stings.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

[[File:Kalratri Sanghasri 2010 Arnab Dutta.JPG|thumb|upright|Goddess [[Kalaratri]] rides a donkey.]]
Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the [[Hinduism]], where the goddess [[Kalaratri]]'s [[vahana]] (vehicle) is a donkey.&lt;ref name=gaen/&gt; Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=muller/&gt; and the [[Panchatantra]].&lt;ref name=purn/&gt;

In Islam, eating the meat of a domestic donkey is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=86563 Eating meat of a donkey and giraffe]," [[IslamWeb.net]], 2003-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and film===
Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the [[Bible]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of [[Homer]], [[Aesop]] and [[Apuleius]], where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the [[Proletariat|lower class]]. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's ''[[The Ass in the Lion's Skin]]'', representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. [[Shakespeare]] popularized the use of the word "ass" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600). In contrast, a few years later, [[Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as [[Sancho Panza]]'s mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility. They are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Balaam]]'s ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of [[Jesus]] riding into [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. [[William Wordsworth]] portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem ''[[Peter Bell (Wordsworth)|Peter Bell:A Tale]]'', using the donkey as a Christian symbol. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] in ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in [[Juan Ramon Jimenez]]'s ''[[Platero and I]].'' The melancholy [[Eeyore]] in ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in [[George Orwell]]'s 1951 ''[[Animal Farm]]'', where [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;  [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] is a well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1956 ''[[The Last Battle]]''.&lt;ref name=mish/&gt; Brighty is the central character of the 1953 children's novel and 1967 film ''[[Brighty of the Grand Canyon]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Donkeys are portrayed in film including the 1940 [[Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', where the donkey is portrayed as a [[slapstick comedy|slapstick]] character who participates in a social faux pas with [[Bacchus]] and is punished by [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=clague/&gt; A donkey is featured as the main figure in the 1966 film ''[[Au hasard Balthazar]]'' by [[Robert Bresson]], and, is given a life path of Christian symbolism.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]], is featured as a main character in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' franchise of the 2000s.&lt;ref name=shrek/&gt;

===Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults===
Many cultures have colloquialisms and [[proverb]]s that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include "to talk the hind legs off a donkey", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as "the donkey lets the rain soak him".&lt;ref name=ehren/&gt; The French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]] constructed the paradox called [[Buridan's ass]], in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision.&lt;ref name=phrase/&gt; Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including "put your money in the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and "women, donkeys and goats all have heads" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats).&lt;ref name=melfi/&gt;  The United States developed its own expressions, including "better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me", "a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey", and "a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold", among others.&lt;ref name=meider/&gt; From Afghanistan, we find the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] proverb, "Even if a donkey goes to [[Mecca]], he is still a donkey." In Ethiopia, there are many [[Amharic]] proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, "The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart" (Bad company corrupts good morals).

The words "donkey" and "ass" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and are generally used to mean someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly,&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict2/&gt;&lt;ref name=long/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfe/&gt; In [[football (soccer)|football]], especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a "donkey",&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; and the term has a similar connotation in [[poker]].&lt;ref  name=bochan/&gt; In the US, the slang terms "dumbass" and "jackass" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.&lt;ref name=dict3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict4/&gt;

===Politics===
[[File:The W(estminster) just-asses a braying - or - the downfall of the E. O. table by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon]]

In keeping with their widespread cultural references, donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world. A "[[donkey vote]]" is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with [[ranked voting systems]] and [[compulsory voting]], such as Australia.&lt;ref name=abc2/&gt; The donkey is a common symbol of the [[Democratic Party of the United States]], originating in a [[cartoon]] by [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=nast/&gt;

The bray of the donkey may be used as a [[simile]] for loud and foolish speech in political [[Derision|mockery]].&lt;ref name=tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; For example,&lt;ref name=tryon/&gt;{{quote|There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses; for what's loud and senseless talking and swearing, any other than braying|[[Roger L'Estrange|Sir Roger L'Estrange]]}}
In 1963, [[Party of Donkeys]], a frivolous political party was founded in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milani|first1=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians: The Men and Women who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979|volume=1|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|isbn=978-0815609070|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''ruc català''" or "''burro català''" ([[Catalan donkey]]) has become a [[Catalan symbols|symbol of Catalonia]] in Spain. In 2003 some friends in Catalonia made bumper stickers featuring the ''burro català'' as a reaction against a national advertising campaign for ''Toro d'Osborne'', a brandy. The burro became popular as a nationalist symbol in Catalonia, whose residents wanted to assert their identity to resist Spanish [[centralism]]. Renewed attention to the regional burro helped start a breeding campaign for its preservation, and its numbers have increased.&lt;ref name=mont/&gt;

[[Proshka]], an ass owned by Russian populist nationalist liberal democratic politician [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], became prominent during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 Russian presidential election]] campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video. In that controversial ad, Zhirinovsky appeared sitting in a [[sleigh]] harnessed with Proshka, then claiming that the "little wretched ass" is the symbol of Russia and that if he would become [[President of Russia|President]] a "daring [[troika harness|troika]]" would return as a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|symbol of Russia]] instead of the ass; at the end, Zhirinovsky beat Proshka with a [[whip]], made the ass move and had a ride on him through the snow-covered backyard of his [[dacha]]. International organisations [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and [[World Animal Protection]] have accused Zhirinovsky of [[cruelty to animals]]. Zhirinovsky replied to the assertions by stating that similar treatment is commonplace in the [[Arab world]] and claimed that his ass has been treated "better than many people".&lt;ref name=ass-defenders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|title=Страница не найдена|publisher=|access-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165143/http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|archive-date=May 16, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Esoteric Buddhism''''' is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}} It was one of the first books written for the purpose explain of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] for the wide range of readers,{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} and was "made up of the [[Mahatma Letters|author's correspondence]] with an [[Koot Hoomi|Indian mystic]]."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}} This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|"His [Sinnett's] second book, ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' an outline of some of the main teachings of theosophy, attracted much attention and served as a harbinger of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P.B.'s]] monumental work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
Through the mediation of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the [[mahatma]]s [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theosopedia}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the [[mahatma|Masters]]" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "[[occult]] cosmology".

In preface to the original edition author says that [[exoteric]] [[Buddhism]] "has remained in closer union with the [[esoteric]] doctrine" than any other [[Major religious groups|world religion]]. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=123}}

=== Esoteric teachers ===
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour{{refn|group=note|[[Mahatma Letters|Letters from mahatmas]] formed the basis of two theosophical books by Sinnett.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=61}}}} rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=1|Лесевич|1887|2p=16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in [[Tibet]] there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-ka-pa]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Lopez|1999|p=50}}

=== The constitution of man ===
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven elements]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The [[Physical body|Physical Body]] (''[[Rūpa]]'').
#Vitality (''[[Prana]]'', or ''Jiva'').
#[[Subtle body|Astral Body]] (''Linga Sharira'').
#Animal [[Soul]] ([[Kāma|''Kāma Rūpa'']]).
#Human Soul ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']]).
#Spiritual Soul (''[[Buddhi]]'').
#[[Spirit]] ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|''Ātma'']]).{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=24|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The world periods ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Man after death ===
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=77}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}} The four upper components move on [[Astral plane|Kama loca]], and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=81}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of [[karma]] specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnates]].{{refn|group=note|"The lower four, or quaternary, are transitory, while the upper triad is related to the eternal element in man, his real nature and identity with the universal soul."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=24}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}}} New incarnations on the [[Physical plane|earth plane]] are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=98}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}

Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The spirit of the [[Psychic|sensitive]], getting odylized,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} so to say, by the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the spirit in the Devachan, ''becomes'' for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called ''[[rapport]],'' is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=95|Hammer|2003|2p=467}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
[[File:Man on planet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Diagram "Man on a Planet".{{refn|group=note|"Man evolves in seven major or root-races; 49 minor races; and the subordinate races or offshoots. The arrow indicates the direction taken by the evolutionary impulse.&lt;br/&gt;
I, II, III, IV, etc., are the seven major or [[root race|root-races]].&lt;br/&gt;
1, 2, 3, etc., are the minor races.&lt;br/&gt;
a, a, a, are the subordinate or offshoot races.&lt;br/&gt;
N, the initial and terminal point of evolution on the planet.&lt;br/&gt; 
S, the axial point where the development equilibrates or adjusts itself in each race evolution.&lt;br/&gt; 
E, the equatorial points wherein the descending arc intellect overcomes spirituality and in the ascending arc spirituality outstrips intellect.&lt;br/&gt;
A word or two [globe, earth] added to make it apply as well  to a whole manwantaric chain of worlds."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and [[spiritual evolution]]." He selected "some key terms" in the book.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}

[[Avīci|'''Avitchi''']] is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|incarnation]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=93}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Sukhavati|'''Devachan''']] is a state of greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=92}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eighth sphere''' is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=113}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=162}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Astral plane|'''Kama loca''']] is "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}} The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=97}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Manvantara]]''' is a period of activity or manifestation.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Monad (philosophy)|'''Monad''']] is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Pralaya]]''' is a state of nonbeing.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Round (Theosophy)|'''Round''']] is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}

Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the [[Mental plane|devachanic plane]]. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Mahatma Letters'' (letter 14) this number is "slightly different."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}} The letter states that man "has passed in all his lives upon our planet (in this Round) but 77,700 years he has been in the subjective spheres 922,300 years."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}} A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 [[root race]]s); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=60–61, 140}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}} In ''Mahatma Letters'' it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more. And then a series of lives in offshoot and branchlet races; making the total incarnations of man in each station or planet 777."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}}

=== Theosophical Buddha ===
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=167|Lopez|2008|2pр=187–188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Lopez]], author of ''Esoteric Buddhism'' "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries."{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=176}} The Buddha had leaved "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all [[caste]]s. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands.{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=177}}&lt;br/&gt;Sinnett claimed that the  Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=181}}

=== Against blind faith ===
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=194–195|Guénon|2004|2p=126}}{{refn|group=note|"It is priestly imposture that rendered these gods so terrible to man; it is religion that makes of him the selfish bigot, the fanatic that hates all mankind out of his own sect without rendering him any better or more moral for it. It is the belief in God and gods that makes two-thirds of humanity the slaves of a handful of those who deceive them under the false pretence of saving them. &lt;...&gt; In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist."{{sfn|Harris}} For example, [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called ''Esoteric Buddhism.'' It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1896|pp=209–210}}{{refn|group=note|Nonetheless [[Christmas Humphreys|Humphreys]] wrote that "Buddha's Teaching was not born from a spiritual vacuum, but was an expression of some portion of that Gupta Vidya 'the accumulated Wisdom of the ages', which antedates all known religions."{{sfn|Humphreys|2012|p=23}}&lt;br/&gt;
"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}}}{{refn|group=note|Sinnett received instructions from the Tibetan Masters, and Rhys Davids believed that [[Lamaism]] was a Religion not only different from Buddhism, but and being in his time in antagonism with the teachings and the institutions of original Buddhism.{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=16}} See also a book by Eva M. Dargyay{{sfn|Dargyay|1979}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[René Guénon|Guénon's]] opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=93}} According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}

Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]], this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 4}}

== New editions and translations ==
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"153 editions published between 1883 and 2016 in 8 languages and held by 610 WorldCat member libraries worldwide".{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}}

'''The European Week for Waste Reduction (EWWR)'''&lt;ref name="EWWR"&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/EWWR ACR+ - EWWR presentation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was launched as a 3-year project supported by the LIFE+ Programme of the [[European Commission]] until July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1588&amp;format=PDF&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en European Commission - Environment Policy &amp; Governance, LIFE + Projects 2007], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This source doesn't seem to reference the European Week for Waste Reduction anywhere|date=March 2013}} It continues taking place in the following years. The 2012 edition of the EWWR took place from the 17 to 25 November 2012 under the patronage of Mr Janez Potočnik, European Commissioner for the Environment. 
It aims to organize multiple actions during a single week, across Europe, that will raise awareness about [[waste reduction]]. Each year, the most outstanding actions are rewarded during an awards ceremony in Brussels at the heart of the European institutions. Since the beginning of the project, more than 20.000 awareness raising actions on waste prevention have been implemented in the framework of the EWWR.

The 2017 date is from November 18-27.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewwr.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five partners of this project are:
* '''ADEME''' (the French Environment and Energy Management Agency – project coordinator)
* '''ACR+''' (the Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and sustainable Resource management – project technical secretariat)
* '''ARC''' (the Catalan Waste Agency)
* '''IBGE''' (Brussels Environment, public administration for the environment and energy)   and
* '''LIPOR''' (the Intermunicipal Waste Management Service of [[Greater Porto]]).

==Purpose==
* To raise awareness about waste reduction strategies and about the policies of the European Union and its Member States on this subject
* To promote sustainable waste reduction actions across Europe
* To highlight the work accomplished by various actors, through concrete examples of waste reduction
* To encourage changes in the behaviour of Europeans (consumption, production) in everyday life

==Target audience==
* '''Public authorities across Europe''' that have competence in the field of waste prevention that responded to a Call for Interest launched by the official partners of the project. These EWWR Organisers act as coordinators of the Week in the area covered by their authority, thereby ensuring the registration and validation of actions proposed by various Project Developers.
* '''Project developers''' interested in carrying out awareness raising actions on the subject of waste prevention during the Week, with the aim of informing the greatest possible number of citizens. These Project Developers register their proposals for EWWR actions through the national, regional or local Organiser covering their area.
:'''5 categories of Project Developer:'''
** Administration/public authority
** Association/NGO
** Business/industry
** Educational establishment
** Other (for example : hospital, retirement home, cultural centre etc.).
* '''European citizens''' who participate in actions set up by Project Developers during the Week and learn about the kind of waste reduction habits that they can take up in everyday life.

==Five themes of the EWWR==
* Too much waste
* Better production
* Better consumption
* A longer life for products
* Less waste thrown away

The '''Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative''' (EITI) is a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas and mineral resources. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors.

The EITI Standard requires information along the extractive industry value chain from the point of extraction, to how the revenue makes its way through the government, to how it contributes to the economy.

This includes how licenses and contracts are allocated and registered, who are the beneficial owners of those operations are, what are the fiscal and legal arrangements are, how much is produced, how much is paid, where are those revenues allocated, and what is the contribution to the economy, including employment.

The [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]] is implemented in 52 countries around the world. Each of these countries is required publish to an annual EITI Report to disclose information on: contracts and licenses, production, revenue collection, revenue allocation, and social and economic spending.

Every country goes through a quality-assurance mechanism, called Validation, at least every three years. Validation serves to assess performance towards meeting the EITI Standard and promote dialogue and learning at the country level. It also safeguards the integrity of the EITI by holding all EITI implementing countries to the same global standard.

Each implementing country has its own national secretariat and multi-stakeholder group, made up of representatives from the country’s government, extractive companies and civil society. The multi-stakeholder group takes decisions on how the EITI process is carried out in the country.

The EITI Standard is developed and overseen by an international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multi-stakeholder]] Board, consisting of representatives from governments, extractives companies, civil society organisations, financial institutions and international organisations.

The Chair of the EITI is [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]], former [[Prime Minister of Sweden]]. The previous chairs have been the [[Clare Short]] (2011-2016), former [[Secretary of State for International Development|UK Secretary of State for International Development]] and [[Peter Eigen]] (2009-2011). The EITI International Secretariat is located in [[Oslo, Norway]] and is headed by former Swedish diplomat Jonas Moberg.

== History ==
The “Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative” (EITI) was first launched in September 2002 by [[Tony Blair|UK Prime Minister Tony Blair]] at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715054456/http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/basic_info/basicinfo.html World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EITI|url=http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090422161958/http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 April 2009|website=UK Web Archive|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following years of academic debate, as well as lobbying from civil society and companies, on the management of government revenues from the extractive industries. In particular, the EITI was established to be an answer to public discussions on the “[[Resource Curse]]” or the “[[Paradox of Plenty]]”. NGOs such as by [[Global Witness]] and “[[Publish What You Pay]]”, as well as companies such as [[BP]] pushed the UK government to working towards an international transparency norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded at a conference in [[London]] in 2003. The 140 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final attendee list, Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) London  Conference 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|publisher=DFID, UK|accessdate=1 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from government, companies and civil society agreed on twelve principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI)  London Conference, 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf |publisher=DFID, UK |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase transparency over payments and revenues in the extractive sector. A pilot phase of the EITI was launched in Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Ghana and the Kyrgyz Republic. The management of the Initiative continued to lay with the UK [[Department for International Development]].

The second EITI Conference on 17 March 2005 in London established six [https://web.archive.org/web/20140719154306/http://eiti.org/eiti/criteria criteria] based on the principles. These set out the minimum requirements for transparency in the management of resources in the oil, gas and mining sectors, laying the foundation for a rule-based organisation. This conference also established an international advisory group (IAG) under the Chairmanship of [[Peter Eigen]] to further guide the work of how the EITI is to be set up and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|website=www.eiti.org|publisher=EITI|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More countries, companies and civil-society organisations joined the initiative. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] endorsed the EITI.

The report issued in June 2006 by the international advisory group recommended the establishment of a multi-stakeholder board and an independent secretariat, and these were set in place at the third EITI conference held in Oslo, Norway on 11 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EITI Oslo Conference: Making transparency a global norm|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Veiledninger-og-brosjyrer/2006/eiti_conference.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=419568|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oslo was chosen as the new location for the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norway to host EITI international secretariat|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/pressemeldinger/2006/norway-to-host-eiti-international-secret.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=439120|website=regjeringen.no/en/archive.html?id=115322|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the body further fleshed out the criteria, turning them into a set of 23 requirements, known as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191309/http://eiti.org/news-events/2011-edition-eiti-rules EITI Rules in 2011].

The EITI Standard replaced the EITI Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Stella|title=EITI board raises bar on global standards to report natural resource revenues|url=http://www.trust.org/item/?map=eiti-board-raises-bar-on-global-standards-to-report-natural-resource-revenues|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Thompson Reuters Foundation|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 May 2013. The Standard was revised in February 2016.

== Structure and Funding  ==
The EITI is organised as a non-profit association under Norwegian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI Articles of Association|url=http://eiti.org/document/eiti-articles-association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three institutional bodies: The Members’ Meeting, the EITI Board, and the International Secretariat. The Members’ Meeting governs the EITI and convenes alongside the EITI global conferences, which are held every two to three years.

The board develops the Standard and assesses the progress of the countries. It is supported by the international secretariat, located in Oslo, Norway.
[[File:EITI Global Conference 2016.jpg|thumb|303x303px|EITI Global Conference, February 2016]]
The EITI Board meets between two and four times a year and is composed of three groups: countries, companies and civil society. The membership of the Board reflects the multi-stakeholder nature of the EITI. The EITI Board has eight committees (audit, finance, governance and oversight, implementation, nominations, outreach and candidature, rapid response and Validation) to develop recommendations to the full board.

The funding of the EITI is two-fold. At the country level, implementation is funded by the governments. At the international level, the EITI is funded by implementing countries, supporting governments and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI - How we are funded|url=http://eiti.org/about/funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member countries ==
Any country with [[Extractive industry|extractive industry sectors]] can adhere to the EITI Standard. Countries implementing the transparency standard include OECD states such as Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as countries in Africa, Central and East Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/countries|title=EITI Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a country intends to join the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]], it is required to undertake five sign-up steps before applying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/faq-countries-considering-eiti|title=FAQs for governments considering EITI implementation|website=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These steps relate to a clear commitment of the government, company and civil society engagement, the establishment of a multi-stakeholder group and agreement on a work plan, which sets out what the country wants to achieve within a certain time frame.

Once the application of the country has been accepted by the board, the country is called an “EITI candidate”. The candidate receives the deadlines for publishing information and undergoes “Validation” two and a half years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/validation#validation-consequences|title=Validation consequences|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of Validation is a measure of how well the country is progressing to meet the requirements of the standard. It can make satisfactory, meaningful, inadequate or no progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/about/how-we-work#upholding-the-standard-internationally-validation|title=Upholding the Standard internationally: Validation|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI board will ask the country to improve aspects which Validation deemed insufficient to fulfil the standard. An overview of Validation results is available [https://eiti.org/document/validation-schedule-decisions online].

When a candidate country passes EITI Validation, it is declared “EITI compliant” by the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/validation|title=EITI Validation|website=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2017, 51 countries are implementing the EITI:

== Impact of the EITI ==
The EITI has made significant contributions to improved governance of the extractive sector in several countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcomes and impact of the EITI|url=https://eiti.org/outcomes-impact-of-eiti|website=eiti.org|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the EITI has been central to many reforms of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/progress-report-2017/analysing-impact|title=EITI Progress Report 2017 - analysing impact|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, debates on transparency in the sector are unrecognisable from ten years ago, and the EITI is seen as being at the forefront of many frontier debates including beneficial ownership, commodity trading, and artisanal and small-scale mining.

It is also clear that the EITI process is one of the only ''functioning'' global mechanisms to inform and channel debate in resource-rich countries in a way that includes all stakeholders. In Peru, EITI Reports have highlighted that, only about 15% of revenues from the mining and hydrocarbon sector has been used for developmental spending, such as infrastructure or economic diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progrep.eiti.org/2016/country-focus/peru|title=EITI Progress Report 2016|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=29 April 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest has been spent on current expenditures such as salaries and servicing debts. Local citizens are using this information to engage with their regional authorities on alternative ways to spend these resources.

EITI Reports make recommendations aimed at addressing weaknesses in government systems and improving extractive sector management. In Nigeria, President Buhari has initiated major reforms in the oil sector, starting with restructuring the national oil company, a review of oil contracts, an pause in the awarding of the notorious oil swap deals, and a review of subsidy arrangements. These were all recommendations from Nigeria EITI Reports.

Furthermore, the EITI can lead to higher attractiveness for investments. There is “mounting evidence that information release supports greater competition around government contracting and that being an EITI signatory leads to greater inflows of both aid and foreign direct investment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/big-signing|title=A big signing: Donald Trump signs a law repealing a disclosure rule for oil companies|last=The Economist|first=|date=17 February 2017|website=economist.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malden|first=Alexander|date=26 January 2017|title=A safer bet?

== Supporting Companies ==
Around 80 companies involved in oil, gas, and mining support the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://eiti.org/supporters/companies|website=eiti.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting companies publicly endorse the EITI and  contribute to covering the cost of the international secretariat of the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/funding#contributions-from-implementing-countries-and-companies|title=EITI funding - contributions from implementing countries and companies|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extractive companies are involved on the national level in countries implementing the transparency standard. They are part of the stakeholders and are required to hand over numbers on payments as part of the reporting process under the EITI standard. Company advocacy has resulted in several countries beginning EITI implementation.

== Criticism ==
Campaigning organisations have criticised the organisation for the lack of sanction possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extracting oil, burying data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548214|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=The Economist|issue=Feb 25th, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, business representatives have commented that the EITI board is captured by civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment - Beyond transparency: EITI stretches 'civil society' role|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-4/general-interest/comment-beyond-transparency.html|publisher=Oil &amp; Gas Journal|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI has been seen as insufficient to bring full transparency to payments in the extractive industries, since it does not cover countries active in commodity trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohstoffhandel blüht gleiches Schicksal wie den Banken|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Rohstoffhandel-blueht-gleiches-Schicksal-wie-den-Banken/story/23012824|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=Tagesanzeiger online|date=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been addressed by new requirements of the EITI standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/GN26|title=Guidance note 26 - Reporting on first trades in oil|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=June 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Fuck Off'''" ({{Lang-zh|c=不合作方式|s=|t=}}&lt;!-- ; [[pinyin]]: ; {{IPA2|}}; {{Audio|AAAA.ogg|pronunciation}} --&gt;) was a controversial [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] art exhibition which ran alongside the [[Third Shanghai Biennale]] (2000) in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. The exhibition’s title translates as "Uncooperative Attitude" in Chinese, but the blunter English language sentiment was deemed preferable.&lt;ref name="pol"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollack|first=Barbara|title=The wild, wild East : an American art critic's adventures in China|year=2010|publisher=Timezone 8|location=[Hong Kong]|isbn=9789881803498|page=}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition encompassed [[Conceptual art|conceptual]], [[Performance art|performance]], and [[protest art]].

==Overview==
The exhibition was held in an Eastlink Gallery warehouse by [[Feng Boyi]] and the 43-year-old [[Ai Weiwei]], and is revered by many young Chinese artists.&lt;ref name=vine&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_7_89/ai_76332991/pg_4&lt;/ref&gt; Ai encapsulated "Fuck Off"'s artistic-curatorial attitude with one set of photos in which he gives [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]] in turn to the [[White House]], the [[Forbidden City]] and the viewer, and another in which he releases an ancient [[Han Dynasty]] Chinese vase which smashes at his feet.&lt;ref name=vine/&gt; 

The exhibition included works by 46 avant-garde artists, among them He Yunchang, who posed in a color photograph while bare-chested and suspended from a crane by his ankles over a rushing river into which he holds a blade, the same knife he later used to cut his own arm. [[Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu|Sun Yuan]] exhibited ''Solitary Animal'', a glass case containing an animal skeleton and—purportedly—enough poison gas to wipe out the show's entire audience. Wang Chuyu's performance consisted of a four-day fast. Zhu Ming floated down the [[Huangpu River]] in a plastic bubble wearing a diaper.&lt;ref name=vine/&gt;

"Fuck Off" has been one of the most famous contemporary art exhibitions in recent history. It took place in the Eastlink gallery as well as a warehouse at 1133 West Suzhou River Road. The show included both emerging and famous artists and totaled 48 in all. The work displayed in Fuck Off was raw and unedited, which was the polar opposite of the Shanghai Beinnale that was open at the same time. The entire purpose of the show was to truly show the Chinese government exactly how "uncooperative" these artists could be, and that is evident in the closing line of the exhibition catalogue: "Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site,' but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse."&lt;ref name=ai13&gt;{{cite book|last=Merewether|first= Charles|title=Ai Wei-wei|year=2003|publisher=Timezone 8|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9889726289|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview by Chin-Chin Yap, Ai Weiwei was asked if the actual exhibit of "Fuck Off" had a concept similar to the Black, White, and Gray Cover Books he published. He went on to say that after the books were finished, there were a lot of interesting art works happening, and the people in his life continually recommended creating an exhibit with the theme of the books. His opinion was not that the show was really that good because it was organized so quickly, and he knew that there was a possibility that it could be shut down by the police and having all the work confiscated. Luckily, he said that the artists involved were "cooperative and interested and the attitude was there." In a very eye-opening statement, Ai goes on to say that "maybe Fuck Off was most important because of what it represented." Those involved had a clear thought about the image they wanted to give to Chinese institutions and Western curators, institutions and dealers, and that thought was:"We had to say something as individual artist to the outside world, and what we said was 'fuck off'."&lt;ref name=ai51&gt;{{cite book|last=Merewether|first= Charles|title=Ai Wei-wei|year=2003|publisher=Timezone 8|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9889726289|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous examples from this exhibition was the performance of "Eating People" by [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]]. It consisted of a series of photographs of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. One picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the [[FBI]] and [[Scotland Yard]]. The piece's cannibalistic theme was controversial in Britain when Zhu's work was featured on a [[Channel 4]] documentary exploring [[Chinese modern art]] in 2003. In response to the public reaction, Zhu Yu stated, "No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it". Zhu has claimed that he used an actual fetus which was stolen from a medical school. 

Many influential artists of the current [[Chinese art]] scene took part, many of whom have since been included in international exhibitions, catalogues and television documentaries. 

The exhibition was closed by the Shanghai police before its scheduled closing date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapmag.com/53features1.html|title=ArtAsiaPacific: Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A catalog of the exhibition has been published, a black book with the simple title "FUCK OFF" on its cover.

==Feng Boyi on "Fuck Off"==
Co-curator Feng Boyi felt as though Chinese artists were just working for foreigners because the early Chinese contemporary art shows were being held in foreign countries. In co-curating the exhibition, Feng said that "We wanted to show the 'fuck off' style, not working for the government or in the style of western countries, but a third way."&lt;ref name=pol/&gt;

==Co-Curators==
'''Description by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi in October, 2000:'''

"'Fuck Off' is an event that is participated by both the organizers and artists. In today's art, the alternative is playing the role of revising and criticizing the power discourse and mass convention. In an uncooperative and uncompromisable way, it self-consciously resists the threat of assimilation and vulgarization. A cultural attitude that stands against the power and makes no compromise with vulgarization is, together with independent individual experiences, feelings and creations, is what extends the pursuit and desire of art for spiritual freedom – an everlasting theme. Such a cultural attitude is obviously exclusive and alienated. It aims at dealing with such themes as cultural power, art institution, art trends, communications between the East and West, exoticism, post-modernism and post colonialism, etc.

'Fuck Off' emphasizes the independent and critical stance that is basic to art existence, and its status of independence, freedom and plurality in the situation of contradictions and conflicts. It tries to provoke artist's responsibility and self-discipline, search for the way in which art lives as "wildlife", and raise questions about some issues of contemporary Chinese art.

Allegory, directing questioning, resistance, alienation, dissolution, endurance, boredom, bias, absurdity, cynicism and self-entertainment are aspects of culture as well as features of existence. Such issues are re-presented here by the artists with unprecedented frankness and intelligence, which leaves behind fresh and stimulating information and traces of existence.

In this exhibition, participants and their works are not objects of choice, identification and judgment. They have no quest for any kind of excuse. Group identification and inner difference are both so fully respected and encouraged that it may be doubted if there is the necessity for the presence of audience.

An on-site ambiguity and uncertainty forces one to seek meaning and satisfaction only in the form of proliferation and postpone. Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site', but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse."&lt;ref name=fo&gt;{{cite book|last=Ai|first=Weiwei|title=Fuck Off|year=2000|location=China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Works==
'''''Accidental Dropping'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Ai Weiwei is so concerned with Chinese history as a whole and the fact that people are not playing the proper role in learning about it or preserving it. By dropping a near-priceless artifact, Ai is essentially asking if the Chinese people really care about their history, and why not? It is taking something that is worth an immense amount of money and reducing it to shards. If he can do this with an artifact this important, it should suffice to raise awareness about the importance of all aspects of Chinese history.

'''''Golden Sunlight (Performance)'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

He Yuchang does a large amount of performance art and is known to push the limits in what he does. His goal is to "seek enduring and fearless confrontation with reality and a poetic expression for this."

'''''Chinese Landscape: Tattoo No. 2'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Huang Yan sees landscape paintings as a way of expressing himself. The landscapes he paints show tranquility, and does so on a variety of things. These scenes are painted on his body, on pork, and even on cow bones.

'''''Mouse'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Jin Le experiments with a wide variety of materials in order to demonstrate what he thinks that people and animals would look like if scientists succeeded in combining them into one form.

'''''Peace series No. 19'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Liang Yue uses Photoshop as his main form of expression. He attempts to Photoshop a variety of ads onto photos he takes and then post them absolutely everywhere in an attempt to require people to see them.

'''''Paradise Lost No. 17'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Meng Huang was born in Beijing, and says "I grew up, knowing nothing. Now I live in Beijing and find that works of art stars are very much westernized." His works seem to be reminiscent of an almost unattainable land that was once a paradise, but is now sad and downtrodden.

'''''Stamping on Water'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Song Dong notes "I find more pleasure in doing 'art' as a matter because of the openness of artistic language. As I understand it, the time is over when artistic styles are defined by medium, method and paradigm. When I make use of these, the only thing that I have in mind is whether they fit my ideas." His work seems to show a lot of disparity in life and the fact that humans are a lot less important to the world around them.

'''''Skin Graft'''''&lt;ref name=fo /&gt; 

Zhu Yu is a very outspoken artist who uses his work to make a statement. His work is aimed at making people think about the world around them. He says that "We're not very afraid that we are not thinking what others are thinking since such an issue is taken care of by our spirit. What we are afraid of is that people are thinking what they are not supposed to think. So we need to re-think over what people initially take to be right, and abstract out everything that has nothing to do with reality."

In [[behaviorism|behavioral]] [[psychology]], the '''assumption of generality''' is the assumption that the results of [[experimental analysis of behavior|experiments]] involving schedules of [[reinforcement]], conducted on non-human subjects (often pigeons), can be generalized to apply to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, D.L &amp; Mallott, R.W. (1971). ''Elementary Principles of Behavior''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse W.H. (1966). Intermittent reinforcement. In W.K. Honig (ed.), ''Operant Behavior: areas of research and application'' (pp. 52–108). New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1969). ''Contingencies of Reinforcement: A theoretical analysis.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; If the assumption holds, many aspects of daily human life can be understood in terms of these results. The naturalization of sunlight helps our bodies to stay awake and keep motivated. The darkness that comes with night tells our body to slow down for the day and get some rest. The ability to survive comes with generality. Experiments have been done to test inescapability and [[insolubility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroto|first=Donald S.|author2=Seligman, Martin E.|title=Generality of learned helplessness in man.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=2|pages=311–327|doi=10.1037/h0076270|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/31/2/311/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergus Lowe has questioned the generality of schedule effects in cases of fixed-interval performance among humans and non-humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, F.C. (1979) Determinants of human operant behavior. In M.D. Zeiler &amp; P. Harzem (Eds), ''Reinforcement and the organization of behavior'' (pp. 159–192). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to generalize information from one situation to another is a function of several factors: the [[reliability (research methods)|reliability]] of the original information; the [[paradigm]]'s [[Validity (logic)|validity]]; one's understanding of the paradigm, the true determinants of the behavior, and the relevant details of the situations in question; and the similarity between the original source of the data and the situation to which it is to be applied.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsu.edu/depart/psychology/sebac/fac-sch/rm/Ch5-2.html |title=Generality Maximization |publisher=Jsu.edu |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are both similarities and differences between the terms "[[stimulus generalization]]" and "generality of a [[functional relationship]]." Stimulus generalization is the description of the fact that an [[organism]] behaves in a similar way to similar [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and that the more different the stimuli, the more different the behavior. The generality of a finding refers to the degree to which a functional relationship obtained in one situation is able to predict the obtained relationship in a new situation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

"Generality" refers more to functional relationships than individual events. That responses occur to X about the same as to Z is irrelevant; rather, that [[distributed practice]] helps in learning [[nonsense syllable]]s and in learning other tasks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''geothermal heat pump''' or '''ground source heat pump''' (GSHP) is a [[central heating]] and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground.

It uses the earth all the time, without any [[intermittent energy source|intermittency]], as a heat source (in the winter) or a [[heat sink]] (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and may be combined with [[solar heating]] to form a [[geosolar]] system with even greater efficiency. They are also known by other names, including '''geoexchange, earth-coupled, earth energy''' systems. The engineering and scientific communities prefer the terms "''geoexchange''" or "''ground source heat pumps''" to avoid confusion with traditional [[geothermal power]], which uses a high temperature heat source to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt; Ground source heat pumps harvest heat absorbed at the Earth's surface from solar energy. The temperature in the ground below {{convert|6|m}} is roughly equal to the mean annual air temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/Mean_Annual_Air_Temperature.html|title=Mean Annual Air Temperature – MATT – Ground temperature – Renewable Energy – Interseasonal Heat Transfer – Solar Thermal Collectors – Ground Source Heat Pumps – Renewable Cooling|author=|date=|website=www.icax.co.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that latitude at the surface.

Depending on latitude, the temperature beneath the upper {{convert|6|m}} of Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16&amp;nbsp;°C (50 and 60&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Geothermal Basics |publisher=US Department of Energy |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a [[heat pump]] to force the transfer of heat from the ground. Heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space, against the natural direction of flow, or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one. The core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle that moves heat. [[Air-source heat pumps]] are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters, even when extracting heat from cold winter air, although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5&amp;nbsp;°C (41&amp;nbsp;°F). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} A ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground. This is much more energy-efficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year. Seasonal variations drop off with depth and disappear below {{convert|7|m}}&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; to {{convert|12|m}}&lt;ref name=Kurevija&gt;Tomislav Kurevija, Domagoj Vulin, Vedrana Krapec. "[http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/057/vol5/017/ecp57vol5_017.pdf Influence of Undisturbed Ground Temperature and Geothermal Gradient on the Sizing of Borehole Heat Exchangers]" page 1262 ''[[University of Zagreb#Faculties|Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering, University of Zagreb]]'',May 2011. Accessed: October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[thermal inertia]]. Like a [[cave]], the shallow ground temperature is warmer than the air above during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. A ground source heat pump extracts ground heat in the winter (for heating) and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer (for cooling). Some systems are designed to operate in one mode only, heating or cooling, depending on climate.

Geothermal pump systems reach fairly high [[coefficient of performance]] (CoP), 3 to 6, on the coldest of winter nights, compared to 1.75–2.5 for air-source heat pumps on cool days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12640 |title=Energy Savers: Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are among the most energy-efficient technologies for providing [[HVAC]] and [[water heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/projects/projects.cfm/ProjectID=108 |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tennessee Energy Efficient Schools Initiative Ground Source Heat Pumps |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528045631/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/projects/projects.cfm/ProjectID%3D108 |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cres-energy.org/techbasics/geothermal_div1.html |title=COLORADO RENEWABLE ENERGY SOCIETY – Geothermal Energy |publisher=Cres-energy.org |date=2001-10-25 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140006/http://www.cres-energy.org/techbasics/geothermal_div1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Setup costs are higher than for conventional systems, but the difference is usually returned in energy savings in 3 to 10 years, and even shorter lengths of time with federal, state and utility tax credits and incentives. Geothermal heat pump systems are reasonably warranted by manufacturers, and their working life is estimated at 25 years for inside components and 50+ years for the ground loop.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12640 |title=Energy Savers: Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, there are over one million units installed worldwide providing 12 GW of thermal capacity, with an annual growth rate of 10%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

==Differing terms and definitions==
[[File:Geothermal Systems.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ground source heating and cooling]]
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Some confusion exists with regard to the terminology of heat pumps and the use of the term "''geothermal''". "''Geothermal''" derives from the Greek and means "''Earth heat''" – which geologists and many laymen understand as describing hot rocks, volcanic activity or heat derived from deep within the earth. Though some confusion arises when the term "''geothermal''" is also used to apply to temperatures within the first 100 metres of the surface, this is "''Earth heat''" all the same, though it is largely influenced by stored energy from the sun.

==History==
The heat pump was described by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1853 and developed by [[Peter Ritter von Rittinger]] in 1855. After experimenting with a freezer, Robert C. Webber built the first direct exchange ground-source heat pump in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/about/about_us.htm|title=History |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=About Us |publisher=International Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful commercial project was installed in the [[Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon)]] in 1948, and has been designated a [[National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by [[ASME]].&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; The technology became popular in Sweden in the 1970s, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. Open loop systems dominated the market until the development of [[polybutylene]] pipe in 1979 made closed loop systems economically viable.&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; As of 2004, there are over a million units installed worldwide providing 12&amp;nbsp;GW of thermal capacity.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 =Lund | first1 =J. | last2 =Sanner | first2 =B. | last3 =Rybach | first3 =L. | last4 =Curtis | first4 =R. | last5 =Hellström | first5 =G. |date = September 2004| title =Geothermal (Ground Source) Heat Pumps, A World Overview | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =25 | issue =3 | pages =1–10 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull25-3/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}

==Ground heat exchanger==
{{see also|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}
[[Image:Pond Loop Close Up.jpg|thumb|right|Loop field for a 12-ton system (unusually large for most residential applications)]]

Heat pumps provide winter heating by extracting heat from a source and transferring it into a building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground source heat pump uses the top layer of the earth's crust as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderated temperature.

In the summer, the process can be reversed so the heat pump extracts heat from the building and transfers it to the ground. Transferring heat to a cooler space takes less energy, so the cooling efficiency of the heat pump gains benefits from the lower ground temperature.

Ground source heat pumps employ a [[heat exchanger]] in contact with the ground or groundwater to extract or dissipate heat. This component accounts for anywhere from a fifth to half of the total system cost, and would be the most cumbersome part to repair or replace. Correctly sizing this component is necessary to assure long-term performance: the energy efficiency of the system improves with roughly 4% for every degree Celsius that is won through correct sizing, and the underground temperature balance must be maintained through proper design of the whole system. Incorrect design can result in the system freezing after a number of years or very inefficient system performance; thus accurate system design is critical to a successful system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/ground-source-heat-pumps/ground-source-heating-cooling/|title=GSHC Viability and Design – Carbon Zero Consulting|author=|date=|website=carbonzeroco.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shallow {{Convert|3-8|foot|m|adj = on}} horizontal heat exchangers experience seasonal temperature cycles due to solar gains and transmission losses to ambient air at ground level. These temperature cycles lag behind the seasons because of thermal inertia, so the heat exchanger will harvest heat deposited by the sun several months earlier, while being weighed down in late winter and spring, due to accumulated winter cold. Deep vertical systems {{Convert|100-500|feet|m}} deep rely on migration of heat from surrounding geology, unless they are recharged annually by solar recharge of the ground or exhaust heat from air conditioning systems.

Several major design options are available for these, which are classified by fluid and layout. Direct exchange systems circulate refrigerant underground, closed loop systems use a mixture of anti-freeze and water, and open loop systems use natural groundwater.

===Direct exchange (DX)===
{{Main article|Direct exchange geothermal heat pump}}
The [[direct exchange geothermal heat pump]] (DX) is the oldest type of geothermal heat pump technology. The ground-coupling is achieved through a single loop, circulating refrigerant, in direct thermal contact with the ground (as opposed to a combination of a refrigerant loop and a water loop). The [[refrigerant]] leaves the heat pump cabinet, circulates through a loop of copper tube buried underground, and exchanges heat with the ground before returning to the pump. The name "direct exchange" refers to heat transfer between the refrigerant loop and the ground without the use of an intermediate fluid. There is no direct interaction between the fluid and the earth; only heat transfer through the pipe wall. Direct exchange heat pumps are not to be confused with "water-source heat pumps" or "water loop heat pumps" since there is no water in the ground loop. [http://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/ ASHRAE] defines the term ground-coupled heat pump to encompass closed loop and direct exchange systems, while excluding open loops.
[[File:DX system in a house.jpg|thumb|Direct exchange geothermal system]]
Direct exchange systems are more efficient and have potentially lower installation costs than closed loop water systems. Copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] contributes to the higher efficiency of the system, but heat flow is predominantly limited by the thermal conductivity of the ground, not the pipe. The main reasons for the higher efficiency are the elimination of the water pump (which uses electricity), the elimination of the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (which is a source of heat losses), and most importantly, the latent heat phase change of the refrigerant in the ground itself.

However, in case of leakage there is virtually no risk of contaminating the ground or the ground water. Contrary to water-source geothermal systems, direct exchange systems do not contain antifreeze. So, in case of a refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant currently used in most systems – R-410A – would immediately vaporize and seek the atmosphere. This is due to the low boiling point of R-410A: {{convert|-51|C|F}}.  R-410A refrigerant replaces larger volumes of antifreeze mixtures used in water-source geothermal systems and presents no threat to aquifers or to the ground itself.

While they require more refrigerant and their tubing is more expensive per foot, a direct exchange earth loop is shorter than a closed water loop for a given capacity. A direct exchange system requires only 15 to 40% of the length of tubing and half the diameter of drilled holes, and the drilling or excavation costs are therefore lower. Refrigerant loops are less tolerant of leaks than water loops because gas can leak out through smaller imperfections. This dictates the use of brazed copper tubing, even though the pressures are similar to water loops. The copper loop must be protected from corrosion in acidic soil through the use of a [[sacrificial anode]] or other [[cathodic protection]].

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted field monitoring of a direct geoexchange heat pump water heating system in a commercial application. The EPA reported that the system saved 75% of the electrical energy that would have been required by an electrical resistance water heating unit. According to the EPA, if the system is operated to capacity, it can avoid the emission of up to 7,100 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 15 pounds of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; each year per ton of compressor capacity (or 42,600&amp;nbsp;lbs. of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   and 90&amp;nbsp;lbs. of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for a typical 6 ton system).&lt;ref name="EPAdoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227091649/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern climates, although the earth temperature is cooler, so is the incoming water temperature, which enables the high efficiency systems to replace more energy than would otherwise be required of electric or fossil fuel fired systems. Any temperature above {{convert|-40|C|F}} is sufficient to evaporate the refrigerant, and the direct exchange system can harvest energy through ice.

In extremely hot climates with dry soil, the addition of an auxiliary cooling module as a second condenser in line between the compressor and the earth loops increases efficiency and can further reduce the amount of earth loop to be installed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Closed loop===
Most installed systems have two loops on the ground side: the primary refrigerant loop is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The secondary loop is typically made of [[high-density polyethylene]] pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze ([[propylene glycol]], [[denatured alcohol]] or [[methanol]]). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in an increasing number of European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the secondary loop outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The secondary loop is placed below the [[frost line]] where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available. Systems in wet ground or in water are generally more efficient than drier ground loops since water conducts and stores heat better than solids in sand or soil. If the ground is naturally dry, soaker hoses may be buried with the ground loop to keep it wet.

[[Image:Pump Pack.jpg|thumb|right|An installed liquid pump pack]]
Closed loop systems need a heat exchanger between the refrigerant loop and the water loop, and pumps in both loops. Some manufacturers have a separate ground loop fluid pump pack, while some integrate the pumping and valving within the heat pump. Expansion tanks and pressure relief valves may be installed on the heated fluid side. Closed loop systems have lower efficiency than direct exchange systems, so they require longer and larger pipe to be placed in the ground, increasing excavation costs.

Closed loop tubing can be installed horizontally as a loop field in trenches or vertically as a series of long U-shapes in wells (see below). The size of the loop field depends on the soil type and moisture content, the average ground temperature and the heat loss and or gain characteristics of the building being conditioned. A rough approximation of the initial soil temperature is the average daily temperature for the region.

====Vertical====
[[File:Geothermal drilling for residential heating.jpg|thumb|Drilling of a borehole for residential heating]]
A vertical closed loop field is composed of pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically {{convert|50|to(-)|400|ft}} deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector at the bottom of the hole. The [[borehole]] is commonly filled with a [[bentonite]] [[grout]] surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the [[heat transfer]]. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents [[artesian wells]] from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5–6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three boreholes {{convert|80|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers" /&gt; (A ton of heat is 12,000 [[British thermal unit]]s per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 [[kilowatt]]s.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.

====Horizontal====
[[Image:3-ton Slinky Loop.jpg|thumb|right|A three-ton slinky loop prior to being covered with soil. The three slinky loops are running out horizontally with three straight lines returning the end of the slinky coil to the heat pump.]]
A horizontal closed loop field is composed of pipes that run horizontally in the ground. A long horizontal [[trench]], deeper than the [[frost line]], is dug and U-shaped or slinky coils are placed horizontally inside the same trench. Excavation for shallow horizontal loop fields is about half the cost of vertical drilling, so this is the most common layout used wherever there is adequate land available. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three loops {{convert|120|to|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} long of [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] 3/4 (DN&amp;nbsp;20) or NPS&amp;nbsp;1.25 (DN&amp;nbsp;32) polyethylene tubing at a depth of {{convert|1|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Chiasson1999&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Advances in modeling of ground source heat pump systems | url = http://www.solis.pl/index.php/content/download/375/1291/file/GROUND%20SOURCE%20HEAT.pdf | year = 1999 | author = Chiasson, A.D. | publisher = Oklahoma State University

The depth at which the loops are placed significantly influences the energy consumption of the heat pump in two opposite ways: shallow loops tend to indirectly absorb more heat from the sun, which is helpful, especially when the ground is still cold after a long winter. On the other hand, shallow loops are also cooled down much more readily by weather changes, especially during long cold winters, when heating demand peaks. Often, the second effect is much greater than the first one, leading to higher costs of operation for the more shallow ground loops. This problem can be reduced by increasing both the depth and the length of piping, thereby significantly increasing costs of installation. However, such expenses might be deemed feasible, as they may result in lower operating costs. Recent studies show that utilization of a non-homogeneous soil profile with a layer of low conductive material above the ground pipes can help mitigate the adverse effects of shallow pipe burial depth. The intermediate blanket with lower conductivity than the surrounding soil profile demonstrated the potential to increase the energy extraction rates from the ground to as high as 17% for a cold climate and about 5–6% for a relatively moderate climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rezaei | first1 = B. | last2 = Amir | first2 = Kolahdouz | last3 = Dargush | first3 = G.

A slinky (also called coiled) closed loop field is a type of horizontal closed loop where the pipes overlay each other (not a recommended method). The easiest way of picturing a slinky field is to imagine holding a [[slinky]] on the top and bottom with your hands and then moving your hands in opposite directions. A slinky loop field is used if there is not adequate room for a true horizontal system, but it still allows for an easy installation. Rather than using straight pipe, slinky coils use overlapped loops of piping laid out horizontally along the bottom of a wide trench. Depending on soil, climate and the heat pump's run fraction, slinky coil trenches can be up to two thirds shorter than traditional horizontal loop trenches. Slinky coil ground loops are essentially a more economical and space efficient version of a horizontal ground loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informedbuilding.com/Geothermal/Main16/Types-of-Geothermal-Ground-Loops/ |title=Geothermal Ground Loops |publisher=Informed Building |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radial or directional drilling====
As an alternative to trenching, loops may be laid by mini [[horizontal directional drilling]] (mini-HDD). This technique can lay piping under yards, driveways, gardens or other structures without disturbing them, with a cost between those of trenching and vertical drilling. This system also differs from horizontal &amp; vertical drilling as the loops are installed from one central chamber, further reducing the ground space needed. Radial drilling is often installed retroactively (after the property has been built) due to the small nature of the equipment used and the ability to bore beneath existing constructions.

====Pond====
[[Image:Pond Loop Being Sunk.jpg|thumb|right|12-ton pond loop system being sunk to the bottom of a pond]]
A closed pond loop is not common because it depends on proximity to a body of water, where an open loop system is usually preferable. A pond loop may be advantageous where poor water quality precludes an open loop, or where the system heat load is small. A pond loop consists of coils of pipe similar to a slinky loop attached to a frame and located at the bottom of an appropriately sized pond or water source.

===Open loop===
In an open loop system (also called a groundwater heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. [[ASHRAE]] calls open loop systems ''groundwater heat pumps'' or ''surface water heat pumps'', depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate [[injection well]], [[irrigation trench]], tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance may need to be protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. [[Limescale]] may [[fouling|foul]] the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hard water#Indices]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.

[[Deep lake water cooling]] uses a similar process with an open loop for air conditioning and cooling. Open loop systems using ground water are usually more efficient than closed systems because they are better coupled with ground temperatures. Closed loop systems, in comparison, have to transfer heat across extra layers of pipe wall and dirt.

A growing number of jurisdictions have outlawed open-loop systems that drain to the surface because these may drain aquifers or contaminate wells. This forces the use of more environmentally sound injection wells or a closed loop system.

====Standing column well====
A standing column well system is a specialized type of open loop system. Water is drawn from the bottom of a deep rock well, passed through a heat pump, and returned to the top of the well, where traveling downwards it exchanges heat with the surrounding bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Orio |first1=Carl D. |last2=Johnson |first2=Carl N. |last3=Rees |first3=Simon J. |last4=Chiasson |first4=A. |last5=Deng |first5=Zheng |last6=Spitler |first6=Jeffrey D. |year=2004 |title=A Survey of Standing Column Well Installations in North America |periodical=ASHRAE Transactions |publisher=ASHRAE |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=637–655 |url=http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-25 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095818/http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a standing column well system is often dictated where there is near-surface bedrock and limited surface area is available. A standing column is typically not suitable in locations where the geology is mostly clay, silt, or sand. If bedrock is deeper than {{convert|200|ft}} from the surface, the cost of casing to seal off the overburden may become prohibitive.

A multiple standing column well system can support a large structure in an urban or rural application. The standing column well method is also popular in residential and small commercial applications. There are many successful applications of varying sizes and well quantities in the many boroughs of New York City, and is also the most common application in the New England states. This type of ground source system has some heat storage benefits, where heat is rejected from the building and the temperature of the well is raised, within reason, during the summer cooling months which can then be harvested for heating in the winter months, thereby increasing the efficiency of the heat pump system. As with closed loop systems, sizing of the standing column system is critical in reference to the heat loss and gain of the existing building. As the heat exchange is actually with the bedrock, using water as the transfer medium, a large amount of production capacity (water flow from the well) is not required for a standing column system to work. However, if there is adequate water production, then the thermal capacity of the well system can be enhanced by discharging a small percentage of system flow during the peak Summer and Winter months.

Since this is essentially a water pumping system, standing column well design requires critical considerations to obtain peak operating efficiency. Should a standing column well design be misapplied, leaving out critical shut-off valves for example, the result could be an extreme loss in efficiency and thereby cause operational cost to be higher than anticipated.

==Building distribution==
[[Image:Water to Air Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|left|Liquid-to-air heat pump]]
The heat pump is the central unit that becomes the heating and cooling plant for the building. Some models may cover space heating, space cooling, (space heating via conditioned air, [[hydronic]] systems and / or [[radiant heating]] systems), domestic or pool water preheat (via the [[wikt:desuperheater|desuperheater]] function), demand hot water, and driveway ice melting all within one appliance with a variety of options with respect to controls, staging and zone control. The heat may be carried to its end use by circulating water or forced air. Almost all types of heat pumps are produced for commercial and residential applications.

''Liquid-to-air'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-air'') output forced air, and are most commonly used to replace legacy forced air furnaces and central air conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems. Heat pumps cannot achieve as high a fluid temperature as a conventional furnace, so they require a higher volume flow rate of air to compensate. When retrofitting a residence, the existing duct work may have to be enlarged to reduce the noise from the higher air flow.

[[Image:Water to Water Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid-to-water heat pump]]
''Liquid-to-water'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-water'') are [[hydronic]] systems that use water to carry heating or cooling through the building. Systems such as radiant [[underfloor heating]], [[baseboard radiator]]s, [[wall radiator|conventional cast iron radiator]]s would use a liquid-to-water heat pump. These heat pumps are preferred for pool heating or domestic hot water pre-heat. Heat pumps can only heat water to about {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} efficiently, whereas a boiler normally reaches {{convert|65|–|95|C|F}}. Legacy radiators designed for these higher temperatures may have to be doubled in numbers when retrofitting a home. A hot water tank will still be needed to raise water temperatures above the heat pump's maximum, but pre-heating will save 25–50% of hot water costs.

Ground source heat pumps are especially well matched to underfloor heating and baseboard radiator systems which only require warm temperatures 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) to work well. Thus they are ideal for open plan offices. Using large surfaces such as floors, as opposed to radiators, distributes the heat more uniformly and allows for a lower water temperature. Wood or carpet floor coverings dampen this effect because the thermal transfer efficiency of these materials is lower than that of masonry floors (tile, concrete). Underfloor piping, ceiling or wall radiators can also be used for cooling in dry climates, although the temperature of the circulating water must be above the [[dew point]] to ensure that atmospheric humidity does not condense on the radiator.

Combination heat pumps are available that can produce forced air and circulating water simultaneously and individually. These systems are largely being used for houses that have a combination of air and liquid conditioning needs, for example central air conditioning and pool heating.

==Seasonal thermal storage==
[[Image:HeatAndColdStorageWithHeatPump.svg|thumb|right|A heat pump in combination with heat and cold storage]]
{{Main article|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
The efficiency of ground source heat pumps can be greatly improved by using [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] and interseasonal heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/interseasonal_heat_transfer.html |title=Interseasonal Heat Transfer |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat captured and stored in thermal banks in the summer can be retrieved efficiently in the winter. Heat storage efficiency increases with scale, so this advantage is most significant in commercial or [[district heating]] systems.

[[Geosolar combisystem]]s have been used to heat and cool a greenhouse using an [[aquifer]] for thermal storage.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Passel|first1=Willy|last2=Sourbron|first2=Maarten|last3=Verplaetsen|first3=Filip |last4=Leroy|first4=Luc |last5=Somers|first5=Yvan |last6=Verheyden|first6=Johan |last7=Coupé|first7=Koen|editor=Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie Vlaanderen|title=Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming|url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-23|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer, the greenhouse is cooled with cold ground water. This heats the water in the aquifer which can become a warm source for heating in winter.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonneterp.nl/english/index_uk.html |title=Schematic of similar system of aquifers with fans-regulation |publisher=Zonneterp.nl |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of cold and heat storage with heat pumps can be combined with water/humidity regulation. These principles are used to provide [[renewable heat]] and renewable cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/renewable_cooling.html |title=Capture, storage and release of Renewable Cooling |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to all kinds of buildings.

Also the efficiency of existing small heat pump installations can be improved by adding large, cheap, water filled solar collectors. These may be integrated into a to-be-overhauled parking lot, or in walls or roof constructions by installing one-inch [[Polyethylene|PE]] pipes into the outer layer.

==Thermal efficiency==
{{Main article|Thermal efficiency}}
The net [[thermal efficiency]] of a heat pump should take into account the efficiency of electricity generation and transmission, typically about 30%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;  Since a heat pump moves three to five times more heat energy than the electric energy it consumes, the total energy output is much greater than the electrical input. This results in net thermal efficiencies greater than 300% as compared to radiant electric heat being 100% efficient. Traditional combustion furnaces and [[electric heater]]s can never exceed 100% efficiency.

Geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption— and corresponding air pollution emissions—up to 44% compared to air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared to electric resistance heating with standard air-conditioning equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24782.pdf Geothermal Heat Pumps]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dependence of net thermal efficiency on the electricity infrastructure tends to be an unnecessary complication for consumers and is not applicable to hydroelectric power, so performance of heat pumps is usually expressed as the ratio of heating output or heat removal to electricity input. Cooling performance is typically expressed in units of BTU/hr/watt as the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio|energy efficiency ratio]] (EER), while heating performance is typically reduced to dimensionless units as the [[Coefficient of Performance|coefficient of performance]] (COP). The conversion factor is 3.41 BTU/hr/watt. Performance is influenced by all components of the installed system, including the soil conditions, the ground-coupled heat exchanger, the heat pump appliance, and the building distribution, but is largely determined by the "lift" between the input temperature and the output temperature.

For the sake of comparing heat pump appliances to each other, independently from other system components, a few standard test conditions have been established by the [[American Refrigerant Institute]] (ARI) and more recently by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. Standard ARI 330 ratings were intended for closed loop ground-source heat pumps, and assume secondary loop water temperatures of {{convert|25|C|F}} for air conditioning and {{convert|0|C|F}} for heating. These temperatures are typical of installations in the northern US. Standard ARI 325 ratings were intended for open loop ground-source heat pumps, and include two sets of ratings for groundwater temperatures of {{convert|10|C|F}} and {{convert|21|C|F}}. ARI 325 budgets more electricity for water pumping than ARI 330. Neither of these standards attempt to account for seasonal variations. Standard ARI 870 ratings are intended for direct exchange ground-source heat pumps. [[ASHRAE]] transitioned to ISO 13256-1 in 2001, which replaces ARI 320, 325 and 330. The new ISO standard produces slightly higher ratings because it no longer budgets any electricity for water pumps.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;

Efficient compressors, variable speed compressors and larger heat exchangers all contribute to heat pump efficiency. Residential ground source heat pumps on the market today have standard COPs ranging from 2.4 to 5.0 and EERs ranging from 10.6 to 30.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahridirectory.org/ahriDirectory/pages/wbahp/defaultSearch.aspx |title=AHRI Directory of water-to-air geothermal heat pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for an [[Energy Star]] label, heat pumps must meet certain minimum COP and EER ratings which depend on the ground heat exchanger type. For closed loop systems, the ISO 13256-1 heating COP must be 3.3 or greater and the cooling EER must be 14.1 or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/eligibility/geo_heat_pump_elig.pdf |title=Energy Star Program Requirements for Geothermal Heat PUmps |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Partner Commitments |publisher=Energy Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual installation conditions may produce better or worse efficiency than the standard test conditions. COP improves with a lower temperature difference between the input and output of the heat pump, so the stability of ground temperatures is important. If the loop field or water pump is undersized, the addition or removal of heat may push the ground temperature beyond standard test conditions, and performance will be degraded. Similarly, an undersized blower may allow the plenum coil to overheat and degrade performance.

Soil without artificial heat addition or subtraction and at depths of several metres or more remains at a relatively constant temperature year round. This temperature equates roughly to the average annual air-temperature of the chosen location, usually {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} at a depth of {{convert|6|m}} in the northern US. Because this temperature remains more constant than the air temperature throughout the seasons, geothermal heat pumps perform with far greater efficiency during extreme air temperatures than air conditioners and air-source heat pumps.

Standards ARI 210 and 240 define [[Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (SEER) and [[Heating Seasonal Performance Factor]]s (HSPF) to account for the impact of seasonal variations on air source heat pumps. These numbers are normally not applicable and should not be compared to ground source heat pump ratings. However, [[Natural Resources Canada]] has adapted this approach to calculate typical seasonally adjusted HSPFs for ground-source heat pumps in Canada.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |title=Ground Source Heat Pumps (Earth Energy Systems) |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Heating and Cooling with a Heat Pump |publisher=Natural Resources Canada, Office of Energy Efficiency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403212025/http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-03 |df= }} Note: contrary to air-source conventions, the NRC's HSPF numbers are in units of BTU/hr/watt. Divide these numbers by 3.41 BTU/hr/watt to arrive at non-dimensional units comparable to ground-source COPs and air-source HSPF.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC HSPFs ranged from 8.7 to 12.8 BTU/hr/watt (2.6 to 3.8 in nondimensional factors, or 255% to 375% seasonal average electricity utilization efficiency) for the most populated regions of Canada. When combined with the thermal efficiency of electricity, this corresponds to net average thermal efficiencies of 100% to 150%.

==Environmental impact==
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Environmental Protection Agency|title= Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier – Report 430-R-93-004|publisher= EPA|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential, particularly where they are used for both heating and cooling and where the electricity is produced from renewable resources.

GSHPs have unsurpassed thermal efficiencies and produce zero emissions locally, but their electricity supply includes components with high greenhouse gas emissions, unless the owner has opted for a 100% [[renewable energy]] supply. Their environmental impact therefore depends on the characteristics of the electricity supply and the available alternatives.

The GHG emissions savings from a heat pump over a conventional furnace can be calculated based on the following formula:&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Hanova | first1 = J | last2 = Dowlatabadi | first2 = H | date =9 November 2007 | title =Strategic GHG reduction through the use of ground source heat pump technology | periodical =Environmental Research Letters | place =UK | publisher =IOP Publishing | volume =2 | pages = 044001 8pp | url =http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1748-9326/2/4/044001/erl7_4_044001.pdf?request-id=dd247af1-1eb0-4c8d-a20b-426d37d8ee5f | issn =1748-9326 | doi =10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/044001 | accessdate =2009-03-22 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode =2007ERL.....2d4001H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;GHG\ Savings=HL \left( \frac{FI}{AFUE \times 1000\frac{kg}{ton}}-\frac{EI}{COP \times 3600\frac{sec}{hr}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
*HL = seasonal heat load ≈ 80 GJ/yr for a modern detached house in the northern US
*FI = emissions intensity of fuel = 50&amp;nbsp;kg(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GJ for natural gas, 73 for heating oil, 0 for 100% [[renewable energy]] such as wind, hydro, photovoltaic or solar thermal
*[[AFUE]] = furnace efficiency ≈ 95% for a modern [[condensing furnace]]
*COP = heat pump coefficient of performance ≈ 3.2 seasonally adjusted for northern US heat pump
*EI = emissions intensity of electricity ≈ 200–800 ton(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GWh, depending on region

Ground-source heat pumps always produce fewer greenhouse gases than air conditioners, oil furnaces, and electric heating, but natural gas furnaces may be competitive depending on the greenhouse gas intensity of the local electricity supply. In countries like Canada and Russia with low emitting electricity infrastructure, a residential heat pump may save 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year relative to an oil furnace, or about as much as taking an average passenger car off the road. But in cities like Beijing or Pittsburgh that are highly reliant on coal for electricity production, a heat pump may result in 1 or 2 tons more carbon dioxide emissions than a natural gas furnace.  For areas not served by utility natural gas infrastructure, however, no better alternative exists.

The fluids used in closed loops may be designed to be biodegradable and non-toxic, but the refrigerant used in the heat pump cabinet and in direct exchange loops was, until recently, [[chlorodifluoromethane]], which is an ozone depleting substance.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rafferty | first = Kevin |date = April 1997| title =An Information Survival Kit for the Prospective Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Owner | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =18 | issue =2 | pages = 1–11 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull18-2/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} The author issued an [http://geoheat.oit.edu/ghp/survival.pdf updated version] of this article in February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although harmless while contained, leaks and improper end-of-life disposal contribute to enlarging the [[ozone hole]].  For new construction, this refrigerant is being phased out in favor of the ozone-friendly but potent greenhouse gas [[R410A]]. The [[EcoCute]] water heater is an air-source heat pump that uses [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] as its working fluid instead of [[chlorofluorocarbons]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Open loop systems (i.e. those that draw ground water as opposed to closed loop systems using a borehole heat exchanger) need to be balanced by reinjecting the spent water. This prevents [[aquifer]] depletion and the contamination of soil or surface water with brine or other compounds from underground.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Before drilling, the underground geology needs to be understood, and drillers need to be prepared to seal the borehole, including preventing penetration of water between strata. The unfortunate example is a geothermal heating project in [[Staufen im Breisgau]], Germany which seems the cause of considerable damage to historical buildings there. In 2008, the city centre was reported to have risen 12&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,589944,00.html Spiegel.de report on recent geological changes] (in German, partial [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/11/town-rips-up.html translation])&lt;/ref&gt; after initially sinking a few millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583323/Geothermal-probe-sinks-German-city.html|title=Geothermal probe sinks German city|first=Bojan|last=Pancevski|date=30 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The boring tapped a naturally pressurized aquifer, and via the borehole this water entered a layer of anhydrite, which expands when wet as it forms gypsum.

Ground-source heat pump technology, like building orientation, is a [[natural building]] technique ([[bioclimatic building]]).

==Economics==
Ground source heat pumps are characterized by high capital costs and low operational costs compared to other [[HVAC]] systems. Their overall economic benefit depends primarily on the relative costs of electricity and fuels, which are highly variable over time and across the world. Based on recent prices, ground-source heat pumps currently have lower operational costs than any other conventional heating source almost everywhere in the world. Natural gas is the only fuel with competitive operational costs, and only in a handful of countries where it is exceptionally cheap, or where electricity is exceptionally expensive.&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; In general, a homeowner may save anywhere from 20% to 60% annually on utilities by switching from an ordinary system to a ground-source system.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium, Inc. |url=http://geoexchange.us/ |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economics"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Lienau | first1 =Paul J.  | last2 =Boyd | first2 =Tonya L.  | last3 =Rogers | first3 =Robert L.  |date = April 1995| title =Ground-Source Heat Pump Case Studies and Utility Programs | place =Klamath Falls, OR | publisher =Geo-Heat Center, Oregon Institute of Technology | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/hp1.pdf | accessdate=2009-03-26 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital costs and system lifespan have received much less study until recently, and the [[return on investment]] is highly variable. The most recent data from an analysis of 2011–2012 incentive payments in the state of Maryland showed an average cost of residential systems of $1.90 per watt, or about $26,700 for a typical (4 ton) home system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenThermal.org analysis of geothermal incentive payments in the state of Maryland|url=http://openthermal.net/md/|publisher=OpenThermal.org|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An older study found the total installed cost for a system with 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 ton) thermal capacity for a detached rural residence in the US averaged $8000–$9000 in 1995 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kavanaugh|first1=Steve|last2=Gilbreath|first2=Christopher|editor=Joseph Kilpatrick|title=Cost Containment for Ground-Source Heat Pumps|url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/tp72.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|edition=final report|date=December 1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies found an average cost of $14,000 in 2008 US dollars for the same size system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=Paul|title=Indiana Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Rebate, Program Review|url=http://www.in.gov/oed/files/GHPProgramreport.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|date=June 2008|publisher=Indiana Office of Energy and Defense Development|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oakridge"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. | title = Geothermal (Ground-Source) Heat Pumps: Market Status, Barriers to Adoption, and Actions to Overcome Barriers| last1 = Hughes| publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory | year = 2008| doi = 10.2172/948543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Energy estimates a price of $7500 on its website, last updated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12670 |title=Energy Savers: Selecting and Installing a Geothermal Heat Pump System |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source in Canada placed prices in the range of $30,000–$34,000 Canadian dollars.&lt;ref name="retscreen"&gt;{{Cite book |editor=RETscreen International|title=Clean Energy Project Analysis: RETscreen Engineering &amp; Cases Textbook |url=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/12.php |accessdate=2009-04-20 |year=2005 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |isbn=0-662-39150-0 |id=Catalogue no.: M39-110/2005E-PDF |chapter=Ground-Source Heat Pump Project Analysis |chapterurl=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/textbook_gshp.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid escalation in system price has been accompanied by rapid improvements in efficiency and reliability. Capital costs are known to benefit from economies of scale, particularly for open loop systems, so they are more cost-effective for larger commercial buildings and harsher climates. The initial cost can be two to five times that of a conventional heating system in most residential applications, new construction or existing. In retrofits, the cost of installation is affected by the size of living area, the home's age, insulation characteristics, the geology of the area, and location of the property. Proper duct system design and mechanical air exchange should be considered in the initial system cost.

Capital costs may be offset by government subsidies; for example,  Ontario offered $7000 for residential systems installed in the 2009 fiscal year. Some electric companies offer special rates to customers who install a ground-source heat pump for heating or cooling their building.&lt;ref name="geothermal_incentive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |title=Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=[[Capital Electric Cooperative]] |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206122801/http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where electrical plants have larger loads during summer months and idle capacity in the winter, this increases electrical sales during the winter months. Heat pumps also lower the load peak  during the summer due to the increased efficiency of heat pumps, thereby avoiding costly construction of new power plants. For the same reasons, other utility companies have started to pay for the installation of ground-source heat pumps at customer residences. They lease the systems to their customers for a monthly fee, at a net overall saving to the customer.

The lifespan of the system is longer than conventional heating and cooling systems. Good data on system lifespan is not yet available because the technology is too recent, but many early systems are still operational today after 25–30 years with routine maintenance. Most loop fields have warranties for 25 to 50 years and are expected to last at least 50 to 200 years.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghpcFAQ"/&gt; Ground-source heat pumps use electricity for heating the house.

The payback period for larger commercial systems in the US is 1–5 years, even when compared to natural gas.&lt;ref name="economics" /&gt; Additionally, because geothermal heat pumps usually have no outdoor compressors or cooling towers, the risk of vandalism is reduced or eliminated, potentially extending a system's lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of a Geothermal Heat Pump System |url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/benefits-of-a-geothermal-heat-pump-system.html |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground source heat pumps are recognized as one of the most efficient heating and cooling systems on the market. They are often the second-most cost effective solution in extreme climates (after [[co-generation]]), despite reductions in thermal efficiency due to ground temperature. (The ground source is warmer in climates that need strong air conditioning, and cooler in climates that need strong heating.) The financial viability of these systems depends on the adequate sizing of ground heat exchangers (GHEs), which generally contribute the most to the overall capital costs of GSHP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icebookshop.com/Products/Geothermal-Energy,-Heat-Exchange-Systems-and-Energ.aspx|title=Geothermal Energy, Heat Exchange Systems and Energy Piles|last=Craig|first=William|last2=Gavin|first2=Kenneth|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763983|location=London|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial systems maintenance costs in the US have historically been between $0.11 to $0.22 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year in 1996 dollars, much less than the average $0.54 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year for conventional HVAC systems.&lt;ref name="bloomquist"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bloomquist | first = R.

Governments that promote renewable energy will likely offer incentives for the consumer (residential), or industrial markets. For example, in the United States, incentives are offered both on the state and federal levels of government.&lt;ref name="mmar2009"&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222100703/http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 |date=2008-02-22 }}. US Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] provides a financial incentive for generation of renewable heat based on metered readings on an annual basis for 20 years for commercial buildings.

Because of the technical knowledge and equipment needed to design and size the system properly (and install the piping if heat fusion is required), a GSHP system installation requires a professional's services. Several installers have published real-time views of system performance in an online community of recent residential installations.  The [[International Ground Source Heat Pump Association]] ([[IGSHPA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGSHPA|url=http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/|publisher=www.igshpa.okstate.edu|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal Exchange Organization (GEO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Executive Order on Sustainability Includes Geothermal Heat Pumps|url=https://www.geoexchange.org/|publisher=www.geoexchange.org|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.geo-exchange.ca/ Canadian GeoExchange Coalition] and the [http://www.gshp.org.uk/ Ground Source Heat Pump Association] maintain listings of qualified installers in the US, Canada and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12670 |title=Energy Savers: Selecting and Installing a Geothermal Heat Pump System |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, detailed analysis of Soil thermal conductivity for horizontal systems and formation thermal conductivity for vertical systems will generally result in more accurately design systems with a higher efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/|title=Horizontal &amp; Vertical Thermal Conductivity |publisher=Carbonzeroco.com |date=2016-03-23 |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Carnet B''''': Created in 1886, the ''Carnet B'' was, initially, a list of foreigners suspected of espionage. Prior to [[World War I]], the list was gradually expanded to include all persons likely to disturb public order and [[antimilitarists]] who might oppose national mobilization. Those listed were to be arrested in the event of war. In July 1914 the list contained 2,481 names. However, after the assassination of socialist leader and committed antimilitarist [[Jean Jaurès]] a few days before the start of World War I, most of the left-wing rallied to the ''[[Union sacrée]]'' (Sacred Union) government and ''Carnet B'' was not used to detain individuals. The maintenance and use of ''Carnet B'' was discontinued on 18 July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This doesn't work: [[fr:Carnet B|"''Carnet B''"]] --&gt;[[:fr:Carnet B|"''Carnet B''"]], Wikipédia en français, 14 July 2013.

* '''Tulard database''': In the [[interwar period]], police officer [[André Tulard]] set up a database registering [[French Communist Party|communists]] and others activists. The database was used under [[Vichy France|Vichy]] to register Jews. These files were given to [[Theodor Dannecker]] of the [[Gestapo]] and greatly assisted the [[French police]] in carrying out raids against Jews, who were then interned at [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy camp]] before being deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPV14lGhF8gC&amp;q=Tulard#v=snippet&amp;q=Tulard&amp;f=false ''Verdict on Vichy: Power and Prejudice in the Vichy France Regime''], Michael Curtis, Arcade Publishing (New York), 2003, 440 pp, {{ISBN|1559706899}}.

* '''''Répertoire national d’identification des personnes physiques'' (''RNIPP'')''': a national directory for the identification of natural persons, maintained by INSEE since 1946. It is regularly updated through statistical bulletins on civil status changes, drawn up and sent to INSEE by municipalities and containing details of births, deaths, recognitions and marginal notes made in birth certificates for persons born in metropolitan France or its overseas departments. The directory serves four purposes: (i) to eliminate confusion arising from people sharing the same name; (ii) use by tax authorities and pension funds to verify the civil status of individuals; (iii) contributing to health monitoring by sending daily information on deaths to the Institute for Health Monitoring (InVS); and (iv) generating demographic statistics to assist in decision-making. RNIPP only includes information on the civil status of citizens: family name, sometimes the usual name (or marital name), given names, gender, date and place of birth,  number of birth certificate, date and place of death and death certificate number for the recently deceased, and national registration number. The National System of Management of the Identities managed by ''Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse'' (''CNAV''), the social security pension administrator, is a copy of the RNIPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/en/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/rnipp.htm "Definition: National Directory for the Identification of Natural Persons / RNIPP"], National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).

Records are held for a maximum of 40 years. The STIC has sparked several controversies, as some people have not been able to find jobs because they were registered in the STIC (sometimes wrongly, others simply as victims). In 2005 the [[CNIL|CNiL]] discovered errors in 47% of the records included in the STIC database.&lt;ref name=LDH/&gt;
* '''''JUDEX''''': a system to register criminal offenders and plaintiffs used by the [[Gendarmerie]] is similar to the STIC.  JUDEX contained 2.2 millions records in 2003.&lt;ref name=LDH&gt;[http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article1604 "''Les fichiers STIC et JUDEX détournés de leur destination initiale''"], [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH), 3 November 2006, {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Base-élèves'' system''': the Students-Base system, a database containing personal data on children age three and older and their families, including psychosocial data and information on competence, skills, and problems. Although initially accessed by educators and social actors, the new French law of March 2007 for the prevention of delinquency granted access to such information to Mayors for the purpose of preventing delinquency. However, after protests, data related to citizenship, language, and culture of origin were removed in October 2007. The ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', the highest administrative jurisdiction, held in two decisions of 19 July 2010 that the "''Base-élèves''" and the computerised file of student identifiers ("''Base nationale des identifiants des élèves''" or BNIE) were not functioning in compliance with the Data Protection Act. Further, the Conseil déetat considered that the collection of health data in the "Base-élèves" relating to children was not relevant and reminded in its decisions that parents have a right to object to the collection and processing of their children's data. It also held that the retention period of 35 years for the children identifiers contained in the BNIE was excessive.&lt;ref name="PI-France-2011"/&gt;

The new database would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (''[[Fichier des personnes recherchées]]'' or FPR). The CNiL protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.&lt;ref name=Parafes&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html "''Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français''"] (Generalization of the voluntary filing of biometric profiles for travelers in French Airports), ''[[Le Monde]]'' (AFP), 8 August 2007, {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fingerprints''': In a decision delivered on 18 April 2013, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that a 1987 French Decree related to storing fingerprint data is a privacy violation because:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=93cc918e-5827-4059-9452-063def250630 "European Court of Human Rights finds that storing fingerprint data is privacy violation"], Cédric Lindenmann, Lexology, 14 June 2013.

** the scope of the Decree is not limited to certain serious crimes, such as sexual offences or organised crime, but includes all offences, even the minor ones; 
** the database did not distinguish between those data subjects who were convicted and those who were not, nor did it make a distinction on whether the data subjects had been officially charged; and
** the maximum data retention period of 25 years was disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of the Decree.

===Schengen area===

* '''[[Schengen Information System]]''' (SIS), a database system used by 27 European countries to maintain and distribute information on individuals and property of interest for national security, border control, and law enforcement purposes. The countries using the system in 2013 are the five original participants (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), twenty additional countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland), as well as two countries (Ireland and the United Kingdom) that participate under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]. The database contains more than 46 million entries, called alerts, mostly dealing with lost identity documents. Person alerts comprise roughly 885,000 of the entries (1.9%). The person alerts include: first and last names; middle initial, aliases, date of birth, sex, nationality, is the person armed and/or violent, reason for the alert, and the action to be taken if person is encountered. The remainder of the database contains alerts relating to lost, stolen, or misappropriated property, including: firearms, identity documents, blank identity documents, motor vehicles, and banknotes. SIS does not record travellers' entries into or exits from the [[Schengen Area]] or individual countries, although 14 Schengen participants have separate national databases which do record travellers' entries and exits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33020_en.htm "The Schengen Information System (SIS)"], The Schengen area and cooperation, ''Europa'', 3 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)''': [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] is a tiered set of databases at the local, state, and national levels. The tiered architecture allows crime laboratories to control their own data—each laboratory decides which profiles it will share with the rest of the country. State law governs which specific crimes are eligible for CODIS. A record in the CODIS database, known as a CODIS DNA profile, consists of an individual's DNA profile, together with the sample's identifier and an identifier of the laboratory responsible for the profile. CODIS does not contain any personal identity information, such as names, dates of birth, or social security numbers. CODIS consists of the Convicted Offender Index (profiles of individuals convicted of crimes), the Forensic Index (profiles developed from biological material found at crime-scenes), the Arrestee Index, the Missing or Unidentified Persons Index, and the Missing Persons Reference Index. As of 2006, approximately 180 laboratories in all 50 states participate in CODIS. At the national level, the National DNA Index System (NDIS), is operated by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the CODIS Program and the National DNA Index System"], Federal Bureau of Investigation.

'''Gustave Hermite''' (June 11, 1863 - November 9, 1914) was a French [[aeronaut]] and [[physicist]], pioneer with [[Georges Besançon]] of the [[weather balloon]]. He was the nephew of [[Charles Hermite]], one of the fathers of modern mathematical analysis.

==Biography==
Gustave Hermite was born in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France, on June 11, 1863.&lt;ref name=aerophile&gt;{{cite journal|language=fr|author=Emmanuel Aimé|title=Portraits d'aéronautes contemporains|journal=[[L'Aérophile]]|volume=4 |issue=1 and 2 |date=January-February 1896|pages=1-5|issn=|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553510t|publisher=Blondel la Rougery|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bonplans&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.radiosonde.eu.bonplans.info/RS01/RS01P11.html|title=Gustave Hermite, inventeur du ballon-sonde|series=La Chasse aux radiosondes|auteur=|website=www.radiosonde.eu.bonplans.info|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fond of sciences, he began studying chemistry in 1884 at the laboratory of the Academy of Neuchâtel in Switzerland, then turned to astronomy.&lt;ref name=aerophile/&gt; His first communication to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1884 deals with an astronomical telescope of its design.&lt;ref name=aerophile/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt; In 1885, he became a member of the [[Société astronomique de France|Astronomical Society of France]]. He then embarked on developing inventions and in 1887, he designed and made a rangefinder, then in 1888  a small captive helicopter powered by an electric motor attached to a battery on the ground.&lt;ref name=aerophile/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt;

In 1889 he began experimenting with heavier than air aviation: small airplanes propelled by rockets or kites used as a means of traction, on  water or on  ice.&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt; On August 17, 1889, he made his first flight in an untethered balloon and, with his friend [[Georges Besançon]], in 1889 built the ''Sirius'' in which they made a trip from Paris to [[Le Creusot]] in 16 hours with a stop in the [[Yonne]] Department.&lt;ref name=aerophile/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt;

In 1890-91, Hermite and Besançon planned a flight over the [[North Pole]] but the project did not materialize for lack of funding. The two men began then working on high altitude balloons for scientific purposes. In early 1892, they launched a series of small paper balloons filled with gas to become familiar with the technique.&lt;ref name="zebulon"&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url= http://zebulon1er.free.fr/radiosondage.htm| title= Le radiosondage | work= La Météo | accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, the first documented weather balloon in history flew,  with a [[barometer]] and a minimum [[thermometer]].&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt; The ball fell to the ground thanks to a parachute and the instruments could be recovered.

Having demonstrated the feasibility of the balloon probe, which he gave the name of weather balloon, and thanks to the support of the Union Aerophile de France, they then launch a series of balloons capable of carrying more than 10,000 meters a nacelle weighing several kilograms containing recording devices which inaugurated a series of international scientific ascents.&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt; In 1898 [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] organized the beginnings of systematic sounding of the atmosphere at the Trappes Observatory of Dynamic Meteorology .&lt;ref name="zebulon"/&gt;

Gustave Hermite died on November 9, 1914 in [[Bois-Colombes]], a suburb of Paris.&lt;ref name=bonplans/&gt;

In [[psychoanalytic theory]], when an individual is unable to integrate difficult feelings, specific defenses are mobilized to overcome what the individual perceives as an unbearable situation. The defense that helps in this process is called [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]]. Splitting is the tendency to view events or people as either all bad or all good.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kraft Goin (1998). [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p981153.html ''Borderline Personality Disorder: Splitting Countertransference.''] The Psychiatric Times, vol. 15 issue 11&lt;/ref&gt; When viewing people as all good, the individual is said to be using the [[defense mechanism]] '''idealization''': a mental mechanism in which the person attributes [[exaggeratedly]] positive qualities to the self or others. When viewing people as all bad, the individual employs '''devaluation''': attributing exaggeratedly negative qualities to the self or others.

In child development, idealization and devaluation are quite normal. During the childhood development stage, individuals become capable of perceiving others as complex structures, containing both good and bad components. If the development stage is interrupted (by early childhood trauma, for example), these defense mechanisms may persist into adulthood.

== Sigmund Freud ==
The term idealization first appeared in connection with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s definition of [[narcissism]]. Freud's vision was that all human infants pass through a phase of [[primary narcissism]] in which they assume they are the centre of their universe.  To obtain the parents' love the child comes to do what he thinks the parents value. Internalising these values the child forms an [[ego ideal]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, E.D. (1978). ''The Ego Ideal of the Psychoanalyst.'' Int. J. Psycho-Anal., 59:377-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S. &amp; Scheier, M.F. (2000). ''Perspectives on Personality.'' Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; This ego ideal contains rules for good behaviour and standards of excellence toward which the ego has to strive. When the child cannot bear ambivalence between the [[real self]] and the ego ideal and defenses are used too often, it is called pathologic. Freud called this situation [[secondary narcissism]], because the ego itself is idealized. Explanations of the idealization of others besides the self are sought in drive theory as well as in object-relation theory. From the viewpoint of libidinal drives, idealization of other people is a "flowing-over" of narcissistic [[libido]] onto the object; from the viewpoint of self-object relations, the object representations (like that of the caregivers) were made more beautiful than they really were.&lt;ref&gt;Spruiell, V. (1979). Freud's Concepts of Idealization. J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn., 27:777-791&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heinz Kohut ==
An extension of Freud's theory of narcissism came when [[Heinz Kohut]] presented the so-called "self-object transferences" of idealization and [[Mirroring (psychology)|mirroring]]. To Kohut, idealization in childhood is a healthy mechanism. If the parents fail to provide appropriate opportunities for idealization ([[healthy narcissism]]) and mirroring (how to cope with reality), the child does not develop beyond a developmental stage in which he sees himself as [[grandiose]] but in which he also remains dependent on others to provide his [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, L. (1989). [http://www.findingstone.com/professionals/monographs/kohutandjung.htm ''Kohut and Jung A Comparison of Theory and Therapy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newirth, J.W. (1987). ''Idealization and Interpretation.'' Contemporary Psychoanalysis 23, 239-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut stated that, with narcissistic patients, idealization of the self and the therapist should be allowed during therapy and then very gradually will diminish as a result of unavoidable optimal frustration.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, S.A., &amp; Black, M.J. (1995). ''Freud and beyond.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otto Kernberg ==
[[Otto Kernberg]] has provided an extensive discussion of idealization, both in its defensive and adaptive aspects. He conceptualised idealization as involving a denial of unwanted characteristics of an object, then enhancing the object by projecting one's own libido or omnipotence on it. He proposed a developmental line with one end of the continuum being a normal form of idealization and the other end a pathological form. In the latter, the individual has a problem with object constancy and sees others as all good or all bad, thus bolstering idealization and devaluation. At this stage idealization is associated with borderline pathology. At the other end of the continuum, idealization is said to be a necessary precursor for feelings of mature love.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, P.M., Van-Der Keshet, Y. (1995). ''A Note on the Assessment of Idealization.'' Journal of Personality Assessment, 65 (1) 77-90

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14934">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''intertrial priming''' is an accumulation of the [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effect over multiple trials, where "priming" is the effect of the exposure to one stimulus on subsequently presented stimuli.  Intertrial priming occurs when a target feature (the characteristic that distinguishes targets from non-targets) is repeated from one trial to the next, and typically results in speeded response times to the target. A target is the stimulus participants are required to search for. For example, intertrial priming occurs when the task is to respond to either a red or a green target, and the response time to a red target is faster if the preceding trial also has a red target.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maljkovic|first1=V|last2=Nakayama|first2=K|title=Priming of pop-out: I. Role of features|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=November 1994|volume=22|issue=6|pages=657–72|pmid=7808275|doi=10.3758/bf03209251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top-down and bottom-up attention ==
Visual attention is influenced by [[Attention#Bottom-up versus top-down|top down and bottom up]] attentional processes. Top-down attention is  allocated based on an observer's current knowledge about the stimuli. Participants in an experiment might be instructed to search for, and respond to a target object presented in a display that is a different colour than the other objects presented simultaneously. Top down knowledge of the dimension of the target (i.e. colour) can speed response times to target identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=A|last2=Gormican|first2=S|title=Feature analysis in early vision: evidence from search asymmetries.|journal=Psychological Review|date=January 1988|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15–48|pmid=3353475|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.95.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up attention is involuntarily and automatically directed towards salient features in the environment such as a bright colour among dull colours. In experimental settings, the more different a stimulus is from other stimuli in a visual display, the more salient it is. Bottom-up attention is typically not guided by observers' goals or knowledge, only by the physical properties of the stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor|first1=Charles E.|last2=Egeth|first2=Howard E.|last3=Yantis|first3=Steven|title=Visual Attention: Bottom-Up Versus Top-Down|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=19|pages=R850–R852|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.09.041|pmid=15458666|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies employ various methods involving intertrial priming to assess the contribution of top down versus bottom up processes in guiding attention in visual search tasks.

=== Integrative framework ===
There are factors in [[visual search]] tasks that the top down versus bottom up dichotomy does not take into consideration. Not all selection biases can be explained by physical saliency (bottom up) or observer goals (top down).&lt;ref name="awh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Awh|first1=Edward|last2=Belopolsky|first2=Artem V.|last3=Theeuwes|first3=Jan|title=Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=16|issue=8|pages=437–443|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2012.06.010|pmid=22795563|pmc=3426354|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies that have found that stimuli that are equally salient and are connected with rewards and can draw a participants' attention, even if this choice doesn't match their selection goals. An alternative framework has been proposed where past selection history, current goals and physical salience are integrated in a model of attentional control.&lt;ref name="awh" /&gt;

== Measuring the effects of intertrial priming ==
Intertrial priming is an important aspect to consider in designing an experiment as it can influence the results if it is not considered/controlled. Intertrial priming is often measured using a visual search task. A typical visual search task involves participants searching for, and responding to, a target amongst a group of non-target items. Intertrial priming performance is generally measured by recording participants' reaction times to identify a target and comparing these times across trials. Different trial designs and visual search tasks can be employed to measure intertrial priming.

=== Blocked and mixed trials ===
Studies often compare blocked and mixed visual search trials to measure intertrial priming. [[Blocking effect|Blocked trial]]s are multiple, successively presented visual search trials that include the same target, and [[mixed trial]]s are a randomised series of trials, each trial consisting of different targets.&lt;ref name="hillstrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillstrom|first1=Anne P.|title=Repetition effects in visual search|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=62|issue=4|pages=800–817|doi=10.3758/BF03206924|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a blocked trial condition may include searching for a green circle in trial 1, and in multiple successive preceding trials, whereas a mixed trial condition may include searching a for a green circle in trial 1, but a red circle in the proceeding trials. Blocking trials can control for effects of variability in targets. When a target with the same defining feature is repeated across trials (blocked conditions), participants reaction times are faster than when the target is not the same across trials (mixed conditions).&lt;ref name="hillstrom" /&gt;  This repetition effect is also cumulative. As the number of target repetitions increases, up to a certain point, participants reaction times are faster each time they are exposed to the same target in repeated trials.&lt;ref name="hillstrom" /&gt;  In mixed and blocked trials there can be a disparity in intertrial priming that results in faster reaction times in the blocked trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bravo|first1=Mary J.|last2=Nakayama|first2=Ken|title=The role of attention in different visual-search tasks|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=51|issue=5|pages=465–472|doi=10.3758/BF03211642|year=1992|citeseerx=10.1.1.155.4133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times may be faster in blocked trials because participants are required to respond to targets that differ in only one dimension from non-targets.

=== Cueing ===
A [[Sensory cue|cue]] is a presentation of a stimulus prior to a trial to inform the participant of an upcoming target feature. For example, a blue circle may be shown before a trial to signify a blue circle will be the target in the upcoming trial. Target relevant cues may be presented to participants to decrease their reaction time to the target in the display. These cues may be valid or invalid. Valid cues correctly predict the target stimulus but invalid cues do not. For example, if the target in an upcoming trial is a blue circle, a blue circle presented as a cue would be valid, but if a red circle was presented as a cue it would be invalid, as it doesn't correctly predict the blue circle target stimulus. Reaction times to valid cues are typically faster than reaction times to invalid cues.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; This phenomenon is known as a cueing effect.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt;

=== Cue validity effect ===
When a valid cue has a low probability of correct target prediction, there can still be a reliable cueing effect for valid cues, and faster reaction times to valid cues than invalid cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Theeuwes|first1=Jan|last2=Reimann|first2=Brit|last3=Mortier|first3=Karen|title=Visual search for featural singletons: No top-down modulation, only bottom-up priming|journal=Visual Cognition|volume=14|issue=4–8|pages=466–489|doi=10.1080/13506280500195110|year=2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.78.1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the [[Contextual cueing|cueing effect]] is not affected by the predictive nature of the cue, and may not be due to top-down control. If top-down control is involved in the response selection then invalid trials should have a faster response than valid trials because participants are aware that the likelihood of being presented with a valid trial is very low.

== Types of visual search ==

=== Pop-out search ===
Pop-out search tasks include a target that differs in one dimension from a group of homogeneous non-target items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Stefanie I.|title=The mechanism of priming: Episodic retrieval or priming of pop-out?|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=127|issue=2|pages=324–339|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.07.005|pmid=17868628|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dimension is a categorical feature of a stimulus such as its colour (i.e. a red target among green non-targets), its shape (a square target among circle non-targets) or its orientation (a vertically presented target among horizontal non-targets). Response times in pop-out searches are generally faster to targets when the colour of both targets and distractors remains the same throughout trials, and slower when these colours are switched during trials.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt;

=== Conjunctive search ===
{{Main article|Conjunctive query}}
A conjunctive search involves non-target stimuli that have more than one dimension in common with the target stimulus. For example, when a target is a green circle in a conjunctive search, non-targets (distractors) could be red circles and green squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Gelade|first2=Garry|title=A feature-integration theory of attention|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=97–136|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5|pmid=7351125|date=January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target will share one dimension in common with one set of non-targets (i.e. shape) and another dimension in common with the other non-target group (i.e. colour). If target and distractor features are the same over consecutive trials, response times are faster than when these dimensions are not repeated.&lt;ref name="geyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geyer|first1=Thomas|last2=Müller|first2=Hermann J.|last3=Krummenacher|first3=Joseph|title=Cross-trial priming of element positions in visual pop-out search is dependent on stimulus arrangement.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=33|issue=4|pages=788–797|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.33.4.788|pmid=17683228|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why it occurs (major theories) ==

=== Dimension-weighting account theory ===
The "[[Pre-attentive processing#Vision|dimension-weighting account]]" of visual selection states that there is a limit to the [[Attentional bias|attentional weight]] that can be allocated to a particular dimension of an object at any one time. The dimensions of stimuli perceived as important to an observer are allocated more attentional weight (i.e. a target in a visual search), resulting in faster detection times.  If a target dimension is known in advance, this can increase the [[Salience (neuroscience)|saliency]] signals of the target. On the other hand, if the target dimension is unknown, attentional weight has to be shifted to the target dimension. When target dimensions remain the same across trials there is no change in attentional weight required, resulting in faster reaction times (intertrial facilitation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Found|first1=Andrew|last2=Müller|first2=Hermann J.|title=Searching for unknown feature targets on more than one dimension: Investigating a 'dimension-weighting' account|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=58|issue=1|pages=88–101|doi=10.3758/BF03205479|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priming of pop-out hypothesis ===
The priming of pop-out [[hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; suggests performance in a visual search task involving a pop-out target can be affected by the search history of specific target features in previous trials. If target and distractor features are repeated in subsequent trials, reaction times will be faster than if these features change across trials.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; The hypothesis proposes the repetition of a target used in a preceding trial makes its pop-out features more salient to an observer and therefore increases the likelihood the observer will attend to it.

=== Episodic retrieval hypothesis ===
The [[Negative priming#Episodic retrieval model|episodic retrieval model]]&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Liqiang|last2=Holcombe|first2=Alex|last3=Pashler|first3=Harold|title=Repetition priming in visual search:  Episodic retrieval, not feature priming|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=2004|volume=1|issue=32|pages=12–20|doi=10.3758/bf03195816}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests reduced response times in intertrial priming are due to the observers' retrieval of [[episodic memories]] relevant to the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olivers|first1=Christian N. L.|last2=Meeter|first2=Martijn|title=Feature priming in visual search does not depend on the dimensional context|journal=Visual Cognition|volume=16|issue=6|pages=785–803|doi=10.1080/13506280701428658|year=2008|hdl=1871/16531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis states that visual search is composed of three successive stages of processing:
# search for a target,
# decide if the chosen target is the target of interest, and
# select and respond to the chosen target.&lt;ref name="huang" /&gt;
This hypothesis argues that when a target presented in a previous trial is presented again in the current trial, processing of the target is accelerated in the target decision stage of the model, so that after identification the target is verified to assess whether it matches the previous target stored in episodic memory.

=== Perceptual grouping of distractors account ===
Many theories focus on the repetition of target features as dominant explanation for the repetition effects seen in intertrial priming.  If target features are the same over consecutive trials but [[Object-based attention#Distractors|distractor feature]]s are changed, response times are not as fast as if both target and distractor features are kept constant over trials.&lt;ref name="geyer" /&gt;  This suggests that intertrial priming may mainly be due to distractor feature repetition, and target feature repetition influences this only slightly. This distractor-based priming may be due to faster perceptual grouping of distractors across trials. Perceptual grouping of distractors allows the target presence or absence to be distinguished more quickly.&lt;ref name="geyer" /&gt;  However, the repetition of target defining features cannot be excluded as a contributor to the priming effect found in conjunctive searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristjánsson|first1=Árni|last2=Wang|first2=DeLiang|last3=Nakayama|first3=Ken|title=The role of priming in conjunctive visual search|journal=Cognition|volume=85|issue=1|pages=37–52|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00074-4|pmid=12086712|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.116.8419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judgement''' (or '''judgment''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/judgement.html Judgement or Judgment?] - Choices in [[terminology|terminological]] spelling and usage.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[evaluation]] of [[evidence]] to [[make a decision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=43009&amp;dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/judgement?view=uk |title=AskOxford.com |publisher=AskOxford.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/judgement LDOCEonline]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has four distinct uses:
* Informal – [[opinion]]s expressed as facts. 
* Informal and [[psychological]] – used in reference to the quality of [[Mind|cognitive faculties]] and adjudicational capabilities of particular individuals, typically called ''[[wisdom]]'' or ''[[discernment]]''.
* Legal – used in the context of legal [[trial]], to refer to a final [[judgment (law)|finding, statement, or ruling]], based on a considered weighing of evidence, called, "''[[adjudication]]''". See [[Judgment (law)#Spelling|spelling note]] for further explanation. 
* Religious – used in the concept of [[salvation]] to refer to the ''[[divine judgement|adjudication of God]]'' in determining [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]] for each and all human beings. God's assessment of a person's worth: a determination of "good" conveys great value while "evil" conveys worthless.

Additionally, judgement can mean:
* [[Personality judgment]], a psychological phenomenon of a person forming opinions of other people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7782">'''Lila''' ({{lang-sa|लीला}}, [[IAST]] ''{{IAST|līlā}}'') or '''Leela''' can be loosely translated as the ''"divine play"''. The concept of Lila is common to both [[Nondualism|non-dualist]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical]] schools, but has a markedly different significance in each. Within non-dualism, Lila is a way of describing all [[reality]], including the [[cosmos]], as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute ([[Brahman]]). In the dualistic schools of [[Vaishnavism]], Lila refers to the activities of [[God]] and his devotee, as well as the macrocosmic actions of the manifest universe, as seen in the Vaishnava scripture ''[[Srimad Bhagavatam]]'', verse 3.26.4:&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/3/26/4/ Vedabase entry SB 3.26.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701191002/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/26/4/ |date=2015-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==

{{quote|{{Anchor|misra}}Brahman is full of all perfections. And to say that Brahman has some purpose in creating the world will mean that it wants to attain through the process of creation something which it has not. And that is impossible. Hence, there can be no purpose of Brahman in creating the world. The world is a mere spontaneous creation of Brahman. It is a Lila, or sport, of Brahman. It is created out of Bliss, by Bliss and for Bliss. Lila indicates a spontaneous sportive activity of Brahman as distinguished from a self-conscious volitional effort. The concept of Lila signifies freedom as distinguished from necessity.|Ram Shanker Misra|''The Integral [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitism]] of [[Sri Aurobindo]]''}}

{{quote|{{Anchor|zimmer_campbell}}The relation of [[Purusha|Purusa]] to [[Prakrti]]—the unfolding force of nature—becomes here a relation of male to female. This is expressed in the Siva temple in the core image of the sivalinga, an expression of male ([[Lingam|linga]]) and female ([[yoni]]) union. The basic [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] motif of an unfolding or flowering cosmos is expressed here specifically in the relation of male to female, as well as in terms of consciousness and intentionality (in the concept of lila as the divine play of male and female). As such, the core [[Shaivism|saivite]] image of cosmogony as the flowering of consciousness and sexual union rather than the sacrificial act. This theme resonates with other Hindu doctrines, such as [[Tantra]] and [[Shaktism|Sakta]].|[[Heinrich Zimmer]] and [[Joseph Campbell]]|''Philosophies of India''}}

{{Quote|{{Anchor|bastin}}The Vendantic yogi never tires of stating that [[Moksha|kaivalya]], "isolation-integration", can be attained only by turning away from the distracting allure of the world and worshiping with single-pointed attention the formless Brahman-Atman; to the Tantric, however—as to the normal child of the world—this notion seems pathological, the wrong-headed effect of a certain malady of intellect. (...) "I like eating sugar," as [[Ramprasad Sen|Ramprasad]] said, "but I have no desire to become sugar." Let those who suffer from the toils of [[samsara]] seek release: the perfect devotee does not suffer; for he can both visualize and experience life and the universe as the revelation of that Supreme Divine Force ([[shakti]]) with which he is in love, the all-comprehensive Divine Being in its cosmic aspect of playful, aimless display (lila)—which precipitates pain as well as joy, but in its bliss transcends them both.|Rohan Bastin|''The Domain of Constant Excess: Plural Worship at the Munnesvaram Temples in [[Sri Lanka]]''}}

{{Quote|{{Anchor|capra}}The basic recurring theme in Hindu mythology is the creation of the world by the self-sacrifice of God—"sacrifice" in the original sense of "making sacred"—whereby God becomes the world which, in the end, becomes again God. This creative activity of the Divine is called lila, the play of God, and the world is seen as the stage of the divine play. Like most of  Hindu mythology, the myth of lila has a strong magical flavour. Brahman is the great magician who transforms himself into the world and then performs this feat with his "magic creative power", which is the original meaning of maya in the Rig Veda. The word maya—one of the most important terms in Indian philosophy—has changed its meaning over the centuries. From the might, or power, of the divine actor and magician, it came to signify the psychological state of anybody under the spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriad forms of the divine lila with reality, without perceiving the unity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under the spell of maya. (...) In the Hindu view of nature, then, all forms are relative, fluid and ever-changing maya, conjured up by the great magician of the divine play. The world of maya changes continuously, because the divine lila is a rhythmic, dynamic play. The dynamic force of the play is karma, an important concept of Indian thought. Karma means "action". It is the active principle of the play, the total universe in action, where everything is dynamically connected with everything else. In the words of the Gita Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all things have their life.|[[Fritjof Capra]]|''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)}}

==Implications==
Hindu denominations differ on how a human should react to awareness of Lila. [[Karma Yoga]] allows a joyful embrace of all aspects of life ("intentional acceptance") while maintaining distinction from the Supreme, while [[Bhakti Yoga|Bhakti]] and [[Jnana Yoga]] advocate striving for oneness with the Supreme. Lila is an important idea in the traditional worship of [[Krishna]] (as prankster) and [[Shiva]] (as dancer), and has been used by modern writers like [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]], [[Fritjof Capra]], and [[Alan Watts]].

Lila is comparable to the Western [[theology|theological]] position of [[Pandeism]], which describes the Universe as God taking a physical form in order to experience the interplay between the elements of the Universe.

A '''Macroscopic traffic flow model''' is a [[mathematical model|mathematical]] [[traffic model]] that formulates the relationships among [[traffic flow]] characteristics like [[density]], [[Traffic flow|flow]], mean speed of a traffic stream, etc.. Such models are conventionally arrived at by integrating [[microscopic traffic flow models]] and converting the single-entity level characteristics to comparable system level characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | doi=10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | volume=217 | issue=3 | title=Rigorous Derivation of Nonlinear Scalar Conservation Laws from Follow-the-Leader Type Models via Many Particle Limit | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | pages=831–871| year=2015 | last1=Di Francesco | first1=M. | last2=Rosini | first2=M.D. | arxiv=1404.7062 | bibcode=2015ArRMA.217..831D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of modeling traffic flow at macroscopic level originated under an assumption that traffic streams as a whole are comparable to [[fluid flow|fluid streams]]. The first major step in macroscopic modeling of traffic was taken by Lighthill and Whitham in 1955, when they indexed the comparability of ‘traffic flow on long crowded roads’ with ‘flood movements in long rivers’. A year later, Richards (1956) complemented the idea with the introduction of ‘[[shock-wave]]s on the highway’, completing the so-called LWR model. 
Macroscopic modeling may be primarily classified according to the type of traffic as homogeneous and heterogeneous, and further with respect to the order of the mathematical model.

Suchman was awarded a [[National Merit Scholarship]] in 1979, a Harvard College Scholarship in 1980 and a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship from 1984 to 1988. He was a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] Scholar in health policy research at [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1999-2001, and a fellow in residence at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in 2001-03.&lt;ref name="CV 2015"/&gt;

He has chaired the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Sections on the Sociology of Law (2005-2006) and Organizations, Occupations, and Work (2016-2017), and has served on the Board of Trustees of the [[Law and Society Association]] (2005-2008).

=== "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches", 1995===
In his article "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'", Suchman defines legitimacy as "a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."&lt;ref name="Suchman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suchman|first1=Mark|title=Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches|journal=The Academy of Management Review |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=571–610 |doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency. In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

Suchman states three types of legitimacy: 
* pragmatic legitimacy, 
* moral legitimacy, and 
* cognitive legitimacy.

=== Pragmatic legitimacy ===
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; This is further broken down into three sub-sections: 
* exchange legitimacy, 
* influence legitimacy, and 
* dispositional legitimacy. 
Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;

Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt; This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

=== Moral legitimacy ===
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Yankelovich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections:
* consequential legitimacy, 
* procedural legitimacy, 
* structural legitimacy, and 
* personal legitimacy. 
Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brinkerhoff |first1=Derick |title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;

=== Cognitive legitimacy ===
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;
Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sun |first1=William |last2=Louche |first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison /&gt; While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison/&gt;

In [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], a '''notation''' is a [[system]] of graphics or [[symbol]]s, [[Character_(symbol)|character]]s and abbreviated [[Expression (language)|expression]]s, used (for example) in [[Artistic disciplines|artistic]] and [[scientific discipline]]s to represent technical facts and quantities by [[Convention (norm)|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;lpg=PT337&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT337 | title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Crystal, David | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notation | title=Notation | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a notation is a collection of related symbols that are each given an [[arbitrary]] meaning, created to facilitate [[structured communication]] within a [[domain knowledge]] or [[field of study]].

Standard notations refer to general agreements in the way things are written or denoted. The term is generally used in technical and scientific areas of study like [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], but can also be seen in areas like [[business]], [[economics]] and [[music]].

==Written communication==
* Phonographic [[writing systems]], by definition, use symbols to represent components of auditory language, i.e. [[speech]], which in turn refers to things or ideas. The two main kinds of phonographic notational system are the [[alphabet]] and the [[syllabary]]. Some written languages are more consistent in their correlation of written symbols (or [[grapheme]]s) with sound (or [[phoneme]]s), and are therefore considered to have better [[phonemic orthography]].
* Ideographic writing, by definition, refers to things or ideas independently of their pronunciation in any language. Some ideographic systems are also [[pictogram]]s that convey meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object.

===Biology and medicine===
* [[Nucleic acid notation]]
* [[Systems Biology Graphical Notation|Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)]]&lt;!--[Doesn't clarify/assist?:], orthogonal notations for ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'', and ''Activity Flows''--&gt;
* [[Sequence motif#Pattern description notations|Sequence motif pattern-description notations]]
* [[Cytogenetic notation]]
* [[Energy Systems Language]]

===Chemistry===
* [[Chemical formula]]s are a way of expressing information about the atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, e.g. {{chem|H|2|O}} or {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}

===Computing===
* BNF (Backus normal form, or [[Backus–Naur form]]) and EBNF (extended Backus-Naur form) are the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars.
* [[Hungarian notation]] is an identifier naming convention in [[computer programming]], that represents the [[data type|type]] or intended use of a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] with a specific pattern within its name. 
* [[Mathematical markup languages]] are computer notations for representing mathematical formulae.
* Various notations have been developed to specify [[regular expression]]s.

===Logic===
A variety of symbols are used to express logical ideas; see the [[List of logic symbols]]

===Management===
* Time and motion study symbols such as [[therblig]]s

===Mathematics===
*[[Mathematical notation]] is used to represent various kinds of mathematical ideas.
** All types of [[notation in probability]]
** [[Cartesian coordinate system]], for representing position and other spatial concepts in analytic geometry
** [[Notation for differentiation]], common representations of the [[derivative]] in [[calculus]]
** [[Big O notation]], used for example in analysis to represent less significant elements of an expression, to indicate that they will be neglected
** [[Z notation]], a formal notation for specifying objects using [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and [[first-order predicate logic]]
** [[Ordinal notation]]
** [[Set-builder notation]], a formal notation for defining [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] in [[set theory]]

** [[Arabic numeral]]s
** [[Roman numeral]]s
** [[Scientific notation]] for expressing large and small numbers
** [[Sign-value notation]], using signs or symbols to represent numbers
** [[Positional notation]] also known as place-value notation, in which each position is related to the next by a multiplier which is called the ''base'' of that numeral system
*** [[Binary notation]], a positional notation in base two
*** [[Octal]] notation, a positional notation in base eight, used in some computers
*** [[Decimal notation]], a positional notation in base ten
*** [[Hexadecimal]] notation, a positional notation in base sixteen, commonly used in computers
*** [[Sexagesimal]] notation, an ancient numeral system in base sixty
* See also [[Table of mathematical symbols]] - for general tokens and their definitions...

===Physics===
* [[Bra–ket notation]], or Dirac notation, is an alternative representation of probability distributions in [[quantum mechanics]].
* [[Tensor index notation]] is used when formulating physics (particularly continuum mechanics, electromagnetism, relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory, and general relativity) in the language of [[tensor]]s.

===Typographical conventions===
* [[Infix notation]], the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, such as "''a'' + ''b'' − ''c''".
* [[Polish notation]] or "prefix notation", which places the operator before the operands (arguments), such as "+ ''a'' ''b''".
* [[Reverse Polish notation]] or "postfix notation", which places the operator after the operands, such as "''a'' ''b'' +".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18756">The '''open–closed''' [[political spectrum]], or '''horseshoe theory''' is an alternative to the standard [[Left–right politics|left–right system]], especially used to describe the [[Cleavage (politics)|cleavage]] in political systems in Europe and North America in the 21st century. In this system, parties and voters are arranged on an axis from open ([[social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[globalist]]) to closed ([[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] and [[protectionist]]). Each side draws from both traditionally left- and right-wing ideas and values: "closed" parties usually hold conventionally right-wing views on social issues but may support the left-wing policies of [[market intervention]] and [[redistribution of wealth]], while open parties can hold left-wing or progressive opinions on many issues but be staunchly in favour of the traditionally more rightist policies of [[free trade]]. Depending on context, open–closed can be a replacement to left–right or a second axis on a [[political compass]].&lt;ref name="Davos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/will-politics-open-closed-replace-left-versus-right-1606328|title=Will the politics of 'open and closed' replace 'left versus right'?|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=International Business Times|first=James|last=Bloodworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

A [[Realigning election|political realignment]] along these lines across the [[Western world]] has been described by political scientists in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the [[Great Recession]] and the [[European migrant crisis]], with mainstream left-wing and right-wing political parties shifting or falling behind [[populism|populist]] parties and [[independent (politics)|independents]]. Examples of votes described as having been fought on open-closed lines include the [[UK EU membership referendum, 2016|2016 Brexit referendum]], presidential elections in [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|Austria in 2016]], [[United States presidential election, 2016|the United States in 2016]] and [[French presidential election, 2017|France in 2017]], and general elections in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|Poland in 2015]] and [[Dutch general election, 2017|the Netherlands in 2017]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and|title=Drawbridges up|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france-amerique.com/a-new-political-spectrum/|title=A New Political Spectrum|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first=Guy|last=Sorman|translator-first=Alexis|translator-last=Cornel|website=France-Amérique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/opinion/the-coming-political-realignment.html|title=The Coming Political Realignment|date=1 July 2016|first=David|last=Brooks|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors and terminology==
[[File:Political spectrum horseshoe model.svg|thumb|The horseshoe theory states that extreme left and right have more in common with each other than the centre.|upright=1.2]]
Prior to the development of [[socialism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary divide in British politics was between [[classical liberalism]] ([[Whiggism]]) and [[traditional conservatism]] ([[Toryism]]) as seen in debates about free trade and the [[Corn Laws]], and James Kirkup, writing in the ''Daily Telegraph'', has suggested that the open-closed split marks a return to this era of politics.&lt;ref name="TTIP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11296902/From-immigration-to-trade-and-the-NHS-politics-is-about-open-vs-closed.html|title=From immigration to trade and the NHS, politics is about open vs closed|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rise of the socially-liberal [[New Left]] and socially-conservative [[Christian right|religious right]] in the 1970s, and the subsequent "[[culture war]]s", marked the beginning the open-closed cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornschier |first=Simon |last2=Kriesi |first2=Hanspeter |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=10–29 |chapter=The populist right, the working class, and the changing face of class politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], writing in the ''Washington Post'', described the [[Nordic model]] of free market social democracy as another early example of open politics.&lt;ref name="Armed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-politics-of-the-future-be-open-and-armed/2016/07/07/fd171ce0-447b-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html|title=The politics of the future: Be open and armed|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|first=Fareed|last=Zakaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephan Shakespeare]], director of public opinion research at [[YouGov]], identified the divide in an analysis of the party positions in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK general election]], but termed closed and open voters "drawbridge up" and "drawbridge down" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/17/uk.election20054|title=They seem to be campaigning for the sake of it|first=Stephan|last=Shakespeare|authorlink=Stephan Shakespeare|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 April 2005|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "open" and "closed" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] in 2006, with reference to the [[horseshoe theory]] that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business|title=Tony Blair’s unfinished business|first=Jason|last=Cowley|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair, who declared himself staunchly for "open", had overseen the development of the [[Third Way]] [[New Labour]] movement in 1990s and the schism in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] between "open" Blairites and "closed" traditional socialists has remained.&lt;ref name="Armed"/&gt; Political analyst [[James Bloodworth (journalist)|James Bloodworth]] criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing "closed" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and "open" as overly laudatory of the "[[Davos Man]]" type of globalist.&lt;ref name="Davos"/&gt;

==Rise and development==
[[File:Angela Merkel Donald Trump 2017-03-17 (cropped).png|thumb|left|Although both are conservatives, the "open" [[Angela Merkel]] and "closed" [[Donald Trump]] fall at opposite ends of the spectrum.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt;|alt=Merkel and Trump at a press conference together.|upright=1.2]]
Following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, plus the arrival of large numbers of [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]], populist political parties made significant gains across the European Union. In southern European countries, these tended to be [[Anti-austerity movement|anti-austerity]] left-wing parties such as [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while northern European countries saw [[anti-immigrant]] right-wing parties such as the [[UK Independence Party]] and the [[Alternative for Germany]] gain support.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; However all these parties shared a [[Eurosceptic]] and [[anti-establishment|anti-elite]] viewpoint, and appealed to the "left-behind" who saw their livelihoods or communities as threatened by globalism and immigration. [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|In 2015]], Syriza became the largest party in the [[Parliament of Greece]], while the right-wing populist [[Law and Justice]] became the first party since the fall of Communism to win an [[absolute majority]] in the Polish [[Sejm]] in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|elections the same year]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; At the [[2016 UK EU membership referendum]], the Leave option narrowly defeated the [[bipartisanship|cross-party]] Remain option. The subsequent realignment of British politics saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], aligned with "Leave", and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], aligned with "Remain", rise in the polls while Labour, which remained deeply divided between its open and closed wings, lost ground rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/has-brexit-broken-british-voting/|title=Has Brexit Broken British Voting?|website=[[British Election Study]]|date=21 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=Jon|last1=Mellon|first2=Chris|last2=Prosser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar political developments followed in the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], liberal and pro-globalism, faced two political opponents who both represented protectionist viewpoints from opposite ends of the left–right spectrum: [[Bernie Sanders]], a [[democratic socialist]] who challenged her in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]], running on a [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" platform.&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newdivide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new|title=The new political divide|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump eventually triumphed, winning several [[Rust Belt]] states from the "[[Blue wall (politics)|Blue Wall]]" of Democratic [[safe state]]s which had suffered [[deindustrialisation]] and economic deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-blue-wall|title=Trump stomps all over the Democrats' Blue Wall|publisher=CNN|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "closed" politicians scored several electoral victories, another realignment in the [[political centre]] began in Europe, as [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] voters abandoned traditional [[Major party|parties of government]] and clustered around new liberal parties and independent politicians. In the Netherlands, where the closed anti-Islam and anti-European [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) under [[Geert Wilders]] led [[Opinion polling for the Dutch general election, 2017|opinion polls]] for much of the previous parliament, the liberal pro-EU [[Democrats 66]] and the [[green politics|green]] [[GroenLinks]] positioned themselves as the main open opponents of the PVV. At the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 elections]], all three parties made significant gains at the expense of the established parties.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21718921-identity-does-not-have-be-exclusive-preserve-far-right-dutch-election-suggests|title=The Dutch election suggests a new kind of identity politics|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Van der Bellen]], an independent formerly of [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]], defeated the anti-immigrant [[Norbert Hofer]] of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 Austrian presidential election]], while [[Emmanuel Macron]], a former member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] who described himself as "neither left nor right" and who founded his own party [[En Marche]], defeated the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] candidate [[Marine Le Pen]] in the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]]. In both cases, neither of the mainstream parties of left and right reached the [[Two-round system|second round of voting]] – instead, each election saw an open centrist independent against a closed [[far-right politics|far-right]] party.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

==Open and closed policies==
Although they can come from all sides of the left–right spectrum, closed parties share common ground on many issues, as likewise do open parties.

===Immigration and social integration===
Opposition to immigration is one of the starkest divides between open and closed parties. The closed position supports restrictions on migration, and prefers that immigrants [[Social integration|integrate]] into the national culture. By contrast, the open position takes a more liberal stance on migration, and tolerates or even celebrates [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Both left-wing and right-wing parties can be closed on the topic of immigration: the conservative Polish Law and Justice accuses immigrants of undermining Polish values and bringing in terrorists, while the socialist German [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] considers immigrants a drain on the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;{{Not in source|date=February 2018}} Conversely, in the United Kingdom for example the [[Adam Smith Institute]] (a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] right-wing organisation) and [[Vince Cable]] (a left-wing [[social democrat]] and former [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|business secretary]]) stand together as some of the strongest defenders of immigration.&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Trade and economic integration===
Issues of [[international trade]] and [[international cooperation]] are another significant line of division between the two camps. In the open ideology, free trade and globalism is a net good, strengthening the national economy and providing jobs while cutting prices. In the closed ideology, free trade is detrimental to the national economy and encourages companies to [[offshoring|offshore]] industries, resulting in lower wages and higher unemployment, as well as potentially threatening national culture.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt; The closed attitude to globalism manifests in opposition to trade agreements such as the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]], to [[military alliance]]s such as [[NATO]], and to [[supranational union]]s such as the EU, which are generally supported by the open side.&lt;ref name="newdivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Elites and anti-establishmentism===
Pro-closed politicians opposing free trade and immigration usually describe these as impositions from an existing political [[elite]], either within the country or outside its borders, and campaign on an [[anti-establishment]] platform. In the most extreme case, this can cross over into [[conspiracism]], alleging that shadowy figures are actively trying to harm the nation.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

===Identity===
[[Identity politics]] plays a role in forming both the open and closed coalitions. Pro-closed voters tend to have a strong sense of [[national identity]], while pro-open ones share a more cosmopolitan identity. This does not mean that all closed voters are racist, nor that all open voters are unpatriotic. Nationalist pride can be enhanced by the arrival of newcomers, if these [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the national culture quickly.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Conversely some open politicians, such as [[Jesse Klaver]], leader of GroenLinks, and Emmanuel Macron, have succeeded in developing a patriotic alternative to nationalism in which tolerance and cooperation are themselves considered national values to be prized and protected.&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd6cc7da-2a75-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c|title=Emmanuel Macron offers the patriotic antidote to nationalism |date=27 April 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Philip|last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics of cleavage==
Political scientists have identified several lines of cleavage between supporters of open and closed parties. [[Educational attainment]] was the strongest predictor of voting preference in the Brexit referendum and the 2016/2017 US, Dutch and French elections: in each case, those with low educational achievement were more likely to vote for the closed or populist option.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/62d782d6-31a7-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a|title=French election results: Macron’s victory in charts|date=8 May 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=John|last1=Burn-Murdoch|first2=Billy|last2=Ehrenberg-Shannon|first3=Aleksandra|last3=Wisniewska|first4=Aendrew|last4=Rininsland|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was described by the BBC as "one of the most remarkable features of the US election", as the Republican party usually performs well among university graduates.&lt;ref name="Revolt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072|title=US election 2016: The Trump-Brexit voter revolt|first=John|last=Curtice|authorlink=John Curtice|website=BBC News|date=11 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income has been suggested as another dividing line: in the EU referendum, the bottom fifth of UK earners overwhelmingly voted for Brexit (68% Leave, 32% Remain) while a large majority of the top quarter voted against Brexit (39% Leave, 61% Remain). However, Trump performed better with middle class voters than with either the highest or lowest earners and, although a small wealth effect was seen among French voters, this disappeared when [[Controlling for a variable|controlling for]] education.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;

[[Pessimism]] and [[optimism]] also appear to be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate. Le Pen only took 20% of the vote of those who believed the situation would improve for the next generation, but over 40% among those who believed it would deteriorate.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt; A majority of Leave voters agreed life in Britain is worse than it was thirty years ago, while a majority of Remain voters disagreed.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

The '''[[postmodern]] social construction of nature''' is a [[theorem]] or speculation of postmodernist [[continental philosophy]] that poses an alternative critique of previous mainstream, [[Prometheanism|Promethean]] discourse about [[environmental sustainability]] and [[ecopolitics]].

==Position==
Whereas traditional [[criticisms of environmentalism]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} come from the more conservative "right" of politics, [[leftist]] critiques of nature pioneered by postmodernist constructionism highlight{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the need to recognise "[[Other (philosophy)|the other]]".  The implicit assumption made by theorists like Wapner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.questia.com/library/book/environmental-activism-and-world-civic-politics-by-paul-wapner.jsp| title =
Environmental Activism and World Politics | year =  1996| work = Paul Wapner| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/global_environmental_politics/v003/3.1wapner.html| title =
World summit on sustainable development | year =  2003| work = Paul Wapner| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to it as a new "response to [[ecocriticism]] [which] would require critics to acknowledge the ways in which they themselves silence nature and then to respect the sheer [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness of the non-human world."

==Criticism==
Critics argue that, by capturing the nonhuman world within its own conceptual domain, postmodern exerts precisely the urge toward mastery that it criticizes in  modernity. Thus, postmodern cultural criticism deepens the modernist urge toward mastery by eliminating the ontological weight of the nonhuman world. "What else could it mean to assert that there is no such thing as nature?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=539| title =
Leftist Criticism of Nature | date =  Fall 2003| work = Dissent Magazine| accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue becomes an existentialist query about whether nature can exist in a humanist critique, and whether we can discern the "others'" views in relation to our actions on their behalf. This is referred to as the [[Wapner Paradox]]&lt;!-- is this really the Banach–Tarski paradox or the Euclidian one?--&gt;.

[[David Demeritt]]'s typology of the social construction of nature looks at the idea from several standpoints. He seeks to clarify the meaning through exploring the extent of the different uses applied to the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/26/6/767| title =

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9557">In [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]], '''raising and lowering indices''' are operations on [[tensor]]s which change their [[Type of a tensor|type]].  Raising and lowering indices are a form of [[Ricci calculus|index manipulation]] in tensor expressions.

==Tensor type==

Given a [[tensor field]] on a [[manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, in the presence of a [[nonsingular form]] on {{mvar|M}} (such as a [[Riemannian metric]] or [[Minkowski metric]]), one can raise or lower indices to change a type {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} tensor to a {{math|(''a'' + 1, ''b'' − 1)}} tensor (raise index) or to a {{math|(''a'' − 1, ''b'' + 1)}} tensor (lower index), where the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} has been used to denote the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|tensor order]] {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} with {{mvar|a}} upper indices and {{mvar|b}} lower indices.

One does this by multiplying by the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant or contravariant]] [[metric tensor]] and then [[Tensor contraction|contracting]] indices, meaning two indices are set equal and then summing over the repeated indices (applying [[Einstein notation]]). See examples below.

==Vectors (order-1 tensors)==

Multiplying by the ''contravariant'' metric tensor {{mvar|g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;}} and contracting produces another tensor with an upper index:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j=B^i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

The same base symbol is typically used to denote this new tensor, and repositioning the index is typically understood in this context to refer to this new tensor, and is called ''raising the index'', which would be written

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j=A^i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, multiplying by the ''covariant'' metric tensor and contracting ''lowers'' an index (with the same understanding about the reuse of the base symbol):

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}A^j=A_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The form {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} need not be nonsingular to lower an index, but to get the inverse (and thus raise an index) it must be nonsingular.

Raising and then lowering the same index (or conversely) are inverse operations, which is reflected in the covariant and contravariant metric tensors being inverse to each other:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}g_{jk}=g_{kj}g^{ji}={\delta^i}_k={\delta_k}^i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|δ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] or [[identity matrix]]. Since there are different choices of metric with different [[metric signature]]s (signs along the diagonal elements, i.e. tensor components with equal indices), the name and signature is usually indicated to prevent confusion. Different authors use different metrics and signatures for different reasons.

Mnemonically (though ''incorrectly''), one could think of indices "cancelling" between a metric and another tensor, and the metric stepping up or down the index. In the above examples, such "cancellations" and "steps" are like

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j = \cancel{g}^{i \cancel{j}}A_\cancel{j} = A^i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

Again, while a helpful guide, this is only mnemonical and not a property of tensors since the indices do not cancel like in equations, it is only a concept of the notation. The results are continued below, for higher order tensors (i.e. more indices).

When raising indices of quantities in spacetime, it helps to decompose summations into "timelike components" (where indices are zero) and "spacelike components" (where indices are 1, 2, 3, represented conventionally by Latin letters).

===An example from [[Minkowski spacetime]]===

The covariant [[4-position]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;X_\mu = (-ct, x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

with components:
:&lt;math&gt;X_0 = -ct, \quad X_1 = x, \quad X_2 = y, \quad X_3 = z&lt;/math&gt;

(where {{mvar|x}},{{mvar|y}},{{mvar|z}} are the usual [[Cartesian coordinates]]) and the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor with signature (− + + +) is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \eta_{\mu \nu} = \eta^{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

in components:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{00} = -1, \quad \eta_{i0} = \eta_{0i} = 0,\quad \eta_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\,(i,j \neq 0).&lt;/math&gt;

To raise the index, multiply by the tensor and contract:
:&lt;math&gt;X^\lambda = \eta^{\lambda\mu}X_\mu = \eta^{\lambda 0}X_0 + \eta^{\lambda i}X_i&lt;/math&gt;

then for {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}}:
:&lt;math&gt;X^0 = \eta^{00}X_0 + \eta^{0i}X_i = -X_0&lt;/math&gt;

and for {{math|''λ'' {{=}} ''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}:
:&lt;math&gt;X^j = \eta^{j0}X_0 + \eta^{ji}X_i = \delta^{ji}X_i = X_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

So the index-raised contravariant 4-position is:
:&lt;math&gt;X^\mu = (ct, x, y, z)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Tensors (higher order)==

===Order 2===

For an order-2 tensor,&lt;ref name="Schaum’s Outlines"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tensor Calculus |first=D. C. |last=Kay |series=Schaum’s Outlines |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-07-033484-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; twice multiplying by the contravariant metric tensor and contracting in different indices raises each index:

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha\beta}=g^{\alpha\gamma}g^{\beta\delta}A_{\gamma \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

and twice multiplying by the covariant metric tensor and contracting in different indices lowers each index:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta}=g_{\alpha\gamma}g_{\beta\delta}A^{\gamma \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

====An example from [[classical electromagnetism and special relativity]]====

The [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] [[electromagnetic tensor]] in the {{math|(+ − − −)}} signature is given by&lt;ref&gt;NB: Some texts, such as: {{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | authorlink = David J. Griffiths |  title=Introduction to Elementary Particles | publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons, Inc | year=1987 | isbn=0-471-60386-4}}, will show this tensor with an overall factor of −1. This is because they used the negative of the metric tensor used here: {{math|(− + + +)}}, see [[sign convention#Metric signature|metric signature]]. In older texts such as Jackson (2nd edition), there are no factors of {{mvar|c}} since they are using [[Gaussian units]]. Here [[SI units]] are used.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; -\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; -\frac{E_z}{c} \\
\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
\frac{E_z}{c} &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

in components:

:&lt;math&gt;F^{0i} = -F^{i0} = - \frac{E^i}{c} ,\quad F^{ij} = - \varepsilon^{ijk} B_k &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, multiply by the metric tensor and contract:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{\alpha\beta} &amp; = \eta_{\alpha\gamma} \eta_{\beta\delta} F^{\gamma\delta} \\
&amp; = \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta 0} F^{0 0} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta 0} F^{i 0}
+ \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta i} F^{0 i} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta j} F^{i j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and since ''F''&lt;sup&gt;00&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;0''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = − ''F&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha\beta} = \left(\eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta 0} - \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta i} \right) F^{i 0} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta j} F^{i j}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{0k} &amp; = \left(\eta_{0i} \eta_{k0} - \eta_{00} \eta_{ki} \right) F^{i0} + \eta_{0i} \eta_{kj} F^{ij} \\
&amp; = \bigl(0 - (-\delta_{ki}) \bigr) F^{i0} + 0 \\
&amp; = F^{k0} = - F^{0k} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and by antisymmetry, for {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{k0} = - F^{k0} &lt;/math&gt;

then finally for {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''l'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}};

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{kl} &amp; = \left(\eta_{ k  i} \eta_{ l  0} - \eta_{ k  0} \eta_{ l  i} \right) F^{i 0} + \eta_{ k  i} \eta_{ l  j} F^{i j} \\
&amp; = 0 + \delta_{ k  i} \delta_{ l  j} F^{i j} \\
&amp; = F^{k l} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The (covariant) lower indexed tensor is then:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; \frac{E_x}{c} &amp; \frac{E_y}{c} &amp; \frac{E_z}{c} \\
-\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
-\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
-\frac{E_z}{c} &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Order ''{{mvar|n}}''===

When a vector space is equipped with an inner product (or metric as it is often called in this context), there exist operations that convert a contravariant (upper) index into a covariant (lower) index and vice versa. A metric itself is a (symmetric) (0,2)-tensor, it is thus possible to contract an upper index of a tensor with one of the lower indices of the metric. This produces a new tensor with the same index structure as the previous, but with lower index in the position of the contracted upper index. This operation is quite graphically known as lowering an index.
Conversely, a metric has an inverse which is a (2,0)-tensor. This inverse metric can be contracted with a lower index to produce an upper index. This operation is called raising an index.

For a tensor of order {{mvar|n}}, indices are raised by:&lt;ref name="Schaum’s Outlines" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^{i_1j_1}g^{i_2j_2}\cdots g^{i_nj_n}A_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} = A^{j_1j_2\cdots j_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and lowered by:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i_1j_1}g_{i_2j_2}\cdots g_{i_nj_n}A^{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} = A_{j_1j_2\cdots j_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and for a mixed tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i_1p_1}g_{i_2p_2}\cdots g_{i_np_n}g^{j_1q_1}g^{j_2q_2}\cdots g^{j_mq_m}{A^{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_m} = {A_{p_1p_2\cdots p_n}}^{q_1q_2\cdots q_m}&lt;/math&gt;

In the United States and Canada, '''redlining''' is the systematic denial of various services to residents of specific, often racially associated, neighborhoods or communities, either directly or through the selective raising of prices. While the best known examples of redlining have involved denial of financial services such as [[banking]] or [[insurance]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513204845/http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |date=2006-05-13 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; other services such as [[health care]]&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarket]]s&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition]'', Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; have been denied to residents. In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, purposely locating impractically far away from said residents results in a redlining effect.&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto]'' by Walter Thabit. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer targets particular neighborhoods that are predominantly nonwhite, not to deny residents loans or insurance, but rather to charge them more than in a non-redlined neighborhood where there is more competition.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13ehrenreich.html?pagewanted=print|title=The Recession's Racial Divide|date=September 13, 2009|work=The New York Times|last2=Muhammad|first2=Dedrick|first1=Barbara|last1=Ehrenreich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/07baltimore.html|title=Bank Accused of Pushing Mortgage Deals on Blacks|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=June 7, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight coined the term "redlining" to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Geography: Environments, Landscapes, Identities, Inequalities|last=Norton|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0195429540|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black [[inner city]] neighborhoods. For example, in [[Atlanta]] in the 1980s, a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning series of articles by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper-income blacks.&lt;ref name="Color of Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://powerreporting.com/color/|title=The Color of Money |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=1988-05-01 |publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[blacklist]]s is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of [[credit rationing]].

== History ==
{{Segregation}}
Although informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/|title=The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=2014-05-22|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial segregation and discrimination against minorities and minority communities pre-existed this policy.  The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner-city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} The assumptions in redlining resulted in a large increase in residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow.
"Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also [[black neighborhoods]].&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities.&lt;ref name = "jackson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cplan_papers/3/|title=Redlining and the Homeowners' Loan Corporation|author=Hillier, Amy E.|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ Crossney and Bartelt 2005 Urban Geography]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153741/http://bellwether.metapress.com/content/h128812346540080/ |date=2012-07-09 }}[http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf Crossney and Bartelt 2006 Housing Policy Debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023817/http://www.mi.vt.edu/data/files/hpd%20vol.16%20issues%203%20and%204/articles/hpd6(3,4)%20crossney.pdf |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia.  Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://wbhsi.net/~wendyplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |quote=Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following: Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' ...Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups''' | publisher=[[Federal Housing Administration]] | title=Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] With Revisions to February 1938 | location=Washington, D.C. | chapter=Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[National Housing Conference]] in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed [[National People's Action]] (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife [[Gale Cincotta]] and [[Shel Trapp]], a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings &amp; Loan institutions (S&amp;L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallahan|first=Kirk|title=THE MORTGAGE REDLINING CONTROVERSY, 1972–1975|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|publisher=Qualitative Studies Division, Association in Journalism and Mass Communication, Montreal August 1992|accessdate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809022759/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~pr/redlining.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking [[blockbusting]], forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of a disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael, Westgate and Ann, Vick-Westgate|title=Gale Force, The Battles for Disclosure and Community Reinvestment|year=2011|publisher=Harvard Bookstore|location=Cambridge, Ma.|isbn=978-0615449012|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&amp;L's in cities all over the country.

In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate [[Michael S. Dukakis]] to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Patricia|title=Mass Thrifts Plan Suit Over Redlining, Commissioner Stands Firm|journal=American Banker|date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]] of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

According to blackpast.org contributor Brent Gaspaire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Redlining (1937-   ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|url = http://www.blackpast.org/aah/redlining-1937|website = www.blackpast.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=As a consequence of redlining, neighborhoods that local banks deemed unfit for investment were left underdeveloped or in disrepair.  Attempts to improve these neighborhoods with even relatively small-scale business ventures were commonly obstructed by financial institutions that continued to label the underwriting as too risky or simply rejected them outright.  When existing businesses collapsed, new ones were not allowed to replace them, often leaving entire blocks empty and crumbling. Consequently, African Americans in those neighborhoods were frequently limited in their access to banking, healthcare, retail merchandise, and even groceries.|sign=|source=}}

Redlining paralyzed the housing market, lowered property values in certain areas and encouraged landlord [[Abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]. As abandonment increased, the population density became lower. Abandoned buildings served as havens for drug dealing and other illegal activity, increasing social problems and reluctance of people to invest in these areas.&lt;ref name = "wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}
Because areas were redlined residents in them were unable to obtain loans to improve their homes or get loans to move to a different area. Obviously, the neighborhoods had zero investment while neighborhoods around them improved. When the GI Bill was created during World War II, veterans who once lived in redlined areas were unable to get zero interest loans to build new homes like the rest of the returning soldiers. This forced them to stay in the areas that were poor and uninvested in while the rest of America was growing and moving to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sprawling of America.'' Dir. [[Wade Goodwyn]] and Christopher M. Cook. Great Lakes Television Consortium, 2011. Great Lakes Television Consortium. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time the GI Bill was created, the Federal Highway Act was also created. Because the areas that were redlined were so poor, many cities chose to destroy these areas to create the highways. The residents were displaced and forced to move into different uninvested neighborhoods while their homes and businesses were destroyed by the highways.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue, Thomas, and Eric Foner.

A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that the practice of redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12|title=The Effects of the 1930s HOLC "Redlining" Maps - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html|title=How Redlining's Racist Effects Lasted for Decades|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2017-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

[[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] announced a settlement with Evans Bank for $825,000 on September 10, 2015.

The most notable examples of such DOJ and HUD settlements have focused heavily on community banks in large metropolitan areas, but banks in other regions have been the subject of such orders as well, including First United Security Bank in Thomasville, Alabama, and Community State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2014/09/02/evans-bancorp-isnt-only-lender-at-risk-of-redlining-lawsuit/|title=Evans Bancorp isn't only lender at risk of redlining lawsuit|last=Glynn|first=Matt|date=2014-09-02|website=The Buffalo News|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for The Washington Post, "[i]f you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go." The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination Hudson City's broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/25/what-it-looks-like-when-a-bank-structures-its-business-to-avoid-minorities/|title=What it looks like when a bank goes out of its way to avoid minorities|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative action ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] was passed to fight the practice. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development "The ''Fair Housing Act'' makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HUDNo_15-064|url = http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2015/HUDNo_15-064b|website = portal.hud.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905061813/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2015%2FHUDNo_15-064b|archivedate = 2015-09-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.

The [[Community Reinvestment Act]] passed by Congress in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods further required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S.

In the mid-1970s, community organizations,  under the banner of the NPA,  worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organisations was SACCC ([[South Austin Coalition Community Council]]), formed to restore South Austin's neighbourhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance,  as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/02/14/page/S8/article/combatting-redlining-in-austin|title=Combatting redlining in Austin (February 14, 1981)|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retail]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods.&lt;ref&gt;Denver D'Rozario, "Retail Redlining: Definition, Theory, Typology, and Measurement", ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 25, No. 2, 175–186 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online ====

A 2012 study by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Home Depot]], [[Rosetta Stone (software)|Rosetta Stone]] and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]].  This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534 |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |authors=Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Ashkan Soltani |date=24 Dec 2012 |title= Websites Vary Prices, Deals Based on Users' Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liquorlining ====
Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining."  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |title=Liquorlining: Liquor Store Concentration and Community Development in Lower-income Cook County Neighborhoods |last1=Maxwell |first1=Ann |last2=Daniel |first2=Immergluck |date=January 1997 |website=Woodstock Institute |format=PDF |access-date=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416121921/http://woodstockinst.org/document/liquorlining.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romley |first1=John A. |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Ringel |first3=Jeanne |last4=Sturm |first4=Roland |display-authors=2 |last-author-amp= |editor-last=Schuckit |editor1-first=Mark A. |date=January 2007 |title=Alcohol and Environmental Justice:The Density of Liquor Stores and Bars in Urban Neighborhoods in the United States |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reprints/2008/RAND_RP1323.pdf |format=PDF |journal=''[[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]'' |location= |publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=48–55  |access-date=14 March 2015 |via=[[RAND Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student loans ====
In December 2007, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] was brought against student loan lending giant [[Sallie Mae]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]]. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and [[Hispanic]] private student loan applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |title=Sasha Rodriguez &amp; Cathelyn Gregoire on Behalf of All Persons Similarly Situated vs. Sallie Mae (SLM) Corporation |publisher=New America Foundation |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133740/http://www.newamerica.net/files/sallie%20mae%20lawsuit.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] [[private student loans]] caused a [[disparate impact]] on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.

The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the [[United Negro College Fund]] and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.ctd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04113074545 |title=SDSD District Version 1.3 |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Connecticut |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit cards ====
[[Credit card]] redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of [[Credit score in the United States|credit]] to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1098403 |title=Credit Card Redlining |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Cohen-Cole |first1=Ethan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Insurance ====
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9906.t01-1-00168 |title=Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas |journal=Journal of Urban Affairs |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=391–410 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial profiling]] or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=Squires2016/&gt; Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called [[Linguistic Profiling|linguistic profiling]].&lt;ref name=SquiresChadwick2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1078087405281064 |title=Linguistic Profiling |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=400–15 |year=2016 |last1=Squires |first1=Gregory D |last2=Chadwick |first2=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the [[car insurance|automotive insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html Karen Bouffard, "Michigan to crack down on uninsured drivers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128033237/http://www.itd.idaho.gov/transporter/2003/080803_Trans/080803_MIuninsured.html |date=2007-11-28 }}, ''[[The Detroit News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of [[insurance score]]s based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fairhousing.com/resources/history-insurance-redlining|title=The History of Insurance Redlining {{!}} National Fair Housing Advocate Online|website=fairhousing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mortgages ====
'''Reverse redlining''' occurs when a lender or insurer particularly targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but to charge them more than would be charged to a similarly situated white consumer, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. These communities had [[Mortgage discrimination|largely been ignored by most lenders]] just a couple of decades earlier. In the 2000s some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. [[Wells Fargo]] partnered with churches in black communities, where the pastor would deliver "wealth building" seminars in their sermons, and the bank would make a donation to the church in return for every new mortgage application. Working-class blacks wanted a part of the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of contributing to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners struggled to build and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of [[Financial institution|financial firms]]. The growth of [[subprime lending]] (higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records) prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in a range of manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] were subprime. Some subprime loans certainly benefit high-risk borrowers who would not qualify for conventional, [[prime loan]]s. Predatory loans, however, charge unreasonably higher rates and fees by compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered largely subprime loans and almost no prime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages as did low-income whites. Some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans."&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/minority-families-face-wave-of-foreclosures |title=Minority families face wave of foreclosures: Consumer groups urge more 'teeth' in laws combating predators |first=Ruth |last=Mantell |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks, stemming from a legacy of redlining, may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively pushed subprime mortgages. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/weekinreview/04bajaj.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Vikas | last1=Bajaj | first2=Ford | last2=Fessenden | title=What's Behind the Race Gap? |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redlining has helped preserve [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregated]] living patterns for blacks and whites in the United States, as discrimination is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods and the race of the applicant. Lending institutions such as [[Wells Fargo]] have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="The Recession's Racial Divide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998), "Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Redlining Redux", ''Urban Affairs Review,'' Vol. 38, No. 1, 22–41 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state attorneys general have begun investigating these practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}
{{See also|Race and health}}
Policies related to redlining and [[urban decay]] can also act as a form of [[environmental racism]], which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;''[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=11-13-07&amp;storyID=28458 Minority Communities Need More Parks, Report Says]'' by Angela Rowen ''The Berkeley Daily Planet''&lt;/ref&gt; This may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.&lt;ref name="parks" /&gt;

Robert Wallace writes that the pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "[[planned shrinkage]]" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, R. "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Soc Sci Med,'' 1990 – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutionalized racism]] affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS and racism in America." Hutchinson J., ''Journal of the National Medical Association,'' 1992 Feb;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], a '''relation algebra''' is a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] [[reduct|expanded]] with an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] called '''converse''', a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[binary relation]]s on a set ''X'', that is, subsets of the [[cartesian square]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''R''•''S'' interpreted as the usual [[Composition of relations|composition of binary relations]] ''R'' and ''S'', and with the converse of ''R'' as the [[converse relation]].

Relation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], which culminated in the [[algebraic logic]] of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The equational form of relation algebra treated here was developed by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students, starting in the 1940s. Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of [[axiomatic set theory]], with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.

==Definition==
A '''relation algebra''' (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ˘) is an algebraic structure equipped with the [[Introduction to Boolean algebra|Boolean operations]] of conjunction ''x''∧''y'', disjunction ''x''∨''y'', and negation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Boolean constants 0 and 1, the relational operations of [[composition of relations|composition]] ''x''•''y'' and [[converse relation|converse]] ''x''˘, and the relational constant '''I''', such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]]. Roughly, a relation algebra is to a system of binary relations on a set containing the [[empty relation|empty]] (0), [[universal relation|complete]] (1), and [[identity relation|identity]] ('''I''') relations and closed under these five operations as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is to a system of [[permutation]]s of a set containing the identity permutation and closed under composition and inverse. However, the [[first-order logic|first order]] [[theory (logic)|theory]] of relation algebras is not [[completeness (logic)|complete]] for such systems of binary relations.

Following Jónsson and Tsinakis (1993) it is convenient to define additional operations ''x''◁''y'' = ''x''•''y''˘, and, dually,  ''x''▷''y'' = ''x''˘•''y'' .  Jónsson and Tsinakis showed that '''I'''◁''x'' = ''x''▷'''I''', and that both were equal to ''x''˘.  Hence a relation algebra can equally well be defined as an algebraic structure (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ◁, ▷).  The advantage of this [[signature (logic)|signature]] over the usual one is that a relation algebra can then be defined in full simply as a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] for which '''I'''◁''x'' is an involution, that is, '''I'''◁('''I'''◁''x'') = ''x'' .  The latter condition can be thought of as the relational counterpart of the equation 1/(1/''x'') = ''x'' for ordinary arithmetic [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], and some authors use reciprocal as a synonym for converse.

Since residuated Boolean algebras are axiomatized with finitely many identities, so are relation algebras. Hence the latter form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], the variety '''RA''' of relation algebras.  Expanding the above definition as equations yields the following finite axiomatization.

===Axioms===
The axioms '''B1-B10''' below are adapted from Givant (2006: 283), and were first set out by [[alfred Tarski|Tarski]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]] (1948) "Abstract: Representation Problems for Relation Algebras," ''Bulletin of the AMS'' 54: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under binary [[disjunction]], ∨, and unary [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] ()&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:
:'''B1''': ''A'' ∨ ''B'' = ''B'' ∨ ''A''
:'''B2''': ''A'' ∨ (''B'' ∨ ''C'') = (''A'' ∨ ''B'') ∨ ''C''
:'''B3''': (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''
This axiomatization of Boolean algebra is due to [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]] (1933).  Note that the meet of the implied Boolean algebra is ''not'' the • operator (even though it distributes over &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; like a meet does), nor is the 1 of the Boolean algebra the '''I''' constant.

''L'' is a [[monoid]] under binary [[composition of relations|composition]] (•) and [[nullary]] identity '''I''':
:'''B4''': ''A''•(''B''•''C'') = (''A''•''B'')•''C''
:'''B5''': ''A''•'''I''' = ''A''

Unary [[converse relation|converse]] ()˘ is an [[semigroup with involution|involution with respect to composition]]:
:'''B6''': ''A''˘˘ = ''A'' 
:'''B7''': (''A''•''B'')˘ = ''B''˘•''A''˘

Axiom B6 defines conversion as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], whereas B7 expresses the [[antidistributive]] property of conversion relative to composition.&lt;ref name="BrinkKahl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|pages=4 and 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse and composition [[distributive law|distribute]] over disjunction:
:'''B8''': (''A''∨''B'')˘ = ''A''˘∨''B''˘
:'''B9''': (''A''∨''B'')•''C'' = (''A''•''C'')∨(''B''•''C'')

'''B10''' is Tarski's equational form of the fact, discovered by [[Augustus De Morgan]], that ''A''•''B'' &amp;le; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''A''˘•''C'' &amp;le; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''C''•''B''˘ &amp;le; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.
:'''B10''': (''A''˘•(''A''•''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)∨''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

These axioms are [[ZFC]] theorems; for the purely Boolean '''B1-B3''', this fact is trivial. After each of the following axioms is shown the number of the corresponding theorem in Chapter 3 of Suppes (1960), an exposition of ZFC: '''B4''' 27, '''B5''' 45, '''B6''' 14, '''B7''' 26, '''B8''' 16, '''B9''' 23.

The following table shows how many of the usual properties of [[binary relation]]s can be expressed as succinct '''RA''' equalities or inequalities. Below, an inequality of the form ''A''≤''B'' is shorthand for the Boolean equation ''A''∨''B'' = ''B''.

The most complete set of results of this nature is Chapter C of Carnap (1958), where the notation is rather distant from that of this entry. Chapter  3.2 of Suppes (1960) contains fewer results, presented as [[ZFC]] theorems and using a notation that more resembles that of this entry. Neither Carnap nor Suppes formulated their results using the '''RA''' of this entry, or in an equational manner.

==Expressive power==
The [[metamathematics]] of '''RA''' are discussed at length in Tarski and Givant (1987), and more briefly in Givant (2006).

'''RA''' consists entirely of equations manipulated using nothing more than uniform replacement and the substitution of equals for equals. Both rules are wholly familiar from school mathematics and from [[abstract algebra]] generally. Hence '''RA''' proofs are carried out in a manner familiar to all mathematicians, unlike the case in [[mathematical logic]] generally.

'''RA''' can express any (and up to [[logical equivalence]], exactly the) [[first-order logic]] (FOL) formulas containing no more than three variables. (A given variable can be quantified multiple times and hence quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily deeply by "reusing" variables.) Surprisingly, this fragment of FOL suffices to express [[Peano arithmetic]] and almost all [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] ever proposed. Hence '''RA''' is, in effect, a way of algebraizing nearly all mathematics, while dispensing with FOL and its [[Logical connective|connectives]], [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s, [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstiles]], and [[modus ponens]]. Because '''RA''' can express Peano arithmetic and set theory, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] apply to it; '''RA''' is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incomplete]], incompletable, and [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} (N.B. The Boolean algebra fragment of '''RA''' is complete and decidable.)

The '''representable relation algebras''', forming the class '''RRA''', are those relation algebras isomorphic to some relation algebra consisting of binary relations on some set, and closed under the intended interpretation of the '''RA''' operations. It is easily shown, e.g. using the method of [[pseudoelementary class]]es, that '''RRA''' is a [[quasivariety]], that is, axiomatizable by a [[universal Horn theory]]. In 1950, [[Roger Lyndon]] proved the existence of equations holding in '''RRA''' that did not hold in '''RA'''. Hence the variety generated by '''RRA''' is a proper subvariety of the variety '''RA'''. In 1955, [[Alfred Tarski]] showed that '''RRA''' is itself a variety. In 1964, Donald Monk showed that '''RRA''' has no finite axiomatization, unlike '''RA''', which is finitely axiomatized by definition.

===Q-relation algebras===
An '''RA''' is a Q-relation algebra ('''QRA''') if, in addition to '''B1-B10''', there exist some ''A'' and ''B'' such that (Tarski and Givant 1987: §8.4):

:'''Q0''': ''A''˘•''A'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q1''': ''B''˘•''B'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q2''': ''A''˘•''B'' = 1

Essentially these axioms imply that the universe has a (non-surjective) pairing relation whose projections are ''A'' and ''B''. It is a theorem that every '''QRA''' is a '''RRA''' (Proof by Maddux, see Tarski &amp; Givant 1987: 8.4(iii) ).

Every '''QRA''' is representable (Tarski and Givant 1987). That not every relation algebra is representable is a fundamental way '''RA''' differs from '''QRA''' and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]], which, by [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]], are always representable as sets of subsets of some set, closed under union, intersection, and complement.

== Examples ==
1.  Any Boolean algebra can be turned into a '''RA''' by interpreting conjunction as composition (the monoid multiplication •), i.e. ''x''•''y'' is defined as ''x''∧''y''.  This interpretation requires that converse interpret identity (''ў'' = ''y''), and that both residuals ''y''\''x'' and ''x''/''y'' interpret the conditional ''y''→''x''  (i.e., ¬''y''∨''x'').

2.  The motivating example of a relation algebra depends on the definition of a binary relation ''R'' on a set ''X'' as any subset ''R'' ⊆ ''X''², where  ''X''² is the [[Cartesian square]] of ''X''. The power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all binary relations on ''X'' is a Boolean algebra. While  2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; can be made a relation algebra by taking ''R''•''S'' = ''R''∧''S'', as per example (1) above, the standard interpretation of • is instead ''x''(''R''•''S'')''z'' = ∃''y'':''xRy.ySz''.  That is, the [[ordered pair]] (''x'',''z'') belongs to the relation ''R''•''S'' just when there exists ''y'' ∈ ''X'' such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R'' and (''y'',''z'') ∈ ''S''. This interpretation uniquely determines ''R''\''S'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''z'') such that for all ''x'' ∈ ''X'', if ''xRy'' then ''xSz''. Dually, ''S''/''R'' consists of all pairs (''x'',''y'') such that for all ''z'' ∈ ''X'', if ''yRz'' then ''xSz''. The translation ''ў'' = ¬(y\¬'''I''') then establishes the converse ''R''˘ of ''R'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''x'') such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R''.

3.  An important generalization of the previous example is the power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''E'' ⊆ ''X''² is any [[equivalence relation]] on the set ''X''. This is a generalization because ''X''² is itself an equivalence relation, namely the complete relation consisting of all pairs. While 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; is not a subalgebra of 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; when ''E'' ≠ ''X''² (since in that case it does not contain the relation ''X''², the top element 1 being ''E'' instead of ''X''²), it is nevertheless turned into a relation algebra using the same definitions of the operations. Its importance resides in the definition of a ''representable relation algebra'' as any relation algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the relation algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; for some equivalence relation ''E'' on some set. The previous section says more about the relevant metamathematics.

4. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be group. Then the power set &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; is a relation algebra with the obvious boolean algebra operations, composition given by the [[product of group subsets]], the converse by the inverse subset (&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \{a^{-1}\mid a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;), and the identity by the singleton subset &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. There is a relation algebra homomorphism embedding &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;2^{G\times G}&lt;/math&gt; which sends each subset &lt;math&gt;A\subset G&lt;/math&gt; to the relation
&lt;math&gt;R_A = \{(g, h)\in G \times G\mid h\in A g\}&lt;/math&gt;. The image of this homomorphism is the set of all right-invariant relations on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. 

5. If group sum or product interprets composition, [[Group_(mathematics)#Definition|group inverse]] interprets converse, group identity interprets '''I''', and if ''R'' is a [[one-to-one correspondence]], so that ''R''˘•''R'' = ''R•R''˘ = '''I''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski, A.]] (1941), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; then ''L'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] as well as a [[monoid]]. '''B4'''-'''B7''' become well-known theorems of [[group theory]], so that '''RA''' becomes a [[proper extension]] of [[group theory]] as well as of Boolean algebra.

==Historical remarks==
[[augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] founded '''RA''' in 1860, but [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] took it much further and became fascinated with its philosophical power. The work of DeMorgan and Peirce came to be known mainly in the extended and definitive form [[Ernst Schröder]] gave it in Vol. 3 of his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890–1905). ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' drew strongly on Schröder's '''RA''', but acknowledged him only as the inventor of the notation. In 1912, [[Alwin Korselt]] proved that a particular formula in which the quantifiers were nested four deep had no '''RA''' equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Korselt did not publish his finding. It was first published in [[Leopold Loewenheim]] (1915) "Über Möglichkeiten im Relativkalkül," ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' 76: 447–470. Translated as "On possibilities in the calculus of relatives" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 228–251.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact led to a loss of interest in '''RA''' until Tarski (1941) began writing about it. His students have continued to develop '''RA''' down to the present day. Tarski returned to '''RA''' in the 1970s with the help of Steven Givant; this collaboration resulted in the monograph by Tarski and Givant (1987), the definitive reference for this subject. For more on the history of '''RA''', see Maddux (1991, 2006).

[[File:F. Taylor 1856-1915.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856–1915), leading proponent of scientific management]]

'''Scientific management''' is a theory of [[management]] that [[Analysis|analyzes]] and [[wikt:synthesis#Noun|synthesizes]] [[workflow]]s. Its main objective is improving [[economic efficiency]], especially [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]]. It was one of the earliest attempts [[applied science|to apply science]] to the [[engineering]] of [[business process|process]]es and to management. Scientific management is sometimes known as '''Taylorism''' after its founder, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Mitcham05p1153"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitcham|2005|p=1153}} Mitcham, Carl and Adam, Briggle ''Management'' in Mitcham (2005) p. 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor began the theory's development in the [[United States]] during the 1880s and '90s within [[manufacturing]] industries, especially steel. Its peak of influence came in the 1910s;&lt;ref name=Wodham1997p12&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodham|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor died in 1915 and by the 1920s, scientific management was still influential but had entered into [[competition]] and [[syncretism]] with opposing or complementary ideas.

Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of [[industrial engineering]] and management today. These include: analysis; synthesis; [[logic]]; [[rationality]]; [[empiricism]]; [[work ethic]]; efficiency and [[waste reduction|elimination of waste]]; [[standardization]] of [[best practice]]s; disdain for tradition preserved merely for its own sake or to protect the [[social status]] of particular workers with particular skill sets; the transformation of [[craft production]] into [[mass production]]; and [[knowledge transfer]] between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation.

== Name ==
Taylor's own names for his approach initially included "shop management" and "[[process management]]". However, "scientific management" came to national attention in 1910 when crusading attorney [[Louis Brandeis]] (then not yet Supreme Court justice) popularized the term.&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp15-21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924002406647#page/n19/mode/2up/search/Brandeis+find+scientific+management pp. 15–21]&lt;/ref&gt; Brandeis had sought a consensus term for the approach with the help of practitioners like [[Henry L. Gantt]] and [[Frank B. Gilbreth]]. Brandeis then used the consensus of "scientific management" when he argued before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)]] that a proposed increase in railroad rates was unnecessary despite an increase in labor costs; he alleged scientific management would overcome railroad inefficiencies (The ICC ruled against the rate increase, but also dismissed as insufficiently substantiated that concept the railroads were necessarily inefficient.) Taylor recognized the nationally-known term "scientific management" as another good name for the concept, and adopted it in the title of [[The Principles of Scientific Management (monograph)|his influential 1911 monograph]].

== History ==
The [[Midvale Steel Company]], "one of America's great armor plate making plants," was the birthplace of scientific management. In 1877, at age 22, Frederick W. Taylor started as a clerk in Midvale, but advanced to foreman in 1880. As foreman, Taylor was "constantly impressed by the failure of his [team members] to produce more than about one-third of [what he deemed] a good day's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor determined to discover, by scientific methods, how long it should take men to perform each given piece of work; and it was in the fall of 1882 that he started to put the first features of scientific management into operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Horace Bookwalter Drury]], in his 1918 work, ''Scientific management: A History and Criticism'', identified seven other leaders in the movement,  most of whom learned of and extended scientific management from Taylor's efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* [[Henry L. Gantt]] (1861–1919)
* [[Carl G. Barth]] (1860–1939) 
* [[Horace K. Hathaway]] (1878–1944) 
* [[Morris Llewellyn Cooke|Morris L. Cooke]] (1872–1960)
* [[Sanford E. Thompson]] (1867–1949)
* [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank B. Gilbreth]] (1868–1924). Gilbreth's independent work on "motion study" is on record as early as 1885; after meeting Taylor in 1906 and being introduced to scientific management, Gilbert devoted his efforts to introducing scientific management into factories. Gilbreth and his wife Dr [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878–1972) performed micro-motion studies using stop-motion cameras as well as developing the profession of industrial/organizational psychology. 
* [[Harrington Emerson]] (1853–1931) began determining what industrial plants' products and costs were compared to what they ought to be in 1895. Emerson did not meet Taylor until December 1900, and the two never worked together.

Emerson's testimony in late 1910 to the Interstate Commerce Commission brought the movement to national attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When steps were taken to introduce scientific management at the government-owned [[Rock Island Arsenal]] in early 1911, it was opposed by [[Samuel Gompers]], founder and President of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (an alliance of [[craft unions]]). When a subsequent attempt was made to introduce the bonus system into the government's [[Watertown Arsenal]] foundry during the summer of 1911, the entire force walked out for a few days. Congressional investigations followed, resulting in a ban on the use of time studies and pay premiums in Government service.

Taylor's death in 1915 at age 59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0320.html|title=F. W. Taylor, Expert in Efficiency, Dies|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; left the movement without its original leader. In management literature today, the term "scientific management" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples ("classical", implying "no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Today, task-oriented optimization of work tasks is nearly ubiquitous in industry.

== Pursuit of economic efficiency ==
Flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th century, scientific management built on earlier pursuits of [[economic efficiency]]. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of [[wikt:thrift#Noun|thrift]], it favored [[Empiricism|empirical methods]] to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus it was followed by a profusion of successors in applied science, including [[time and motion study]], the [[Efficiency Movement]] (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), [[Fordism]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[industrial engineering]], [[management science]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[logistics]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]], [[lean manufacturing]], and [[Six Sigma]]. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.

Taylor rejected the notion, which was universal in his day and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by [[craft production]] methods. In the course of his empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of [[manual labour|manual labor]]. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; [[material handling equipment]] as we know it today was mostly not developed yet. He looked at [[shovel]]ing in the unloading of [[railroad car]]s full of [[ore]]; lifting and carrying in the moving of [[pig iron|iron pigs]] at steel mills; the manual inspection of [[ball (bearing)|bearing balls]]; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent forms of scientific management were articulated by Taylor's disciples, such as [[Henry Gantt]]; other engineers and managers, such as [[Benjamin S. Graham]]; and other theorists, such as [[Max Weber]]. Taylor's work also contrasts with other efforts, including those of [[Henri Fayol]] and those of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (whose views originally shared much with Taylor's but later diverged in response to Taylorism's inadequate handling of human relations).

== Soldiering ==

Scientific management requires a high level of managerial control over employee work practices and entails a higher ratio of managerial workers to laborers than previous management methods. Such detail-oriented management may cause friction between workers and managers.

Taylor observed that some workers were more talented than others, and that even smart ones were often unmotivated. He observed that most [[worker]]s who are forced to perform repetitive tasks tend to work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished. This slow rate of work has been observed in many industries and many countries&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called by various terms.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp19,23,82,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=19, 23, 82, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor used the term "soldiering",&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soldier|title=Definition of SOLDIER|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that reflects the way [[Conscription|conscripts]] may approach following orders, and observed that, when paid the same amount, workers will tend to do the amount of work that the slowest among them does.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13–29, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor describes soldiering as "the greatest evil with which the working-people ... are now afflicted."&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"/&gt;

This reflects the idea that workers have a vested interest in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one [[Best practice|best method]] for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their [[productivity]] would go up.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"/&gt; Thus his compensation plans usually included [[piece work|piece rates]]. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.

== Relationship to mechanization and automation ==
[[File:Musterarbeitsplatz.png|thumb|A machinist at the Tabor Company, a firm where Frederick Taylor's consultancy was applied to practice, about 1905]]

Scientific management evolved in an era when [[mechanization]] and [[automation]] were still in their infancy. The ideas and methods of scientific management extended the [[American system of manufacturing]] in the transformation from [[craft production|craft]] work (with humans as the only possible agents) to mechanization and automation, although proponents of scientific management did not predict the extensive removal of humans from the production process. Concerns over [[Technological unemployment|labor-displacing technologies]] rose with increasing mechanization and automation.

By factoring processes into discrete, unambiguous units, scientific management laid the groundwork for automation and [[offshoring]], prefiguring [[industrial control systems|industrial process control]] and [[numerical control]] in the absence of any machines that could carry it out. Taylor and his followers did not foresee this at the time; in their world, it was ''humans'' that would execute the optimized processes. (For example, although in their era the instruction "open valve A whenever pressure gauge B reads over value X" would be carried out by a human, the fact that it had been reduced to an algorithmic component paved the way for a machine to be the agent.) However, one of the common threads between their world and ours is that the agents of execution need not be "smart" to execute their tasks. In the case of computers, they are ''not able'' (yet) to be "smart" (in that sense of the word); in the case of human workers under scientific management, they were often ''able'' but were ''not allowed''. Once the time-and-motion men had completed their studies of a particular task, the workers had very little opportunity for further thinking, experimenting, or suggestion-making. They were forced to "play dumb" most of the time, which occasionally led to revolts.

The middle ground between the craft production of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and [[knowledge transfer]], which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer their way out of their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on [[employment]] and [[employability]] is an [[externality]].

== Impact ==

=== Market economies ===

==== Taylor's view of workers ====



Other thinkers soon offered more ideas on the roles that workers play in mature industrial systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just the needs of the whole. [[James Hartness]] published ''The Human Factor in Works Management''&lt;ref name="Hartness1912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartness|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, while [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The [[Human Relations Movement|human relations]] school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures.&lt;ref name="Braverman_1998_1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braverman|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly, a [[syncretism]] has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.

==== Taylorism, anomie, and unions ====

With the division of labor that became commonplace as Taylorism was implemented in manufacturing, workers lost their sense of connection to the production of goods. Workers began to feel disenfranchised with the monotonous and unfulfilling work they were doing in factories. Before scientific management, workers felt a sense of pride when completing their good, which went away when workers only completed one part of production. "The further 'progress' of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor," the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melossi|first1=Dario|title=Controlling Crime, Controlling Society: Thinking about Crime in Europe and America|date=December 2008|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial adoption of Taylor's principles by management seeking to boost efficiency, while ignoring principles such as fair pay and direct engagement by managers, led to further tensions and the rise of unions to represent workers needs.

Taylor had a largely negative view of unions, and believed they only led to decreased productivity. Although he opposed them, his work with scientific management led disenfranchised workers to look to unions for support.

==== Early decades: Making jobs unpleasant ====

Under scientific management, the demands of work intensified. Workers became dissatisfied with the work environment and became angry.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} During one of Taylor's own implementations at the [[Watertown Arsenal]] in Massachusetts, a [[Strike action|strike]] led to an investigation of Taylor's methods by a U.S. House of Representatives committee. The committee reported in 1912, concluding that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered valuable organizational suggestions,{{Request quotation|date=April 2011}} but that it also gave production managers a dangerously high level of uncontrolled power.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullins|2004|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After an attitude survey of the workers revealed a high level of resentment and hostility towards scientific management, the Senate banned Taylor's methods at the arsenal.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"/&gt;

Scientific management lowered worker morale and exacerbated existing conflicts between labor and management. As a consequence, the method inadvertently strengthened [[labor union]]s and their bargaining power in labor disputes,&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp170-174"&gt;
{{Harvnb|Drury|1915|pp=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby neutralizing most or all of the benefit of any productivity gains it had achieved. Thus its net benefit to owners and management ended up as small or negative. It took new efforts, borrowing some ideas from scientific management but mixing them with others, to produce more productive formula.

==== Later decades: Making jobs disappear ====

Scientific management may have exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: the erosion of employment in developed economies via both [[offshoring]] and automation. Both were made possible by the deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the [[knowledge transfer]] that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been [[commodification|commoditized]], and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to [[perfect competition|pure]] than it had been, depressing wages and [[job security]]. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of [[automation]],&lt;ref name="Noble1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noble|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; hastening the onset of the later stages just described.

In a central assumption of scientific management, "the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the machinery."&lt;ref name="Rosen1993p139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1993|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While scientific management had made jobs unpleasant, its successors made them less remunerative, less secure, and finally nonexistent as a consequence of [[structural unemployment]].

==== Relationship to Fordism ====

It is often assumed that [[Fordism]] derives from Taylor's work. Taylor apparently made this assumption himself when visiting the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s Michigan plants not too long before he died, but it is likely that the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp249-253"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=249–253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until [[Henry Ford II]] took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. [[Henry Ford]] felt that he had succeeded ''in spite of'', not ''because of'', experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"/&gt; Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor [[Walter Flanders]] in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the [[efficiency movement]] during the decade of 1905-1915.

=== Planned economies ===

Scientific management appealed to managers of [[planned economy|planned economies]] because [[Economic planning|central economic planning]] relies on the idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design. The opposite theoretical pole would be [[laissez-faire]] thinking in which the [[invisible hand]] of free markets is the only possible "designer". In reality most economies today are somewhere in between. Another alternative for economic planning is [[workers' self-management]].

==== Soviet Union ====

In the [[Soviet Union]], Taylorism was advocated by [[Aleksei Gastev]] and ''nauchnaia organizatsia truda'' (''the movement for the scientific organisation of labor''). It found support in both [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939.&lt;ref name="Beissinger1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beissinger|1988|pp=35–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. As scientific management was believed to epitomize American efficiency,&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] even claimed that "the combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of [[Leninism]]."&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989_p251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=251}}, quoting Stalin 1976 p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensen was one of the consultants who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp193-216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=193–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Cold War]] made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. [[Anti-communism]] had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and [[anti-capitalism]] in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.

==== East Germany ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-19361-006, Chemnitz, Normierung im Fräsmaschinenwerkes "Fritz Heckert".jpg|thumb|East German machine tool builders, 1953.]]

By the 1950s, scientific management had grown dated, but its goals and practices remained attractive and were also being adopted by the [[German Democratic Republic]] as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors. In the accompanying photograph from the [[German Federal Archives]], workers discuss standards specifying how each task should be done and how long it should take. The workers are engaged in a state-planned instance of process improvement, but they are pursuing the same goals that were contemporaneously pursued in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] societies, as in the [[Toyota Production System]].

== Organized labor reactions ==
In 1911, organized labor erupted with strong opposition to scientific management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;, spreading from [[Samuel Gompers]], founder and president of the American Federal of Labor (AFL), in the US to far around the globe. By 1913 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote that the "most widely discussed topic today in Europe, and to some extent in Russia, is the 'system' of the American engineer, Frederick Taylor"; Lenin decried it as merely a "'scientific' system of sweating" more work from laborers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: A 'Scientific' System of Sweating|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1914, Lenin derided Taylorism as "man’s enslavement by the machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: The Taylor System—Man's Enslavement by the Machine|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Russian Revolutions]] brought him to power, Lenin wrote in 1918 that the "Russian is a bad worker [who must] learn to work. The Taylor system... is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/x03.htm|title=The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote box
 |quote = [The early US history of labor relations with scientific management was described by Dr Drury thusly:] ...for a long time there was thus little or no direct [conflict] between scientific management and organized labor... [However] One of the best known experts once spoke to us with satisfaction of the manner in which, in a certain factory where there had been a number of union men, the labor organization had, upon the introduction of scientific management, gradually disintegrated. 

...From 1882 (when the system was started) until 1911, a period of approximately thirty years, there was not a single strike under it, and this in spite of the fact that it was carried on primarily in the steel industry, which was subject to a great many disturbances. For instance, in the [[Philadelphia general strike (1910)|general strike in Philadelphia]], one man only went out at the Tabor plant [managed by Taylor], while at the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin Locomotive]] shops across the street two thousand struck.

...Serious opposition may be said to have been begun in 1911, immediately after certain testimony presented before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] [by Harrington Emerson] revealed to the country the strong movement setting towards scientific management. National labor leaders, wide-awake as to what might happen in the future, decided that the new movement was a menace to their organization, and at once inaugurated an attack... centered about the installation of scientific management in the [[Watertown Arsenal|government arsenal at Watertown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts provides an example of the application and repeal of the Taylor system in the workplace, due to worker opposition.  In the early 2001, neglect in the Watertown shops included overcrowding, dim-lighting, lack of tools and equipment, and questionable management strategies in the eyes of the workers. Frederick W. Taylor and Carl G. Barth visited Watertown in April 1909 and reported on their observations at the shops. Their conclusion was to apply the Taylor system of management to the shops to produce better results.  Efforts to install the Taylor system began in June 1909.  Over the years of time study and trying to improve the efficiency of workers, criticisms began to evolve.  Workers complained of having to compete with one another, feeling strained and resentful, and feeling excessively tired after work.  There is, however, no evidence that the times enforced were unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2017}} In June 1913, employees of the Watertown Arsenal petitioned to abolish the practice of scientific management there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A number of magazine writers inquiring into the effects of scientific management found that the "conditions in shops investigated contrasted favorably with those in other plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuing current reactions==
{{criticism section|date=February 2017}}

[[Criticism]] of Taylor's principles of effective [[workmanship]] and the [[productivity]] of the workers continues today. Often, his theories are described as man-contemptuous and portrayed as now overhauled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= F. W. Taylor und der Taylorismus.

Taylorism is, according to Stephen P. Waring, considered very controversial, despite its popularity.  It is often{{quantify|date=June 2017}} criticized for turning the worker into an "automaton" or "machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, pp. 195–198&lt;/ref&gt; Due to techniques employed with scientific management, employees claim to have become overworked and were hostile to the process. Criticisms commonly came from workers who were subjected to an accelerated work pace, lower standards of workmanship, lower product-quality, and lagging wages.  Workers defied being reduced to such machines, and objected to the practices of Taylorism. Many workers formed unions, demanded higher pay, and went on strike to be free of control issues.  This ignited [[class conflict]], which Taylorism was initially meant{{by whom|date=June 2017}} to prevent.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Efforts to resolve the conflicts included methods of scientific collectivism, making agreements with unions, and the [[personnel management]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waring|1991}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 1960 some [[Countermovement|counter-movements]] to Taylorism arose.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Representatives of the so-called [[Human relations movement|Human Relations movement]] urged humanization and democratization of the working world. The criticism of Taylorism supports the unilateral approach of [[labour economics|labor]]. Strictly speaking, Taylorism is not a scientific theory. All theories of F. W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]] of the selected sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.klett.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=terrasse_artikel__layout__pdf&amp;art_id=1010818|title= Infoblatt Taylorismus.

Another reason for criticizing Taylor's methods stemmed from Taylor's belief that the [[scientific method]] included the calculations of exactly how much time it takes a man to do a particular task, or his rate of work.  However, the opposition to this argument is that such a calculation relies on certain arbitrary, non-scientific decisions such as what constituted the job, which men were timed, and under which conditions.  Any of these factors are subject to change, and therefore can produce inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dismiss so-called "scientific management"/Taylorism as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Meanwhile, the pseudo-science of Taylorism justified heightened outside surveillance of the laboring body, positing a rational 'technology of the productive human body' [...]. Significantly, Taylorism altered previous Cartesian notion of the body as a kind of working machine by redefining 'work' in the more narrow sense used in physics, as 'force working against resistance' [...].

== Legacy ==

Scientific management was one of the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a "bottom-up" way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into [[operations management]], [[operations research]], and management [[cybernetics]]. In the 1980s [[total quality management]] became widely popular, and in the 1990s "re-engineering" went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's [[Six Sigma]] and [[lean manufacturing]] could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their [[cultural evolution|evolutionary]] distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, [[Shigeo Shingo]], one of the originators of the [[Toyota Production System]], believed that this system and [[Japanese management culture]] in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Peter Drucker]] saw Frederick Taylor as the creator of [[knowledge management]], because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management for all sorts of work, including the management of universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to "the work of our salesmen".  Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for "sales engineering"&lt;ref name="Dawson2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Person was talking about what is now called [[sales process engineering]]—engineering the processes that [[sales]]people use—not about what we call [[sales engineering]] today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate [[marketing]].

Google's methods of increasing productivity and output can be seen to be influenced by Taylorism as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Nicholas G.|title=The Shallows|date=June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicon Valley company is a forerunner in applying behavioral science to increase knowledge worker productivity. In classic scientific management as well as  approaches like lean management or business process reengineering leaders and experts develop and define standard. Leading high-tech companies use the concept of nudge management to increase productivity of employees. More and more business leaders start to make use of this new scientific management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|url=http://jorgdesign.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[Military|militaries]] employ all of the major goals and tactics of scientific management, if not under that name. Of the key points, all but wage incentives for increased output are used by modern military organizations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Wage incentives rather appear in the form of skill bonuses for enlistments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Scientific management has had an important influence in sports, where stop watches and motion studies rule the day. (Taylor himself enjoyed sports, especially tennis and golf. He and a partner won a national championship in doubles tennis. He invented improved tennis racquets and improved golf clubs, although other players liked to tease him for his unorthodox designs, and they did not catch on as replacements for the mainstream implements).&lt;ref name="Kanigel1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanigel|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern human resources can be seen to have begun in the scientific management era, most notably in the writings of [[Katherine M. H. Blackford]], who was also a proponent of [[eugenics]].

Practices descended from scientific management are currently used in offices and in medicine (e.g. [[managed care]]) as well.&lt;ref name="Head2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Head|2005|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the tendency to overcome Taylorism is very great. The trend is moving away from assembly line work, since people are increasingly being replaced by [[machine]]s in production plants and sub-processes are [[Automation|automated]], so that human labor is not necessary in these cases. The desire for automated [[workflow]] in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the operational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Business Process Management.|last=Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J. &amp; Reijers, H.|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=Berlin Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=372|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it can be observed that many companies try to make the [[workplace]] as comfortable as possible for the [[employees]]. This is achieved by light flooded rooms, [[Feng shui|Feng Shui]] methods in the workplace or even by creative jobs. The efficiency and creativity of the employees is to be promoted by a pleasant atmosphere at the workplace. Approaches of the Scientific Management, in which attempts are also made to make the work environment pleasant, are partly recognizable here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/ausland/jobs-im-silicon-valley-arbeiten-bei-google-facebook-evernote-a-965811.html|title=Arbeiten im Silicon Valley. Wann ist endlich wieder Montag? In der Spiegel. 04. Mai 2014|last=Laube|first=H.|date=2014|newspaper=Der Spiegel|access-date=6 February 2017|archive-url=https://www.spiegel.de|archive-date=4 May 2014|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the works of Gouldner and Crozier, the recognition of the plurality of [[industrial society|industrial]] forms is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geschichte des organisatorischen Denkens|last=Bonazzi|first=G.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Wiesbaden: Springer Fachmedien.|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, we have a modern corporate management, where managers are given the available positions in [[Company|companies]] and are given the right to take legal action.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der Betriebsgröße im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=117|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working world of the 21st century is mainly based on [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]]. This is derived from quality control. In contrast to Taylorism, by which products are produced in the shortest possible time without any form of quality control and delivered to the end customer, the focus in the 21st century is on quality control at TQM. In order to avoid error rates, it is necessary to hire [[Expert|specialists]] to check all the products which have been manufactured before they are delivered to the end customer. The quality controls have improved over time, and incorrect partial processes can be detected in time and removed from the production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einführung in das Management von Geschäftsprozessen.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism approaches are largely prevalent in companies where machines can not perform certain activities. Certain subprocesses are still to be carried out by humans, such as the sorting out of damaged fruit in the final process before the goods are packed by machines. It turns out that the quality control is ultimately to be verified by the individual man. Certain activities remain similar to the approach of Taylorism. There are no "zero error programs", employees have to be trained and thus reduce error rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einführung in das Management von Geschäftsprozessen. Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[invention]] of the management one managed positions, which are equipped with disposition rights. The positions are occupied by paid employees and form the basis for the current, modern [[Management|corporate management.]] In order to be able to perceive these positions, it was no longer necessary to bring in resources such as capital, but instead [[job qualification|qualification]]s were necessary. Written rights are also passed on to employees, which means that the leaders of an organization tend to fall into the background and merely have a passive position.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"/&gt;

The structure and size of a company must be distinguished. Depending on which dispositions are predominant, the size of the company, the sector, and the number of employees in an organization, one can examine whether approaches of Taylorism are prevalent. It is believed to be predominant in the automotive industry. In spite of the fact that a lot of activities have been replaced by machines during the production, it is ultimately the person who can check the [[quality (business)|quality]] of a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der Betriebsgröße im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=1996|year=|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism led to a [[performance]] increase in companies. All superfluous working steps are avoided. The company benefits from the [[productivity]] of the workers and this in turn from higher [[wage]]s. Unused productivity resources were effectively exploited by Taylorism.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit. Neue Formen der Arbeitsgestaltung als Determinante von Arbeitszufriedenheit am Beispiel teilautonomer Arbeitsgruppen.|last=Von Berg|first=A.|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=Georg- August Universität: Göttingen.|pages=1–2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's work environment in the 21st century benefits from the [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] of working conditions. Corporate [[Strategy|strategies]] are increasingly focused on the flexibility of work. Flexible adaptation to demand should be possible. The qualifications of the employees, the work content as well as the work processes are determined by the competition situation on the market. The aim is to promote [[Discipline|self-discipline]] and the [[motivation]] of employees in order to achieve their own tasks and at the same time to prevent [[wikt:monotonous|monotonous]] work. Technical progress has led to more humane working conditions since inhumane work steps are done by the [[machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"/&gt;

Taylorism's approach is called [[wikt:inhuman|inhuman]]. The increased wage alone is not a permanent incentive for the workers to carry out the same monotonous work. Worker-friendly work structures are required. People no longer want to be perceived merely as executive organ. The complete separation from [[manual labor|manual]] and [[Headworks|headwork]] leads to a lack of [[pleasure]] in the execution of the work steps.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"/&gt;

In the 21st century the rising level of [[education]] leads to better trained workers, but the [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] [[pressure]] also rises. The interplay of [[Economy|economic]] as well as the pressure to innovate also lead to uncertainty among employees. The national diseases in the 21st century have become [[Occupational burnout|burn-out]] phenomena and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]s, often in conjunction with the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and the increased performance pressure in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit.

[[File:Kostnice Sedlec.JPG|thumbnail|Chapel Interior]]
The '''Sedlec Ossuary''' ({{lang-cs|Kostnice v Sedlci}}) is a small [[Roman Catholic]] [[chapel]], located beneath the Cemetery Church of All Saints (Czech: ''Hřbitovní kostel Všech Svatých''), part of the former [[Sedlec Abbey]] in Sedlec, a suburb of [[Kutná Hora]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. The [[ossuary]] is estimated to contain the [[skeletons]] of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. The ossuary is among the most visited [[tourist attraction]]s of the Czech Republic - attracting over 200,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nipos-mk.cz/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Statistika-2009_1dil_100922.pdf NIPOS: Statistika kultury 2009 - I. díl - kulturní dědictví (muzea, galerie a památkové objekty)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Four enormous bell-shaped mounds occupy the corners of the chapel. An enormous [[chandelier]] of bones, which contains at least one of every bone in the human body, hangs from the center of the nave with garlands of [[human skull|skull]]s draping the vault. Other works include piers and [[monstrance]]s flanking the [[altar]], a [[coat of arms]] of the [[House of Schwarzenberg]], and the signature of Rint, also executed in bone, on the wall near the entrance.

==History==
[[Image:Hřbitovní kaple Všech Svatých v Sedlci u Kutné Hory.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel exterior]]
In 1278, Henry, the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]] in Sedlec, was sent to the [[Holy Land]] by King [[Otakar II of Bohemia]]. He returned with a small amount of earth he had removed from [[Golgotha]] and sprinkled it over the abbey [[cemetery]]. The word of this pious act soon spread and the cemetery in Sedlec became a desirable [[burial]] site throughout [[Central Europe]].

In the mid 14th century, during the [[Black Death]], and after the [[Hussite Wars]] in the early 15th century, many thousands were buried in the abbey cemetery, so it had to be greatly enlarged.

Around 1400, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church was built in the center of the cemetery with a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] upper level and a lower chapel to be used as an [[ossuary]] for the mass graves unearthed during construction, or simply slated for demolition to make room for new burials.

After 1511, the task of [[exhumation|exhuming]] skeletons and stacking their bones in the chapel was given to a half-[[blindness|blind]] [[monk]] of the order.

Between 1703 and 1710, a new entrance was constructed to support the front wall, which was leaning outward, and the upper chapel was rebuilt. This work, in the Czech [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, was designed by [[Jan Santini Aichel]].

In 1870, [[František Rint]], a woodcarver, was employed by the [[House of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]] family to put the bone heaps into order, yielding a [[macabre]] result. The signature of Rint, also executed in bone, appears on the wall near the entrance to the chapel.

==In media==
In 1970, the centenary of Rint's contributions, Czech filmmaker [[Jan Švankmajer]] was commissioned to document the ossuary. The result was a 10-minute-long frantic-cut film of skeletal images overdubbed with an actual tour-guide's neutral voice narration. This version was initially banned by the Czech Communist authorities for alleged [[subversion]], and the soundtrack was replaced by a brief spoken introduction and a [[jazz]] arrangement by [[Zdeněk Liška]] of the [[poem]] "Comment dessiner le portrait d'un oiseau" ("How to Draw the Portrait of a Bird") by [[Jacques Prévert]]. Since the [[Velvet Revolution]], the original tour guide soundtrack has been made available.

In the documentary ''[[Long Way Round]]'', [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Charley Boorman]] stop to see this church. [[Dan Cruickshank]] also views the church in his ''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture|Adventures in Architecture]]''.

The ossuary is a major plot device in the [[John Connolly (author)|John Connolly]] novel ''The Black Angel''.

The ossuary is used as a location for the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' movie]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Czech Republic|url=http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech_culture/filming_locations.html|publisher=My Czech Republic|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movie ''[[Blood &amp; Chocolate (film)|Blood &amp; Chocolate]]''.

The ossuary was also featured in ''[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]]'' and is described by [[Cara Seymour]] in the final scene of the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]''

The ossuary was also the influence for Dr. Satan's lair in the [[Rob Zombie]] film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan Strusiewicz|first=Cezary|title=The 6 Creepiest Places on Earth|url=http://www.cracked.com/article/181_the-6-creepiest-places-earth_p2/|publisher=Cracked.com|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the term as used in folklore and superstition|the main meaning of the modern German word|blessing|the Hebrew term|segan}}

'''''Segen''''' is a German word translating to "blessing, benediction; charm; prayer; spell, incantation".

It is in origin a loan from Latin ''signum''  ''sīgnāre'' "to make a sign", viz. the [[Sign of the Cross]] used to confer a Christian [[blessing]],
The term is attested as  [[Old High German]] ''seganōn'' from as early as c. AD 800, resulting in a modern ''segnen'' "to bless". The noun ''Segen'' "blessing" was derived from the verb at an early time, attested in the 9th century as ''segan''.
[[Old English]] hat the corresponding ''sægnan'', which survives as the dialectal (esp. Scottish) ''sain'' (popularized by Scott, ''[[The Heart of Midlothian|Heart of Mid-Lothian]]'' "God sain us").
The concept of ''Segen'', understood [[magical thinking|magically]], was very productive in the [[folklore]], [[folk religion]] and [[superstition]] of [[German-speaking Europe]], studied in great detail by the German philologists and folklorists of the 19th century.

The medieval church used the ''Segen'' (the sign of the cross with a spoken formula) liberally, intended as an act with protective effect, putting the person or thing blessed under the protection of God. Nor was the action reserved for priests or clerics, but any Christian was permitted to make the sign of the cross and invoke the protection of God. Thus the ''Segen'' came to be seen as the inverse of the [[curse]] (''Fluch''), magical acts with the power to either protect or harm.  
&lt;!--The blessing offered by parents (''vater- &amp; muttersegen, benedictio parentum, paternum et maternum votum'') was considered particularly effective, presumably based on the narratives of the Old Testament (Hebrew  ''barak'' בָּרַךְ lit. "to kneel").
--&gt; 
The concept of ''Segen'' thus became the continuant of the incantation formulas of the [[Germanic paganism|pre-Christian period]]  (the only surviving samples of which are the [[Merseburg Incantations]]).

Use of such formulas was partly encouraged by the Church, as they did superficially involve an expression of piety by the invocation of God, Christ or the Virgin Mary, but at the same time their magical use was viewed with scepticism and was sometimes repressed.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' citing "E. H. Meyer myth. 23"."{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the time  of the [[Early Modern witch-hunts]], the term ''segen'' had become ambiguous, and depending on context could refer to a harmless farewell, to a  pious invocation of God, or to a Satanic or superstitious spell  (''pro incantamento et adjuratione magica'' Stieler 1669{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}; e.g. ''[[Wolfssegen]]'' "contra lupos").
{{verse translation|lang=de|
si (landstreicher) kunnen sagen vom vinstern sternen und tuond die lüt segen lernen für den donder und den hagel
|
they [vagabonds] know tales of dark stars and teach people ''spells'' [segen] for [to control] thunder and hail.
|attr1=''[[Des Teufels Netz]]'' v. 6367 (15th century)}}

This early modern usage survives in dialectal variation throughout the rural parts of German-speaking Europe.
For [[German-speaking Switzerland]], the ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]'' [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register/faksimile.php?&amp;band=7&amp;spalte=444 7,444 "Sëgeⁿ"] 
records some  two dozen compounds in ''-sëgeⁿ'', in some of which ''Segen'' takes the meaning "prayer" and in others "spell, charm".

A notable concept in Swiss folklore is the ''Alpsegen'' (''Alpe(n)sëgeⁿ, Alpsëgeⁿ''  [https://web.archive.org/web/20130325231631/http://digital.idiotikon2.ch/idtkn/id7.htm#page/70451/mode/1up 7,451]), a folk religious custom in Alpine Switzerland where every night 
a prayer must be sung over each [[Alpine pasture]]. This combined the function of an apotropaic charm with a practical aspect of communicating between remote pastures; if the ''Alpsegen'' was not heard from a neighbouring site, it would be a sign that a misfortune or accident had befallen and the neighbours would come to aid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15702">In [[computer science]], '''separation of concerns''' ('''SoC''') is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a [[modularity (programming)|modular]]&lt;ref name=laplante&gt;{{cite book|last=Laplante|first=Phillip|title=What Every Engineer Should Know About Software Engineering|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849372283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulating]] information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of [[information hiding]].&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Dr. R. J.|title=Managing Complexity in Software Engineering|year=1990|publisher=IEE|isbn=0863411711|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXtHeZt8ZowC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{cite book|title=Microsoft Application Architecture Guide|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0-7356-2710-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9on897Ep7AC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22layered+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0xPaUKKJMITmiwKhiYDYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. Of special value is the ability to later improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections.

== Implementation ==
The mechanisms for modular or object-oriented programming that are provided by a [[programming language]] are mechanisms that allow developers to provide SoC.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite paper|last=Painter|first=Robert Richard|title=Software Plans: Multi-Dimensional Fine-Grained Separation of Concerns|citeseerx = 10.1.1.110.9227|publisher=Penn State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[object-oriented programming]] languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C++]], [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] can separate concerns into [[Object (computer science)|objects]], and architectural [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] like [[Model-view-controller|MVC]] or [[Model-view-presenter|MVP]] can [[separation of presentation and content|separate content from presentation]] and the data-processing (model) from content.
[[Service-orientation|Service-oriented design]] can separate concerns into [[Service (Systems Architecture)|services]]. [[Procedural programming]] languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] can separate concerns into [[procedure (computer science)|procedure]]s or [[Subroutines|functions]]. [[Aspect-oriented programming]] languages can separate concerns into [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]] and [[Object (computer science)|objects]].

Separation of concerns is an important design principle in many other areas as well, such as [[urban planning]], [[architecture]] and [[information design]].&lt;ref name=garofalo&gt;{{cite book|last=Garofalo|first=Raffaele|title=Building Enterprise Applications with Windows Presentation Foundation and the Model View ViewModel Pattern|year=2011|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0735650926|pages=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WJ5oQT0dcUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22urban+planning%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CxjaUK-hN-yVjAKz84D4Cg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22%20%22urban%20planning%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to more effectively understand, design, and manage complex interdependent systems, so that functions can be reused, optimized independently of other functions, and insulated from the potential failure of other functions.

Common examples include separating a space into rooms, so that activity in one room does not affect people in other rooms, and keeping the stove on one circuit and the lights on another, so that overload by the stove does not turn the lights off. The example with rooms shows encapsulation, where information inside one room, such as how messy it is, is not available to the other rooms, except through the interface, which is the door. The example with circuits demonstrates that activity inside one module, which is a circuit with consumers of electricity attached, does not affect activity in a different module, so each module is not concerned with what happens in the other.

== Origin ==
The term ''separation of concerns'' was probably coined by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] in his 1974 paper "On the role of scientific thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{quote |Let me try to explain to you, what to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking. It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained&amp;nbsp;—on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called '''"the separation of concerns"''', which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.}}

Fifteen years later, it was evident the term '''Separation of Concerns''' was becoming an accepted idea. In 1989, Chris Reade wrote a book titled "Elements of Functional Programming"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Reade | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Reade | title = Elements of Functional Programming
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley Longman | year = 1989 | location =  Boston, MA, USA | isbn = 0-201-12915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes separation of concerns:
{{quote |The programmer is having to do several things at the same time, namely,
# describe what is to be computed;
# organise the computation sequencing into small steps;
# organise memory management during the computation.}}
Reade continues to say,
{{quote |Ideally, the programmer should be able to concentrate on the first of the three tasks (describing what is to be computed) without being distracted by the other two, more administrative, tasks. Clearly, administration is important, but by separating it from the main task we are likely to get more reliable results and we can ease the programming problem by automating much of the administration.

The '''separation of concerns''' has other advantages as well. For example, program proving becomes much more feasible when details of sequencing and memory management are absent from the program. Furthermore, descriptions of what is to be computed should be free of such detailed step-by-step descriptions of how to do it, if they are to be evaluated with different machine architectures. Sequences of small changes to a data object held in a store may be an inappropriate description of how to compute something when a highly parallel machine is being used with thousands of processors distributed throughout the machine and local rather than global storage facilities.

Automating the administrative aspects means that the language implementor has to deal with them, but he/she has far more opportunity to make use of very different computation mechanisms with different machine architectures.}}

== Examples ==

=== Internet protocol stack ===
Separation of concerns is crucial to the design of the Internet. In the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], great efforts have been made to separate concerns into well-defined [[OSI Model|layers]]. This allows protocol designers to focus on the concerns in one layer, and ignore the other layers. The Application Layer protocol SMTP, for example, is concerned about all the details of conducting an email session over a reliable transport service (usually TCP), but not in the least concerned about how the transport service makes that service reliable. Similarly, TCP is not concerned about the routing of data packets, which is handled at the [[Internet Layer]].

=== HTML, CSS, JavaScript ===
[[HTML|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), and [[JavaScript]] (JS) are complementary languages used in the development of webpages and websites. HTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of content presentation style, and JS defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of CSS, HTML performed both duties of defining semantics and style.

=== Subject-oriented programming ===
[[Subject-oriented programming]] allows separate concerns to be addressed as separate software constructs, each on an equal footing with the others. Each concern provides its own class-structure into which the objects in common are organized, and contributes state and methods to the composite result where they cut across one another. Correspondence rules describe how the classes and methods in the various concerns are related to each other at points where they interact, allowing composite behavior for a method to be derived from several concerns. [[Subject-oriented programming#Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns, Hyper/J and the Concern Manipulation Environment|Multi-dimensional Separation of Concerns]] allows the analysis and composition of concerns to be manipulated as a multi-dimensional "matrix" in which each concern provides a dimension in which different points of choice are enumerated, with the cells of the matrix occupied by the appropriate software artifacts.

=== Aspect-oriented programming ===
[[Aspect-oriented programming]] allows [[cross-cutting concern]]s to be addressed as primary concerns. For example, most programs require some form of [[computer security|security]] and [[Data logging|logging]]. Security and logging are often secondary concerns, whereas the primary concern is often on accomplishing business goals. However, when designing a program, its security must be built into the design from the beginning instead of being treated as a secondary concern. Applying security afterwards often results in an insufficient security model that leaves too many gaps for future attacks. This may be solved with aspect-oriented programming. For example, an aspect may be written to enforce that calls to a certain API are always logged, or that errors are always logged when an exception is thrown, regardless of whether the program's procedural code handles the exception or propagates it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software build automation ===
Most project organization tasks are seen as secondary tasks. For example, [[build automation]] is an approach to automating the process of compiling source code into binary code. The primary goals in build automation are reducing the risk of human error and saving time.

=== Levels of analysis in artificial intelligence ===
In [[cognitive science]] and [[artificial intelligence]], it is common to refer to David Marr's [[David Marr (neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis|levels of analysis]].  At any given time, a researcher may be focusing on (1) what some aspect of intelligence needs to compute, (2) what algorithm it employs, or (3) how that algorithm is implemented in hardware.  This separation of concerns is similar to the [[interface (computing)|interface]]/implementation distinction in software and hardware engineering.

=== Normalized Systems ===

In [[Normalized Systems]] separation of concerns is one of the four guiding principles. Adhering to this principle is one of the tools that helps reduce the combinatorial effects that, over time, get introduced in software that is being maintained. In Normalized Systems separation of concerns is actively supported by the tools.

=== SoC via partial classes ===
Separation of concerns can be implemented and enforced via [[partial class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Single-minute exchange of die''' ('''SMED''') is one of the many [[lean production]] methods for reducing waste in a manufacturing process. It provides a rapid and efficient way of converting a manufacturing process from running the current product to running the next product. This rapid changeover is key to reducing production lot sizes and thereby improving flow ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]), reducing production loss and output variability.

The phrase "single minute" does not mean that all changeovers and startups should take only ''one'' minute, but that they should take less than 10 minutes (in other words, "single-digit minute").&lt;ref&gt;Study of Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, 1981, p 70&lt;/ref&gt; Closely associated is a yet more difficult concept, '''One-Touch Exchange of Die''', '''(OTED)''', which says changeovers can and should take less than 100 seconds.  A [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] is a tool used in manufacturing. However SMED's utility is not limited to manufacturing (see [[value stream mapping]]).

==History==
Frederick Taylor analyzed non-value-adding parts of setups in his 1911 book, ''Shop Management'' (page 171). However, he did not create any method or structured approach around it.

Frank Gilbreth studied and improved working processes in many different industries, from bricklaying to surgery. As part of his work, he also looked into changeovers. His book ''Motion Study'' (also from 1911) described approaches to reduce setup time.

Even Henry Ford's factories were using some setup reduction techniques. In the 1915 publication ''Ford Methods and Ford Shops'', setup reduction approaches were clearly described. However, these approaches never became mainstream. For most parts during the 20th century, the economic order quantity was the gold standard for lot sizing.

The JIT workflow of Toyota had this problem of tools changeover took between two and eight hours, Toyota could neither afford the lost production time nor the enormous lot sizes suggested by the economic order quantity. Lot reduction and set up time reduction had actually been ongoing in TPS since 1945 when Taiichi Ohno became manager of the machine shops in Toyota. On a trip to the US in 1955, Taiichi Ohno observed Danly stamping presses with rapid die change capability. Subsequently, Toyota bought multiple Danly presses for the Motomachi plant. And Toyota started to work on improving the changeover time of their presses. This was known as ''Quick Die Change'', or  ''QDC'' for short. They developed a structured approach based on a framework from the US World War II ''Training within Industry'' (TWI) program, called ECRS – Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify.

Over time they reduced these changeover times from hours to fifteen minutes by the 1960s, three minutes by the 1970s and then just 180 seconds by 1990s.

During the late 1970s, when Toyota's method was already well refined, Shigeo Shingo participated in one QDC workshop. After he started to publicize details of the Toyota Production System without permission, the business connection was terminated abruptly by Toyota. Shingo moved to the US and started to consult on lean manufacturing. Besides claiming to have invented this quick changeover method (among many other things), he renamed it ''Single Minute Exchange of Die'' or, in short, SMED. The ''Single Minute'' stands for a single digit minute (i.e., less than ten minutes). He promoted TPS and SMED in US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allaboutlean.com/smed-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twisummit.cn/downloads/2007/Smalley_Origins_and_Facts_Regarding_TPS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Toyota found that the most difficult tools to change were the dies on the large transfer-stamping machines that produce car vehicle body parts.  The dies – which must be changed for each model – weigh many tons, and must be assembled in the stamping machines with tolerances of less than a millimeter, otherwise the stamped metal will wrinkle, if not melt, under the intense heat and pressure.

When Toyota engineers examined the change-over, they discovered that the established procedure was to stop the line, let down the dies by an overhead crane, position the dies in the machine by human eyesight, and then adjust their position with crowbars while making individual test stampings.  The existing process took from twelve hours to almost three days to complete.

Toyota's first improvement was to place precision measurement devices on the transfer stamping machines, and record the necessary measurements for each model's die.  Installing the die against these measurements, rather than by human eyesight, immediately cut the change-over to a mere hour and a half.

Further observations led to further improvements – scheduling the die changes in a standard sequence (as part of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule|FRS]]) as a new model moved through the factory, dedicating tools to the die-change process so that all needed tools were nearby, and scheduling use of the overhead cranes so that the new die would be waiting as the old die was removed.  Using these processes, Toyota engineers cut the change-over time to less than 10 minutes per die, and thereby reduced the economic lot size below one vehicle.

The success of this program contributed directly to [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time manufacturing]] which is part of the [[Toyota Production System]]. SMED makes [[Production levelling|Load balancing]] much more achievable by reducing economic lot size and thus stock levels.

===Effects of implementation===

Shigeo Shingo, who created the SMED approach, claims&lt;ref&gt;A revolution in manufacturing: The SMED system, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1985, p 113&lt;/ref&gt; that in his data from between 1975 and 1985 that average setup times he has dealt with have reduced to 2.5% of the time originally required; a 40 times improvement.

However, the power of SMED is that it has a lot of other effects which come from systematically looking at operations; these include:

* Stockless production which drives inventory turnover rates,
* Reduction in footprint of processes with reduced inventory freeing floor space
* Productivity increases or reduced production time
** Increased machine work rates from reduced setup times even if number of changeovers increases
** Elimination of setup errors and elimination of trial runs reduces defect rates
** Improved quality from fully regulated operating conditions in advance
** Increased safety from simpler setups
** Simplified housekeeping from fewer tools and better organization
** Lower expense of setups
** Operator preferred since easier to achieve
** Lower skill requirements since changes are now designed into the process rather than a matter of skilled judgement
* Elimination of unusable stock from model changeovers and demand estimate errors
* Goods are not lost through deterioration
* Ability to mix production gives flexibility and further inventory reductions as well as opening the door to revolutionized production methods (large orders ≠ large production lot sizes)
* New attitudes on controllability of work process amongst staff

== Implementation ==

Shigeo Shingo recognizes  eight techniques&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p 47&lt;/ref&gt; that should be considered in implementing SMED.

# Separate internal from external setup operations
# Convert internal to external setup
# Standardize function, not shape
# Use functional clamps or eliminate fasteners altogether
# Use intermediate jigs
# Adopt parallel operations (see image below)
# Eliminate adjustments
# Mechanization
NB External setup can be done without the line being stopped whereas internal setup requires that the line be stopped.

He suggests&lt;ref&gt;A revolution in manufacturing: The SMED system, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1985, p 27&lt;/ref&gt; that SMED improvement should pass through four conceptual stages:

A) ensure that external setup actions are performed while the machine is still running,
B) separate external and internal setup actions, ensure that the parts all function and implement efficient ways of transporting the die and other parts,
C) convert internal setup actions to external,
D) improve all setup actions.

[[Image:smedfases.gif|center]]

===Formal method===
There are seven basic steps [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323033009/http://www.sevenrings.co.uk/SMED/HowtodoSMED.asp] to reducing changeover using the SMED system:

# OBSERVE the current methodology (A)
# Separate the INTERNAL and EXTERNAL activities (B). Internal activities are those that can only be performed when the process is stopped, while External activities can be done while the last batch is being produced, or once the next batch has started. For example, go and get the required tools for the job BEFORE the machine stops.
# Convert (where possible) Internal activities into External ones (C) (pre-heating of tools is a good example of this).
# Streamline the remaining internal activities, by simplifying them (D). Focus on fixings – [[Shigeo Shingo]] observed that it's only the last turn of a bolt that tightens it – the rest is just movement.
# Streamline the External activities, so that they are of a similar scale to the Internal ones (D).
# Document the new procedure, and actions that are yet to be completed.
# Do it all again: For each iteration of the above process, a 45% improvement in set-up times should be expected, so it may take several iterations to cross the ten-minute line.

This diagram shows four successive runs with learning from each run and improvements applied before the next.
* Run 1 illustrates the original situation.
* Run 2 shows what would happen if more changeovers were included.
* Run 3 shows the impact of the improvements in changeover times that come from doing more of them and building learning into their execution.
* Run 4 shows how these improvements can get you back to the same production time but now with more flexibility in production capacity.
* Run N (not illustrated) would have changeovers that take 1.5 minutes (97% reduction) and whole shift time reduced from 420 minutes to 368 minutes a productivity improvement of 12%.

The SMED concept is credited to [[Shigeo Shingo]], one of the main contributors to the consolidation of the [[Toyota Production System]], along with [[Taiichi Ohno]].

===Key elements to observe===

Look for:
# shortages, mistakes, inadequate verification of equipment causing delays and can be avoided by check tables, especially visual ones, and setup on an intermediary jig
# inadequate or incomplete repairs to equipment causing rework and delays
# optimization for least work as opposed to least delay
# unheated molds which require several wasted 'tests' before they will be at the temperature to work
# using slow precise adjustment equipment for the large coarse part of adjustment
# lack of visual lines or benchmarks for part placement on the equipment
# forcing a changeover between different raw materials when a continuous feed, or near equivalent, is possible
# lack of functional standardization, that is standardization of only the parts necessary for setup e.g. all bolts use same size spanner, die grip points are in the same place on all dies
# much operator movement around the equipment during setup
# more attachment points than actually required for the forces to be constrained
# attachment points that take more than one turn to fasten
# any adjustments after initial setup
# any use of experts during setup
# any adjustments of assisting tools such as guides or switches

'''Record all necessary data'''

[[Image:smedtemplate.gif|thumb|400 px|none|Data capture template]]

'''Parallel operations using multiple operators''' By taking the 'actual' operations and making them into a network which contains the dependencies it is possible to optimise task attribution and further optimize setup time. Issues of effective communication between the operators must be managed to ensure safety is assured where potentially noisy or visually obstructive conditions occur.

'''Social cognition''' is "a sub-topic of [[social psychology]] that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that [[cognitive processes]] play in social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Park |first=Mina |last2= Song |first2=Jae-Jin |last3=Oh |first3=Seo Jin |last4=Shin |first4=Min-Sup |last5=Lee |first5=Jun Ho |last6=Oh |first6= Seung Ha |journal= BioMed Research International |language=en |volume=2015 |pages=1–7 |doi= 10.1155/2015/313274 |pmid= 26236723 |pmc= 4506840 |issn= 2314-6133 |title=The Relation between Nonverbal IQ and Postoperative CI Outcomes in Cochlear Implant Users: Preliminary Result |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with [[conspecifics]] (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of [[social psychology]], social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[information processing theory]]. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt; The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.

The term ''social cognition'' has been used in multiple areas in [[psychology]] and [[Social cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience]], most often to refer to various social abilities disrupted in [[autism]],&lt;ref name="Striano"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Cognition: Development, Neuroscience and Autism|editor=Striano, T.|editor2=Reid, V.|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1-4051-6217-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref name="Billeke-Aboitiz-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 =Billeke | first1 = P. | last2 = Aboitiz | first2 = F.  | title = Social cognition in schizophrenia: from social stimuli processing to social engagement| journal =Frontiers in Psychiatry  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = eCollection 2013 |date=February 2013 | doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00004 | pmid = 23444313 | pmc=3580762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other disorders.&lt;ref name="BlairMitchellBlair"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain|last=Blair|first=J.|author2=Mitchel, D. |author3=Blair, K.  |year=2005|isbn=978-0-631-23336-7|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|pages=25–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cacioppo, J.T.|author2=Berntson, G.G.|author3=Sheridan, J.F.|author4=McClintock, M.K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Multilevel integrative analyses of human behavior: social neuroscience and the complementing nature of social and biological approaches|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|issue=6|pages=829–43|pmid=11107878|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.829|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806233305/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cacioppo, J.T.|year=2002|title=Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa|journal=American Psychologist|volume=57|issue=11|pages=819–31|pmid=12564179|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.11.819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=R.|title=Social cognition and the human brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|pages=469–79|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01399-6|pmid=10562726|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.7847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]]s study the development of social cognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|title= Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence|last=Shaffer |first=D.R.|author2=Kipp, K. |isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|chapter=Chapter 12: Theories of social and cognitive development |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of [[cognitive psychology]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name=Husain&gt;{{cite book|title= Social Psychology|last=Husain |first=A. |isbn=9788131760000 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]]|chapter=Chapter 5: Social Perception and Cognition |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "[[mentalism (psychology)|cognitive elements]]" such as [[schema (psychology)|schemas]], [[attribution theory|attributions]], or [[stereotype]]s. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.

==Social schemas==
Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or "[[concept]]s" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the brain]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.

When a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.

Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication? A theory driven study |journal=The Open Medical Informatics Journal |volume=2 |pages=82–91|doi=10.2174/1874431100802010082|pmid=19415137|pmc=2669642}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.

Social cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural differences==
Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.&lt;ref name= "Aronson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book |title= Remembering |last=Bartlett |first=F. |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page=249 |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.

Cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as [[China]] and [[Japan]] tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbett |first=R. |author2=Peng, K. |author3=Choi, I. |author4= Norenzayan, A.  |title=Culture and Systems of thought: Holistic vs. analytic cognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |pages=291–310 |year=2001 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.291 |pmid=11381831 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Takahiko Masuda |last1=Masuda |first1=T. |last2=Nisbett|first2=R. |title=Culture and change blindness |journal=Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal. |volume=30 |pages=381–389 |year=2006 |doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_63 |pmid=21702819 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett" /&gt; For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|authorlink2=Phoebe C.

Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyamoto |first=Y. |author2=Kitayama, S.  |title=Cultural variation in correspondence bias: The critical role of attitude diagnosticity of socially constrained behaviour |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=1239–1248 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1239 |pmid=12416925 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.6787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of [[Phineas Gage]], whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent [[neuropsychological]] studies have shown that [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] disrupt social cognitive processes. For example, damage to the frontal lobes can affect emotional responses to social stimuli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harmon-Jones |first=E. |author2=Winkielman, P.  |year=2007 |title=Social Neuroscience: Integrating Biological and Psychological Explanations of Social Behavior |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-59385-404-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Descarte's Error: Emotion, reason and the human brain |last=Damasio |first=A.R. |year=1994 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-65656-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hornak |first=J. |author2=Rolls, E.T. |author3=Wade, D.  |year=1996 |title=Face and voice expression identification in patients with emotional and behavioral changes following ventral frontal lobe damage |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=34 |pages=247–61 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00106-9 |pmid=8657356 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performance on [[theory of mind]] tasks.&lt;ref name=BaronCohen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=V.E. |author2=Baron-Cohen, S. |author3= Knight, R.T.  |title=Frontal lobe contributions to theory of mind |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=10 |pages=640–56 |year=1998 |doi=10.1162/089892998562942 |pmid=9802997 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.330.1488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brunet |first=E. |author2=Sarfati, Y. |author3=Hardy-Bayle, MC. |author4=Decety, J. |year=2000 |title=A PET investigation of attribution of intentions to others with a non-verbal task |journal=NeuroImage |volume=11 |pages=157–66 |doi=10.1006/nimg.1999.0525 |pmid=10679187 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[temporal lobe]], damage to the [[fusiform gyrus]] can lead to the [[prosopagnosia|inability to recognize faces]].

The development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively (see [[developmental psychology]]). For example, it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as [[Face perception|facial recognition]]) may be [[psychological nativism|innate]]. Consistent with this, very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice, face and scent of their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |pages=182–3 |chapter=Chapter 5: Social Development |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-631-14809-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">'''Synectics''' is a [[problem solving]] methodology that stimulates thought processes of which the subject may be unaware. This method was developed by [[George M. Prince]] (April 5, 1918 – June 9, 2009)&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/06/21/george_prince_consultant_who_sparked_creative_ideas/ George Prince, consultant who sparked innovation, founded international firm], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William J.J. Gordon]], originating in the [[Arthur D. Little]] Invention Design Unit in the 1950s.

==History==
The process was derived from [[Tape recorder|tape-recording]] (initially [[Sound|audio]], later [[video]]) meetings, analysis of the results and experiments with alternative ways of dealing with the obstacles to success in the meeting. "Success" was defined as getting a creative solution that the group was committed to implement.

The name Synectics comes from the Greek and means "the joining together of different and apparently irrelevant elements."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, William J.J. ''Synectics: The Development of Creative Capacity''. (New York: Harper and row, Publishers, 1961), 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon and Prince named both their practice and their new company Synectics, which can cause confusion as people not part of the company are trained and use the practice. While the name was trademarked, it has become a standard word for describing creative problem solving in groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/kwessel/MBA%20660%20Session%202%20Folder/9993081.pdf Nolan, Vincent. "Whatever Happened to Synectics?" ''Creativity and Innovation Management,'' v. 21 n.1 (2003): 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Synectics is a way to approach [[creativity]] and [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] in a rational way. "Traditionally, the creative process has been considered after the fact... The Synectics study has attempted to research creative process in vivo, while it is going on."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gordon, Synectics research has three main assumptions:
*The [[Creativity|creative process]] can be described and taught;
*Invention processes in arts and sciences are analogous and are driven by the same "psychic" processes;
*Individual and group creativity are analogous.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
With these assumptions in mind, Synectics believes that people can be better at being creative if they understand how creativity works.

One important element in creativity is embracing the seemingly [[Relevance|irrelevant]]. Emotion is emphasized over intellect and the [[Irrationality|irrational]] over the [[Rationality|rational]]. Through understanding the emotional and irrational elements of a problem or idea, a group can be more successful at solving a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince emphasized the importance of creative [[Behavior|behaviour]] in reducing inhibitions and releasing the inherent creativity of everyone. He and his colleagues developed specific practices and meeting structures which help people to ensure that their constructive intentions are experienced positively by one another. The use of the creative behaviour tools extends the application of Synectics to many situations beyond invention sessions (particularly constructive resolution of conflict).

Gordon emphasized the importance of {{"'}}metaphorical process' to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar". He expressed his central principle as: "Trust things that are alien, and alienate things that are trusted." This encourages, on the one hand, fundamental problem-analysis and, on the other hand, the [[Social alienation|alienation]] of the original [[problem]] through the creation of [[analogy|analogies]]. It is thus possible for new and surprising solutions to emerge.

As an invention tool, Synectics invented a technique called "springboarding" for getting creative beginning ideas. For the development of beginning ideas, the method incorporates brainstorming and deepens and widens it with [[metaphor]]; it also adds an important evaluation process for Idea Development, which takes embryonic new ideas that are attractive but not yet feasible and builds them into new courses of action which have the commitment of the people who will implement them.

Synectics is more demanding of the subject than [[brainstorming]], as the steps involved imply that the process is more complicated and requires more time and effort. The success of the Synectics [[methodology]] depends highly on the skill of a trained [[facilitator]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Dick, ''High Tech Creativity'', [[IEEE]] Engineers' Guide to Business, pp. 117-8, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">"'''The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories'''" is a 1976 paper in [[ethics]] by Michael Stocker. Published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', the central claim of the paper is that some modern ethical theories fail to account for [[motivation|motive]] in their theories, producing a sort of [[schizophrenia]] because the agent is unable to use his reasons or motives as a basis for his actions. According to Stocker, motive is important to ethics and should be considered as well, rather than only "duty, rightness and obligation" which he believes are the main focuses of current theories. Stocker believes that this focus is not compatible with the motives required for goods such as [[love]] and [[friendship]].

Stocker uses the example of a friend visiting you in the hospital. It is nice at first, however he reveals that he chose to spend time with you not out of concern for you in particular, but because he felt it was his moral [[duty]]. In this case, we feel that there is something missing in this action—we would much prefer to be visited by someone who cares about us directly, not just his duty.

A '''prop''', formally known as '''(theatrical) property''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property Oxford Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817070616/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property |date=2016-08-17 }} "old-fashioned term for prop"&lt;/ref&gt; is an object used on stage or on screen by [[actors]] during a [[performance]] or [[Filmmaking#Production|screen production]]. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment. Consumable food items appearing in the production are also considered props.&lt;ref name="Nesfield-Cookson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nesfield-Cookson |first=Mary |title=Small Stage Properties and Furniture |year=1934 |publisher=G.

==Term==
The earliest known use of the term "properties" in English to refer to stage accessories is in the 1425 CE [[morality play]], ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |title = First use of "Property" in the theatrical sense |last = Hart |first = Eric |date = 19 October 2009 |work = Prop Agenda |accessdate = 7 April 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041525/http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |archivedate = 22 February 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stage Properties |first=Dutton |last=Cook |magazine=Belgravia |volume=35 |pages=282–284 |year=1878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds the first usage of "props" in 1841, while the singular form of "prop" appeared in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;prop, n./6; Third edition, September 2009; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/152851&gt;; accessed 13 January 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Renaissance]] in [[Europe]], small acting troupes functioned as cooperatives, pooling resources and dividing any income. Many performers provided their own costumes, but special items—stage weapons, furniture or other hand-held devices—were considered "company property"; hence the term "property."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;[[Eric Partridge]] ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English: Second Edition''. Random House 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macgowan"&gt;Kenneth Macgowan and William Melnitz ''The Living Stage''. Prentice-Hall 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts however seem to think that the term comes from the idea that stage or screen objects "belong" to whoever uses them on stage.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

There is no difference between props in different media, such as theatre, film, or television. Bland Wade, a properties director, says, "A coffee cup onstage is a coffee cup on television, is a coffee cup on the big screen." He adds, "There are definitely different responsibilities and different vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Through the Eyes of the Property Director |first=Blande |last=Wade |journal=Theatre Symposium |volume=18 |page=8 |year=2010 |issn=1065-4917 |isbn=978-0-8173-7005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On stage and backstage==
[[Image:Fundus Nationaltheater Mannheim.jpg|thumb|right|Props storage room of the National Theatre, Germany]]
The term "theatrical property" originated to describe an object used in a stage play and similar entertainments to further the action. Technically, a prop is any object that gives the scenery, actors, or performance space specific period, place, or character.{{inconsistent}} The term comes from live-performance practice, especially theatrical methods, but its modern use extends beyond the traditional plays and musical, circus, novelty, comedy, and even public-speaking performances, to film, television, and electronic media.

Props in a production originate from off stage unless they have been preset on the stage before the production begins. Props are stored on a prop table backstage near the actor's entrance during production then generally locked in a storage area between performances. The person in charge of handling the props is generally called the "props master". Other positions also include coordinators, production assistants and interns as may be needed for a specific project.

==Modern usage==
The term has readily transferred to [[television]], [[motion picture]] and [[video game]] production, where they are commonly referred to by the phrase '''movie prop''', '''film prop''' or simply '''prop'''. In recent years, the increasing popularity of [[movie memorabilia]] (a broader term that also includes costumes) has added new meaning to the term "prop", broadening its existence to include a valuable after-life as a prized collector's item. Typically not available until after a film's premiere, movie props appearing on-screen are called "screen-used", and can fetch thousands of dollars in online auctions and charity benefits.&lt;ref name="Mohr"&gt;Ian Mohr ''[[Daily Variety]]''. Reed Business Information, February 27, 2006 [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 "Movie props on the block: Mouse to auction Miramax leftovers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021080710/http://variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;David James, ''[[People Magazine]]'', Time, Inc. February 24, 2007 [http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html#comment-66215834 "Bid on Dreamgirls Costumes for Charity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226152128/http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many props are ordinary objects. However, a prop must "read well" from the [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of theatre terms#H|house]] or on-screen, meaning it must look real to the audience. Many real objects are poorly adapted to the task of looking like themselves to an audience, due to their size, durability, or color under bright lights, so some props are specially designed to look more like the actual item than the real object would look. In some cases, a prop is designed to behave differently from how the real object would, often for the sake of safety.

Examples of special props are:
* A prop sack representing a [[burlap bag]], might have another black fabric bag sewn, discreetly inside the burlap, giving it strength, hiding the contents and creating a visual void to the audience view.
* A prop mop, representing a string [[mop]], but built out of a rectangular shape covered with fabric, so the mop can be slid across the stage to another actress as part of a musical number (as in ''Fiddler on the Roof''{{'}}s song "Matchmaker").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|title=HOUSE INTERIOR PROPS|author=|date=|website=faculty.trinity.edu|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430152902/http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|archivedate=30 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[prop weapon]] (such as a stage gun or a stage sword) that looks functional, but lacks the intentional harmfulness of the corresponding real weapon. In the theater, prop weapons are almost always either non-operable replicas, or have safety features to ensure they are not dangerous. Guns fire caps or noisy blanks, swords are dulled, and knives are often made of plastic or rubber. In film production, fully functional weapons are mostly used, but typically only with special [[smoke blank]]s with blank adapted guns instead of real bullets. Real cartridges with bullets removed are still dangerously charged which has caused several tragic instances when used on stage or film. The safety and proper handling of real weapons used as movie props is the premiere responsibility of the ''[[prop master]]''. [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] and other law enforcement agencies may monitor the use of real guns for film and television, but this is generally not necessary with stage props as these guns are permanently "plugged".
* Breakaway objects, or ''stunt props,'' such as [[balsa]]-wood furniture, or [[sugar glass]] (mock-glassware made of crystallized sugar) whose breakage and debris look real but rarely cause injury due to their light weight and weak structure. Even for such seemingly safe props, very often a [[stunt double]] will replace the main actor for shots involving use of breakaway props. Rubber bladed-weapons and guns are examples of props used by [[Stunt performer|stuntmen]] to minimize injury, or by actors where the action requires a prop which minimizes injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyle |first=Richard |title=A Collector's Guide To Hand Props |url=http://www.racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |work= |publisher=RACprops |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195326/http://racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |archivedate=3 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Hero" props are the more detailed pieces intended for close inspection by the camera or audience. The hero prop may have legible writing, lights, moving parts, or other attributes or functions missing from a standard prop; a hero prop [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, for example, might include a depressible trigger and a light-up muzzle and display panel (all of which would make the hero prop more expensive and less durable). The term is also used on occasion for ''any'' of the items that a main character would carry in film and television (which are often hero props in the first sense as well). The term may sometimes be used in stage production, as many props from film find their way into theatre from common rental and purchase shops.

In [[anthropology]], a '''tribe''' is a [[human]] [[social group]]. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with [[colonialism]]. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be [[wikt:primitive|primitive]] and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as [[nation]]s, [[state (polity)|state]]s, and forms of [[kinship]].

In some places, such as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|India]] and [[Tribe (Native American)|North America]], tribes are [[Polity|polities]] that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.

== Etymology ==
The word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century [[Middle English]]-literature, in reference to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]]. The Middle English word is derived from Old French ''tribu'' and, in turn, from Latin ''tribus'' (plural ''tribūs''), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into ''tribūs'' known as the ''Ramnes'' (or ''Ramnenses''), ''Tities'' (or ''Titienses''), and ''Luceres'', corresponding, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], to the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Sabines]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] respectively. The ''Ramnes'' were named after [[Romulus]], leader of the Latins, ''Tities'' after [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines, and ''Luceres'' after [[Lucumo]], leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the [[Tribal Assembly]] (''comitia tributa'') in the [[Roman Republic]] included 35 tribes (four "urban tribes" and 31 "rural tribes"). According to [[Livy]], the three "tribes" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.

The term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''tri-'' ("three") and ''bhew'' ("to be"). The classicist [[Gregory Nagy]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]],''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the linguist [[Émile Benveniste]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origines de la formation des noms en indo-européen'',  {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Umbrian]] ''trifu'' (equivalent of the Latin ''tribus'') is apparently derived from a combination of ''*tri-'' and ''*bhu-'', where the second element is cognate with the Greek root ''phúō'' φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek [[wikt:φυλή|''phulē'']] φυλή "clan, race, people" (plural ''phylai'' φυλαί). The Greek ''[[polis]]'' ("state" or "city") was, like the Roman state, divided into three ''phylai''.

In Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in [[New Latin]] and instead of ''tribus''  the word ''phyle'' was used, derived from the Greek ''phulē''&lt;!-- 'and ultimately the Hebrew, meaning or "sceptre" ' ← Commented this out as the connection, if any, is not at all clear  --&gt;. In the historical sense, "tribe", "race" and "clan" have often been used interchangeably.

==Usage controversy==
The term and concept of a ''tribe'' is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the [[social science]]s. The term ''tribe'' was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] writes:
:The tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.&lt;ref name="MITCHELL-1970-83"&gt;Mitchell, Clyde J. 1970. "Tribe and Social Change in South Central Africa: A Situational Approach" in Gutkind, Peter C. W. Editor. ''The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa'', p. 83. [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that "like the word ''Indian'', ''[t]ribe'' is a word that has connotations of colonialism."&lt;ref name="ORTOLEVA-2013-95"&gt;Ortoleva, Matthew. 2013. "We Face East" in Goggin, Peter N. Editor. ''Environmental Rhetoric and Ecologies of Place'', p. 95. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|9781135922658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes and nations ==
Considerable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over [[cultural evolution]] and [[colonialism]].  In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable.  Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an "ethnic group" or of a "nation".  [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] research has challenged all of these notions.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Elman Service]] presented a [[Sociopolitical typology|system of classification]] for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:

# [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[Band society|bands]] that are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]
# Tribal societies with some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige
# [[Social stratification|Stratified]] tribal societies led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] (see [[Chiefdom]])
# [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments

In his 1975 study, ''The Notion of the Tribe'', [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Morton Fried|Morton H. Fried]] provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes.  Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes.  He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Morton H. Fried (1972) ''The Notion of Tribe''.  Cummings Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]
Fried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such "secondary" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak [[leadership]]. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army.  Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called "scheduled" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form "secondary" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.

In [[meteorology]], '''visibility''' is a measure of the [[distance]] at which an object or light can be clearly discerned.  It is reported within [[surface weather observation]]s and [[METAR]] code either in [[Metre|meters]] or [[Mile#Statute mile|statute miles]], depending upon the country.  Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing and aviation. Meteorological visibility refers to transparency of air: in dark, meteorological visibility is still the same as in daylight for the same air.

==Definition==
[[File:Plane flying into clouds.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A commercial aircraft flying into the clouds over Los Angeles]]
[[ICAO]] Annex 3 ''Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation'' &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/ISS/Meetings/CT-MTDCF-ET-DRC_Geneva2008/Annex3_16ed.pdf|title=ICAO Annex 3 Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation|last=|first=|date=July 2007|website=|publisher=International Civil Aviation Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-09|edition=16th}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains the following definitions and note:
:a) the greatest distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions, situated near the ground, can be seen and recognized when observed against a bright background;
:b) the greatest distance at which lights of 1,000 [[candela]]s can be seen and identified against an unlit background.
:Note.— The two distances have different values in air of a given [[Attenuation coefficient|extinction coefficient]], and the latter b) varies with the background illumination. The former a) is represented by the meteorological optical range (MOR).
Annex 3 &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also defines [[Runway visual range|Runway Visual Range (RVR)]] as:
:The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line.

[[File:Foggy morning road - visibility at 200 ft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Fog]]gy morning road]]
[[File:Tel Aviv Carmel Panorama.jpg|thumb|240px|On clear days, Tel Aviv's skyline is visible from the Carmel mountains, 80km north]]

In extremely clean air in Arctic or mountainous areas, the visibility can be up to 160 km (100 miles) where there are large markers such as mountains or high ridges. However, visibility is often reduced somewhat by [[air pollution]] and high [[humidity]].  Various [[weather station]]s report this as [[haze]] (dry) or [[mist]] (moist).  [[Fog]] and [[smoke]] can reduce visibility to near zero, making [[driving]] extremely dangerous.  The same can happen in a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] in and near [[desert]] areas, or with [[forest fire]]s.  Heavy [[rain]] (such as from a [[thunderstorm]]) not only causes low visibility, but the inability to [[brake]] quickly due to [[Hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]].  [[Blizzard]]s and ground blizzards (blowing snow) are also defined in part by low visibility.

==Derivation==
To define visibility the case of a [[Black body|perfectly black]] object being viewed against a perfectly white background is examined. The [[Contrast (vision)|visual contrast]], ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(x), at a distance ''x'' from the black object is defined as the relative difference between the light intensity of the background and the object

&lt;math&gt;C_\text{V}(x) = \frac{F_\text{B}(x) - F(x)}{F_\text{B}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(x) and ''F''(x) are the intensities of the background and the object, respectively. Because the object is assumed to be perfectly black, it must absorb all of the light incident on it. Thus when ''x''=0 (at the object), ''F''(0) = 0 and ''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''(0) = 1.

Between the object and the observer, ''F''(x) is affected by additional light that is [[scattering|scattered]] into the observer's line of sight and the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light by gases and [[Particulate|particles]]. Light scattered by particles outside of a particular beam may ultimately contribute to the [[irradiance]] at the target, a phenomenon known as [[multiple scattering]]. Unlike absorbed light, scattered light is not lost from a system. Rather, it can change directions and contribute to other directions. It is only lost from the original beam traveling in one particular direction. The multiple scattering's contribution to the irradiance at ''x'' is modified by the individual particle scattering coefficient, the number concentration of particles, and the depth of the beam. The intensity change ''dF'' is the result of these effects over a distance ''dx''. Because ''dx'' is a measure of the amount of suspended gases and particles, the fraction of ''F'' that is diminished is assumed to be proportional to the distance, ''dx''.  The fractional reduction in ''F'' is

&lt;math&gt;dF = -b_\text{ext} F dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[attenuation coefficient]].  The scattering of background light into the observer's line of sight can increase ''F'' over the distance ''dx''.  This increase is defined as ''b' F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ''dx'', where ''b''' is a constant. The overall change in intensity is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;dF(x) = \left[b' F_\text{B}(x) - b_\text{ext} F(x)\right] dx&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; represents the background intensity, it is independent of ''x'' by definition.  Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;dF_\text{B}(x) = 0 = \left[b' F_\text{B}(x) - b_\text{ext} F_\text{B}(x)\right] dx&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear from this expression that ''b''' must be equal to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the visual contrast, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), obeys the [[Beer–Lambert law]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_\text{V}(x)}{dx} = - b_\text{ext} C_\text{V}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

which means that the contrast decreases exponentially with the distance from the object:

&lt;math&gt;C_\text{V}(x) = \exp(- b_\text{ext} x)&lt;/math&gt;

Lab experiments have determined that contrast ratios between 0.018 and 0.03 are perceptible under typical daylight viewing conditions. Usually, a contrast ratio of 2% (''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02) is used to calculate visual range. Plugging this value into the above equation and solving for ''x'' produces the following visual range expression (the Koschmieder equation):

&lt;math&gt;x_\text{V} = \frac{3.912}{b_\text{ext}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; in units of length.  At sea level, the [[Rayleigh scattering|Rayleigh atmosphere]] has an extinction coefficient of approximately 13.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at a [[wavelength]] of 520&amp;nbsp;nm.  This means that in the cleanest possible atmosphere, visibility is limited to about 296&amp;nbsp;km.

Visibility perception depends on several physical and visual factors. A realistic definition should consider the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to spatial frequencies, and then to use the Fourier transform and the contrast sensitivity
function of the HVS to assess visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Moreno|first1 = Ivan|last2 = Jauregui-Sánchez|first2 = Y.|last3 = Avendaño-Alejo|first3 = Maximino|year = 2014|title = Invisibility assessment: a visual perception approach|url = http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2014.pdf|journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A|volume = 31|issue = 10|pages = 2244–2248|doi = 10.1364/josaa.31.002244|bibcode = 2014JOSAA..31.2244M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fog, mist, haze, and freezing drizzle==
The international definition of fog is a visibility of less than {{convert|1|km|ft}}; mist is a visibility of between {{convert|1|km|mi}} and {{convert|2|km|mi}} and haze from {{convert|2|km|mi}} to {{convert|5|km|mi}}. Fog and mist are generally assumed to be composed principally of water droplets, haze and smoke can be of smaller particle size; this has implications for sensors such as Thermal Imagers (TI/FLIR) operating in the far-IR at wavelengths of about 10 μm which are better able to penetrate haze and some smokes because their particle size is smaller than the wavelength; the IR radiation is therefore not significantly deflected or absorbed by the particles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

With fog, occasional [[freezing drizzle]] and [[snow]] can occur. This usually occurs when temperatures are below 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit). Hazards can include slipping and falling on ice or slipping in your car on ice causing a potential lethal crash. Low visibility below 1000 yards is usually accompanied with this. Low lying stratus clouds are the culprit of most of these cold weather events.

==Very low visibility==
Visibility of less than {{convert|100|m|ft}} is usually reported as zero.  In these conditions, [[road]]s may be closed, or automatic warning lights and signs may be activated to warn drivers.  These have been put in place in certain areas that are subject to repeatedly low visibility, particularly after [[traffic collision]]s or  [[pile-up]]s involving multiple vehicles.

==Low visibility warnings==
In addition, an advisory is often issued by a government weather agency for low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. [[National Weather Service]].  These generally advise motorists to avoid [[travel]] until the fog dissipates or other conditions improve.  [[Airport]] travel is also often delayed by low visibility, sometimes causing long waits due to [[Instrument approach#Decision_height_or_altitude|approach visibility minimums]] and the difficulty of safely moving aircraft on the ground in low visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why fog can play havoc with your travel plans|url=http://www.newcastleairport.com.au/blog/why-fog-can-play-havoc-with-your-travel-plans#.WayUZciGOUk|website=www.newcastleairport.com.au|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project AS 07/13 - Regulation of Low Visibility Operations|url=https://www.casa.gov.au/standard-page/project-0713-regulation-low-visibility-operations?WCMS%3APWA%3A%3Apc=PC_93101|website=www.casa.gov.au|publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority|accessdate=3 September 2017|language=en|date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visibility and air pollution==
A visibility reduction is probably the most apparent symptom of [[air pollution]].  Visibility degradation is caused by the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of light by particles and gases in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. Absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by gases and particles is sometimes the cause of discolorations in the atmosphere but usually does not contribute very significantly to visibility degradation.

Scattering by particulates impairs visibility much more readily. Visibility is reduced by significant scattering from particles between an observer and a distant object. The particles scatter light from the [[sun]] and the rest of the sky through the line of sight of the observer, thereby decreasing the contrast between the object and the background sky. Particles that are the most effective at reducing visibility (per unit [[aerosol]] mass) have diameters in the range of 0.1-1.0&amp;nbsp;µm. The effect of air molecules on visibility is minor for short visual ranges but must be taken into account for ranges above 30&amp;nbsp;km.
