The '''2003 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl''' was played on December 25, 2003, in [[Honolulu]] and matched the hometown [[2003 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii Warriors]] with the [[2003 Houston Cougars football team|Houston Cougars]]. This was the second [[Hawaii Bowl]], and the first time Hawaii and Houston played each other. The game was sponsored by [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]].

==Game summary==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Houston scored first with a 34-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Kevin Kolb]] to wide receiver [[Chad McCullar]]. David Bell kicked a 21-yard field goal to increase Houston's lead to 10-0. Hawaii got its first points of the game at the end of the first quarter on a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, [[Timmy Chang]] found wide receiver [[Clifton Herbert]] for a 49-yard touchdown pass to make the score 10-10.

Running back [[Jackie Battle]] scored on a 2-yard touchdown run for Houston, as they increased their lead to 17-10. David Bell later kicked a field goal to increase the lead to 20-10. A Hawaii field goal before half time cut the lead to 20-13.

In the third quarter, running back [[Michael Brewster Jr.]] ran in for a touchdown tying the game at 20. Timmy Chang then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jason Rivers (American football)|Jason Rivers]], and Hawaii claimed its first lead of the game at 27-20. Jackie Battle scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and the score was 27-27. Jason Rivers caught a 4-yard touchdown pass to give Hawaii a 34-27 lead. In the fourth quarter, wide receiver [[Vincent Marshall]] caught an 81-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 34. The game headed into overtime.

In overtime, Timmy Chang found [[Britton Komine]] for an 11-yard touchdown and a 41-34 Hawaii lead. Houston answered with an Anthony Evans touchdown run. After one overtime period the score was 41-41. On Houston's next possession, Jackie Battle got the handoff, and rushed 4&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The score was now 48-41 Houston. Jason Rivers tied it for Hawaii, by catching a 19-yard touchdown pass. In the third overtime period, Michael Brewster ran in for an 8-yard touchdown. The [[two-point conversion]] attempt failed leaving the score 54-48 Hawaii, and giving Houston a chance to win. Houston couldn't score, and that ended up being the final margin.

The game is also memorable for a fight between both teams that occurred after the game was over. Players from each team got into shouting matches and punches were thrown. Play-by-play announcer Dave Barnett called the ending sad and surprising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6020">An '''accident''', in [[philosophy]], is an attribute that may or may not belong to a subject, without affecting its essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=William Keith Chambers|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|pages=148|isbn=978-0-521-38760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other [[Catholic]] theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. 

In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts:  property and [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. [[Non-essentialism]] argues that every property is an accident. Modal [[necessitarianism]] argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.

==Aristotle ==
{{see also|Potentiality and actuality}}
[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|others=Richard J. Blackwell, Richard J. Spath, W. Edmund Thirlkel|title=Commentary on Aristotle's Physics|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|pages=29|isbn=978-1-84371-545-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CD0IRPg4roC&amp;pg=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the [[essence]] of the thing being described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/aristotle/section6.rhtml|title=Aristotle - Metaphysics: Books Zeta and Eta|publisher=SparkNotes|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218210927/http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/aristotle/section6.rhtml| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/|title=Aristotle on Non-contradiction|date=2007-02-02|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preus|first=Anthony |author2=John P. Anton|author3=George L. Kustas|title=Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy V|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-7914-1027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is a necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.

The nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion ("being acted on"). Together with "substance", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] of Aristotle's [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/433/catlec.htm|title=Predication and Ontology: The Categories|publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic church|Catholic]] theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist#Roman Catholic|Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or ''species'') of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the [[Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]].

== Modern philosophy ==
In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: [[Property (philosophy)|property]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek ''symbebekos'')&lt;ref name="Slomkowski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomkowski|first=Paul|title=Aristotle's Topics|publisher=BRILL|year=1997|pages=90–93|isbn=978-90-04-10757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at its most basic level a ''property''. The color "[[yellow]]", "high value", "Atomic Number 79" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, "[[gold]]", "[[platinum]]", and "[[electrum]]" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.

There are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:
*[[Non-essentialism|Anti-essentialism]] (associated with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) argues that there are no essential properties at all, and therefore every property is an accident.
*Modal [[necessitarianism]] (associated with [[Saul Kripke]]), argues for the veracity of the modal system "Triv" (If P is true, then P must be true). The consequence of this theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9315">'''Address munging''' is the practice of disguising
an [[e-mail address]] to prevent it from being automatically collected by  unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. 
Address munging is intended to disguise an e-mail address in a way that prevents computer software from seeing the real address, or even any address at all, but still allows a human reader to reconstruct the original and contact the author: an email address such as, "&lt;nowiki&gt;no-one@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;", becomes "no-one at example dot com", for instance.

Any e-mail address posted in public is likely to be automatically collected by [[computer software]] used by bulk emailers (a process known as [[e-mail address harvesting|e-mail address scavenging]]). Addresses posted on [[webpage]]s, [[Usenet]] or [[chat rooms]] are particularly vulnerable to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm Email Address Harvesting: How Spammers Reap What You Sow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424083903/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm |date=April 24, 2006 }}, Federal Trade Commission. URL accessed on 24 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a [[mailing list]] that is [[archive]]d and made available via the [[world wide web|web]], or passed onto a [[Usenet]] [[news server]] and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.

==Disadvantages==
Disguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send [[electronic mail|e-mail]] to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of [[e-mail spam]], at the expense of causing problems for innocent users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interhack.net/pubs/munging-harmful/ Address Munging Considered Harmful], Matt Curtin&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.

The use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.&lt;ref&gt;See Usenet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection. For example, such addresses can be revealed through a simple [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22at+*+dot%22 Google Search].

Any impediment reduces the user's willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained [[e-mail filtering]] on the user's end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100 percent immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.

For commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with [[CAPTCHA]] fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring exactly the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.

== Alternatives ==
As an alternative to address munging, there are several "transparent" techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:

* "Transparent name mangling" involves replacing characters in the address with equivalent HTML references from the [[list of XML and HTML character entity references]], e.g. the '@' gets replaced by either 'U+0040' or '&amp;amp;#64; and the '.' gets replaced by either 'U+002E'or '&amp;amp;#46;' with the user knowing to take out the dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crans.org/~raffo/email-munging.php|first=Daniele|last=Raffo|title=Email Munging|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=12 February 2015|website=Daniele Raffo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting all or part of the e-mail address as an image,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidden-email.com/ E-mail as an image]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, no-one[[File:At sign.svg|15px|@|link=]]example.com, where the at sign is disguised as an image, sometimes with the [[alt attribute|alternative text]] specified as "@" to allow copy-and-paste, but while altering the address to remain outside of typical [[regular expression]]s of spambots.
* Using a client-side form with the e-mail address as a CSS3 animated [[ASCII art|text logo]] captcha and shrinking it to normal size using inline [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=120792 Client-side contact form generator] (the generator requires JavaScript enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#Web technology support|CSS]])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting an e-mail address with the order of characters jumbled and restoring the order using CSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bithack.se/pub/ PHP jumbler tool] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091755/http://bithack.se/pub/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Building the link by [[client-side scripting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamstop.org/spamtools/email JavaScript address script generator] (the generator requires [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#JavaScript support|javascript]] enabled)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[client-side scripting]] to produce a multi key email address encrypter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonvanhattum.com.br/email_encrypter.php|first=Ton van|last=Hattum|title=Email Address on Your Site, SPAM Protection, Encrypting|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=22 February 2017|website=Ton van Hattum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[server-side scripting]] to run a contact form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addressmunger.com/contact_form_generator PHP contact form generator]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of munging "&lt;nowiki&gt;user@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;" via client-side scripting would be:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
 &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var name = 'user';
 var at = '@';
 var domain = 'example.com';
 document.write(name + at + domain);
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using [[screen reader]]s and users with disabilities,
and ignores users of text browsers like [[lynx (web browser)|lynx]] and [[w3m]], although being transparent means they don't disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.

According to a 2003 study by the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], even the simplest "transparent name mangling" of e-mail addresses can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamhelp.org/articles/030319spamreport.pdf "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] accessed 2016-09-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218222622/http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml |date=December 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Common methods of disguising addresses include:

{| class="wikitable"
!Disguised address
!Recovering the original address
|-
|no-one at example (dot) com
|Replace " at " with "@", and " (dot) " with "."
|-
|no-one@elpmaxe.com.invalid
|Reverse [[domain name]]: ''elpmaxe'' to ''example''&lt;br&gt;remove [[.invalid]]
|-
|moc.elpmaxe@eno-on
|Reverse the entire address
|-
|no-one@exampleREMOVEME.com
|Instructions in the address itself; remove REMOVEME.
|-
|no-one@exampleNOSPAM.com.invalid
|Remove NOSPAM and [[.invalid]] from the address.
|-
|n o - o n e @ e x a m p l e . c o m
|This is still readable, but the spaces between letters stop most automatic spambots.
|-
|no-one&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;example&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;com (as HTML)
|This is still readable and can be copied directly from webpages,&lt;br&gt;but stops many email harvesters.

'''Antifeminism''' (also spelt '''anti-feminism''') is broadly defined as opposition to some or all forms of [[feminism]]. This opposition has taken various forms across time and cultures. For example, antifeminists in the late 19th century and early 20th century resisted [[women's suffrage]], while antifeminists in the late 20th century in the [[United States]] opposed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Lynne E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVtFJ5tvINsC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1032-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux" /&gt; Others, particularly in the 21st century, see antifeminism as a response to an ideology rooted in hostility towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/30/how-anti-feminism-is-shaping-world-politics/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3b1021768c79 |title= How anti-feminism is shaping world politics  |work = Washington  Post |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/anti-feminist-youtuber-sydney-watson-launces-march-for-men-in-melbourne.html |title= 'Anti-feminist' YouTuber Sydney Watson launches March for Men in Melbourne  |work =News hub |accessdate=October 25, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K.J., Kanner, M. and Elsayegh, N.

== Overview ==
Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] argues that an antifeminist ideology rejects at least one of the following general principles of feminism:

#That [[sociology of gender|social arrangements]] among men and women are neither natural nor divinely determined.
#That social arrangements among men and women [[patriarchy|favor men.]]
#That there are collective actions that can and should be taken to transform these arrangements into more just and equitable arrangements, such as those in the timelines of [[timeline of women's suffrage|woman's suffrage]] and [[timeline of women's rights (other than voting)|other rights]].&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;[[Kenneth Clatterbaugh|Clatterbaugh, Kenneth]] (2007), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;pg=PA21 Anti-feminism]", in {{cite book|editor-last1=Flood |editor-first1=Michael | editor-last2 = Kegan Gardiner | editor-first2 = Judith |editor-last3= Pease |editor-first3= Bob | editor-last4 = Pringle | editor-first4 = Keith | editor-link1 = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | pages = 21&amp;ndash;22 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415333436 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian sociologists Melissa Blais and Francis Dupuis-Déri write that antifeminist thought has primarily taken the form of an extreme version of [[masculism|masculinism]], in which "men are in crisis because of the feminization of society".&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blais|first1=Melissa|last2=Francis Dupuis-Déri|first2=Francis |title=Masculinism and the antifeminist countermovement |journal=Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest |volume=11 |issue=1|pages=21&amp;ndash;39|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''antifeminist'' is also used{{By whom|date=September 2017}} to describe public female figures, some of whom (such as [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Camille Paglia]], and [[Katie Roiphe|Kate Roiphe]]) define themselves as feminists, based on their opposition to some or all elements of feminist movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Rhonda|title=Anti‐feminists as media celebrities |journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies |volume=22 |issue=3|pages=207&amp;ndash;222 |doi=10.1080/1071441000220303|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists label writers such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Katie Roiphe]] and [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] with this term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Stacey | first = Judith | title = Is academic feminism an oxymoron? | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 1189&amp;ndash;1194 | doi = 10.1086/495543 | date = Summer 2000 | jstor = 3175510 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamarck Minnich | first = Elizabeth | title = Feminist attacks on feminisms: patriarchy's prodigal daughters  | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 159&amp;ndash;175 | doi = 10.2307/3178629  | date = Spring 1998 | jstor = 3178629 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their positions regarding oppression and lines of thought within feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Jervis | editor-first1 = Lisa | editor-last2 = Zeisler | editor-first2 = Andi | title = BITCHfest : ten years of cultural criticism from the pages of Bitch magazine | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780374113438 }} (Foreword by Margaret Cho.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of antifeminism has varied across time and cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, like those in the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]], campaigned against women's suffrage.

Men's studies scholar [[Michael Kimmel]] defines antifeminism as "the opposition to women's equality". He says that antifeminists oppose "women's entry into the public sphere, the re-organization of the private sphere, women's control of their bodies, and women's rights generally." Kimmel further writes that antifeminist argumentation relies on "religious and cultural norms" while proponents of antifeminism advance their cause as a means of "'saving' masculinity from pollution and invasion". He argues that antifeminists consider the "traditional gender division of labor as natural and inevitable, perhaps also divinely sanctioned."&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;

== Antifeminist stances ==
Some antifeminists view feminism as a denial of innate [[Sex differences in psychology|differences between the genders]], and an attempt to reprogram people against their biological tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Jean (1996), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfYSzwWrBbYC&amp;pg=PA10 The case for feminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Leahy | editor-first = Michael P.T. | title = The liberation debate: rights at issue | page = 10 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | isbn = 9780415116947 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists also frequently argue that feminism, despite claiming to espouse equality, ignores rights issues unique to men. Some believe that the [[feminist movement]] has achieved its aims and now seeks higher status for women than for men via special rights and exemptions, such as female-only scholarships, affirmative action, and gender quotas.&lt;ref name="(Wattenberg, B 1994)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wattenberg | first = Ben |title=Has feminism gone too far? | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145104/http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| archive-date= 13 October 2006 |url=http://www.menweb.org/paglsomm.htm| deadurl= no |accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=MenWeb |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(Pizzey, E 1999)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pizzey | first = Erin | author-link = Erin Pizzey |title=How the women's movement taught women to hate men | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060926183932/http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | archive-date= 26 September 2006 |url= http://www.fathersforlife.org/pizzey/how_women_were_taught_to_hate_men.htm | deadurl= no |publisher=Fathers for Life|year=1999 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(JSC 2006)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Shaw Crouse | first = Janice | title = What Friedan wrought | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427170136/http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | archive-date = 27 April 2006 | url = http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/articledisplay.asp?id=10088&amp;department=BLI&amp;categoryid=dotcommentary | publisher = Concerned Women for America | date = 7 February 2006 | accessdate = 30 September 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or conservative religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Murli (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUPhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Feminism and policy approaches for gender aware development]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Desai | editor-first = Murli | title = The paradigm of international social development: ideologies, development systems and policy approaches | page = 119 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781135010256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barthalow Koch, Patricia (2004), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA1163 Feminism and sexuality in the United States]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Francoeur | editor-first1 = Robert T. | editor-last2 = Noonan | editor-first2 = Raymond J. | title = The Continuum complete international encyclopedia of sexuality | page = 1163 | publisher = Continuum | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780199754700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaggar, Alison (1983), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xVI6ZYDkDSYC&amp;pg=PA75 Traditional Marxism and human nature]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Jaggar | editor-first = Alison | title = Feminist politics and human | page = 75 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Allanheld | location = Totowa, N.J | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780710806536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ubiquity of [[casual sex]] and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kassian | first = Mary A. | title = The feminist mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781581345704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lukas | first = Carrie L. | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, MD | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these traditionalists oppose women's entry [[Women in the workforce|into the workforce]], [[Women in government|political office]], and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Busch | first = Elizabeth Kaufer | contribution = Women against liberation | editor-last1 = Busch | editor-first1 = Elizabeth Kaufer | editor-last2 = Lawler | editor-first2 = Peter Augustine | title = Democracy reconsidered | page = 242 | publisher = Lexington Books | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780739124819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals. For example, [[Paul Gottfried]] maintains that the change of women's roles "has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family" and contributed to a "descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos".&lt;ref name="(Gottfried, Paul 2002)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gottfried |first = Paul|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/|title=The trouble with feminism|accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=LewRockwell.com|date=21 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Antisuffragists.jpg|thumb|American antisuffragists in the early 20th century]]

=== 19th century ===
The "women's movement" began in 1848, most famously articulated by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], asking for voting rights and many other rights, such as education, job liberties, marital and property rights, and the right to choose whether to be a mother or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]] (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Irp3sOCk5cUC&amp;pg=PA69 Backlashes then and now]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Faludi | editor-first = Susan | editor-link = Susan Faludi | title = Backlash: the undeclared war against women | page = 69 | publisher = Vintage | location = London | isbn = 9781409043447 | date = 2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chafetz |first= Janet |last2= Dworkin |first2= Anthony | title = In the face of threat: organized antifeminism in comparative perspective | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001001003 | jstor = 190086 | date = March 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a "crisis of masculinity"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = Men's responses to feminism at the turn of the century | journal = [[Gender and Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 261&amp;ndash;283 | doi = 10.1177/089124387001003003 | jstor = 189564 | date = September 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist. The men who believed in this model cited religious models and natural law to emphasize women's need to return to the private sphere, in order to separate men and women to keep women from outwardly challenging men in public.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 19th century, one of the major focal points of antifeminism was opposition to [[women's suffrage]], which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dolton | first = Patricia F. | title = The alert collector: women's suffrage movement | journal = [[Reference and User Services Quarterly]] | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 31&amp;ndash;36 | doi = 10.5860/rusq.54n2.31 | date = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddux"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Maddux | first = Kristy | title = When patriots protest: the anti-suffrage discursive transformation of 1917 | journal = Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 283&amp;ndash;310 | doi = 10.1353/rap.2005.0012 | date = Fall 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. In ''Sex in Education: or, a Fair Chance for the Girls'' (1873), Harvard professor Edward Clarke predicted that if women went to college, their brains would grow bigger and heavier, and their wombs would atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Edward H. | title = Sex in education |pages=29, 55 | publisher = Wildside Press | location = Rockville, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780809501700 }} [https://books.google.com/?id=_MceYURa3VcC Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other antifeminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;[[Kenneth Clatterbaugh|Clatterbaugh, Kenneth]] (2004), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-57607-774-0 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-family movement appeared in the late 19th century, by about 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = Michele | title = Women's rights and wedding bells: 19th-century pro-family rhetoric and (re)enforcement of the gender status quo| journal = [[Journal of Family Issues]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 501&amp;ndash;528 | doi = 10.1177/0192513X06297465 | date = April 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was intended to halt the rising divorce rate and reinforce traditional family values. The National League for the Protection of the Family, formerly known as the Divorce Reform League, took over the movement in 1881.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Henderson | first = C. R. | title = Reviews: ''The Report of the National League for the Protection of the Family'' | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | page = 705 | doi = 10.1086/210751 | date = March 1898 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Warren Dike|Samuel Dike]] was one of the founders of the League, and was considered an early expert on divorce. Through his efforts, the League garnered attention from pro-family advocates. It underwent a shift from fighting against divorce to promoting marriage and traditional family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speaking on behalf of the League in an 1887 address to the Evangelical Alliance Conference, Samuel Dike described the ideal family as having "one man and one woman, united in wedlock, together with their children".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This movement built the foundation for many pro-family arguments in contemporary antifeminism.

=== Early 20th century ===
Women's suffrage was achieved in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. [[Anna Howard Shaw]], president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working under the influence of male forces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thurner | first = Manuela | title = "Better citizens without the ballot": American antisuffrage women and their rationale during the progressive era | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 33&amp;ndash;60 | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0279 | date = Spring 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arguments employed by antisuffragists at the turn of the century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.

There were two reasons antisuffragists opposed women participating in the political realm. Some argued that women were already overburdened. The majority of them, however, argued that a woman's participation in the political realm would hinder her participation in social and civic duties. If they won the right to vote, women would consequently have to align with a particular party, which would destroy her ability to be politically neutral. Antisuffragists feared this would, in fact, hinder their influence with legislative authorities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mid 20th century ===
In 1951, two journalists published ''Washington Confidential.'' The novel claimed that Communist leaders used their men and women to recruit a variety of minorities in the nation's capital, such as females, colored males, and homosexual males. The vast popularity of the book caused such a buzz that the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]] had to create a "publicity campaign to improve the image of federal employees"&lt;ref name="Storrs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Storrs | first = Landon R.Y. | title = Attacking the Washington "Femmocracy": antifeminism in the Cold War Campaign against "Communists in Government" | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–152 | doi = 10.2307/20459124 | jstor = 20459124 | date = Spring 2007  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in hopes to save their federal employees from losing their jobs. This ploy failed once the journalists linked feminism to communism in their novel and ultimately reinforced antifeminism by implying that defending the "white, Christian, heterosexual, patriarchal family" was the only way to oppose communism.&lt;ref name=Storrs /&gt;

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ====
The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a perennially proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would grant equal rights and opportunities to every citizen of the United States, regardless of his or her sex. In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", making it unacceptable to ERA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Alice (November 1972 and May 1973)|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment (''interview with Amelia R.

A new section to the ERA was added, stating: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." That is, women could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. By 1972, the amendment was supported by both major parties and was immensely popular. However, it was defeated in Congress when it failed to get the vote of thirty-eight legislatures by 1982.&lt;ref name="Burris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Burris | first = Val | title = Who opposed the ERA? An analysis of the social bases of antifeminism | journal = [[Social Science Quarterly]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;317 | date = June 1983 | jstor = 42874034 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia Ellen (1989), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXlSB6-WpKUC&amp;pg=PA31 "Reasonable distinctions": an alternative to the ERA]", in {{cite book |editor-last= Harrison | editor-first = Cynthia Ellen|title= On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968 |publisher=University of California Press| location = Berkeley|pages=31&amp;ndash;32|isbn=9780520061217| year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Himmelstein identified two main theories about the appeal of antifeminism and its role in opposition to the ERA. One theory is that it was a clash between upper-class liberal voters and the older, more conservative lower-class rural voters who often serve as the center for right-wing movements; in other words, this theory identifies particular social classes as more inherently friendly to antifeminism. Another theory holds that women who feel vulnerable and dependent on men are likely to oppose anything that threatens that tenuous stability; under this view, while educated, independent career women may support feminism, housewives who lack such resources are more drawn to antifeminism. Himmelstein, however, says both views are at least partially wrong, arguing that the primary dividing line between feminists and antifeminists is cultural rather than stemming from differences in economic and social status.&lt;ref name=Himmelstein&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Himmelstein | first = Jerome | title = The social basis of antifeminism: Religious networks and culture | journal = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;15 | doi = 10.2307/1386059 | jstor = 1386059 | date = March 1986 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, in fact, similarities between income between activists on both sides of the ERA debate.

Val Burris, meanwhile, says that high-income men opposed the amendment because they would gain the least with it being passed; that those men had the most to lose, since the ratification of the ERA would mean more competition for their jobs and possibly a lowered self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Because of the support of antifeminism from conservatives and the constant "conservative reactions to liberal social politics", such as the New Deal attacks, the attack on the ERA has been called a "right-wing backlash".&lt;ref name=Burris /&gt; Their methods include actions such as "insults proffered in emails or on the telephone, systematic denigration of feminism in the media, Internet disclosure of confidential information (e.g. addresses) on resources for battered women"&lt;ref name="Blais &amp; Dupuis-Déri" /&gt; and more.

==== Abortion ====
Abortion remains one of the most controversial topics in the United States. ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was passed in 1973, and abortion was utilized by many antifeminists to rally supporters. [[Anti-abortion movements|Antiabortion views]] helped further several right-wing movements, including explicit antifeminism, and helped right-wing politicians rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollack Petchesky|first=Rosalind | title = Antiabortion, antifeminism, and the rise of the new right | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 206&amp;ndash;246 | doi = 10.2307/3177522| date = Summer 1981 | ref = harv | postscript = .|jstor=3177522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffe|first=Carole|title=Abortion and antifeminism|journal= [[Politics &amp; Society]] | volume=15|issue=2|pages=207&amp;ndash;211 |doi=10.1177/003232928701500206 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiabortion writings, as well as conservative commentary in the late 20th century criticized the selfishness and self-centeredness of the feminist movement regarding abortions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Some current antifeminist practices can be traced back to the rise of the religious right in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  [[BBC]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', among others, have covered the 2014 social media trend [[Women Against Feminism|#WomenAgainstFeminism]].

British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the website [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] have also reported on an increasing number of women and female celebrities rejecting feminism and instead subscribing to [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardy |first1=Elle |last2=Lehmann |first2=Claire |last3=Jha |first3=Trisha |last4=Matthewson |first4=Paula |title=Am I a feminist?

In response to the social media trend, modern day feminists also began to upload similar pictures to websites such as Twitter and Tumblr. Most used the same hashtag, "womenagainstfeminism", but instead made satirical and bluntly parodic comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chang | first = Charis |title=#WomenAgainstFeminism goes viral as people explain why they don't need feminism anymore | url = http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/womenagainstfeminism-goes-viral-as-people-explain-why-they-dont-need-feminism-anymore/story-fnixwvgh-1227010590106 | work = [[news.com.au]] |accessdate= August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, ''Time'' magazine included "feminist" on its annual list of proposed banished words.

== Organizations ==
[[File:STOP ERA.gif|thumb|Symbol used for signs and buttons by ERA opponents]]

Founded in the U.S. by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] in 1972, Stop ERA, now known as "[[Eagle Forum]]", lobbied successfully to block the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name="wse2"&gt;Tierney, Helen (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DkPFL6XcKeQC&amp;pg=PA95 Antifeminist movements]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tierney | editor-first = Helen | title = Women's studies encyclopedia: A–F | page=95 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780861721122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Schlafly who forged links between Stop ERA and other conservative organizations, as well as single-issue groups against abortion, pornography, gun control, and unions. By integrating Stop ERA with the thus-dubbed "[[new right]]", she was able to leverage a wider range of technological, organizational and political resources, successfully targeting pro-feminist candidates for defeat.&lt;ref name="wse2" /&gt;

In India, the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]] is an antifeminist organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basu | first = Srimati | title = Playing off courts: the negotiation of divorce and violence in plural legal settings in Kolkata | journal = [[Journal of Legal Pluralism|The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law]] | volume = 38 | issue = 52 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;75 | doi = 10.1080/07329113.2006.10756591 | date = 2006 | ref = harv | postscript = .| citeseerx = 10.1.1.485.7052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed to a number of laws that they claim to have been used against men.&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni, Mangesh (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 Critical masculinity studies in India]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dasgupta | editor-first1 = Rohit K. | editor-last2 = Gokulsing | editor-first2 = K.

The [[Concerned Women for America|Concerned Women of America (CWA)]] are also an antifeminist organization. Like other conservative women's groups, they oppose [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and make appeals for maternalism and biological differences between women and men.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schreiber | first = Ronnee | title = Righting feminism: conservative women and American politics | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195331813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber|first=Ronnee | title = Injecting a woman's voice: Conservative women's organizations, gender consciousness, and the expression of women's policy preferences | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 47 | issue = 7&amp;ndash;8 | pages = 331&amp;ndash;341 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021479030885 | date = October 2002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Women's Forum]] (IWF) is another antifeminist, conservative, women-oriented group. It's younger and less established than the CWA, though the two organizations are often discussed in relation to each other. It was founded to take on the "old feminist establishment".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both of these organizations pride themselves on rallying women who do not identify with [[feminist rhetoric]] together. These organizations frame themselves as being by women, for women, in order to fight the idea that feminism is the only women-oriented ideology. These organizations chastise feminists for presuming to universally speak for all women. The IWF claims to be "the voice of ''reasonable'' women with important ideas who embrace common sense over divisive ideology".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[alt-right]] movement is antifeminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Liam|title=Alt-right, alt-left, antifa: a glossary of extremist language|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html|date=15 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date = 26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
According to [[Amherst College]] sociology professor Jerome L. Himmelstein, antifeminism is rooted in social stigmas against feminism and is thus a purely reactionary movement. Himmelstein identifies two prevailing theories that seek to explain the origins of antifeminism: the first theory, proposed by Himmelstein, is that conservative opposition in the [[abortion]] and [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) debates has created a climate of hostility toward the entire feminist movement.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; The second theory Himmelstein identifies states that the female antifeminists who lead the movement are largely married, low education, and low personal income women who embody the "insecure housewife scenario" and seek to perpetuate their own situation in which women depend on men for fiscal support. However, numerous studies have failed to correlate the aforementioned demographic factors with support for antifeminism, and only religiosity correlates positively with antifeminist alignment.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein" /&gt; Thus, Himmelstein concludes that antifeminism is a conservative religious reaction against the progress of modern feminism.

Authors Janet Saltzman Chafetz and Anthony Gary Dworkin, writing for ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]'', argue that the organizations most likely to formally organize against feminism are religious. This is because women's movements may demand access to male-dominated positions within the religious sector, like the clergy, and women's movements threaten male-oriented values of some religions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The more successful a feminist movement is in challenging the authority of male-dominated groups, the more these groups will organize a countermovement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] sociology professor Danielle Giffort argues that the stigma against feminism created by antifeminists has resulted in organizations that practice "implicit feminism", which she defines as the "strategy practiced by feminist activists within organizations that are operating in an anti- and [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] environment in which they conceal feminist identities and ideas while emphasizing the more socially acceptable angles of their efforts".&lt;ref name=Giffort&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giffort | first = Danielle M. | title = Show or tell? Feminist dilemmas and implicit feminism at girls' rock camp | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 569–588 | doi = 10.1177/0891243211415978 | jstor = 23044173 | date = October 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the stigma against feminism, some activists, such as those involved with [[Rock and Roll Camp for Girls|Girls Rock]], may take the principles of feminism as a foundation of thought and teach girls and women independence and self-reliance without explicitly labeling it with the stigmatized brand of feminism. Thus, most women continue to practice feminism in terms of seeking equality and independence for women, yet avoid the label.&lt;ref name=Giffort /&gt;

==Motivations==
Antifeminism might be motivated by the belief that feminist theories of [[patriarchy]] and disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or exaggerated;&lt;ref name="flood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; that feminism as a movement encourages [[misandry]] and results in harm or oppression of men; or driven by general opposition towards [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blee, Kathleen M. (1998), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d9lhBw8t410C&amp;pg=PA32 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Mankiller | editor-first1 = Wilma | editor-last2 = et al | title = The reader's companion to U.S. women's history | page = 32 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Co | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780395671733 }}
*"The two major waves of antifeminist activity coincide with the two waves of the women's rights movement: the campaign to secure female suffrage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the feminist movement of the late twentieth century. In both periods, those holding a traditional view of women's place in the home and family tried to advance their cause by joining with other conservative groups to forestall efforts to extend women's rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mertz, Thomas J. (2005), "[https://archive.org/stream/NewDictionaryOfTheHistoryOfIdeas/New%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20History%20of%20Ideas%202005_djvu.txt Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cline Horowitz | editor-first = Maryanne | title = New dictionary of the history of ideas / Vol. 1, Abolitionism to Common sense | pages = 94&amp;ndash;98 | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780684313788 }}
*"Antifeminism, then, repudiates critiques of male supremacy and resists efforts to eliminate it (often accompanied by dismissal of the idea that change is possible). Note that this definition of antifeminism limits its reference to reactions against critiques of gender-based hierarchies and efforts to relieve the oppression of women."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Angela Marie (2008), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA115 Antifeminism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Bonnie G. | title = The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history / Vol. 1, Abayomi to Czech Republic | pages = 115&amp;ndash;119 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | isbn = 9780195148909 | year = 2008 }}
*"Reform activity that challenged either the subordination of women to men or the patriarchal limitation of women's status provoked an antifeminist response that included an intellectual and political campaign to halt progress toward women's rights and equality."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 126 American students, antifeminist men were found to value their own power more than nonfeminist or feminist men did. Antifeminist women were not found to have the same difference from other women, suggesting some men may oppose feminism because they fear losing their power or sense of power in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first= Lori J. |last2=Shanahan |first2=Sandra B. |last3=Olivetti |first3=Jennifer | title = Power, empowerment, and equality: evidence for the motives of feminists, nonfeminists, and antifeminists | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 37 | issue = 3&amp;ndash;4 | pages = 227&amp;ndash;247 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025699828057 | date = August 1997 | ref = harv | quote = "Men may focus on feminism as an issue of power simply because of the position they have traditionally held in society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Apparent infection rate''' is an estimate of the rate of progress of a disease, based on proportional measures of the extent of infection at different times.

Firstly, a proportional measure of the extent of infection is chosen as the disease extent metric. For example, the metric might be the proportion of leaf area affected by mildew, or the proportion of plants in a population showing dieback lesions. Measures of disease extent are then taken over time, and a [[mathematical model]] is fit. The model is based upon two assumptions:
* the progress of the infection is constrained by the amount of tissue that remains to be infected; and
* if it were not so constrained, the extent of infection would exhibit [[exponential growth]].

There is a single model parameter&amp;nbsp;''r'', which is the apparent infection rate. It can be calculated analytically using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{t_2-t_1} \log_e \left [ \frac{x_2 (1-x_1)}{x_1 (1-x_2)} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''r'' is the apparent infection rate
:''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the time of the first measurement
:''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the time of the second measurement
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of infection measured at time ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of infection measured at time ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

[[File:Human losses of world war two by country.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Example of a bar chart.]]
A '''bar chart''' or '''bar graph''' is a chart or graph that presents [[Categorical variable|categorical data]] with [[Rectangle|rectangular]] bars with [[height]]s or [[length]]s proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.  A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a '''line graph'''.

A bar graph shows comparisons among [[discrete variable|discrete]] [[categorical variable|categories]]. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.

==History==

Many sources consider [[William Playfair]] (1759-1824) to have invented the bar chart and the ''Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781'' graph from his ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'' to be the first bar chart in history.  Diagrams of the velocity of a constantly accelerating object against time published in ''The Latitude of Forms'' (attributed to Jacobus de Sancto Martino or, perhaps, to [[Nicole Oresme]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett | date = 1968 | title = Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions | publisher = Univ. of Wisconsin Press | place = Madison | pages = 85–99 | isbn = 0-299-04880-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 300 years before can be interpreted as "proto bar charts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beniger | first = James R. | author-link = James R.

== Usage ==
Bar charts have a discrete domain of categories, and are usually scaled so that all the data can fit on the chart. When there is no natural ordering of the categories being compared, bars on the chart may be arranged in any order. Bar charts arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called Pareto charts. 
Bar graphs/charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data.&lt;ref name=KD&gt;Kelley, W. M.; Donnelly, R. A. (2009) ''The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems''. New York, NY: Alpha Books {{ISBN|1592578659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Categorical data is a grouping of data into discrete groups, such as months of the year, age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually qualitative. In a column bar chart, the categories appear along the horizontal axis; the height of the bar corresponds to the value of each category.

===Grouped and Stacked===
Bar graphs can also be used for more complex comparisons of data with grouped bar charts and stacked bar charts.&lt;ref name=KD/&gt; In a '''grouped bar chart''', for each categorical group there are two or more bars.  These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping.  For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue.  
Alternatively, a '''stacked bar chart''' could be used.  The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other.  The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, stacked bar charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable.

Grouped bar graphs usually present the information in the same order in each grouping. Stacked bar graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar.

The '''boulevard rule''' is a principle in [[United States]] [[traffic law]] which states that the driver of a vehicle entering a highway from a smaller road or entrance (called the ''unfavored driver'') must stop and yield the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]] to all oncoming highway traffic (the ''favored drivers'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule often comes into play in [[road accident]] cases, when a court must determine if a driver is [[Negligence|negligent]] in causing a collision, due to his breach of the [[duty of care]] imposed by the rule on the unfavored driver.

[[Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;Md. Transportation Code § 21-403&lt;/ref&gt; is among the [[U.S. state]]s which follow this rule, but not all states have similar provisions in [[statute]]s or [[case law]]. [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Vehicle &amp; Traffic Code § 1143&lt;/ref&gt; applies the rule to traffic entering public roads from private driveways or alleys, but not where public roads intersect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5937">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a (left) '''Bousfield localization''' of a [[model category]] replaces the model structure with another model structure with the same cofibrations but with more weak equivalences.

Bousfield localization is named after [[Aldridge Bousfield]], who first introduced this technique in the context of localization of topological spaces and spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge Bousfield, ''[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT9580/v12/undervisningsmateriale/bousfield-topology-1979.pdf The localization of spectra with respect to homology]'', Topology vol 18 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge Bousfield, ''The localization of spaces with respect to homology'', Topology vol. 14 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model category structure of the Bousfield localization==
Given a [[class (mathematics)|class]] ''C'' of morphisms in a model category ''M'' the left Bousfield localization is a new model structure on the same category as before. Its equivalences, cofibrations and fibrations, respectively, are
* the ''C''-local equivalences
* the original cofibrations of ''M''
and (necessarily, since cofibrations and weak equivalences determine the fibrations)
* the maps having the [[right lifting property]] with respect to the cofibrations in ''M'' which are also ''C''-local equivalences.
In this definition, a ''C''-local equivalence is a map &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; which, roughly speaking, does not make a difference when mapping to a ''C''-local object. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;f^* : map (Y, W) \to map (X, W)&lt;/math&gt;
is required to be a weak equivalence (of [[simplicial set]]s) for any ''C''-local object ''W''. An object ''W'' is called ''C''-local if it is fibrant (in ''M'') and 
:&lt;math&gt;s^* : map (B, W) \to map (A, W)&lt;/math&gt;
is a weak equivalence for ''all'' maps &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''. The notation &lt;math&gt;map(-, -)&lt;/math&gt; is, for a general model category (not necessarily [[enriched category|enriched]] over simplicial sets) a certain simplicial set whose set of [[path component]]s agrees with morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] of ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_0 (map(X, Y)) = Hom_{Ho(M)}(X, Y).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'' is a simplicial model category (such as, say, simplicial sets or topological spaces), then "map" above can be taken to be the derived simplicial mapping space of ''M''.

This description does not make any claim about the existence of this model structure, for which see below.

Dually, there is a notion of ''right Bousfield localization'', whose definition is obtained by replacing cofibrations by fibrations (and reversing directions of all arrows).

==Existence==
The left Bousfield localization model structure, as described above, is known to exist in various situations, provided that ''C'' is a set:
* ''M'' is left proper (i.e., the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is again a weak equivalence) and combinatorial
* ''M'' is left proper and cellular.
Combinatoriality and cellularity of a model category guarantee, in particular, a strong control over the cofibrations of ''M''.

Similarly, the right Bousfield localization exists if ''M'' is right proper and cellular or combinatorial and C is a set.

==Universal property==
The [[localization of a category|localization]] &lt;math&gt;C[W^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; of an (ordinary) category ''C'' with respect to a class ''W'' of morphisms satisfies the following universal property:
* There is a functor &lt;math&gt;C \to C[W^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; which sends all morphisms in ''W'' to isomorphisms.
* Any functor &lt;math&gt;C \to D&lt;/math&gt; that sends ''W'' to isomorphisms in ''D'' factors uniquely over the previously mentioned functor.

The Bousfield localization is the appropriate analogous notion for model categories, keeping in mind that isomorphisms in ordinary category theory are replaced by weak equivalences. That is, the (left) Bousfield localization &lt;math&gt;L_C M&lt;/math&gt; is such that
* There is a [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen]] functor &lt;math&gt;M \to L_C M&lt;/math&gt; whose left derived functor sends all morphisms in ''C'' to weak equivalences.
* Any left Quillen functor &lt;math&gt;M \to N&lt;/math&gt; whose left derived functor sends ''C'' to weak equivalences factors uniquely through &lt;math&gt;M\to L_C M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

===Localization and completion of a spectrum===
Localization and completion of a spectrum at a prime number ''p'' are both examples of Bousfield localization, resulting in a [[local spectrum]]. For example, localizing the [[sphere spectrum]] ''S'' at ''p'', one obtains a [[local sphere]] &lt;math&gt;S_{(p)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stable model structure on spectra===
The [[stable homotopy category]] is the homotopy category (in the sense of model categories) of spectra, endowed with the stable model structure. The stable model structure is obtained as a left Bousfield localization of the level (or projective) model structure on spectra, whose weak equivalences (fibrations) are those maps which are weak equivalences (fibrations, respectively) in all levels.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hovey, ''[http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0402/ Spectra and symmetric spectra in general model categories]'', Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 165 (2001), section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morita model structure on dg categories===
Morita model structure on the category of small dg categories is Bousfield localization of the standard model structure (the one for which the weak equivalences are the quasi-equivalences).

[[File:Bunyip 1890.jpg|thumb|A bunyip depicted in 1890]]
'''Bunyip aristocracy''' is an Australian term satirising attempts to develop an aristocracy in the colonies now forming that country. It was first coined in 1853 by [[Daniel Deniehy]] who made a speech lambasting the attempt by [[William Wentworth]] to establish a titled [[aristocracy]] in the [[New South Wales]] government. This speech came to be known as the ''Bunyip Aristocracy speech''.

Deniehy made speeches opposing the new self-titled Australian aristocracy in the Victorian theatre and on the [[soapbox]] at [[Circular Quay]].

In response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary [[peerage]] in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: "''Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the [[platypus|duck-billed platypus]], and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a "bunyip aristocracy.''" (The [[bunyip]] is an Ancestral Being of [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Aboriginal Dreaming]].) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.

Among those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was [[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James MacArthur]] (1798–1867), the son of [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John MacArthur]], who had been nominated to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] (the lower house was only created in 1856): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to the [[Rum Rebellion]] in which [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] played a major role.&lt;/ref&gt; of a New South Wales order of chivalry.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The [[Order of Australia]] was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded [[British honours system|British honours]].

'Bunyip aristocracy' is now a [[pejorative]] term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bunyip aristocracy definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTLSSN?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dan Deniehy's Bunyip aristocracy speech ==

''Note: Deniehy had a habit of writing speeches and articles that addressed himself in the third person''

{{Quotation|Mr. Deniehy seconded the resolution [that this meeting pledges itself to resist, by every constitutional means in its power, the formation of a second chamber which is not based on popular suffrage]. Why he had been selected to speak to the present resolution he knew not, save that as a native of the colony he might naturally be expected to feel something like real interest, and to speak with something like real feeling on a question connected with the political institutions of the country. He would do his best to respond to that invitation 'Speak up,' and would perhaps balance deficiencies flowing from a small volume of voice by in all cases calling things by their right names.

He protested against the present daring and unheard-of attempt to tamper with a fundamental popular right – that of having a voice in the nomination of men who were to make, or control the making of, laws binding on the community – laws perpetually shifting and changing the nature of the whole social economy of a given state, and frequently operating in the subtlest forms on the very dearest interests of the citizen – on his domestic, his moral, perhaps his religious relations.

The name of Mr. Wentworth had frequently been mentioned there that day, and that on one or two occasions with an unwise tenderness, a squeamish reluctance to speak plain, English, and call certain nasty doings of Mr. Wentworth by the usual homely appellatives, simply because they were Mr. Wentworth's. He for one was nowise disposed, as preceding speakers had seemed, in tapping the vast shoulder of Mr. Wentworth's political recreancies, to '[[Damn with faint praise|damn him with faint praise]] and mistimed eulogy.

He had listened from boyhood upwards to grey tradition, Mr. Wentworth's demagogic Areopagitas – his speeches for the liberty of unlicensed printing regime of Darling; and for these and divers other deeds of a time when the honourable member for Sydney had to the full his share of the chivalrous pugnacities of five-and-twenty, he was as much disposed to give Mr Wentworth credit as any man. But with these perpetual fantasies, these everlasting variations on the 'Light of the other Days,' continually ringing in his ears, he [Dan Deniehy] was fain to enquire by what rule of moral and political appraisal, it was sought to throw in a scale opposite to that containing the flagrant and shameless political dishonesty of years, the democratic escapades, sins long since repented of in early youth.

The subsequent political conduct-rather the systemic political principles of Mr. Wentworth – had been such as would have been sufficient to cancel the value of even a century of action. The British Constitution had been frequently spoken of that afternoon in terms of unbounded laudation. That Constitution certainly deserved to be spoken of with respect; he [Dan Deniehy] respected it, no doubt they all respected it.

But his was a qualified respect at best, and in all presumed assimilations of the political hypotheses of our colonial Constitution-makers with the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|Constitution of Great Britain]], he warned them not be seduced by mere words and phrases-sheer 'talkee talkee.' Relatively, it was not only an admirable example of slowly growing and gradually elaborated political experience, applied, set in action, but it was also eminent and exemplary as a long history, still evolving, of political philosophy. But it was after all but relatively good for its wonderfully successful fusion of principles the most antagonistic.

Circumstances entirely alter cases, and he would warn them to be seduced by no mere vague association exhaled from the use of venerable phrases, that had, what phrases now-a-days seldom could boast, genuine meanings attached to them. The patrician element existed in the British Constitution as did the regal, for good reasons-it had stood in the way of all late legislatorial thought and operation as a great fact; as such it was handled, and in a deep and prudential spirit of conservatism allowed to stand-but as affecting the basis and foundation of the architecture of a Constitution-the elective principle neutralised for all detrimental influence, by conversion, practically, into a mere check upon the deliberations of the initiative section of the Legislature.

And having the right to frame, to embody, to shape it as we would, with no great stubborn facts to work upon as in England, there was nothing but the elective principle and the inalienable freedom of every colonist upon which to work out the whole organisation and body of our political institution.

But because it was the good pleasure of Mr. Wentworth and the respectable tail of that puissant Legislative body, whose serpentine movements were so ridiculous, we were not to form our own Constitution, but instead of this we were to have an Upper House and a Constitution cast upon us, upon a pattern which should suit the taste and propriety of political oligarchs who treated the people at large as if they were cattle to be bought and sold in the market; or as they indeed were in American slave States, and now in Australian markets, where we might find bamboozled coolies and kidnapped Chinamen.

And being in a figurative humour, he might endeavour to make some of the proposed nobility to pass before the stage of our imagination, as the ghost of Banquo walked along in the vision of Macbeth, so that we might have a fair view of these Harlequin aristocrats, these Botany Bay magnificos (laughter), these Australian mandarins.

Let them walk across the stage in all the pomp and circumstances of hereditary titles. First, then, in the procession stalks the hoary Wentworth. But he could not imagine that to such a head the strawberry leaves [a reference to the decoration on a Duke's coronet] would add any honour.

Next came the native aristocrat Mr. James Macarthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green- (great cheers and laughter) -and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry. There was also the colonial starred Terence Aubrey Murray, with more crosses and orders-not perhaps orders of merit-than a state of mandarinhood.

Another friend who claimed a colonial title was George Robert Nichols, the hereditary Grand Chancellor of all the Australias. Behold him in the serene and moody dignity of that portrait of Rodius' that smiled on us in all the public – house parlours – the gentleman who took Mr. Lowe to task for altering his opinions; this conqueror in the lists of jaw, and the victor in the realms of gab. It might be well to ridicule the doings of such a clique, but their doings merited burning indignation-yet, to speak seriously of such a project would too much resemble the Irishman's kicking at nothing, it wrenched one horribly.

But, though their weakness was ridiculous, he could assure them that these pygmies might do a great deal of mischief. They would bring contempt on a country whose interest he was sure they all had at heart, until even the poor Irishman in the streets of Dublin would fling his jibe at the Botany Bay aristocrats. In fact, he was puzzled how to classify them. They could not aspire to the miserable and effete dignity of the grandees of Spain.

They had antiquity of birth, but these he would defy any naturalist properly to classify them. But perhaps it was only a specimen of the remarkable contrariety that existed at the Antipodes. Here they all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulations of this degeneration, he supposed they were to be favoured with a '''bunyip aristocracy'''.

He trusted that this was only the beginning of a more extended movement, and from its auspicious commencement he augured the happiest results. A more orderly, united, and consolidated movement he had never witnessed. He must say that he was proud to belong to Botany Bay.

He took it as no term of reproach, when he saw that there was such a keen sensibility on the subject of their political sights – that the instant the liberties of their country were threatened, they could assemble, and with one voice, declare their determined and undying opposition.

But he would remind them that this was not a selfish consideration, there were wider interests at stake. In the present disturbed state of Europe, they must calculate on having to receive the poor Russian flying from the [[knout]] of his oppressor.

And also, looking at the gradually increasing pressure of political parties at home, they must prepare to open their arms and receive the fugitives from England, Scotland, and Ireland, who would hasten to gain a security and a competence, that appeared to be denied them in their own country.

The interests of these countless thousands were involved in their decision on this occasion, and they looked, and were entitled to look, for a heritage befitting the dignity of free men. Bring them not here with delusive hopes-let them not find a new-fangled aristocracy haunting these free shores.

But it is to yours to offer them a land, where man is rewarded for his labour, and where the law no more recognises the supremacy of a class, than it recognises the predominance of a religion. But there is an aristocracy worthy of our ambition. Wherever man's skill is eminent, wherever glorious manhood asserts its elevation, there is an aristocracy that confers honour on the land that possesses it. That is God's aristocracy.

That is an aristocracy that will grow and expand under free institutions, and bless the land where it flourishes. He hoped they would take into consideration the hitherto barren condition of the country they were legislating for. He was a native of this young but glorious continent. Its past was not hallowed in history by the achievements of men whose names reflected a light on the times in which they lived. They had no long line of poets, of statesmen, and warriors; in this country art had done nothing, but nature everything. It was theirs to inaugurate the future.

In no country had the attempt been successfully made to manufacture an aristocracy ''pro re nata''. It could not be done. They might as well expect honour to be paid to the nobles of King Kamehameha, or the ebony earls of the Emperor Soulouque of Hayti.

The aristocracy of England was founded on the sword. The men that came over with William the Conqueror were the masters of the Saxons, and so were the aristocracy. The soldiers of Cromwell were the masters of the Irish, and so became their aristocracy. But he should like to know how Wentworth and his clique had conquered the inhabitants of New South Wales – except in the artful dodgery of doctoring up a Franchise Bill.

If we were to be blessed with an aristocracy he would rather it should not resemble that of William the Bastard but of Jack the Strapper.

But he trespassed too long on their time and would only seek in conclusion, but to record two things. First, his indignant denunciation of any tampering with the purity of the elective principle, the only basis upon which good government could be placed; and, secondly, he wished them to regard the future destinies of their country.

Let them, with prophetic eye, behold the troops of weary pilgrims, from foreign despotism, which would, ere long, be floating to their shores, and let them now – give the most earnest assurance, that such men as composed the Wentworth clique, were not the representations of the spirit, the intelligence, of the freemen of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Martin1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Alfred Martin|title=The life and speeches of Daniel Henry Deniehy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjciBDj5JIgC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=18 December 2012|year=1884|publisher=McNeil and Coffee|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial peerage==

A Committee, consisting of Messrs. [[Charles Cowper]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray|T.A. Murray]], [[George Macleay]], [[Edward Deas Thomson|E. Deas Thomson]], J.H. Plunkett, Dr. Douglas, W. Thurlow, James Macarthur, [[James Martin (Australian politician)|James Martin]], and W.C. Wentworth, appointed on the motion of W.C.Wentworth, held its first meeting, Sydney, 27 May 1853. Fifteen meetings were called. Half the members did not attend the meetings. The Bill was reported 28 July 1853. It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs :
* A committee of the Legislative Council has framed a new Constitution for the colony, by which it is proposed 
**(1.) To create a colonial nobility with hereditary privileges.
**(2.) To construct an Upper House of Legislature in which the people will have no voice.
**(3.) To add eighteen new seats to the Lower House, only one of which is to be allotted to Sydney while the other seventeen are to be allotted among the country and squatting districts.
**(4.) To squander the public revenue by pensioning off the officers of the Government on their full salaries ! thus implanting in our institutions a principle of jobbery and corruption.
**(5.) To fix irrevocably on the people this oligarchy in the name of free institutions so that no future Legislature can reform it even by absolute majority. The Legislative Council has the hardihood to propose passing this unconstitutional and anti-British measure with only a few days notice, and before it can possibly be considered by the colonists at large.  
The meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, J.H. 1984, The Bedside Book of Colonial Doings, previously published in 1879 as 'Australian Dictionary of Dates containing the History of Australasia from 1542 to May 1879, pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Catharsis}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], '''cathexis''' is defined as the process of investment of [[mental energy|mental or emotional energy]] in a person, object, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Calvin S. ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology''. New York: Mentor, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''cathexis'' (κάθεξις) was chosen by [[James Strachey]] to render the [[German language|German]] term ''Besetzung'' in his translation of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s complete works. Freud himself wrote of "interest (Besetzung)", in an early letter to [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref name= Gay465n&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Freud|year=1989|page=465n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Gay]] objected that Strachey's use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud's use of ''Besetzung'' – "a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of [[Electric charge|electricity]])".&lt;ref name= Gay465n/&gt;

==Usage==

Freud defined cathexis as an investment of [[libido]], pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A cathexis or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a cathexis of [[mortido]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, '' A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 54 and p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called a group of cathected ideas a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (1995) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2013}} representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] and the "re-cathecting" of former positions or [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', pp. 123–4&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: "object-cathexes".

Freud used the term "[[anticathexis|anti-cathexis]]" or counter-charge&lt;ref&gt;Felluga, Dino. "Terms Used by Psychoanalysis." Introductory Guide to Critical Theory. Purdue U. 31 August 2009. ([http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/psychoanalysis/psychterms.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to [[psychological repression|repress]] such [[Interpersonal attraction|desires]]. Like a steam engine, the libido's cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], [[reaction formation]], or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. Scott Peck#Love|M. Scott Peck]] distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care.

==Object relations==

Freud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 118 and pp. 151–8&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the  foundation of [[object relations theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2003) p. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinking==

Freud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, “in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

[[Eric Berne]] raised the possibility that [[child art]] often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects.&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' () p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ambiguity in Freud's usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect – as in a "cathexis of longing".&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karoly Hajdu''' (1920–1981), better-known as '''Charlotte Bach''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-British [[impostor]] who later in life became a [[trans woman]] and [[fringe science|fringe]] [[evolution]]ary theorist. She developed an alternative theory of evolution which acquired a cult following among prominent writers and scientists in the London of the 1970s. They, without exception, remained ignorant of her true identity until after her death.

==Life as a man==
Hajdu was born near [[Budapest]] in 1920. In the wake of [[World War II]] he moved to England and in 1948 began to use the name Baron '''Carl Hajdu'''. In 1956 he collected money for [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian freedom fighters]] resisting the then [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation. ''[[Sunday People|The People]]'', which specialised in lurid [[exposé (journalism)|exposés]], alleged that Hajdu had pocketed the proceeds. He was found guilty of [[fraud]] in 1957, and was forced into [[bankruptcy]].

Hajdu then adopted the persona of writer and society [[hypnotherapist]] '''Michel Karoly'''. He rented an apartment in [[Mayfair]]. He began to acquire a following in polite society, and wrote an [[agony aunt|agony uncle]] column in a mass-selling magazine of the day. Karoly continued in this role until 1965, when both his wife and stepson suddenly died. He was declared bankrupt again, and in 1966 was sentenced to two months in [[Prison|gaol]] for acquiring a loan whilst bankrupt.

By her own account, the sudden deaths had precipitated a profound identity crisis.

==Life as a woman==
In 1968, Hajdu adopted the new identity of Dr Charlotte Bach, a supposed former lecturer at Budapest's [[Eötvös Loránd University]], whose alumni included the philosophers [[Michael Polanyi|Michael]] and [[Karl Polanyi]] and the mathematician [[John von Neumann]].

'Dr Bach' would openly tell lecture audiences how at first, putting ads in the windows of local newsagents, she had worked as a [[dominatrix]]. This experience had provided invaluable research data, she said, for the purpose of compiling a dictionary of psychology. These researches had in turn led to the all-embracing theory.

She lived full-time as Charlotte Bach until she died. She was thus what is sometimes referred to as a ''non-op trans woman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|volume=2|date=1999-10-10|author=Dr. Charles Moser|url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume2/Moser/moser1.htm|accessdate=2009-01-26|title=Addressing the Healthcare Needs of Sexual Minority Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ethology===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nikolass Tinbergen.gif|thumb|left|120px|[[Niko Tinbergen]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Dutch [[ethology|ethologist]] whose ideas were a key influence on Bach's [[pseudo-science]] of human ethology]] --&gt;
In 1971 Bach unveiled her transformative, as she would insist, theory of [[evolution]]. Among other things, she argued, it correctly displaced [[Darwinism]] in favour of [[Lamarckism]]. Drawing heavily on the work of animal [[ethology|ethologists]] such as [[Niko Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]], she argued that humans experience in varying degrees a pull towards becoming the opposite [[gender|sex]]. This urge could either be denied or ''asseverated'': [[gay]]s and femme [[lesbians]], for example, are [[female|women]] in men’s bodies or vice versa, but transvestites and butch lesbians are not. This gave rise to eight possible permutations.

This deep-seated and ineradicable phenomenon, she argued, was the true engine of evolutionary change. It was also the key to the proper understanding of culture&amp;mdash;including science, politics and religion. Upon such reasoning, backed up by a polymathic accumulation of supporting evidence and a forceful lecturing style, she elaborated what she called the science of Human Ethology.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hollylodgeestatelondon.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Holly Lodge, where only the caretaker knew Bach's true identity]] --&gt;
Eminent scientists who sought to engage with the apparent challenges of Bach's theory included the [[biologist]] [[Brian Goodwin]] and [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]], a pioneer of [[cybernetics]] and former head of the [[Burden Neurological Institute]] in Bristol.

Bach attracted the interest in particular of the English writer [[Colin Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=The Misfits|year=1988|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-88184-589-2|pages=15–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of a number of eminent British scientists and academics. Wilson began to write about her theory. Bach became a cult figure. A small group of followers who would gather at her home at [[Holly Lodge Estate|Holly Lodge]] in [[Highgate]], while weekly lectures would take place elsewhere. An Institute of Human Ethology was set up to promote her ideas and stimulate further research. Her literary executors included the then professor of educational technology at Britain's [[Open University]]. She was invited to speak at [[Sussex University]] and at [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], [[Cambridge]], named in honour of the man most of whose ideas she wished to consign to the dustbin.

In due course, leading members of London's then burgeoning [[Gay Liberation]] movement&amp;mdash;equally ignorant of Bach's true identity&amp;mdash;took up human ethology and started publishing pamphlets of their own, much attracted by the tantalising notion of homosexuals as the [[vanguardism|vanguard]] of evolutionary change.

Bach continued to elaborate upon her original thesis up to the time of her death in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">A '''critical précis''' is an [[expository writing|expository]] style of writing, analogous in structure to an [[essay]] but which contains a summary of another piece of text. In essence, the entire content summarizes all the main ideas, arguments and [[abstraction]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiferth|first=Michael S.|title=Writing the Precis|url=http://lonestar.texas.net/~mseifert/precis1302.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220124429/http://lonestar.texas.net/~mseifert/precis1302.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 February 2002|work=Texas.net|publisher=English 1302 - Palo Alto College|accessdate=6 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the text into a shorter passage a fraction of its original length, in order to provide insight into the original author's [[thesis]]. The writer of the précis is careful to avoid copying any direct wording from the original text in order to avoid [[academic plagiarism]], except in short passage quotations where necessary.

The précis is a common assignment in the [[humanities]] and [[liberal arts]] streams in [[higher education]]. Typical lengths are less than 500 to 1500 words.

The majority of higher education students find the précis to be a useful analytical format and tool{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Its use also extends to [[interdisciplinary]] formats, and is sometimes also identified as a '''rhetorical précis'''.

==Structure==
;Introduction
::Cites the main text of work being analyzed, similar to a typical essay [[lead paragraph]]
;Body
::Explanation of key ideas, concepts and phrases, demonstrating the implied significance and purpose of the text using direct examples of how the author supports the thesis, often relating or contrasting to the reader's assumptions (this is not a creative interpretation)
;Conclusion
::Summarizes the main idea and importance of the original author's thesis, and the author's connections to the intended audience

The précis is written from an impartial [[Third-person narrative|third-person point of view]], although personal analysis of a text can also be considered précis format. The analysis of ideas is usually in chronological order.

===Example keywords===
The opening paragraph follows a certain structure:
''...''the author'''...
::asserts, argues, believes, claims, conveys the thought, declares, demonstrates, elucidates, expounds the idea, finds, identifies the fact, illustrates, implies, points out, posits, proposes, reports, reveals, states, suggests...'''that'''...
:::followed by a clause explaining the thesis. This clause is typically similar in scope to the concluding sentence of the final paragraph.

These words exemplify the use of ''rhetorically accurate verbs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanzbom|first=Leon|title=On English and Writing: Critical Thinking|url=http://www.lanzbom.org/criticalthinking.htm|publisher=Word Rogues|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dendrogram''' is a [[diagram]] representing a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]. This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts:
* in [[hierarchical clustering]], it illustrates the arrangement of the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everitt |first= Brian  |date= 1998 |title= Dictionary of Statistics |location= Cambridge, UK|publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= 96 |isbn= 0-521-59346-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[computational biology]], it shows the clustering of [[gene]]s or samples, sometimes in the margins of [[heat map|heatmaps]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Leland|last2=Friendly|first2=Michael|title=The History of the Cluster Heat Map|journal=The American Statistician|date=May 2009|volume=63|issue=2|pages=179–184|doi=10.1198/tas.2009.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[phylogenetics]], it displays the [[evolution]]ary relationships among various biological [[taxa]]. In this case, the dendrogram is also called a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/phylogenetic-tree|title=Phylogenetic tree (biology)|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''dendrogram'' derives from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|δένδρον}} ({{grc-transl|δένδρον}}), meaning "tree", and {{wikt-lang|grc|γράμμα}} ({{grc-transl|γράμμα}}), meaning "drawing, mathematical figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461974285 |title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=2010035283 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date= |website=www.tabularium.be |publisher= |access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clustering example ==

For a clustering example, suppose that five taxa (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) have been clustered by [[UPGMA]] based on a matrix of [[genetic distances]]. The [[hierarchical clustering]] dendrogram would show a column of five nodes representing the initial data (here individual taxa), and the remaining nodes represent the clusters to which the data belong, with the arrows representing the distance (dissimilarity). The distance between merged clusters is monotone, increasing with the level of the merger: the height of each node in the plot is proportional to the value of the intergroup dissimilarity between its two daughters (the nodes on the right representing individual observations all plotted at zero height).

In [[category theory]], an abstract branch of [[mathematics]], an '''equivalence of categories''' is a relation between two [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] that establishes that these categories are "essentially the same". There are numerous examples of categorical equivalences from many areas of mathematics. Establishing an equivalence involves demonstrating strong similarities between the mathematical structures concerned. In some cases, these structures may appear to be unrelated at a superficial or intuitive level, making the notion fairly powerful: it creates the opportunity to "translate" theorems between different kinds of mathematical structures, knowing that the essential meaning of those theorems is preserved under the translation.

If a category is equivalent to the [[dual (category theory)|opposite (or dual)]] of another category then one speaks of
a '''duality of categories''', and says that the two categories are '''dually equivalent'''.

An equivalence of categories consists of a [[functor]] between the involved categories, which is required to have an "inverse" functor. However, in contrast to the situation common for [[isomorphism]]s in an algebraic setting, the composition of the functor and its "inverse" is not necessarily the identity mapping. Instead it is sufficient that each object be ''[[natural transformation|naturally isomorphic]]'' to its image under this composition. Thus one may describe the functors as being "inverse up to isomorphism". There is indeed a concept of [[isomorphism of categories]] where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of much less practical use than the ''equivalence'' concept.

==Definition==
Formally, given two categories ''C'' and ''D'', an ''equivalence of categories'' consists of a functor ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'', a functor ''G'' : ''D'' → ''C'', and two natural isomorphisms ε: ''FG''→'''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and η : '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;→''GF''. Here ''FG'': ''D''→''D'' and ''GF'': ''C''→''C'', denote the respective compositions of ''F'' and ''G'', and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''C''→''C'' and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''D''→''D'' denote the ''identity functors'' on ''C'' and ''D'', assigning each object and morphism to itself. If ''F'' and ''G'' are contravariant functors one speaks of a ''duality of categories'' instead.

One often does not specify all the above data. For instance, we say that the categories ''C'' and ''D'' are ''equivalent'' (respectively ''dually equivalent'') if there exists an equivalence (respectively duality) between them. Furthermore, we say that ''F'' "is" an equivalence of categories if an inverse functor ''G'' and natural isomorphisms as above exist. Note however that knowledge of ''F'' is usually not enough to reconstruct ''G'' and the natural isomorphisms: there may be many choices (see example below).

==Equivalent characterizations==
A functor ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' yields an equivalence of categories if and only if it is simultaneously:
* [[full functor|full]], i.e. for any two objects ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'', the map Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) induced by ''F'' is [[surjective]];
* [[faithful functor|faithful]], i.e. for any two objects ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'', the map Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) induced by ''F'' is [[injective]]; and
* [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective (dense)]], i.e. each object ''d'' in ''D'' is isomorphic to an object of the form ''Fc'', for ''c'' in ''C''.
This is a quite useful and commonly applied criterion, because one does not have to explicitly construct the "inverse" ''G'' and the natural isomorphisms between ''FG'', ''GF'' and the identity functors. On the other hand, though the above properties guarantee the ''existence'' of a categorical equivalence (given a sufficiently strong version of the [[axiom of choice]] in the underlying set theory), the missing data is not completely specified, and often there are many choices. It is a good idea to specify the missing constructions explicitly whenever possible.
Due to this circumstance, a functor with these properties is sometimes called a '''weak equivalence of categories'''. (Unfortunately this conflicts with terminology from [[homotopy type theory]].)

There is also a close relation to the concept of [[adjoint functors]]. The following statements are equivalent for functors ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' and ''G'' : ''D'' → ''C'':
* There are natural isomorphisms from ''FG'' to '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''GF''.
* ''F'' is a left adjoint of ''G'' and both functors are full and faithful.
* ''G'' is a right adjoint of ''F'' and both functors are full and faithful.
One may therefore view an adjointness relation between two functors as a "very weak form of equivalence". Assuming that the natural transformations for the adjunctions are given, all of these formulations allow for an explicit construction of the necessary data, and no choice principles are needed. The key property that one has to prove here is that the ''counit'' of an adjunction is an isomorphism if and only if the right adjoint is a full and faithful functor.

==Examples==
* Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; having a single object &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and a single morphism &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and the category &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; with two objects &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and four morphisms: two identity morphisms &lt;math&gt;1_{d_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1_{d_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and two isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon d_{1} \to d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \colon d_{2} \to d_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The categories &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent; we can (for example) have &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; map &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; map both objects of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and all morphisms to &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.
* By contrast, the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with a single object and a single morphism is ''not'' equivalent to the category &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; with two objects and only two identity morphisms as the two objects therein are ''not'' isomorphic.
* Consider a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with one object &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and two morphisms &lt;math&gt;1_{c}, f \colon c \to c&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt; be the identity morphism on &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;f \circ f = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Of course, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to itself, which can be shown by taking &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt; in place of the required natural isomorphisms between the functor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_{C}&lt;/math&gt; and itself.  However, it is also true that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; yields a natural isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_{C}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  Hence, given the information that the identity functors form an equivalence of categories, in this example one still can choose between two natural isomorphisms for each direction.
* The category of sets and [[partial function]]s is equivalent to but not isomorphic with the category of [[pointed set]]s and point-preserving maps.&lt;ref name="KoslowskiMelton2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jürgen Koslowski and Austin Melton|title=Categorical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4186-3|page=10|author=Lutz Schröder|chapter=Categories: a free tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of finite-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[real number|real]] [[vector space]]s, and the category &lt;math&gt;D = \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of all real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (the latter category is explained in the article on [[additive category|additive categories]]).  Then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent: The functor &lt;math&gt;G \colon D \to C&lt;/math&gt; which maps the object &lt;math&gt;A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and the matrices in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding linear maps is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
* One of the central themes of [[algebraic geometry]] is the duality of the category of [[affine scheme]]s and the category of [[commutative ring]]s.  The functor &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; associates to every commutative ring its [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]], the scheme defined by the [[prime ideal]]s of the ring.  Its adjoint &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; associates to every affine scheme its ring of global sections.
* In [[functional analysis]] the category of commutative [[C*-algebra]]s with identity is contravariantly equivalent to the category of [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s.  Under this duality, every compact Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is associated with the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and every commutative C*-algebra is associated with the space of its [[maximal ideal]]s.  This is the [[Gelfand representation]].
* In [[lattice theory]], there are a number of dualities, based on representation theorems that connect certain classes of lattices to classes of [[topology|topological spaces]].  Probably the most well-known theorem of this kind is ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'', which is a special instance within the general scheme of ''[[Stone duality]]''.  Each [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a specific topology on the set of [[lattice theory|ultrafilters]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Conversely, for any topology the clopen (i.e. closed and open) subsets yield a Boolean algebra.  One obtains a duality between the category of Boolean algebras (with their homomorphisms) and [[Stone space]]s (with continuous mappings). Another case of Stone duality is [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] stating a duality between finite partial orders and finite distributive lattices.
* In [[pointless topology]] the category of spatial locales is known to be equivalent to the dual of the category of sober spaces.
* For two [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] ''R'' and ''S'', the [[product category]] ''R''-'''Mod'''×''S''-'''Mod''' is equivalent to (''R''×''S'')-'''Mod'''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Any category is equivalent to its [[skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]].

==Properties==
As a rule of thumb, an equivalence of categories preserves all "categorical" concepts and properties. If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence, then the following statements are all true:
* the object ''c'' of ''C'' is an [[initial object]] (or [[terminal object]], or [[zero object]]), [[if and only if]] ''Fc'' is an [[initial object]] (or [[terminal object]], or [[zero object]]) of ''D''
* the morphism α in ''C'' is a [[monomorphism]] (or [[epimorphism]], or [[isomorphism]]), if and only if ''Fα'' is a monomorphism (or epimorphism, or isomorphism) in ''D''.
* the functor ''H'' : ''I'' → ''C'' has [[limit (category theory)|limit]] (or colimit) ''l'' if and only if the functor ''FH'' : ''I'' → ''D'' has limit (or colimit) ''Fl''. This can be applied to [[equaliser (mathematics)|equalizers]], [[product (category theory)|product]]s and [[coproduct]]s among others. Applying it to [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]]s and [[cokernel]]s, we see that the equivalence ''F'' is an [[Regular category#Exact sequences and regular functors|exact functor]].
* ''C'' is a [[cartesian closed category]] (or a [[topos]]) if and only if ''D'' is cartesian closed (or a topos).

Dualities "turn all concepts around": they turn initial objects into terminal objects, monomorphisms into epimorphisms, kernels into cokernels, limits into colimits etc.

If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence of categories, and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two inverses of ''F'', then ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are naturally isomorphic.

If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence of categories, and if ''C'' is a [[preadditive category]] (or [[additive category]], or [[abelian category]]), then ''D'' may be turned into a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category) in such a way that ''F'' becomes an [[additive functor]]. On the other hand, any equivalence between additive categories is necessarily additive. (Note that the latter statement is not true for equivalences between preadditive categories.)

An '''auto-equivalence''' of a category ''C'' is an equivalence ''F'' : ''C'' → ''C''. The auto-equivalences of ''C'' form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition if we consider two auto-equivalences that are naturally isomorphic to be identical. This group captures the essential "symmetries" of ''C''. (One caveat: if ''C'' is not a small category, then the auto-equivalences of ''C'' may form a proper [[class (set theory)|class]] rather than a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].)

'''Ethical codes''' are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions. An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of [[business ethics]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] for employees, and codes of professional practice.

==Code of ethics or code of conduct? (corporate or business ethics)==
{{See also|Business ethics|Code of conduct}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many companies use the phrases ''ethical code'' and ''code of conduct'' interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of [[ethics]] will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.

==Code of practice (professional ethics)==
{{See also|Professional ethics}}
A code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non-governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of [[professional responsibility]], which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered "ethical" or "correct" or "right" in the circumstances.  In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, ''Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations'', the [[International Federation of Accountants]] provided the following working definition:
"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=PAIB Committee |date=31 May 2007 |title=Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations |series=International Good Practice Guidance |publisher=The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) |isbn=978-1-931949-81-1 |url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/defining-and-developing-effective-code-conduct-organizations |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

Listed below are a few example statements from the professional codes of the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) and the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] (SPJ):
; PRSA Code of Ethics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PRSA Code of Ethics |website=Public Relations Society of America |url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/ |access-date=19 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: “Loyalty: We are faithful to those we represent, while honoring our obligation to serve the public interest.”
: “Fairness: We deal fairly with clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, the media, and the general public. We respect all opinions and support the right of free expression.”
; SPJ  Code of Ethics&lt;ref name=SPJ&gt;{{cite web |date=6 September 2014 |title= SPJ Code of Ethics |website=Society of Professional Journalists |url=https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: “Minimize Harm …  Balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness. … Balance a suspect’s right to a fair trial with the public’s right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges. …”
: “Act Independently …  Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts.”

==General notes==
Ethical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part.

They are distinct from [[moral code]]s that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2064759/Elementi_di_deontologia_politica |language=Italian |first=Giampiero |last=Buonomo |title=Elementi di deontologia politica |journal=Nuovi studi politici |date=April–September 2000 |pages=3-66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/qui/code_deontologie.asp|title=Déontologie à l'Assemblée nationale |author=Assemblée Nationale |author-link=National Assembly (France) |language=French |date=2 August 2017 |website=Assemblée Nationale|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies.

Even organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include [[Black-hat hacker|hacker communities]], bands of thieves, and [[street gang]]s.

The Jewish [[Written Torah]] and [[Oral Torah]] comprise the earliest and best preserved ethical code. Adapted to every field of actual day-to-day life for thousands of years, Jewish [[Halakha]] is the oldest collective body of [[religious law]]s, [[law]]s and [[jurisdiction]]s still in use.

Codes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is [[malum in se]], [[malum prohibitum]], and good practice.  Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational.

In sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify "good and bad behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/code%20of%20ethics |title=Code of Ethics |work=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] |access-date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21347">{{short description|The emergence of human moral behavior over the course of human evolution}}
The '''evolution of morality''' refers to the emergence of human moral behavior over the course of [[human evolution]]. [[Morality]] can be defined as a system of ideas about right and wrong conduct. In everyday life, morality is typically associated with [[human behavior]],  and not much thought is given to the social conducts of other creatures. The emerging fields of [[evolutionary biology]] and in particular [[sociobiology]] have argued  that, though human [[social behavior]]s are complex, the precursors of human morality can be traced to the behaviors of many other [[social animal]]s. Sociobiological explanations of human behavior are still controversial. The traditional view of social scientists has been that morality is a construct, and is thus culturally relative, although others argue that there is a [[science of morality]].

==Animal sociality==
{{see also|Social animal}}
Though other animals may not possess what humans may perceive as moral behavior, all social animals have had to modify or restrain their behaviors for group living to be worthwhile. Typical examples of behavioral modification can be found in the societies of [[ants]], [[bees]] and [[termites]]. Ant colonies may possess millions of individuals. [[E. O. Wilson]] argues that the single most important factor that leads to the success of ant colonies is the existence of a sterile worker caste. This caste of females are subservient to the needs of their mother, the [[Queen ant|queen]], and in so doing, have given up their own reproduction in order to raise brothers and sisters. The existence of sterile castes among these social insects significantly restricts the competition for mating and in the process fosters cooperation within a colony. Cooperation among ants is vital, because a solitary ant has an improbable chance of long-term survival and reproduction. However, as part of a group, colonies can thrive for decades. As a consequence, ants are one of the most successful families of species on the planet, accounting for a [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that rivals that of the human species.&lt;ref name="ants"&gt;{{cite book

The basic reason that social animals live in groups is that opportunities for survival and reproduction are much better in groups than living alone. The social behaviors of mammals are more familiar to humans. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like [[empathy]] and [[altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Richard|author2=Lee, P.C. |author3=Njiraini, N. |author4=Poole, J.H. |author5=Sayialel, K. |author6=Sayialel, S. |author7=Bates, L.A. |author8= Moss, C.J. |title=Do Elephants Show Empathy?|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2008|volume=15|series=10-11|pages=204–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"&gt;Rodriguez, Tommy (2011).

== Primate sociality ==
{{See also|Altruism in animals}}
Humanity’s closest living relatives are [[common chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s. These primates share a [[common ancestor]] with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of [[social norm]]s,  realization of "self", and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/14/AR2008081403049.html|title=Barbara J.

King|author=|date=|website=randomhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality.
Many social animals such as primates, dolphins, and whales have shown to exhibit what [[Michael Shermer]] refers to as premoral sentiments. According to Shermer, the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:

:'' attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group''.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer argues that these premoral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, lack of [[group cohesion]] could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of reciprocity. Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} For example, chimpanzees are more likely to [[food sharing|share food]] with individuals who have previously [[Personal grooming|groomed]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimpanzees Share Forbidden Fruit|first1=Kimberley J.|last1=Hockings|first2=Tatyana|last2=Humle|first3=James R.|last3=Anderson|first4=Dora|last4=Biro|first5=Claudia|last5=Sousa|first6=Gaku|last6=Ohashi|first7=Tetsuro|last7=Matsuzawa|date=12 September 2007|publisher=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000886|pmid=17849015 | pmc=1964537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/Wilkinson84.pdf|title=Reciprocal food sharing in the vampire bat|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals such as Capuchin monkeys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primates.com/monkeys/fairness.html|title=Monkey research : monkeys show sense of justice |website=www.primates.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/12/08/0810957105|title=The absence of reward induces inequity aversion in dogs|first1=Friederike|last1=Range|first2=Lisa|last2=Horn|first3=Zsófia|last3=Viranyi|first4=Ludwig|last4=Huber|date=7 December 2008|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=pnas.0810957105|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810957105|pmid=19064923|pmc=2629244}}&lt;/ref&gt; also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors.

Chimpanzees live in [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals.  As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of [[social control]], [[conflict resolution]] and group solidarity. This numerical limit is theorized to be hard coded in our [[gene]]s since even modern humans have difficulty maintaining stable social relationships with [[Dunbar's number|more than 100–200 people]].  According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. People also apply a degree of judgment and reason not seen in the animal kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==The punishment problems==
While groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing many of them, any characteristics that entail impunity are positively selected by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1979). Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically punishing individuals aware of their breach of rules would select against the ability to be aware of it, precluding any coevolution of both conscious choice and a sense of it being the basis for moral and penal liability in the same species.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). "Against 'Sociobiology'". [letter] New York Review of Books 22 (Nov. 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human social intelligence==
The [[Dunbar's number|social brain hypothesis]], detailed by [[Robin Dunbar|R.I.M Dunbar]] in the article ''The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution'', supports the fact that the brain originally evolved to process factual information. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of [[color vision]]. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. 2009. The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution. Annals of Human Biology 562-572.&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind as defined by [[Martin Brüne|M. Brune]], is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"&gt;Brune, M., and Brunecohrs, U. 2006. Theory Of Mind—Evolution, Ontogeny, Brain Mechanisms And Psychopathology. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, 30:437-455.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced [[social intelligence]]. Collectively, group living requires cooperation and generates conflict. Social living puts strong evolutionary selection pressures on acquiring social intelligence due to the fact that living in groups has advantages. Advantages to group living include protection from predators and the fact that groups in general outperform the sum of an individual’s performance. But, from an objective point of view, group living also has disadvantages, such as, competition from within the group for resources and mates. This sets the stage for something of an evolutionary arms race from within the species.

Within populations of social animals, altruism, or acts of behavior that are disadvantageous to one individual while benefiting other group members has evolved. This notion seems to be contradictory to evolutionary thought, due to the fact that an organism's fitness and success is defined by its ability to pass genes on to the next generation. According to [[Ernst Fehr|E. Fehr]], in the article, ''The Nature of Human Altruism'', the evolution of altruism can be accounted for when [[kin selection]] and [[inclusive fitness]] are taken into account; meaning [[reproductive success]] is not just dependent on the number of offspring an individual produces, but also the number of offspring that related individuals produce.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., &amp; Fischbacher, U. 2003.  The Nature Of Human Altruism. Nature 425:785-791.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of familial relationships altruism is also seen, but in a different manner typically defined by the [[prisoner's dilemma]], theorized by [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]]. The prisoner's dilemma serves to define cooperation and defecting with and against individuals driven by incentive, or in Nash's proposed case, years in jail. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat. In the tit-for-tat strategy, an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection.

Brune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human. The emergence of this unique trait is perhaps where the divergence of the modern human begins, along with our acquisition of language. Humans use metaphors and imply much of what we say. Phrases such as, "You know what I mean?" are not uncommon and are direct results of the sophistication of the human theory of mind. Failure to understand another's intentions and emotions can yield inappropriate social responses and are often associated with human mental conditions such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], some forms of [[dementia]], and [[psychopathy]]. This is especially true for autism spectrum disorders, where social disconnect is evident, but non-social intelligence can be preserved or even in some cases augmented, such as in the case of a savant.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"/&gt; The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior.

==Evolution of religion==
{{see also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents. By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

==The Wason selection task==
{{See also|Wason selection task|Altruism#Scientific viewpoints|}}
In an experiment where subjects must demonstrate abstract, complex reasoning, researchers have found that humans (as has been seen in other animals) have a strong innate ability to reason about social exchanges. This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1870/the-science-good-and-evil?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==
[[Disgust]], one of the [[basic emotions]], may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective. One example is things that increase the risk of an [[infectious disease]] such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological [[decomposition]], a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor [[hygiene]], and various body fluids such as [[feces]], [[vomiting|vomit]], [[phlegm]], and [[blood]]. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as [[incest]] (the [[incest taboo]]) or unwanted sexual advances.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"/&gt; Still another example are behaviors that may threaten group cohesion or cooperation such as cheating, lying, and stealing. [[MRI]] studies have found that such situations activate areas in the brain associated with disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J.

The '''Formosan black bear''' (臺灣黑熊, ''Ursus thibetanus formosanus''), also known as the '''white-throated bear''', is a [[subspecies]] of the [[Asiatic black bear]]. Formosan black bears are [[endemic]] to [[Taiwan]]. In 2001, they were voted the [[List of national animals|most representative wildlife of Taiwan]] in a half-year-long countrywide voting campaign. They are also the largest land animals and the only native bears (''[[Ursidae]]'') in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="gio_gov_tw"&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/ecology/English/animals_e/MidAnimals_e/MidAnimals06_e.htm Taiwan's Ecological Conservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013130/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/ecology/English/animals_e/MidAnimals_e/MidAnimals06_e.htm |date=2008-09-08 }}. Gio.gov.tw. Retrieved on 2011-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of severe exploitation and habitat degradation in recent decades, populations of wild Formosan black bears have been declining. This species was listed as "endangered" under Taiwan's Wildlife Conservation Act ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 野生動物保育法) in 1989. Their geographic distribution is restricted to remote, rugged areas at elevations of {{convert|1000|-|3500|m}}.

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:V character.JPG|thumb|130px|left|The V-shaped white mark on a bear's chest]]
[[File:Formosan Black Bear01.jpg|thumb|160px|right|A Formosan black bear]]
The Formosan black bear is sturdily built and has a round head, short neck, small eyes, and long [[snout]]. Its head measures 26–35&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 40–60&amp;nbsp;cm in [[circumference]]. Its ears are 8–12&amp;nbsp;cm long. Its snout resembles a dog's, hence its nickname is "dog bear". Its tail is inconspicuous and short — usually less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm long. Its body is well covered with rough, glossy, black hair, which can grow over 10&amp;nbsp;cm long around the neck. The tip of its chin is white. On the chest, there is a distinctive yellowish or white mark that is shaped like a "V" character or a [[crescent]] moon. This earns it another nickname — "moon bear".&lt;ref name="physical_chars"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/bear/features.asp] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
[[File:Acorn-20.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Acorns]]
[[File:19-Formosan Black Bear.JPG|thumb|160px|A bear eating fruits]]

They feed primarily on leaves, buds, fruits, roots, although they also eat insects, small animals, and [[carrion]]. Diets of bears monitored in [[Yushan National Park]] include succulent vegetation in spring, soft fruits rich in [[carbohydrate]] in summer, and fat-loaded [[Mast (botany)|hard mast]] (e.g., [[acorn]] and [[walnut]]) in fall/winter.

== Habitat and behavior ==
The Formosan bear lives in the mountainous forests in the eastern two-thirds of Taiwan at elevations of {{convert|1,000|to|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the winter, rather than [[hibernate|hibernating]] like [[Asiatic black bear]]s in [[temperate]] areas, they move to lower elevations to find food. They are active for 54–57% of daylight hours, and more active during summer (60%) and fall/winter (60%) than spring (47%). They are primarily active during the day in the spring and summer; and increasingly active at night in the fall/winter when [[acorn]]s are abundant. They are solitary and usually move around extensively except during the mating season or when caring for cubs. Formosan bears are also the only bears on the planet that make temporary nests.

Although they look clumsy and slow, Formosan black bears can easily outrun humans, reaching speeds of 30–40&amp;nbsp;km per hour. They are skilled at swimming and climbing, as well. Because of their [[endangered species]] status and their habit of avoiding humans, Formosan black bears are rarely seen in the wild. In most encounters the bear retreats and runs away from humans. Even though bears can be aggressive, they rarely attack humans without provocation.

==Reproduction==

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:26-sucking_cubs.jpg|A mother bear nursing her cubs
Image:44 days Feb 12.jpg|A 44-days old cub
Image:12-cub_on_tree.jpg|A bear cub climbing in a tree
&lt;/gallery&gt;
As solitary animals, Formosan black bears do not stay in fixed shelters, except for females during their breeding period. The bear's courtship period is very brief. A male trails after a female for a few days. After mating, they return to their solitary lives. Females reach [[sexual maturity]] at age 3–4 and males reach sexual maturity at age 4–5, usually one year later than females. Mating is usually from June to August and [[pregnancy]] lasts for 6–7 months. Thus, wild females usually give birth between December and the following February.&lt;ref name="reproduction"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/bear/breeding.asp] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each birth produces 1–3 cubs. Cubs will be nursed by mother for about six months. When they are strong enough to leave the den, bear cubs will remain with the mother for approximately two years, until the mother enters the next cycle of [[estrus]] and drives the cubs off. This forms the 2-year reproductive cycle of Formosan black bears.&lt;ref name="reproduction"/&gt;

==Hunter and hunted==

Formosan black bears (台灣黑熊) and [[Formosan clouded leopard]]s  (台灣雲豹) — two of the most powerful land animals on the island of [[Taiwan]] — used to roam over the ranges and mountains of [[Taiwan]]. However, while the leopard is now extinct, the bear, though endangered, has survived.&lt;ref name="hunter_and_hunted"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/relation/hunterandbear.asp]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research by the Institute of Wildlife Conservation, [[National Pingtung University of Science and Technology]], this may be due to the myths and traditional taboos of [[Taiwanese aborigines]].&lt;ref name="wildlife_conservation"&gt;[http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/techwp.aspx?id=0980115003&amp;ctunit=208&amp;ctnode=287&amp;mp=7 行政院國家科學委員會, National Science Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211192306/http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/techwp.aspx?id=0980115003&amp;ctunit=208&amp;ctnode=287&amp;mp=7 |date=2009-02-11 }}.

[[Bunun people]] call black bears ''Aguman'' or ''Duman'' which means the devil. If a Bunun hunter's trap accidentally traps a bear, he has to build a cottage in the mountains and burn the body of the bear there. He also has to stay in the cottage alone away from the village until the millet harvest is finished. [[Rukai people|Rukai]] and [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] people are allowed to hunt bears, but the hunters have to pay the price of carrying the ancient curse in return. [[Rukai people|Rukai]] people believe hunting bears can result in disease. Also, not every one is allowed to eat bear meat, and children are strictly forbidden to do so. In Taroko ([[Truku people|Truku]]) legend, Formosan black bears are respectful “kings of the forest” whose white marks on their chests represent the moon. The Taroko people believe that killing black bears results in family disaster. In general, among these hunting tribes, hunters of boars are respected as heroes, while hunters of bears are considered losers.&lt;ref name="hunter_and_hunted"/&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:YLS 8822.jpg|thumb|[[Mascot]] of the [[2017 Summer Universiade]] held in [[Taipei]], [[TAIWAN]]]]
From 1998 to 2000, 15 Formosan black bears were captured and radio collared in [[Yushan National Park]]. Reported bear sightings are very infrequent and no one knows exactly how many bears still exist. The species has been legally protected since 1989 but illegal hunting continues and such poaching continues to threaten Formosan black bear populations. For example, eight of fifteen bears captured in the above survey had missing toes or paws, caused by illegal traps.

Since 1989, Formosan black bears have been listed as [[endangered animals]] and protected by Taiwan's ''Cultural Heritage Preservation Law'' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 文化資產保存法). Internationally, this species is listed on [http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml Appendix I] of [[CITES]]. CITES bans all international trade of any products from this species. The Formosan black bear is also on the [[Red List of Threatened Animals|red list]] of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] ([[IUCN]]) which declares that these bears are vulnerable to extinction.

An indigenous [[Bunun people|Bunun]] hunter once said, "If there were no bears in the mountains, the forest would look empty and I would feel lonely." Mei-Hsiu Hwang of Institute of Wildlife Conservation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/index.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109124505/http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/index.asp |date=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a campaigner for black-bear preservation, also said: "We do not wish to lose this soul of Taiwan's mountains. We do not wish our offspring to see them only in the zoo or in history books."

There is still hope for the Formosan black bear. In 2009, Lin Yuan-Yuan (a member of Yushan National Park's black bear conservation group) recorded footage showing a mother bear attempting to help her two cubs cross a rapid near Batongguan Historic Trail (八通關古道) in the eastern section of Tafen (塔芬).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016211640/http://english.ysnp.gov.tw/Publication.aspx?CurrentNodeID=1802&amp;Level=3&amp;PublicID=569 Yushan National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">'''Gravitaxis''' is a form of [[taxis]] characterized by the directional movement of an organism in response to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Gravitaxis|accessdate=25 March 2018|title=Gravitaxis - Biology-Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitaxis is one of the many forms of taxis. It is characterized by the movement of an organism in response to gravitational forces. It is sometimes called geotaxis.&lt;ref name="King Crab"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=C. F.|last2=Paul|first2=A. J.|title=Phototaxis and Geotaxis of Light-Adapted Zoeae of the Golden King Crab Lithodes aequispinus (Anomura: Lithodidae) in the Laboratory|journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology|date=February 1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106|doi=10.2307/1549552|jstor=1549552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitaxis is different from [[gravitropism]] in a way that the latter is more about the growth response of an organism to gravity.

==Taxis==
{{main|Taxis}}
Taxis is a behavioral response of a cell or an organism to an external stimulus. The movement is characteristically directional. The movement may be positive or negative. A positive taxis is one in which the organism or a cell moves towards the source of stimulation (attraction). A negative taxis is when the organism or a cell moves away from the source of stimulation (repulsion).

==Examples==
It can be seen in many [[microorganism]]s including [[Euglena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Häder|first1=DP|last2=Hemmersbach|first2=R|title=Gravitaxis in Euglena.|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|date=2017|volume=979|pages=237–266|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54910-1_12|pmid=28429325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of planktonic larvae of ''Lithodes aequispinus'' (king crab) to gravity is another example of gravitaxis.&lt;ref name="King Crab" /&gt; They show both positive and negative gravitaxes in a way that they move either upward (negative) or downward (positive). Gravitaxis can also be observed in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=JD|last2=Texada|first2=MJ|last3=Munjaal|first3=R|last4=Baker|first4=DA|last5=Beckingham|first5=KM|title=Gravitaxis in Drosophila melanogaster: a forward genetic screen.|journal=Genes, brain, and behavior|date=April 2006|volume=5|issue=3|pages=222–39|doi=10.1111/j.1601-183X.2005.00154.x|pmid=16594976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is coined from ''[[gravity|gravi-]]'' meaning gravity, and ''taxis'' or the [[motility|movement]] of an [[organism]] in response to a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].

'''Hans Christian Ørsted''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜːr|s|t|ɛ|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oersted "Oersted"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-da|hans kʁæsdjan ˈɶɐ̯sdɛð|lang}}; often rendered '''Oersted''' in English; 14 August 1777{{spaced ndash}}9 March 1851) was a Danish [[physics|physicist]] and [[chemistry|chemist]] who discovered that [[electric current]]s create [[magnetic field]]s, which was the first connection found between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. [[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] (Oe) are named after him.

A leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], Ørsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.

==Early life and studies==
[[File:Hans Christian Ørsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young H. C. Ørsted]]
Ørsted was born in [[Rudkøbing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy.&lt;ref name="compilation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/oersted.htm|title=Hans Christian Ørsted |publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796 Ørsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.

In 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired Ørsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801 Ørsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ Inspiration fra Europa - planer i København] Niels Bohr Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany Ørsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to Ørsted as he subscribed to Kantian thought regarding the unity of nature.&lt;ref name="compilation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian, R.M. &amp; Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian Ørsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.

Ørsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812 Ørsted again visited Germany and France after publishing ''Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love'' and ''Første Indledning til den Almindelige Naturlære'' (1811).

Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term ''Gedankenexperiment'' circa 1812 and the German term ''Gedankenversuch'' in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen, J., "H.C. Ørsted, Immanuel Kant and the Thought Experiment", Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, Vol.13, (1976), pp. 48–65.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Electromagnetism==
[[File:17. Естердов експеримент.ogv|thumb|280px|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect Ørsted discovered. Demonstrated by Prof. Oliver Zajkov, Physics Institute at the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], Macedonia.]]
On 21 April 1820, during a lecture, Ørsted noticed a [[compass]] needle deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from a battery was switched on and off, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Ørsted (1997). Karen Jelved, Andrew D. Jackson, and Ole Knudsen, translators from Danish to English. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}}, pp.421-445&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, Roberto de Andrade, "[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V&amp;H%20Sect3/V&amp;H%20245-265.pdf Resistance to the discovery of [[electromagnetism]]: Ørsted and the symmetry of the magnetic field]", in: Fabio Bevilacqua &amp; Enrico Giannetto (eds.), ''Volta and the History of Electricity'', Pavia / Milano, Università degli Studi di Pavia / Editore Ulrico Hoepli, 2003, pp. 245-265. (Collana di Storia della Scienza) {{ISBN|88-203-3284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his discovery, the [[Royal Society of London]] awarded Ørsted the [[Copley Medal]] in 1820 and the French Academy granted him 3,000 [[French francs|francs]].

Ørsted's findings stirred much research into electrodynamics throughout the scientific community, influencing French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's work also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

==Later years==
[[File:Assistens Kirkegård - Hans Christian Ørsted.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone]]
Ørsted was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1822 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter O|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterO.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences, in 1824. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] and the [[European Patent Organisation|Danish Patent and Trademark Office]].
In 1829, Ørsted founded [[Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt]] ('College of Advanced Technology') which was later renamed the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|title=History of DTU|publisher=Technical University of Denmark|accessdate=2009-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902070101/http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, Ørsted made a significant contribution to [[chemistry]] by producing [[aluminium]] for the first time. While an aluminium-iron alloy had previously been developed by [[Humphry Davy]], Ørsted was the first to isolate the element via a reduction of [[aluminium chloride]].

Ørsted died in Copenhagen in 1851, aged 73, and was buried in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
The [[CGS|centimetre-gram-second system (CGS)]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named for his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

===Toponomy===
The [[Ørstedsparken|Ørsted Park]] in Copenhagen was named after Ørsted in 1879. The streets [[H.C. Ørsteds Vej]] in [[Frederiksberg]] and H. C. Ørsteds Allé in [[Galten, Denmark|Galten]] are also named after him.

The buildings that are home to the [[University of Copenhagen Department of Chemistry|Department of Chemistry]] and the [[University of Copenhagen Institute for Mathematical Sciences|Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s [[North Campus (University of Copenhagen)|North Campus]] are named the ''[[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute|H.C. Ørsted Institute]]'', after him. A dormitory named H. C. Ørsted Kollegiet is located in [[Odense]].

The [[Ørsted (satellite)|first Danish satellite]], launched 1999, was named after Ørsted.

===Monuments and memorials===
[[File:Statue of Hans Christian Øersted, Øerstedsparken, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Ørsted in [[Ørstedsparken]], in Copenhagen.]]
A [[The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted|statue of Hans Christian Ørsted]] was installed in the Ørsted Park in 1880. A commemorative plaque is located above the gate on the building in [[Studiestræde]] where he lived and worked. The 100 [[Danish krone|danske kroner]] note issued from 1950 to 1970 carried an engraving of Ørsted.

===Awards and lectures===
Two medals are awarded in Ørsted's name: the [[Oersted Medal]] for notable contributions in the teaching of physics in America, awarded by [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], along with the [[H. C. Ørsted Medal]] for Danish scientists, awarded by the Danish ''Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse'' (Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science), founded by Ørsted. 

The H.C. Ørsted Lectureship is awarded to two prominent researchers annually.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''Hold come what may''' is a phrase popularized by logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. [[Belief]]s that are "held come what may" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.&lt;ref name="Ney"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alyssa Ney|title=Metaphysics: An Introduction|date=13 August 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-67633-1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what may—in other words, that all beliefs are [[rationality|rationally]] revisable ("no statement is immune to revision"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

Many philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the [[laws of thought]] cannot be revised and may be "held come what may". Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a [[web of beliefs]], in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

A closely related concept is '''hold more stubbornly at least''', also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs.  Examples might be laws of [[logic]], or the belief in an external world of physical objects.  Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs.  It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Willard Van Orman |last=Quine |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |title=From a Logical Point of View |edition=2nd revised |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0674323513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to "hold more stubbornly at least".

IHU is affiliated to the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU). The official symbol of the IHU is a version of the [[Happy Human]].

The funding arm of the organisation, the Humanist Endowment Fund Society (HEFS) was established in 1970. Donations are eligible for deduction from taxable income.

IHU publishes a quarterly journal, the ''[[Humanist Outlook]]'' which began publication in 1966.

== Narsingh Narain (Founder IHU) ==
Narsingh Narain (1897–1972) was born on 4 October 1897 in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. In 1960, he founded the Indian Humanist Union, an organisation for promoting [[humanism]]. Narain is one of the main humanist thinkers of twentieth century India. Some of his important essays have been collected in a book titled ''A Commonsense Humanism and Other Essays.''

'''Inversive activities''' are processes which self internalise the action concerned. For example, a person who has an Inversive personality [[Internalization|internalises]] his [[emotion]]s from any exterior source. An inversive heat source would be a heat source where all the heat remains within the object and is not subject to any format of [[transference]] or [[externalisation]].

Is the opposite of Transversive activities and objects which suggest by their very nature that the outcome is transferred to the [[secondary source]].

Kortunefookie's Web site suggest users to send an innermost secret, a smarmiest wisecrack, a private prayer, or an outlandish prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/arts/2009/07/kortunefookie-_get_your_fix/ |title=Kortunefookie- get your fix |publisher=Midnightpoutine.ca |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kortunefookie has two parts: one that utilizes the [[Web 2.0]] to gather the texts from the public, and the other that consists of an interactive [[installation art|sculptural installation]] (the interactive kiosk). The fortunes are submitted by the public via the project’s website then stored into an [[XML]] database. Once moderated, these texts are uploaded on the computer's custom application housed inside the interactive wooden kiosk. This sculptural kiosk is weather proof and designed to be installed just about anywhere outdoors. Anyone visiting the on-site interactive sculpture can push a button and receive a small paper that contains a printed original message. These fortunes are printed using a thermal [[receipt printer]], a type of paper that resembles a retail [[receipt]].

== History ==
Created in 2008 as part of a research creation project funded by the [[Université du Québec en Outaouais|University of Quebec in Outaouais]], the creative team included professor Jean-François Lacombe from the Multidisciplinary Image School and Christian Desjardins, his research assistant and student at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jflacombe.com/ |title=Site de Jean-François Lacombe_auteur, créateur multidisciplinaire et designer graphique qui s'intéresse aux lieux du projet ainsi qu'aux nouvelles formes de communications génératrices de liens sociaux. &amp;#124; S27 |publisher=Jflacombe.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project's ambition was to allow different users to interact and post messages on the public realm. From the beginning, the endeavour intended to be a [[multidisciplinary]] creation that would act both as an art installation and as an interactive medium to communicate. A challenge for the team was to render the complex technology used invisible, letting the experience generated by the device dominate (as describe by [[John Maeda]], in his book The Laws of Simplicity, MIT Press, 2006). As the team wanted a seamless operation and to facilitate the use of the interactive sculpture, a familiar image had to be associated to the new device. After a period of research and development, the team came up with the idea to utilize the image of the fortune cookies.

=== Construction and programming ===
[[File:Kortunefookie open.jpg|thumb|right|Insides of the interactive kiosk.]]
[[File:Kortunefookie team.gif|thumb|right|Kortunefookie's founding team at work]]
Shortly after finalizing the usage design, the construction of the interactive kiosk prototype and then development of the application began simultaneously. The prototype was made with slabs of pink [[Styrofoam]] that measured one and a half inches thick. Once the desired form and scale had been achieved, the model was dismantled so that each Styrofoam layer could be reproduced in wood in the same dimensions. It was then just a matter of assembling all the layers of wood to form the hollow sculpture. Francis Boivin, then a visual arts student at the University of Quebec in Outaouais, greatly contributed to the making of the wooden sculpture. The final fortune cookie sculpture is made entirely from salvaged [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] logs that were once telephone poles. 
[[File:Kortunefookie decoupe.jpg|thumb|Kortunefookie's styrofoam prototype]]
The customized application that prints the fortune was built on a [[Mac Mini]] (1.83&amp;nbsp;GHz Core 2 Duo/1GB/80GB/Combo) with the programming interface [[Cocoa (API)]] and development tools [[Apple Xcode]] and Interface Builder. It was mainly programmed by Justin McKillican. Lastly, speakers were installed inside the fortune cookie so that a 10-second synthesized melody could be heard each time the button was pressed. This also allowed to manage the intervals between each text so that it was impossible for a continuous cascade of paper to be printed.

Finally, using the [[Content management system|CMS]] [[SPIP]], the Web site was conceived to act both as a promotional tool as well as the text collecting interface. In this project, the Web was the obvious “drop point” for messages as it allowed anyone anywhere to participate in the creation of the fortunes. It also permits for the sent messages to be filtered out. Specifically those that were distasteful, promotional, or aimed at specific individuals.

Statistics for the texts so far are:
*French texts received: 641+
*English texts received: 1,312+
*Texts printed: 22,000+

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Kortunefookie toronto.jpg|thumb|Exhibit at La Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, Toronto 2010.]]
For its first showing at the Arts Under The Bridge Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dumboartsfestival.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Dumbo Arts Festival |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City (organized by [[Brooklyn]] artist-run centre DAC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dumboartscenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), the project was entitled SensGoodKarma. However, this title restricted the editorial line as well as the public’s scope for intervention. Several brainstorming sessions to find a new name proved fruitless until, one evening in 2009, Chris Zeke Hand exclaimed,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeke.com/tag/kortunefookie/ |title=KortuneFookie |publisher=zeke.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; “''Kortunefookie!''”, inspiring the permanent name of the project.

== Objectives and critical perspective ==
The objective of the project, as stated by its creator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jflacombe.com/?p=1526 |title=Quelle image les gens se font-ils de la ville? &amp;#124; S27 |publisher=Jflacombe.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the establishment of a communication tool that would act as an ''intermediary'' between the public’s imagination and that of its users. Kortunefookie was a kind of a contemporary [[divination]] device, allowing thousands of users to share and come in contact with an intimate thought of someone else. This necessity for communication, or the intimacy of communication as proposed by Kortunefookie,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; is reiterated by François Chalifour :&lt;br /&gt;
«Isolation is unattractive, it bothers us. It holds up traffic. To correct the situation, we must fill the space that separates things, beings. Communication, for as long as it has existed, has proved to be a privileged means of closing this chasm: attract attention, open the channels of communication, exchange the message. In all sorts of ways, Lacombe’s odd-looking box, lying by the side of the road outside an art gallery, speaks to us of a trend whose results remain, to this day, ambiguous. Have we bridged the gap, have we filled the void, have we crossed the gulf that separates us? Jean-François Lacombe is working on it.»

The '''mass-to-charge ratio''' (''m''/''Q'') is a [[physical quantity]] that is most widely used in the [[electrodynamics]] of charged particles, e.g. in electron optics and [[ion optics]].  It appears in the scientific fields of [[electron microscopy]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[accelerator physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[Auger electron spectroscopy]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="M03752"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=mass-to-charge ratio, m/z in mass spectrometry|file=M03752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of the mass-to-charge ratio, according to classical electrodynamics, is that two particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path in a vacuum , when subjected to the same electric and magnetic fields. Its SI units are [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Coulomb|C]]. In rare occasions the [[Thomson (unit)|thomson]] has been used as its unit in the field of mass spectrometry.

Some fields use the '''charge-to-mass''' ratio (''Q''/''m'') instead, which is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of the mass-to-charge ratio.  The 2014 CODATA recommended value for an [[electron]] is {{frac|''Q''|''m''}} = {{val|-1.758820024|(11)|e=11|u=C/kg}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?esme electron charge to mass quotient]. NIST Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

When charged particles move in electric and magnetic fields the following two laws apply:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = Q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|([[Lorentz force]] law)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a} = m \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|([[Newton's second law]] of motion)
|}

where '''F''' is the [[force]] applied to the ion, ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the particle, '''a''' is the [[acceleration]], ''Q'' is the [[electric charge]], '''E''' is the [[electric field]], and '''v''' &amp;times; '''B''' is the [[cross product]] of the ion's [[velocity]] and the [[magnetic flux density]].

This differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of ''m''/''Q''. Thus [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] could be thought of as "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When presenting data in a [[mass spectrum]], it is common to use the dimensionless ''m''/''z'', which denotes the dimensionless quantity formed by dividing the mass number of the ion by its charge number.&lt;ref name="M03752" /&gt;

Combining the two previous equations yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{m}{Q}\right)\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

This differential equation is the classic equation of motion of a charged particle in vacuum. Together with the particle's initial conditions it determines the particle's motion in space and time.  It immediately reveals that two particles with the same ''m''/''Q'' ratio behave in the same way. This is why the mass-to-charge ratio is an important physical quantity in those scientific fields where charged particles interact with magnetic or electric fields.

=== Exceptions ===

There are non-classical effects that derive from [[quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment|Stern–Gerlach effect]] that can diverge the path of ions of identical ''m''/''Q''.

== Symbols and units ==
The IUPAC recommended symbol for mass and charge are ''m'' and ''Q'', respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; however using a lowercase ''q'' for charge is also very common. Charge is a scalar property, meaning that it can be either [[positive number|positive]] (+) or [[negative number|negative]] (&amp;minus;). The [[Coulomb]] (C) is the SI unit of charge; however, other units can be used, such as expressing charge in terms of the [[elementary charge]] (e). The [[SI unit]] of the physical quantity ''m''/''Q'' is kilogram per coulomb.

===Mass spectrometry and ''m''/''z''===
{{main|Mass spectrum}}
The units and notation above are used when dealing with the physics of mass spectrometry; however, the ''m''/''z'' notation is used for the independent variable in a [[mass spectrum]].&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite book | title=IUPAC.

An example might help.|date=July 2018}} data interpretation since it is numerically more related to the [[unified atomic mass unit]].&lt;ref name="M03752" /&gt; The ''m'' refers to the molecular or atomic mass number and ''z'' to the [[charge number]] of the [[ion]]; however, the quantity of ''m''/''z'' is dimensionless by definition.&lt;ref name="IUPAC" /&gt; An ion of 100 atomic mass units (''m'' = 100) carrying two charges (''z'' = 2) will be observed at ''m''/''z'' = 50.

== History ==
In the 19th century, the mass-to-charge ratios of some ions were measured by electrochemical methods. In 1897, the mass-to-charge ratio of the [[electron]] was first measured by [[J. J. Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/thomson1897.html J. J. Thomson (1856–1940)] Philosophical Magazine, 44, 293 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, he showed that the electron was in fact a particle with a mass and a charge, and that its mass-to-charge ratio was much smaller than that of the hydrogen ion H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1898, [[Wilhelm Wien]] separated ions ([[canal ray]]s) according to their mass-to-charge ratio with an ion optical device with superimposed electric and magnetic fields ([[Wien filter]]). In 1901 [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufman]] measured the increase of [[electromagnetic mass]] of fast electrons ([[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]), or [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] increase in modern terms. In 1913, Thomson measured the mass-to-charge ratio of [[ion]]s with an instrument he called a parabola spectrograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html Joseph John Thomson (1856–1940)] Proceedings of the Royal Society A 89, 1–20 (1913) [as excerpted in Henry A. Boorse &amp; Lloyd Motz, The World of the Atom, Vol. 1 (New York: Basic Books, 1966)]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, an instrument that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles is called a [[mass spectrometer]].

==Charge-to-mass ratio==

[[File:Mass spectrometer large print.svg|thumb|160px|'''B''' is uniform throughout; '''E''' exists only where shown.]]
The '''charge-to-mass ratio''' (''Q''/''m'') of an object is, as its name implies, the [[electric charge|charge]] of an object divided by the mass of the same object.  This quantity is generally useful only for objects that may be treated as particles.  For extended objects, total charge, charge density, total mass, and mass density are often more useful.

Derivation:

&lt;math&gt;qvB=mv\frac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{Br}&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Since &lt;math&gt;F_{electric}=F_{magnetic}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;Eq=Bqv&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v=\frac{E}{B}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Equations (1) and (2) yield

&lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{m}=\frac{E}{B^2r}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Significance ===
In some experiments, the charge-to-mass ratio is the only quantity that can be measured directly.  Often, the charge can be inferred from theoretical considerations, so that the charge-to-mass ratio provides a way to calculate the mass of a particle.

Often, the charge-to-mass ratio can be determined from observing the deflection of a charged particle in an external [[magnetic]] field.  The [[cyclotron]] equation, combined with other information such as the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle, will give the charge-to-mass ratio. One application of this principle is the mass spectrometer.  The same principle can be used to extract information in experiments involving the [[cloud chamber]].

The ratio of electrostatic to gravitational forces between two particles will be proportional to the product of their charge-to-mass ratios.  It turns out that gravitational forces are negligible on the subatomic level, due to the extremely small masses of subatomic particles.

=== The electron ===

The elementary charge-to-electron mass quotient, &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt;, is a quantity in experimental physics.  It bears significance because the electron mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to measure directly, and is instead derived from measurements of the elementary charge e and &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt;.  It also has historical significance; the ''Q''/''m'' ratio of the electron was successfully calculated by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897—and more successfully by Dunnington, which involves the [[angular momentum]] and deflection due to a perpendicular [[magnetic field]]. Thomson's measurement convinced him that [[cathode ray]]s were particles, which were later identified as [[electron]]s, and he is generally credited with their discovery.

The 2014 [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology|CODATA]] recommended value is &lt;math&gt;e/m_{e}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|fmt=commas|-1.758820024|(11)|e=11|u=[[Coulomb|C]]/[[kilogram|kg]]}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; CODATA refers to this as the '''electron charge-to-mass quotient''', but '''ratio''' is still commonly used.

There are two other common ways of measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron, apart from Thomson and Dunnington's methods.

#The magnetron method: Using a GRD7 Valve ([[Ferranti valve]]),{{dubious|date=November 2010}} electrons are expelled from a hot tungsten-wire filament towards an anode. The electron is then deflected using a solenoid. From the current in the solenoid and the current in the Ferranti Valve, e/m can be calculated.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
#Fine beam tube method: A heater heats a cathode, which emits electrons.  The electrons are accelerated through a known potential, so the velocity of the electrons is known.  The beam path can be seen when the electrons are accelerated through a helium (He) gas.  The collisions between the electrons and the helium gas produce a visible trail.  A pair of [[Helmholtz coil]]s produces a uniform and measurable magnetic field at right angles to the electron beam.  This magnetic field deflects the electron beam in a circular path.  By measuring the accelerating potential (volts), the current (amps) to the Helmholtz coils, and the radius of the electron beam, e/m can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;PASCO scientific, Instruction Manual and Experimental guide for the PASCO scientific Model SE-9638, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeeman Effect===
The charge-to-mass ratio of an electron may also be measured with the [[Zeeman effect]], which gives rise to energy splittings in the presence of a [[magnetic field]] ''B'':
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m}(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i})&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are quantum integer values ranging from -''j'' to ''j'', with ''j'' as the [[eigenvalue]] of the [[total angular momentum]] [[operator (physics)|operator]] '''J''', with&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''S''' is the [[Spin (physics)|spin operator]] with eigenvalue ''s'' and '''L''' is  the [[angular momentum operator]] with eigenvalue ''l''. ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Landé g-factor]], calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;g_J = 1 + \frac{j(j+1) + s(s+1) - l(l+1)}{2j(j+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The shift in energy is also given in terms of [[frequency]] ''&amp;nu;'' and [[wavelength]] ''&amp;lambda;'' as

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = h\Delta\nu = h c \Delta \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right ) = hc \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Measurements of the Zeeman effect commonly involve the use of a [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]], with light from a source (placed in a magnetic field) being passed between two mirrors of the interferometer. If ''&amp;delta;D'' is the change in mirror separation required to bring the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order ring of wavelength ''λ'' + ''Δλ'' into coincidence with that of wavelength ''λ'', and ''ΔD'' brings the (''m'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ring of wavelength ''λ'' into coincidence with the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order ring, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda = \lambda^2\frac{\delta D}{2D\Delta D}&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows then that

:&lt;math&gt;hc\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda^2} = hc\frac{\delta D}{2D\Delta D} = \frac{e\hbar B}{2m}(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i}) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, it is possible to solve for the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{m} = \frac{4 \pi c}{B(m_{j,f}g_{J,f}-m_{j,i}g_{J,i})}\frac{\delta D}{D\Delta D} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Recycling Video.webm|thumb|Video of recycling facility and processes.|thumb|Clean materials recovery facility recycling video.]]

A '''materials recovery facility''', '''materials reclamation facility''', '''materials recycling facility''' or '''Multi re-use facility''' ('''MRF''', pronounced "murf") is a specialized plant that receives, separates and prepares recyclable materials for marketing to end-user manufacturers. Generally, there are two different types: '''clean''' and '''dirty''' materials recovery facilities.

== Clean MRF ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Modern UK Material Recovery Facility.JPG|thumb|A REDOX '''materials recovery facility''' in the UK, with automated size and density separation processes and manual sorting in separate cabins that offers a clean, quiet and ergonomic work environment]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Modern UK Material Recovery Facility2.JPG|thumb|Modern '''materials recovery facilities''' can be clean &amp; safe places]] --&gt;

A ''clean MRF'' accepts [[recycling|recyclable]] comingled materials that have already been separated at the source from [[municipal solid waste]] generated by either residential or commercial sources. There are a variety of clean MRFs. The most common are [[Single-stream recycling|single stream]] where all recyclable material is mixed, or dual stream MRFs, where source-separated recyclables are delivered in a mixed container stream (typically glass, [[ferrous metal]], [[aluminum]] and other non-ferrous metals, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [No.1] and [[High density polyethylene|HDPE]] [No.2] plastics) and a mixed paper stream including corrugated cardboard boxes, newspapers, magazines, office paper and junk mail. Material is sorted to specifications, then baled, shredded, crushed, compacted, or otherwise prepared for shipment to market.

== Mixed-waste processing facility (MWPF)/ Dirty MRF ==
[[File:TriagemDeLixo.jpg|thumb|Manual material triage for recycling.]]

A mixed-waste processing system, sometimes referred to as a dirty MRF, accepts a mixed solid waste stream and then proceeds to separate out designated recyclable materials through a combination of manual and mechanical sorting.  The sorted recyclable materials may undergo further processing required to meet technical specifications established by end-markets while the balance of the [[mixed waste]] stream is sent to a disposal facility such as a [[landfill]]. Today, MWPFs are attracting renewed interest as a way to address low participation rates for source-separated recycling collection systems and prepare fuel products and/or feedstocks for conversion technologies. MWPFs can give communities the opportunity to recycle at much higher rates than has been demonstrated by curbside or other waste collection systems. Advances in technology make today’s MWPF different and, in many respects better, than older versions. &lt;ref&gt;[https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/Education-Resources/Publications/The-Evolution-of-Mixed-Waste-Processing-Facilities.pdf] Gershman, Brickner &amp; Bratton, Inc., American Chemistry Council, (2015) The Evolution of Mixed Waste Processing Facilities 1970-Today&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of residuals (unrecoverable recyclable or non-program materials) from a properly operated clean MRF supported by an effective public outreach and education program should not exceed 10% by weight of the total delivered stream and in many cases it can be significantly below 5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  A dirty MRF recovers between 5% and 45% of the incoming material as recyclables,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} then the remainder is landfilled or otherwise disposed.  A dirty MRF can be capable of higher recovery rates than a clean MRF, since it ensures that 100% of the waste stream is subjected to the sorting process, and can target a greater number of materials for recovery than can usually be accommodated by sorting at the source. However, the dirty MRF process results in greater contamination of recyclables, especially of paper. Furthermore, a facility that accepts mixed solid waste is usually more challenging and more expensive to site. Operational costs can be higher because it is  more labor-intensive.

=== Wet MRF ===
[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|A wet materials recovery facility]]
Around 2004, new [[mechanical biological treatment]] technologies were beginning to utilise ''wet MRFs''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/HarrogateProceedings.pdf ArrowBio Process] Finstein, M. S., Zadik, Y., Marshall, A. T. &amp; Brody, D.

Papadimitriou &amp; E. I. Stentiford), Technology and Service Providers Forum, p. 407-413&lt;/ref&gt; These combine a dirty MRF with water, which acts to densify, separate and clean the output streams. It also hydrocrushes and dissolves biodegradable organics in solution to make them suitable for [[anaerobic digestion]].

{{Lead too short|date=November 2009}}
The doctrine of '''mental reservation''', or of '''mental equivocation''', was a special branch of [[casuistry]] (case-based reasoning) developed in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], and most often associated with the [[Jesuits]].

==Secular use==
Mental reservation is a form of [[deception]] which is not an outright [[lie]]. It was argued for in [[moral theology]], and now in [[ethics]], as a way to fulfill obligations both to tell the truth and to keep secrets from those not entitled to know them (for example, because of the [[Seal of the Confessional and the Catholic Church|seal of the confessional]] or other clauses of [[confidentiality]]). Mental reservation, however, is regarded as unjustifiable without grave reason for withholding the truth. This condition was necessary to preserve a general idea of [[truth]] in social relations.

In '''wide mental reservation''', [[equivocation]]s and [[amphibology|amphibologies]] are used to imply an untruth that is not actually stated. In '''strict mental reservation''', the speaker mentally adds some qualification to the words which they utter, and the words together with the mental qualification make a true assertion in accordance with fact.

A frequently cited example of equivocation is a well-known incident from the life of [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. When [[Julian the Apostate]] was seeking Athanasius's death, Athanasius fled Alexandria and was pursued up the [[Nile]]. Seeing the imperial officers were gaining on him, Athanasius took advantage of a bend in the river that hid his boat from its pursuers and ordered his boat turned around. When the two boats crossed paths, the Roman officers shouted out, asking if anyone had seen Athanasius. As instructed by Athanasius, his followers shouted back, "Yes, he is not very far off." The pursuing boat hastily continued up the river, while Athanasius returned to Alexandria, where he remained in hiding until the end of the persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Newman]]. [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia65/noteg.html ''Apologia pro Vita Sua'', Note G: Lying and Equivocation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another anecdote often used to illustrate equivocation concerns [[Francis of Assisi]]. He once saw a man fleeing from a murderer.  When the murderer then came upon Francis, he demanded to know if his quarry had passed that way. Francis answered, "He did not pass this way," sliding his forefinger into the sleeve of his [[cassock]], thus misleading the murderer and saving a life.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorin, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this anecdote is cited by the [[canonist]] [[Martin de Azpilcueta]] to illustrate his doctrine of a mixed speech (''oratoria mixta'') combining [[speech]] and [[gestural]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin de Azpilcueta]] Azpilcueta, Martin, (Navarra), ''Commentarius in cap. Humanae Aures, XXII. qu. V. De veritate responsi; partim verbo expresso, partim mente concepti. &amp; de arte bona &amp; mala simulandi'', Roma, 1584. Quoted by J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales : le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', published in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international « La raison rusée », Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, p. 93&amp;ndash;118 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible contains a good example of equivocation. [[Abraham]] was married to Sarah/Sarai, his half-sister by a different mother. Fearing that as he traveled people would covet his beautiful wife and as a result kill him to take her, he counselled her to agree with him when he would say that "she is my sister." This happened on two occasions, first with the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt, told in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:11-13, and second, with a king called Abimelech in Gen 20:12.

==''Mentalis restrictio'' in moral theology==
The 16th-century Spanish theologian [[Martin de Azpilcueta]] (often called "Navarrus" because he was born in the Kingdom of [[Navarre]]) wrote at length about the doctrine of ''mentalis restrictio'' or mental reservation. Navarrus held that mental reservation involved truths "expressed partly in speech and partly in the mind," relying upon the idea that God hears what is in one's mind while human beings hear only what one speaks. Therefore, the Christian's moral duty was to tell the truth to God. Reserving some of that truth from the ears of human hearers was moral if it served a greater good. This is the doctrine of '''strict mental reservation'''. A user of the doctrine could reply aloud "I know not" to a human interlocutor, and "to tell you" silently to God, and still be telling the truth (''stricte mentalis'').

Traditionally, the doctrine of mental reservation was intimately linked with the concept of [[equivocation]], which allowed the speaker to employ double meanings of words to tell the ''literal'' truth while concealing a deeper meaning. Navarrus, however, went beyond this, giving the doctrine of mental reservation a far broader and more liberal interpretation than had anyone up to that time. Although some other Catholic theological thinkers and writers took up the argument in favor of strict mental reservation, the concept remained controversial within the Roman Catholic Church, which never officially endorsed or upheld the doctrine and eventually condemned it.

The linked doctrines of mental reservation and equivocation became notorious in England during the [[Elizabethan era]] and the [[Jacobean era]], when Jesuits who had entered  England to minister to the spiritual needs of Catholics were captured by the authorities. The Jesuits [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]] (c. 1561&amp;ndash;1595) (who was also a poet of note) and [[Henry Garnet]] (1555&amp;ndash;1606) both wrote treatises on the topic, which was of far more than academic interest to them. Both risked their lives bringing the sacraments to [[recusancy|recusant]] Catholics&amp;nbsp;— and not only ''their'' lives, since sheltering a priest was a capital offence.&lt;ref name=Kaveny&gt;Cathleen Kaveny. [http://www.faqs.org/periodicals/201001/1938473571.html "Truth or Consequences: In Ireland, Straying Far from the Mental Reservation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807064945/http://www.faqs.org/periodicals/201001/1938473571.html |date=2010-08-07 }}. ''Commonweal'', January 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1586, [[Margaret Clitherow]] had been [[peine forte et dure|pressed]] to death for refusing to enter a plea on the charge of harbouring two priests at York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/york-margaret-clitherow-shrine.htm Margaret Clitherow Shrine, York].&lt;/ref&gt; When caught, tortured and interrogated, Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation not to save themselves&amp;nbsp;— their deaths were a foregone conclusion&amp;nbsp;— but to protect their fellow believers.&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt;

Southwell, who was arrested in 1592, was accused at his trial of having told a witness that even if she was forced by the authorities to swear under oath, it was permissible to lie to conceal the whereabouts of a priest. Southwell replied that that was not what he had said. He had said that "to an oath were required justice, judgement and truth", but the rest of his answer goes unrecorded because one of the judges angrily shouted him down.&lt;ref&gt;Fiorella Sultana De Maria. ''Robert Southwell''. London: CTS, 2003, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicted in 1595, Southwell was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet, who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his alleged involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. Facing the same accusations as Southwell, his attempts to defend himself met with no better result: later that year Garnet was executed in the same fashion.

The [[Protestantism|Protestants]] considered these doctrines as mere justifications for lies. Catholic ethicists also voiced objections: the [[Jansenist]] "[[Blaise Pascal]]...attacked the Jesuits in the seventeenth century for what he saw as their moral laxity."&lt;ref&gt;Randal, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1679, the doctrine of strict mental reservation put forward by Navarrus had become such a scandal that [[Pope Innocent XI]] officially condemned it."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Other casuists justifying mental reservation included [[Thomas Sanchez]], who was criticized by Pascal in his ''[[Provincial Letters]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; although Sanchez added various restrictions (it should not be used in ordinary circumstances, when one is interrogated by competent magistrates, when a [[creed]] is requested, even for [[heresy|heretics]], etc.), which were ignored by Pascal. Of the 26 theses condemned by [[Pope Innocent XI]], several were in Sanchez's works (see op. mor. in præc. Decalogi, III, vi, n. 15). One of them stated:

{{cquote|If anyone, by himself, or before others, whether under examination or of his own accord, whether for amusement or for any other purpose, should swear that he has not done something which he has really done, having in mind something else which he has not done, or some way of doing it other than the way he employed, or anything else that is true: he does not lie nor perjure himself.}}

This type of equivocation was famously mocked in the porter's speech in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', in which the porter directly alludes to the practice of deceiving under oath by means of equivocation.

{{cquote|Faith, here's an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. (''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 3)}}

See, for example [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]] and [[Henry Garnet]], author of ''A Treatise of Equivocation'' (published secretly c. 1595)—to whom, it is supposed, Shakespeare was specifically referring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Shakespeare made the reference to priests because the religious use of equivocation was well known in those periods of early modern England (e.g. under [[James VI and I|James VI/I]]) when it was a capital offence for a Roman Catholic priest to enter England.  A Jesuit priest would equivocate in order to protect himself from the secular authorities without (in his eyes) committing the sin of lying. For example, he could use the ambiguity of the word "a" (meaning "any" or "one") to say "I swear I am not a priest", because he could have a particular priest in mind who he was not.  That is, in his mind, he was saying "I swear I am not one priest" (e.g. "I am not Father Brown".)

According to [[#{{harvid|Malloch|Huntley|1966}}|Malloch and Huntley (1966)]], this doctrine of permissible "equivocation" did not originate with the Jesuits. They cite a short treatise, ''{{lang|la|in cap. Humanae aures}}'', that had been written by [[Martin Azpilcueta]] (also known as Doctor Navarrus), an [[Augustinian]] who was serving as a consultant to the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malloch|first1=A. E.|last2=Huntley|first2=Frank L.|title=Some Notes on Equivocation|journal=PMLA|volume=81|issue=1|date=Mar 1966|pages=145&amp;ndash;6|doi=10.2307/461317|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Rome in 1584. The first [[Jesuit]] influence upon this doctrine was not until 1609, "when Suarez rejected Azpilcueta's basic proof and supplied another" (speaking of [[Francisco Suárez]]).

Following Innocent XI's condemnation of strict mental reservation, equivocation (or wide mental reservation) was still considered orthodox, and was revived and defended by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]. The Jesuit [[Gabriel Daniel]] wrote in 1694 ''Entretiens de [[Cleanthes|Cleanthe]] et d'[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxe]] sur les lettres provinciales'', a reply to Pascal's ''Provincial Letters'' in which he accused Pascal of lying, or even of having himself used mental reservation, by not mentioning all the restrictions imposed by Sanchez on the use of this form of deception.

==Legacy==

===Kant and Constant===
This type of untruth was condemned by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] in ''On a supposed 'right to lie’''. Kant was debating against [[Benjamin Constant]], who had claimed, from a [[consequentialist]] stance opposed to Kant's [[categorical imperative]], that:
{{cquote|To tell the truth is thus a duty; but it is only in respect to one who has a right to the truth. But no one has a right to a truth which injures others.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Stapleton, "[http://www.cfh.ufsc.br/ethic@/ETICA5.PRN.pdf Is Kantian Ethics Left Defenseless in the Face of Evil?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, Kant asserted, in the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty) because it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it is universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies (this last clause was accepted by casuists, hence the reasons for restrictions given to the cases where deception was authorized).&lt;ref name=Cavaille/&gt; The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in himself. And the theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences. However, it was permissible to remain silent or say no more than needed (such as in the infamous example of a murderer asking to know where someone is).

===Others===
The doctrines have also been criticized by [[Sissela Bok]]&lt;ref&gt;Bok, pp. 35&amp;ndash;7 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Paul Ekman]], who defines lies by omission as the main form of lying&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; though larger and more complex moral and ethical issues of [[Lie|lying]] and [[truth]]-telling extend far beyond these specific doctrines. Ekman, however, does not consider cases of deception where "it is improper to question" the truth as real form of deceptions&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ekman]], [https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Why-Dont-We-Catch-Liars.pdf "Why Don't We Catch Liars?"], ''Social Research'', Vol. 63, No. 3 (Fall 1996), pp. 801–817.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; this sort of case, where communication of truth is not to be expected and so deception is justified, was included by casuists.&lt;ref name=Cavaille&gt;J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales : le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', published in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international « La raison rusée », Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, p. 93&amp;ndash;118 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]] famously equivocated, during his trial during the [[Lewinsky scandal]], "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is."

[[Social psychology|Social psychologist]]s have advanced cases&lt;ref&gt;Janet Beavin Bavelas, Alex Black, Nicole Chovil, and Jennifer Mullet, ''Equivocal Communications'', Newbury Park, CA, Sage Publications, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; where the actor is confronted with an [[avoidance-avoidance conflict]], in which he both doesn't want to say the truth and doesn't want to make an outright lie; in such circumstances, equivocal statements are generally preferred. This type of equivocation has been defined as “nonstraightforward communication...ambiguous, contradictory, tangential, obscure or even evasive.”&lt;ref&gt;Bavelas et al., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; People typically equivocate when posed a question to which all of the possible replies have potentially negative  consequences, yet a reply is still expected (the situational theory of communicative conflict).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Peter Bull]], [http://www.ils.uw.edu.pl/PL2007/pliki/1181989221Peter%20Bull.pdf Equivocation and Facework in the Discourse of Televised Political Interviews].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ireland===
The [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Irish Catholic Church]] allegedly misused the concept of mental reservation when dealing with situations relating to [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland|clerical child sexual abuse]], by disregarding the restrictions placed on its employment by moral theologians and treating it as a method that "allows clerics (to) mislead people...without being guilty of lying",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1126/breaking86.htm "Church 'lied without lying'"], ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; for example when dealing with the police, victims, civil authorities and media. In the [[Murphy Report]] into the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin]], Cardinal [[Desmond Connell]] describes it thus:

{{cquote|Well, the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie. On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be&amp;nbsp;– permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying.}}

[[Cathleen Kaveny]], writing in the Catholic magazine ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', notes that Henry Garnet in his treatise on the topic took pains to argue that no form of mental reservation was justified&amp;nbsp;— and might even be a [[mortal sin]]&amp;nbsp;— if it would run contrary to the requirements of faith, charity or justice.&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt; But according to the Murphy Report:

{{cquote|The Dublin Archdiocese's preoccupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The archdiocese did not implement its own [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon-law]] rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the state.}}

Kaveny concludes: "The truths of faith are illuminated by the lives of the [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation to save innocent victims while sacrificing themselves. The Irish prelates practiced mental reservation to save themselves while sacrificing innocent victims. And that difference makes all the difference."&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt;

'''Pancha Bhoota''' or '''Pancha Maha-Bhoota''' ({{lang-sa|पञ्चभूत}}, {{lang|sa|पञ्चमहाभूत}}), five great elements, also five physical elements, is a group of five basic elements, which, according to [[Hinduism]], 
is the basis of all cosmic creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are: '''[[Prithvi]]/[[Bhudevi]]''' (Hindi: पृथ्वी, [[Earth]]), '''[[Ap (water)|Apas]]/[[Varuna]]/[[Jal]]{{dn|date=May 2018}}''' (Hindi: अप्, [[Water]]), '''[[Agni]]''' (Hindi: अग्नि, [[Fire]]), '''[[Vayu]]''' (Hindi: वायु, [[Air]]), '''[[Aakash]]/[[Dyaus]]''' (Hindi: आकाश, [[aether (classical element)|Aether]]). These elements have different characteristics and these also account for different faculties of human experience. In ''[[ayurveda]]'' and Indian philosophy, the human body is considered to be made of these five elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Venkatesan|first1=Satish|title=Ayurvedic remedies: An introduction|isbn=978-9881224149|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vVfGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=panch+bhoota#v=onepage&amp;q=panch%20bhoota&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cārvāka]] did not accept ''Akash'' as basic element as it is not tangible and according to him, there are only four basic elements.&lt;ref name=BDR&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prasad Sinha|first1=Harendra|title=Bharatiya Darshan Ki Rooprekha|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publisher|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wCAqc1G8sKcC&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A+%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4#v=onepage&amp;q=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015|isbn=9788120821446|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] also accepts four basic elements and ''Akash'' is left out.

==Description==
{{Further|The 36 tattvas}}

The ''pancha bhoota'' are associated with a sense which is perceived by sense organ in human being. Below table gives details of associated sense, sense organ, and other attributes of elements.&lt;ref name=BDR /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|}

==Ayurveda==
According to [[ayurveda]] and [[Yoga]], ''Pancha Bhoota'' are associated with overall health of human being. Any disorder in human body indicates imbalance of one or more of these elements. ''Yoga Tattva Mudra Vijnana'' relates these five elements to five fingers of human being. Different ''Mudra'' were developed to balance these&lt;ref&gt;Five Elements [http://gyanpro.com/blog/panchabhutas-5-elements-of-life-with-reference-to-vedic-text-and-illuminati/"]&lt;/ref&gt; in human body which form the ''Hasta Mudra'' in yogic tradition and are used in [[Naturopathy]].

The three ''dosha''- three intrinsic tendencies, which, according to [[ayurveda]] are intrinsic in every human being, are representation of combination of these five elements in human body. The three ''Dosha'' have subtle positive essences which control the mind and body function.&lt;ref name=IS&gt;{{cite web|title=PANCHA BHOOTAS OR THE FIVE ELEMENTS|url=http://www.indianscriptures.com/vedic-lifestyle/beginners-guide/pancha-bhootas-or-the-five-elements|website=http://www.indianscriptures.com/|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|''Pitta'' || ''Agni'', ''Jal/Apas'' || ''Tejas'' 
|-
|''Kapha'' || ''Prithvi'', ''Jal/Apas'' || ''Ojas''
|}

==Yogic View==
According to ''[[Yoga]]'', the aim of ''sadhana'' is to have mastery over oneself. This mastery can be achieved by mastering all the basic elements. The process of gaining mastery over these elements and purifying them is called ''Bhuta Shuddhi''.
''[[Pancha Bhoota Stalam]]'' is representation of ''pancha bhoota'' for yogic practice. People used to move from one temple
to another and do ''sadhana'' on particular basic element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pancha-bhutas-the-possibility-of-the-five-elements|url=http://www.ishafoundation.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/pancha-bhutas-the-possibility-of-the-five-elements/|website=http://www.ishafoundation.org|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven ''[[Chakra]]'' in human body are associated with these five elements.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt; 

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|''Sahasrara Chakra'' || ''Akash'' || Oneness
|}

==Hasta Mudras==
{{Further|List of mudras (yoga)}}

''Hasta Mudra'' or hand posture is based on the ''panch bhootas''. The basic assumption is that all the five elements can be represented by five different fingers in human body as shown in the table below.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Shiv|title=Brilliance of Hinduism|isbn=978-8128800825|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uajPVNSwYOUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=fingers+and+associated+element+hinduism#v=onepage&amp;q=fingers%20and%20associated%20element%20hinduism&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 April 2015|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
|''Kanishthika'', Little Finger || ''Jal/Apas'' 
|-
|''Anamika'',  Ring Finger || ''Prithvi'' 
|-
|''Madhyama'', Middle Finger || ''Akash'' 
|-
|''Tarjani'',  Index Finger || ''Vayu'' 
|-
|''Angustha'', Thumb|| ''Agni'' 
|}

==Vastu==
{{Further|Vastu shastra}}

[[Vastu shastra]] emphasizes on the placement of five elements in specified direction and the balance of these elements determines the condition of the associated structure.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!''Bhoota'' !! Associated Direction || Characteristics 
|-
|''Akasha/Dyaus'' || East || Expansion, enhancement 
|-
|''Vayu/Pavan'' || North || Movements, joy, happiness 
|-
|''Agni'' || South || Power, confidence, fame
|-
|''Jal/Apas/Varuna'' || West || Spirituality, ideas, thoughts, healing 
|-
|''Prithvi/Bhumi'' ||  Center, Diagonal  || Stability, peace and harmony
|}

That is why, in an ideal home, the home itself is placed so that maximum load and weight is in the southwest area of the plot. Thus, there is maximum open space in the North, Northeast and East side of the plot (satisfying Vayu / Air and Akasha / Space)

The entrance to the plot (Main Gate), the Verandah (visitors lounge), and the Main Door is in the Northeast, for the cosmic benefits of Akasha and the purifying benefits of fresh air enter the house in abundance.

To the south of the Verandah is the Living Room, and to its south is 1 or 2 bedrooms (with / without bathrooms)

To the south or southwest of the room is the storeroom (for benefits of Prithvi / Bhumi), and in the Southeast corner of the home is the Kitchen (for here is the perfect balance of Akash (Space) and Agni (Fire)

To the south of the Kitchen is the backyard (but care should be taken to ensure there is NO DOOR in the south to the backyard, it will lead to loss of Vasthu energy)

To the west of the kitchen should be the Master bedroom (and care should be taken to ensure that bathroom IS NOT in the Southwest corner of the room)

To the north of the master bedroom will be the pooja room, and to its north will be a utility area / common bathroom or staircase room to the first floor etc

==Taste==
Combination of pancha bhoota is associated with six human tastes as below.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!''Taste'' !! Associated Bhoota
|-
|Sweet || ''jal, prithvi' (Earth and Water)
|-
|Sour || ''Prithvi, Agni'' (Earth and Fire)
|-
|Salty || ''Jal, Agni'' (Water and Fire)
|-
|Pungent || ''Vayu, Agni'' (Air and Fire)
|-
|Bitter ||akash swaraj
|-
|Astringent || ''vayu pritvi'' (Air and Earth)

The prefix ''[[wikt:pan-|pan-]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for "all, every", ''πᾶν''; ''[[wikt:omni-|omni-]]'' comes from the Latin word for "all", ''omnis''. The [[hybrid word]]s ''pansexual'' and ''pansexualism'' were first attested in 1917, denoting the idea "that [[Libido|the sex instinct]] plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical",&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pansexual |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reproach (credited to [[Sigmund Freud]]) levelled at early [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another early definition was "the pervasion of all conduct and experience with sexual emotions"; as in ''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pansexualism The Free Dictionary]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A literal [[denotation|dictionary definition]] of ''[[bisexuality]]'', due to the prefix ''[[wikt:bi-#English|bi-]]'', is sexual or romantic attraction to two [[sex]]es ([[male]]s and [[female]]s), or to two [[gender]]s ([[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]]).&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |url=http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99 |archivedate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043203/http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefix ''[[wikt:pan-#English|pan-]]'', is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender. Using these definitions, pansexuality is defined differently by explicitly including people who are [[intersex]] or outside the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;

Go Ask Alice! states that pansexuals can be attracted to [[cisgender]], [[transgender]], intersex and [[Androgyny|androgynous]] people, and that the term ''pansexual'' "is generally considered a more inclusive term than ''bisexual.''"&lt;ref name="Bi-Gay-Pansexual"/&gt; Volume 2 of [[Marshall Cavendish|Cavendish]]'s ''Sex and Society'', however, states that "although the term's literal meaning can be interpreted as 'attracted to everything,' people who identify as pansexual do not usually include [[paraphilia]]s, such as [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], [[pedophilia]], and [[necrophilia]], in their definition" and that they "stress that the term pansexuality describes only consensual adult sexual behaviors."&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;

The definition of pansexuality can encourage the belief that it is the only [[sexual identity]] that covers individuals who do not cleanly fit into the categories of male or man, or female or woman.&lt;ref name="mental health"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; However, bisexual-identified people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since ''bisexual'' is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses attraction to different genders as well, it includes attraction to more than two genders.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doesn’t identifying as bisexual reinforce a false gender binary?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is considered more complex than the state of one's sex, as gender includes genetic, hormonal, environmental and social factors.&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; Furthermore, the term ''bisexual'' is sometimes defined as the romantic or sexual attraction to multiple genders.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; The [[Bisexual Resource Center]], for example, defines bisexuality as "an umbrella term for people who recognize and honor their potential for sexual and emotional attraction to more than one gender,"&lt;ref name="biresource.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |last =Bisexual Resource Council/[[Bisexual Resource Center]] |title =BRC Brochure 2010 |year =2010 |accessdate =7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]] states that the term ''bisexual'' "is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between bisexual and terms like pansexual, polysexual, omnisexual, ambisexual, and fluid?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/what-is-the-difference-between-bisexual-and-terms-like-pansexual-polysexual-omnisexual-ambisexual-and-fluid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the scientific classification ''bisexual'' only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt; According to the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]], 25% of American transgender people identify as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetaskforceblog.org/2013/06/05/wonky-wednesday-trans-people-sexual-orientation/|last=Harrison|first=Jack|title=Wonky Wednesday: Trans people &amp; sexual orientation|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Shiri Eisner states that terms such as ''pansexual,'' ''omnisexual,'' ''[[polysexual]],'' ''[[queer]]'', etc. are being used in place of the term ''bisexual'' because "bisexuality, it's been claimed, is a gender binary, and therefore oppressive, word" and that "the great debate is being perpetuated and developed by bisexual-identified transgender and [[genderqueer]] people on the one hand, and non-bi-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the other." Eisner argues that "the allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life" and that the allegations are a political method to keep the bisexual and transgender movements separated, because of those who believe that bisexuality ignores or erases the visibility of transgender and genderqueer people.&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;

The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that "terms like ''pansexual'', ''polysexual'', ''omnisexual'', and ''ambisexual'' also describe a person with [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] attractions, and therefore people with those labels are also bisexual" and that "by replacing the prefix bi – (two, both) with pan- (all), poly- (many), omni- (all), ambi- (both, and implying ambiguity in this case), people who adopt these labels seek to clearly express the fact that gender does not factor into their own sexuality," but "this does not mean, however, that people who identify as bisexual are fixated on gender."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt; The institute believes that the notion that if a person identifies as bisexual, then it is a reinforcement of a false gender binary is a notion that "has its roots in the anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world" and that "while it is true that our society's language and terminology do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of human gender diversity, that is hardly the fault of people who choose to identify as bi. ... The Latin prefix bi- does indeed indicate two or both, however the 'both' indicated in the word bisexual are merely ''homosexual'' (lit. same sex) and ''heterosexual'' (lit. different sex)." The institute argues that heterosexuality and homosexuality, by contrast," are defined by the boundary of two sexes/genders. Given those fundamental facts, any criticism of bisexuality as reinforcing a gender binary is misplaced. Over time, our society's concept of human sex and gender may well change."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt;

The term ''pansexuality'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''bisexuality'', and, similarly, people who identify as bisexual may "feel that gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation should not be a focal point in potential [romantic/sexual] relationships."&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, "half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as ''queer'', ''pansexual'', ''pansensual,'' ''polyfidelitous,'' ''ambisexual,'' ''polysexual,'' or personalized identities such as 'byke' or 'biphilic'".&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; Polysexuality is similar to pansexuality in definition, meaning "encompassing more than one sexuality," but not necessarily encompassing all sexualities. This is distinct from [[polyamory]], which means more than one intimate relationship at the same time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. American Institute of Bisexuality stated, "The term ''fluid'' expresses the fact that the balance of a person's homosexual and heterosexual attractions exists in a state of flux and changes over time."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt;

[[Pawnbroking|Pawn shops]] are one of the oldest businesses in [[Hong Kong]] {{When|date=January 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=This isn't really backed up by anything else in this article|date=January 2018}}. In 2015, there were 205 pawn shops in Hong Kong, with the number increasing slightly over the five previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ejinsight.com/20150817-why-hong-kong-pawn-shops-are-far-from-fading/|title=Why Hong Kong pawn shops are far from fading |last1=Tsoi  |first1=Raymond|date=17 August 2015 |website= EJ Insight|publisher= |access-date= 19 June 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
Pawnbroking sprang up in Hong Kong as it developed into an [[entrepôt]]{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. Jeun Yun Aat (晉源押) was the first pawn shop in Hong Kong{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. In 1926, the [[Hong Kong government]] strengthened its regulations on pawn shops and promulgated pawn legislation. Since then, pawnbrokers are required to be licensed establishments.&lt;ref&gt;The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers’ Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_history . Extracted on 04 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations allowed the industry to become more and more popular{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}.

The activities of the pawnbrokers were limited by the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] in the [[Second World War]]. They flourished again after the war in 1945 as a consequence of post-war inflation and a shortage of resources{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central,_Hong_Kong|Central]], and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.&lt;ref&gt;於彥北. 香港當鋪何以經久不衰："押"字招牌后有乾坤 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation Needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}

In order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items. Items are under strict verification and registration. Pawn shops must keep digital records of all exchanges. If any suspicious items are found in the pawn shop, the pawn shop is to immediately notify the police.{{Citation Needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}

On 12 March 2013, the first "Pawn Shop Stocks", Oi Wah Pawnshop Credit Holdings Limited (01319.HK), was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. This novel sort of pawn shop can cooperate with the market instead of going with the set square to constitute a special private credit market in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Oi Wah Pawnshop Credit Limited. http://www.pawnshop.com.hk/?mod=site_oi_wah_tch_about_us Extracted on 04 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=January 2018}}

== Features of pawn shops ==
[[File:Pawnshop front.jpg|thumb|upright|Dong Zung]]

=== Design ===

==== Dong Zung ====
A dong zung is a large rectangular wooden screen, similar to a pair of doors, located right behind the entrance of the pawn shop. The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment. 

==== Pawning counter ====

The counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation Needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.

=== Names of pawn shops ===

Pawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (同), 'wo' (和)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (昌), 'fat' (發), 'fung' (豐)). The idea behind such a name is an entreaty and hope for having glorious and flourishing business development.&lt;ref&gt;周有泉. 香港人的‘二叔公’- 淺談當鋪 http://www.somanhing.com/ftihk/pdf/assignment/pawnshop.pdf Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source|date=December 2017}}

== Pawning procedure ==
[[File:ZeCauBaan.jpg|thumb|upright|Ze Cau Baan]]
# The customer visits the pawn shop and gives the item to be pawned to the shop assistant.
# The shop assistant will assay the item based on the original price and the current condition of the product.
# If the customer accepts the valuation, the shop assistant will verify the documents that can prove the identity of the customers.
# The pawn ticket and cash will be issued to the customers.
# The customers will count the cash immediately and the process is completed if there is no further problem.&lt;ref&gt;The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers’ Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_procedure Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special terms in pawning ==
* Ceot Zat (出質): Clients offering up items to be pawned.
* Ji Suk Gung/Ciu Fung (二叔公/朝奉): A worker who identifies and appraises the pawned goods.
* Maa Zi (碼子): The number sheet used to track exchanges.
* Zaap Gaa (雜架): Clocks, antiques, etc.
* Jyut Lik (月曆): The lunar calendar. Since months for the lunar calendar are one to two days shorter than the solar calendar, if pawnee repays the loan one day later than the deadline, they need to pay interests for one additional month.
* Lau Dong Ban (流當品): The deadline for repaying loans and getting back the pawned item(s) ends.
* Leoi Gung Gwang (雷公轟): The mortgage interest is as terrible as the rumblings of thunder.
* Ze Cau Baan (遮羞板): A big shield standing in front of the main gate. It is used to hide the situation inside the store.
* Gau Ceot Sap Saam Gwai (九出十三歸): The method pawn shops uses to calculate interest. For instance, when the pawn is worth about 10 dollars, only nine dollars will be lent and in the end thirteen dollars will be needed to repay to loan.&lt;ref&gt;Macau General Chamber of Pawnbrokers. http://www.macaupawnbrokers.com/list.asp?id=328 Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{disability}}
'''People-first language''' ('''PFL'''),&lt;ref name="CDC-NCBDDD_on_PFL"&gt;{{Citation |author=National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities |year=2017 |title=Communicating With and About People with Disabilities |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221060943/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-21 |access-date=2017-12-21 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''person-first language''' ('''PFL'''), is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] to avoid [[social exclusion|marginalization]] or [[dehumanization]] (either [[consciousness|conscious]] or [[subconscious]]) when discussing people with a [[health]] issue or [[disability]]. It can be a type of [[disability etiquette]] but more often is applied to any group that would otherwise be defined or mentally categorized by a condition or trait (for example, [[disease]], age, disability, or appearance) rather than as a group of people who ''have'' that condition or trait. Rather than using a [[labeling theory|label]] or an [[adjective]] to define someone, person-first language puts the person before the [[diagnosis]] and describes what the person ''has'' (for example, "a person with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]" or "a person with [[alcoholism]]"), not an assertion of what the person ''is'' (for example, "a diabetic" or "an alcoholic"). Thus a person is foremost a person and secondly a person with some trait. Advocates of person-first language point out that failing to mentally separate the person from the trait tends to reinforce a sense (even if only subconsciously) that both the trait and the person are inherently bad or inferior and thus tends to marginalize or even dehumanize the person. It also tends to implicitly reinforce a sense of permanency even regarding issues that are temporary; for example, a person with a [[substance use disorder]] has a fair chance of achieving long-term [[cure#remission|remission]]—many years in which he is healthy and productive—but calling him a "substance abuser" reinforces an unspoken sense that he is inherently and permanently tainted and casts too much doubt on maintenance of remission.

==Definition==
People-first language is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] in [[English language|English]]. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious [[dehumanization]] when discussing people with [[disabilities]] and is sometimes referred to{{By whom|date=April 2018}} as a type of [[disability etiquette]]. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, "those that are homeless" rather than "the homeless".

Rather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology, which describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.&lt;ref name="Lynn, 2017"&gt;Lynn, V. A. (2017). Language and HIV communication. HIV/AIDS (Auckland, NZ), 9, 183." &lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people" or "disabled," in order to emphasize that "they are people first." Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from "an asthmatic person" to "a person who has asthma". Furthermore, the use of [[E-Prime|''to be'' is deprecated]] {{By whom|date=April 2018}}  in favor of using ''to have''.

By using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity.

==History==
The term ''[[:wikt:people-first language|people-first language]]'' first appeared in 1988 as recommended by [[advocacy group]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];''Supportive housing needs of elderly and disabled persons: hearing before the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundred First Congress, first session on S. 566 ... the National Affordable Housing Act, June 2, 1989, Volumes 22–23'': "All references to 'handicapped individuals' in the Act must be changed to 'people with disabilities{{'"}} – We join with many of our fellow advocacy organizations in emphasizing the importance of using 'people first' language throughout the Act."&lt;/ref&gt; The usage has been widely adopted by [[speech-language pathologist]]s and researchers, with "person who stutters" (PWS) replacing "stutterer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folkins |first=John |url=http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |title=Resource on Person-First Language |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |date=December 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511071056/http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it is believed that People-first language originated in the mental health community, its origin dates back to the Denver Principles (1983), which states, "We condemn attempts to label us as "victims," a term which implies defeat, and we are only occasionally "patients," a term which implies passivity, helplessness, and dependence upon the care of others. We are "People With AIDS."

Use has been recommended in other increasingly common chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Non-profit organizations, such as the Obesity Action Coalition have expanded advocacy for People-First Language to [[obesity]]. As of 2017, 5 U.S. medical societies had pledged for it, and use it in their communications: the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, American Society of Bariatric Physicians, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obesityaction.org/weight-bias-and-stigma/people-first-language-for-obesity People-First Language for Obesity] Obesity Action Coalition, April 2013 retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common alternative to person-first language is usually called identity-first language, as it places the identifying condition before the personal term. For example, while someone who prefers person-first language might ask to be called a "person with autism", someone who prefers identity-first language would ask to be called an "autistic person". There is no common term for use of identifying conditions as nouns, but it is not usually preferred apart from select communities, such as [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]]. Others have proposed "person-centered language", which, instead of being a replacement linguistic rule, promotes prioritizing the preferences of those who are being referred to and argues for greater nuance in the language used to describe people and groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/07/03/person-centered-language |last=Kapitan |first=Alex |year=2017 |title=On "Person-First Language": It's Time to Actually Put the Person First |publisher=Radical Copyeditor.com |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
{{main|Linguistic prescriptivism|Language and thought}}
The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is the basis for ideologically motivated [[linguistic prescriptivism]]. The hypothesis states that language use significantly shapes perceptions of the world and forms ideological preconceptions.

In people-first language, preconceptions judged to be negative arise from placing the name of the condition before the term "person" or "people", such as "white person" or "Jewish people". Proponents of people-first language argue that this places an undue focus on the condition which distracts from the humanity of the members of the community of people with the condition.

In a 2008 publication about an experiment on teen's perception of people with disabilities, scientists gathered evidence to prove why people-first language, or word order, matters. the scientists divided teenagers from a summer camp into two groups; one group was asked questions using the term "people with epilepsy" and the other group was asked using the term "epileptics". They asked the teenagers questions such as "Do you think that people with epilepsy/epileptics have more difficulties at school?" and "Do you have prejudice toward people with epilepsy/epileptics?"  The studied showed that the teenagers had a higher "stigma perception" on the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy when it came to "epileptics", as opposed to "people with epilepsy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandes|first=Paula T.|last2=De Barros|first2=Nelson F.|last3=Li|first3=Li M.|date=2009-05-01|title=Stop saying epileptic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|language=en|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1280–1283|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x|issn=1528-1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage guidelines==
Some U.S. organizations like the United Spinal Association have published [[disability etiquette]] guides, which prescribe people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedspinal.org/pdf/DisabilityEtiquette.pdf |title=Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Spinal Association |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucp.org/media/tools-for-reporters |title=Tools for Reporters: Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Cerebral Palsy |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[For Dummies]]'' guide to [[etiquette]] prescribed people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Sue (2007).

John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781118051375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the rules of people-first language have become normative in US governmental institutions on the federal (e.g. CDC) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf Communicating With and About People with Disabilities] CDC n.d., retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and on state levels in the heath departments' Developmental Disabilities Councils e.g. Michigan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/5_People_1st_Language_313302_7.pdf People First Language In Proposals for Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council Grants].

== Criticism ==
Critics have objected that people-first language is awkward, repetitive and makes for tiresome writing and reading. [[C. Edwin Vaughan]], a [[sociologist]] and longtime activist for the blind, argues that since "in common usage positive pronouns usually precede nouns", "the awkwardness of the preferred language focuses on the disability in a new and potentially negative way". According to Vaughan, it only serves to "focus on disability in an ungainly new way" and "calls attention to a person as having some type of 'marred identity{{'"}} in terms of [[Erving Goffman]]'s theory of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, C. Edwin (1997). [http://www.blind.net/a-philosophy-of-blindness/individual-articles/people-first-language.html "People-First Language: An Unholy Crusade"]. National Federation of the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[National Federation of the Blind]] adopted a resolution condemning people-first language. The resolution dismissed the notion that "the word 'person' must invariably precede the word 'blind' to emphasize the fact that a blind person is first and foremost a person" as "totally unacceptable and pernicious" and resulting in the exact opposite of its purported aim, since "it is overly defensive, implies shame instead of true equality, and portrays the blind as touchy and belligerent".&lt;ref&gt;Jernigan, Kenneth (March 2009). [http://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/Publications/bm/bm09/bm0903/bm090308.htm "The Pitfalls of Political Correctness: Euphemisms Excoriated"]. ''Braille Monitor'' '''52''' (3). "Be it resolved by the National Federation of the Blind in Convention assembled in the city of Dallas, Texas, this 9th day of July, 1993, that the following statement of policy be adopted: We believe that it is respectable to be blind, and although we have no particular pride in the fact of our blindness, neither do we have any shame in it. To the extent that euphemisms are used to convey any other concept or image, we deplore such use. We can make our own way in the world on equal terms with others, and we intend to do it."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[deaf culture]], person-first language has long been rejected. Instead, deaf culture uses deaf-first language since being culturally deaf is a source of positive identity and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lum |first=Doman |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMqGhHCxXUYC&amp;pg=PA441 |title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=441 |isbn=9780840034434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct terms to use for this group would be "Deaf person" or "hard of hearing person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/educate_children_(3_to_21)/resources_for_mainstream_programs/terminology.html |title=Terminology Describing Deaf Individuals |publisher=Gallaudet University |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054809/http://www.gallaudet.edu/Clerc_Center/Information_and_Resources/Info_to_Go/Educate_Children_(3_to_21)/Resources_for_Mainstream_Programs/Terminology.html |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "hearing impaired" is not acceptable to most Deaf or hard of hearing people because it emphasizes what they cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq |title=Community and Culture – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Association of the Deaf |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism activist [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]] rejects person-first language, on the grounds that saying "person with autism" suggests that autism can be separated from the person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Sinclair, Jim]].

{{quote|In the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as “Autistic,” “Autistic person,” or “Autistic individual” because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual’s identity...It is impossible to affirm the value and worth of an Autistic person without recognizing his or her identity as an Autistic person. Referring to me as “a person with autism,” or “an individual with ASD” demeans who I am because it denies who I am...When we say “person with autism,” we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word “with” or “has.” Ultimately, what we are saying when we say “person with autism” is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/|title=Identity First Language|last=Brown|first=Lydia|date=|website=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Lydia Brown]]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5617">An official system of weights and measures was established{{cn|date=February 2015}} in the ancient 
[[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] under the Achaemenid dynasty (550-350 BCE). The shekel and mina ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage. Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

===Volume===
The ''shekel'' and ''mina'' ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A ''shekel'' or ''mina'' weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. Note that the values given for the ''mina'' do not match the definitions.

: 1 ''shekel'' = 8.3 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 profane ''mina'' = 50 ''shekel'' = 500 ml (approximately 27 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 sacred ''mina'' = 60 ''shekel'' = 600 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''dva'').
: 1 talent (volume) = 60 profane ''mina'' = 25 liters (approximately 1  cubic ''trayas'').

===Weight===
The '''talent''' was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage (bullion, bulk coin), rather than an individual coin. Seven [[Babylonia]]n talents equalled ten Attic talents, according to a list of the revenues of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia)]] recorded in [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book III, 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burn, Andrew R. |title=Persia and the Greeks: the defence of the West, c. 546-478 BC |publisher=Duckworth |location=[London] |year=1984 |pages=123–126 |isbn=0-7156-1765-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''𐎣𐎼𐏁''' (karša) or '''𐎣𐎼𐏁𐎹𐎠''' (karšayā) is a unit of weight equal to 10 Babylonian ''shekels'' or 1/6 Babylonian ''mina'' weighing approximately 83g.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum No. 91117 Inscribed weight; http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=367895&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personalism''' is a philosophical school of thought searching to describe the uniqueness of 1) [[God]] as Supreme [[Soul|Person]] or 2) a human [[person]] in the world of nature, specifically in relation to [[animal]]s. One of the main points of interest of personalism is human subjectivity or self-consciousness, experienced in a person's own acts and inner happenings—in "everything in the human being that is internal, whereby each human being is an eyewitness of its own self".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karol Wojtyla|K. Wojtyła]], ''Subjectivity and Irreducible'' in: Idem ''Person and Community. Selected Essays'', Th. Sandok OSM, P. Lang (trans.), New York 1993,  p. 214; Cf. P. Bristow, ''Christian Ethics and the Human Person'', Family Publications [[Maryvale Institute]], Oxford 2009, pp. 102-103 {{ISBN|978-1-871217-98-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other principles:
# Persons have unique value, and
# Only persons have [[free will]]
According to [[idealism]] there is one more principle
# Only persons are real (in the [[ontology|ontological]] sense).

==Overview==
Writing in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=personalism |title=Personalism |last=Williams |first=Thomas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted scholar Thomas D. Williams cites a plurality of "schools" holding to a "personalist" ethic and "[[Weltanschauung]]", arguing:
{{quote|Personalism exists in many different versions, and this makes it somewhat difficult to define as a philosophical and theological movement. Many philosophical schools have at their core one particular thinker or even one central work which serves as a canonical touchstone. Personalism is a more diffused and eclectic movement and has no such universal reference point. It is, in point of fact, more proper to speak of many personalisms than one personalism. In 1947 [[Jacques Maritain]] could write that there are at least 'a dozen personalist doctrines, which at times have nothing more in common than the word ‘person.’ Moreover, because of their emphasis on the subjectivity of the person and their ties to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], some dominant forms of personalism have not lent themselves to systematic treatises.

It is perhaps more proper to speak of personalism as a 'current' or a broader 'worldview, since it represents more than one school or one doctrine while at the same time the most important forms of personalism do display some central and essential commonalities. Most important of the latter is the general affirmation of the centrality of the person for philosophical thought. Personalism posits ultimate reality and value in personhood — human as well as (at least for most personalists) divine. It emphasizes the significance, uniqueness and inviolability of the person, as well as the person's essentially relational or communitarian dimension. The title 'personalism' can therefore legitimately be applied to any school of thought that focuses on the reality of persons and their unique status among beings in general, and personalists normally acknowledge the indirect contributions of a wide range of thinkers throughout the history of philosophy who did not regard themselves as personalists. Personalists believe that the human person should be the ontological and epistemological starting point of philosophical reflection. They are concerned to investigate the experience, the status, and the dignity of the human being as person, and regard this as the starting-point for all subsequent philosophical analysis.}}

Thus, according to Williams, one ought to keep in mind that although there may be dozens of theorists and social activists in the West adhering to the rubric "personalism," their particular foci may, in fact, be [[asymptote|asymptotic]], and even diverge at material junctures.

==Berdyaev's personalism==
[[Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev]] (1874–1948) was a Russian religious and political philosopher who emphasized human freedom, subjectivity and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-8870-8_3 Existentialism: A Personalist Philosophy of History], ''Berdyaev’s Philosophy of History. An Existentialist Theory of Social Creativity and Eschatology'', by David Bonner Richardson, pp 90-137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mounier's personalism==
{{further|Non-conformists of the 1930s|Alexandre Marc}}
In France, philosopher [[Emmanuel Mounier]] (1905–1950) was the leading proponent of personalism, around which he founded the review ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', which exists to this day. Under [[Jean-Marie Domenach]]'s direction, it criticized the use of [[torture during the Algerian War]]. Personalism was seen as an alternative to both [[Liberalism]] and [[Marxism]], which respected [[human rights]] and the human personality without indulging in excessive [[collectivism]]. Mounier's personalism had an important influence in France, including in political movements, such as [[Marc Sangnier]]'s ''[[Ligue de la jeune République]]'' (Young Republic League) founded in 1912.

A Jewish anti-fascist, [[Zeev Sternhell]], has identified personalism with fascism in a very controversial manner, claiming that Mounier's personalism movement "shared ideas and political reflexes with fascism". He argued that Mounier's "revolt against [[individualism]] and [[materialism]]" would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], "Sur le fascisme et sa variante française", in ''[[Le Débat]]'', November 1984, "Emmanuel Mounier et la contestation de la démocratie libérale dans la France des années 30", in ''[[Revue française de science politique]]'', December 1984, and also [[John Hellman]]'s book, on which he takes a lot of his sources, ''Emmanuel Mounier and the New Catholic Left, 1930-1950'' (University of Toronto Press, 1981). See also [[Denis de Rougemont]], Mme Mounier et [[Jean-Marie Domenach]] dans ''Le personnalisme d’Emmanuel Mounier hier et demain'', Seuil, Paris, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Phenomenological Thomism}}
Following on the writings of [[Dorothy Day]], a distinctively Christian personalism developed in the 20th century. Its main theorist was the Polish philosopher [[Karol Wojtyła]] (later Pope John Paul II). In his work, ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'', first published in 1960, Wojtyła proposed what he termed 'the personalistic norm':
{{quote|This norm, in its negative aspect, states that the person is the kind of good which does not admit of use and cannot be treated as an object of use and as such the means to an end. In its positive form the personalistic norm confirms this: the person is a good towards which the only proper and adequate attitude is love&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Responsibility'' (Ignatius Press, 1993), pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This brand of personalism has come to be known as "Thomistic" because of its efforts to square modern notions regarding the person with the teachings of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=What Is Thomistic Personalism?|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao42_williams1.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=20 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425213150/http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao42_williams1.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wojtyła was influenced by the '''ethical personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/ Personalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A first principle of Christian personalism is that persons are not to be used, but to be respected and loved. In ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', the [[Second Vatican Council]] formulated what has come to be considered the key expression of this personalism: "man is the only creature on earth that God willed for its own sake and he cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself".&lt;ref&gt;''Gaudium et spes'', no. 24. This apparently paradoxical idea - if you seek your life selfishly, you will lose it; if you are generous in giving it, you will find it - is rooted in the gospel: cf. Mt. 16:25; Mk 8:35; Lk 17:33.&lt;/ref&gt;

This formula for self-fulfillment offers a key for overcoming the dichotomy frequently felt between personal "realization" and the needs or demands of social life. Personalism also implies inter-personalism, as Benedict XVI stresses in ''[[Caritas in Veritate]]'':
{{quote|As a spiritual being, the human creature is defined through interpersonal relations. The more authentically he or she lives these relations, the more his or her own personal identity matures. It is not by isolation that man establishes his worth, but by placing himself in relation with others and with God.&lt;ref&gt;''Caritas in veritate'', #53&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Boston personalism&lt;!--'Boston personalism' redirects here--&gt;==
Personalism flourished in the early [[20th century]] at [[Boston University]] in a movement known as '''Boston personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; led by theologian [[Borden Parker Bowne]].  Bowne emphasized the person as the fundamental category for explaining reality and asserted that only persons are real.  He stood in opposition to certain forms of [[materialism]] which would describe persons as mere particles of matter.  For example, against the argument that persons are insignificant specks of dust in the vast universe, Bowne would say that it is impossible for the entire universe to exist apart from a person to experience it.  Ontologically speaking, the person is “larger” than the universe because the universe is but one small aspect of the person who experiences it.   Personalism affirms the existence of the [[soul]].  Most personalists assert that [[God]] is real and that God is a person (or as in Christian [[trinitarianism]], three 'persons', although it is important to note that the nonstandard meaning of the word 'person' in this theological context is significantly different from Bowne's usage).

Bowne also held that persons have value (see [[axiology]], [[value theory]], and [[ethics]]).  In declaring the absolute value of personhood, he stood firmly against certain forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] (including [[social Darwinism]]) which sought to reduce the value of persons.  He also stood against certain forms of [[positivism]] which sought to render ethical and theological discourse meaningless and dismiss talk of God ''a priori''.

[[Georgia Harkness]] was a major Boston personalist theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miles | first=R. | title=Georgia Harkness: The Remaking of a Liberal Theologian | publisher=Westminster John Knox Press | series=Library of theological ethics | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-664-22667-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swunIg1_ut8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrow 1999"&gt;{{cite book | last=Burrow | first=R. |year=1999| title=Personalism: a Critical Introduction |location=St.  Louis,  MO | publisher=Chalice Press | isbn=978-0-8272-3055-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ26UpzbcrgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deats Robb 1986 p.

==California personalism&lt;!--'Personal idealism' and 'Boston personalism' redirect here--&gt;==
[[George Holmes Howison]] taught a metaphysical theory called '''personal idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707190718/http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''California personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the moral freedom experienced by persons. To deny the freedom to pursue the ideals of truth, beauty, and "benignant love" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Thus, even the Personalistic Idealism of Borden Parker Bowne and [[Edgar S. Brightman]] and the Realistic Personal Theism of Thomas Aquinas are inadequate, for they make finite persons dependent for their existence upon an infinite Person and support this view by an unintelligible doctrine of creatio ex nihilo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/|title=Research Howison, George Holmes (1834-1916) - Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.bookrags.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002094713/http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/|archivedate=2012-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personal Idealism of Howison was explained in his book ''The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism''. Howison created a radically democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch, no longer the only ruler and creator of the universe, but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. Howison found few disciples among the religious, for whom his thought was heretical; the non-religious, on the other hand, considered his proposals too religious; only [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s idealist atheism or [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]]'s [[apeirotheism]] seem to resemble Howison's personal idealism.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v020/20.3mclachlan.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180043/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=%2Fjournals%2Fjournal_of_speculative_philosophy%2Fv020%2F20.3mclachlan.html |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents and influence==
Philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], though not formally considered a personalist, made an important contribution to the personalist cause by declaring that a person is not to be valued merely as a means to the ends of other people, but that he possesses dignity (an absolute inner worth) and is to be valued as an end in himself.

Catholic philosopher and theologian [[John Henry Newman]], has been posited as a main proponent of personalism by John Crosby of Franciscan University in his book ''Personalist Papers''. Crosby notes Newman's personal approach to faith, as outlined in ''[[Grammar of Assent]]'' as a main source of Newman's personalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=John|title=Personalist Papers|year=2003|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8132-1317-0|pages=280|url=https://www.amazon.com/Personalist-Papers-John-F-Crosby/dp/0813213177|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311084811/http://www.amazon.com/Personalist-Papers-John-F-Crosby/dp/0813213177|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was greatly influenced by personalism in his studies at [[Boston University]].   King came to agree with the position that only personality is real.  It solidified his understanding of [[God]] as a [[personal god]].  It also gave him a metaphysical basis for his belief that all human personality has dignity and worth.&lt;ref&gt;See his essay [http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol4/580901-002-My_Pilgrimage_to_Nonviolence.htm "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]] explicitly sought to support personalist movement by developing its theoretical foundation and expanding it with a new personalist social ethic.{{r|Deweer 2013|p=3}} However, he later had significant disagreements with Mournier and criticized other personalist writers for insufficient conceptual clarity. Ricœur also disagreed with the other personalists in asserting the signfiicance of justice as a value in its own right and gave this primary in the public sphere, whereas Mournier characterized all relationships including public and political ones in terms of love and friendship.&lt;ref name="Deweer 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deweer |first=D. |year=2013 |title=Ricœur and the Pertinence of a Political Education: on Crisis and Commitment |work=Archivio di filosofia |volume=81 |number=1 |pp=71-80 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/41620619/Deweer_-_Ricoeur_and_the_Pertinence_of_a_Political_Education_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] was also influenced by the personalism advocated by [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Before his election to the Roman papacy, he wrote ''Person and Act'' (sometimes mistranslated as ''The Acting Person''), a philosophical work suffused with personalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|90-277-0985-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he remained well within the traditional stream of Catholic social and individual morality, his explanation of the origins of moral norms, as expressed in his [[encyclical]]s on economics and on [[sexual ethics|sexual morality]], for instance, was largely drawn from a personalist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;see Doran, Kevin P.  Solidarity:  A Synthesis of Personalism and Communalism in the Thought of Karol Wojtyła/John Paul II.  New York:  Peter Lang, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8204-3071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings as Roman pontiff, of course, influenced a generation of Catholic theologians since who have taken up personalist perspectives on the theology of the family and social order.

'''Rights-based approach to development''' is an approach to development promoted by many [[List of development aid agencies|development agencies]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) to achieve a positive transformation of power relations among the various development actors. This practice blurs the distinction between [[human rights]] and [[economic development]]. There are two stakeholder groups in rights-based development—the rights holders (who do not experience full rights) and the duty bearers (the institutions obligated to fulfill the holders' rights). Rights-based approaches aim at strengthening the capacity of duty bearers and empower the rights holders.{{sfn|Gneiting 2009|p=1}}

==History==

===Human rights into development discourse===
Human rights came into global discourse after the [[United Nations]] passed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. This was the first global recognition that all humans are inherente United Nations endorsement of democracy had little to do with the UN's stance on development.{{sfn|Forsythe|1997|p=336}}  [[Human rights]] became one of the major debates between the West and Communist states during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1006}}  Cold War dichotomy of right versus left defined power of the state and of the individual in aspects of society based on political affiliation.{{sfn|Harris-Curtis|2003|p=559}}  The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet bloc left Western values and ideas, which remains one of the main ideologies of the world.

Human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], used to focus primarily on documenting human rights violations on the civil and political level. No longer do these organizations focus solely on human rights violations, but also on social, economic, and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/75134 Our History]". Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evolution of human rights organizations and development organizations and the western idea that rights are asserted through responsibilities, duties, transparency, trust, and accountability have led to the development of the rights-based approach. In 1993 the UN held the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna; during this conference they developed the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], where they linked democracy, human rights, sustainability and development.{{sfn|Hamm|2001|p=1007}}  This made the [[Cold War]] division of Civil and Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural rights interdependent. This further led to the linkage between [[human rights]] and [[Economic development|development]] and enabled policy makers and developers to incorporate a rights-based approach into their policies.

In 1997, the Secretary General to the United Nations called to mainstream [[human rights]] into all work of the [[United Nations]]. Then in 2003, various organizations and agencies met to develop a "Common Understanding" of a human rights-based approach.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=17–18}}  Giving six main principles:
* Universality and Inalienability
* Indivisibility
* Inter-Dependence and Inter-Relatedness
* Equality and Non-Discrimination
* Participation and Inclusion
* Accountability and Rule of Law

The [[United Nations]] developed this guide to address the significant changes occurring in the [[international development]] community with the adoption of human rights in development work. Since the UN published their standards and steps to a rights-based approach to development, many bilateral donor agencies, such as [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]] and [[DFID]], and international NGOs such as [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] and [[Oxfam]] have taken similar steps.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=15}}

===Transition away from welfare model===
The [[Welfare state|welfare model]] has been rooted into Western developmental practices since the 20th century.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  In the welfare model, poverty is defined as the absence of a public good or knowledge. If the state or another vehicle, such as an NGO, provides the absent good, then poverty can be alleviated and development will occur.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}  Billions of dollars have been poured into this approach, however despite some achievements there has not been success with this model. The gap between the rich and poor is widening and according to the ''World Development Report'', nearly half of the world's population live on less than $2 a day.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=270}}

This model lacks a way to hold governments accountable for their actions or inaction. It fails to address governments' inability to fulfill their citizens' rights either because of funding or knowledge. It also constructs the poor as objects of charity, predetermining their roles in civic society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=271}}

Due to the failures of the [[welfare state|welfare model]], NGOs reevaluated and transitioned more towards a rights-based approach to development. In this model, instead of the poor being constructed as charity they would be constructed as actors or rights holders. The NGOs' role is to help the poor overcome obstacles blocking their rights and give governments the tools and training to provide these rights.

==Theories==

===Human rights===
The inclusion of human rights into development discourse has also brought along a certain language of rights. This brings a moral resonance to development rhetoric and makes it hard to avoid in today's discourse. Rights are defined as entitlements that belong to all human beings regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic class;{{sfn|Nussbaum|1998|p=273}}  all humans, therefore, are rights holders, and it is someone’s duty to provide these rights. Who is responsible to give these rights, in other words the duty bearers, has been largely debated. In rights-based approach it is the person’s government that assumes the duty bearer position, but most of the time the said government does not have the resources to fulfill this role. This is where the NGOs come and try to help these governments fulfill their roles and duties to their people by giving them resources. These resources can be monetary or more sustainable such as training to government officials.

Currently there is an under-fulfillment of human rights, which has been directly linked with poverty.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=1}}  Poverty includes the assessment of standard of living, health, and well being. These are social and economic human rights,&lt;!-- It is a bit misleading to use the terms of first and second generation rights. It has been agreed in the Vienna declaration that Human Rights are Indivisible, Interdependent and Interrelated, and thus cannot be separated into a categorization of generations, which can lead people to interpret as first, second and third priorities. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action#Human_Rights_as_Indivisible.2C_Interdependent_and_Interrelated)

Also, to elaborate, I quote the UN Chronicle (https://unchronicle.un.org/article/international-human-rights-law-short-history):
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became generally accepted that such a dichotomy does not do justice to the extent to which these rights are interrelated and interdependent. The dichotomy of positive/negative obligations no longer holds water. It seems much more useful to regard all rights as interdependent and indivisible, and as potentially entailing a variety of obligations on the State. These obligations may be categorized as the duty to respect, protect, promote and fulfil."

I will therefore suggest that these terms are removed from this article. --&gt;which have just recently been included in development discourse.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=316}}  First generation rights, or [[civil and political rights]], have dominated public policy in the past. However, with poverty on the rise and public policy failing, social and economic rights are becoming increasingly important in development of policies.

Affluent or rich countries feel they should help the poor out of charity or humanity.{{sfn|Pogge|2005|p=4}}  Rights-based approach works to shift the paradigm away from [[charity (virtue)|charity]] and towards moral duty imposed on the world through the international consensus of [[human rights]]. NGOs are adopting the “full spectrum” of human rights into their development policies. Using human rights as their driving force they are using rhetoric to develop a [[modus operandi]] that made political human rights effective.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

===Capacity building===
[[Capacity building]] is the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions and solve problems.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=20}}  A goal of rights-based approach to development is to increase the capacity of both the duty bearers and the rights holders.

Key principles to increase capacity are sought to build upon existing capacities, ensure national engagement and ownership, and adjust to countries' needs as development occurs.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=21}}  In this method, the duty bearers and the rights holders both have an active role in development. The duty bearers are accountable for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights; while the rights holders need to ask what they should do to help promote and defend their freedoms. This action keeps their governments accountable for creating sustainability.{{sfn|Sen|2004|p=339}}

Capacity building is an ongoing process, and is often [[Social capital|intangible]]. This is why many [[nonprofit organizations]] have not been able to engage or transition more towards capacity building. Donors like to see tangible results or they like to see where their money is going. Also the success of nonprofit and NGOs is shown through [[tangible]] results, leading organizations more toward service delivery than capacity building.

===International law===
The international recognition of human rights has been largely debated; there is acknowledgment but not institutional enforcement. NGOs that use a rights-based approach in policy decisions have a large problem with gaining legal status or enforcement of the human rights they are defending. They rely on publicly criticizing countries who make these violations.

There have been many international legal documents developed by the United Nations on behalf of human rights issues that all members of the UN have to abide by.

* [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|The Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|The Convention on Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]]
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|The Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]]
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|The Convention on Rights of the Child (CRC)]]
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|The Convention Against Torture (CAT)]]
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|The Convention on Migrant Workers and Their Families (MWC)]]

Since the 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] the international community has developed a legally binding framework for the protection of human rights. These legal documents have created norms and standards internationally.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|pp=2–3}}

===Social contract theory===
The [[social contract]] theory proclaims that rights such as [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]] belong to the individuals and not to society.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=276}}  These rights existed before individuals entered civil society and by entering [[civil society]], one is agreeing to a social contract. In this contract, the state has the right to enforce [[natural rights]]. The state breaks this contract if the rights of the people are broken or not secured. Today, social contracts come in the form of national constitutions, which provide rules explaining and protecting individual rights.

These rights are inherent, they are not granted by authority or any overriding principle. [[Human rights]] are recognized by all people making it universal and fundamental.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003|p=277}}

===Downward accountability===
Within the realm of rights-based approach there is a theoretical relation to downward accountability in relation to [[Economic development|development]].  This theory states what the rights are, who deserves the rights and what actors are responsible for ensuring these rights are secured.  In development there is a focus on the responsibility of actors.  Therefore, in relation to downward accountability it creates a power dynamic in development aid.   NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) focus on downward accountability to ensure the intended beneficiaries are being allowed their rights.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Since the mid-1990s there has been a trend for NGOs and development donor agencies to combine the idea of development and [[human rights]] into the human rights-based approach to development.  Although there has been an undertone of development within the association with human rights earlier than this time; it has been since the end of the 20th century when there were known links of combining development and human rights into the same efforts.  This practice includes NGOs that are geared towards development as well as human rights.  The donor agencies are now helping to fund this combination of human rights with development to become as effective as possible. Even human rights-based approach to development theories were involved with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).  MDGs are the goals set forth by the UN member states to work for the alleviation of extreme poverty, fighting of disease, and other global problems.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

There have been 3 growing trends in relation to NGOs and the rights-based approach to development that have been implemented into practice.  The first trend is focusing attention onto a rights-based approach to development.  The second trend is the joint advocacy by development NGOs and human rights NGOs to work together towards a common goal.  The third trend is to expand the attention to economic and social rights as well.  The Human Rights ideal imparts the international benchmark that states can have related and common ideas.  To have internationally understood human rights allows NGOs, governments, and corporations to be held accountable for their actions.  This change in focus on human rights-based approach to development challenges the market-dominated view that was popular during the 1980s into a view focused on the relationship between human rights and development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003|p=2020}}

These new trends have a significant impact and a possible paradigm shift.  From looking at development as a gift turning to development as a human right puts the responsibility on the government.  However, this is not just the home country, the responsibility of development resides in the hands of wealthy countries as well. To switch to a rights-based approach to development would then lead to using internationally agreed upon human rights as a responsibility of governments to provide.  Within this theory development will no longer be viewed as a gift or a need, but rather a right that states and governments are held accountable for.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===NGOs, UN agencies, donor agencies and specific programs===

====NGOs involvement====

NGOs that have implemented rights-based approach to development have done so with four main principles to follow.  These principles are human rights-based approach design of their programs, [[education]] about rights-based approach, rights to participation, and accountability.  Human rights-based approach design of their programs begins with analysis of the unfulfilled [[human rights]].  It then commits programs and funds to fulfill these missing human rights.  The design of these programs also stresses that the donations are not a gift but rather that the people are finally receiving the human rights treatment they deserve.  Education of human rights and the programs that are being implemented is important.  The education is to inform the beneficiaries of their human rights as well as the ways in which NGOs and other organizations are attempting to increase their human rights.  Education is also to inform the governments, international organizations and donor agencies that are dealing with human rights their roles and responsibilities.  Then there is the principle of rights to participation.  This deals with the idea that beneficiaries should be included when implementing programs on their behalf.  Organizations should include the beneficiaries to help [[Empowerment|empower]].  Then there is the principle of accountability which is designed to have standards of human rights and development.  It is also designed for NGOs, international organizations, donor agencies and governments to be held to a higher standard of responsibility.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] are two NGOs that have been involved traditionally with advocacy in relation to human rights.  These NGOs have expanded from traditional political rights to expand to ESC rights, which includes economic and social rights as well.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[Oxfam]] is an NGO that has adopted the rights-based approach to development.  [[Oxfam]] vowed to continue to provide relief while also addressing the structural causes of poverty and injustice.  This approach combines poverty, human rights, development and trade all within the same realm.  [[Oxfam]] focuses a broad approach to the causes of poverty and injustice.  This NGO also would like to put economic and social justice at the top of the world agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronson and Zimmerman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift towards a rights-based approach to development forced [[Oxfam]] to reexamine its funding, a deeper examination into the state's role as a duty bearer, and using civil society as a vehicle for citizens to empowered to stand up for their rights. [[Oxfam]] also had to evaluate their development practices and business model.{{sfn|Offenheiser-Holcombe 2003}}

There has been a shift from focusing upon civil human rights to human rights of social and economic areas.  There are many NGOs that are now focusing upon the ESC (economic and social rights) while creating and implementing programs.  [[Human Rights Watch]] is one of these NGOs that has implemented a focus on ESC rights.  These rights focus on alleviating poverty and implementing equal social and economic rights in all levels of society.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

NGOs that have implemented these ESC rights are focusing much of their attention on increasing the standard of living to be healthy and safe.  This includes ideas of [[water rights]] in areas that lack clean drinking water and health rights that include availability of medicine and doctors. This would increase the impoverished peoples' standard of living by increasing basic living needs and access.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

====International Development Agencies involvement====

Beginning in the late 1990s when rights-based approach to development began to be a popular discourse many aid donor agencies began to support this view towards development.  Their intentions are to implement support for programs to incorporate both development and human rights in an interdisciplinary fashion.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

Major donor agencies that have adopted the rights-based approach to development include [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]] (United Nations Development Program), UNFPA, ILO, Swedish Sida, Norwegian NOrad, British DFID, and the Australian aid agency.  Other UN programs have also adopted the rights-based approach to development.  This new development framework leads to moral legitimacy and social justice.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

[[UNDP]] The United Nations Development Program began in the late 1990s to raise awareness about this new rights-based approach viewpoint to development.  [[UNDP]] specifically focused upon the interactions of social and economic rights.  Their focus was to help develop policy decisions related to social and economic rights in association with development.  In 2000 [[UNDP]] published "Human Rights and Human Development" a document that provided their intentions and strategies based on their implementation of rights-based approach to development.  UNDP was also present at UN- sponsored conferences in relation to rights-based approach to development that included the UN Millennium Summit.  UNDP also provides tools for governments and donor agencies to support the rights-based approach to development.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}{{cite web |url=http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=847 |title=What is the Rights Based Approach all about? Perspectives from International Development Agencies |author=Celestine Nyamu-Musembi and Andrea Cornwall |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Institute of Development Studies |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}

[[UNICEF]] is another donor agency that has implemented the rights-based approach to development and its ideas.  UNICEF has a more narrow focus on women's and children's rights.  However, it has still implemented rights-based approach strategies with the programs UNICEF is helping to fund.{{sfn|Nelson-Dorsey 2003}}

===Application of rights-based approach in NGOs===
NGOs transitioning to rights-based approach have to redefine missions, test new methodologies, reallocate funding, and train staff. To do this there are a few steps NGOs have to take in developing programs and campaigns around rights-based approach.

First, NGOs need to create program ideas. These are created based on an analysis of rights within a certain country. The analysis is necessary to identify and give priority to the most deprived in society. It is then the goal of a rights-based approach to empower those people. This step also identifies and reviews the [[capacity utilization|capacity]] of the duty-bearers. It also tries to understand the relationship between the rights holders and the duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=33}}

The next step is to educate both the rights holders and the duty bearers by articulating the rights of citizens and duty of the [[government]]. This is an important step so both parties are knowledgeable about their individual rights, responsibilities, and roles in society. This enables effective communication necessary between rights holders and duty bearers.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=34}}

After an extensive [[situation analysis]], a project or program is developed. The program needs to address [[human rights]] deficits related to certain groups, communities, or countries facing abuses or [[discrimination]]. Baselines and benchmarks are set, which create transparency and [[accountability]] in the project. Goals are also created during this step in order to analyze the program's effectiveness in a [[human rights]] context at the end of the project. Finally, NGOs encourage control over the project by the affected peoples, utilizing the Right to Participate principle.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=36}}

To determine the effectiveness of a project, it is essential all inputs, outputs, goals, and outcomes are assessed through a [[human rights]] lens. The results should then be organized in a [[logframe]], to show the clear results of the project.{{sfn|UNDP 2006|p=37}}

==Criticism==
This new development theory of rights-based approach has been met with positive feedback as well as criticism. There are thoughts that incorporating the language of human rights with development is just a change of terminology and doesn’t change the programs being implemented.  The ability for a state to implement public policy has been hindered due to the need to comply with economic and social rights (ESC rights).  Development practices without combining them with [[human rights]] has been more effective in implementing and monitoring programs.  Therefore, the need to combine human rights with development is not necessary for the beneficiaries.{{sfn|Nelson|2007}}

While there still is more positive feedback when dealing with rights-based approach to development there are still criticisms surrounding the focus on combining human rights with development.  These criticisms stem from the idea that changing the terminology will not increase NGOs' productivity or even necessarily the NGOs' programs that are being implemented.  Just by stating that the government and corporations should now be responsible for development as an issue of human rights does not mean that any changes in procedures will occur.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

Another criticism that has been brought up is that there have been many NGOs that have combined the ideas of human rights along with development before the term "rights-based approach to development" was coined.  There has been a natural linkage between development and rights and there has frequently been pressure on states and governments to be involved with issues of human rights as well as development.  Therefore, in many cases, changing the terminology will not increase the effectiveness of the state.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There have been other criticisms of the rights-based approach to development because the ideas and theories have not been narrowed.  Rights-based approach is a vague term that doesn't clearly represent a set of ideas.  There is a multiplicity of explanations about rights-based approach that poses problems when discussing how NGOs, donor agencies or UN programs will try to implement these ideas into their programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

One example of implementation is within the realm of [[Gender and Development]].  [[Women's rights]] have long been fighting for equal rights and by implementing rights-based approach to development it changes some of the ways women's equal rights were being implemented effectively into society.  There have been two main paths relating to inequalities of gender; these include human rights organizations that focus on women's equal rights and organizations focused on gender and development.  By converging these two different ideas it can create problems with the experts and the way the programs are being implemented.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

There is also disparity between NGOs in the north and NGOs in the south between their viewpoints and ideas in which to implement programs in relation to development and human rights separately.  By trying to combine these two discourses across the globe can create problems of fragmentation of ideas and programs.  If fragmentation were to occur it would be the opposite intention of the NGOs that were trying to combine human rights and development into similar programs.{{sfn|Tsikata|2009}}

For example, if a man sells a car with brakes that do not work to his friend, but the seller does not know about the brake problem, the seller then has no ''scienter''. If he sells the car and knew of the problem before he sold the car, he has ''scienter''.

The word has the same [[etymology|root]] as ''[[science]]'', the [[Latin]] ''scienter'' (knowingly), from ''scire'' (to know, to separate one thing from another).

==Scienter action in tort law==
The scienter action is a category within [[tort]] law in some [[common law]] jurisdictions that deals with the damage done by an animal directly to a human. It had a long history in [[English law]] until it was abolished by the [[Animals Act 1971]]. An action in the [[common law jurisdictions]] in which it has not been extinguished by statute is in addition to the torts of [[negligence]] and [[nuisance]] or more bespoke torts like [[cattle trespass]]. If an animal is known to behave in a certain way and is expressed on a person causing injury, an action can be taken in this tort, which also is not available in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[South Australia]] or [[New Zealand]]. In those jurisdictions, the actions involving animals need to be in nuisance or negligence. 

To be successful, the plaintiff needs to take action against the person in control of the animal. It is [[strict liability]], requiring no more than proof of injury, the animal's having a problematic trait, and the knowledge of the person in control about the trait in the animal. Strict liability means that there is no need to argue fault in the form of wilful intent or negligence on the part of the animal or its controller. The only defence is if it can be proved the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by their actions, or if the plaintiff was the cause of the injury. 

It is common to distinguish between harmless animals and wild animals, as no scienter is needed for wild animals. Animals are classed as wild or harmless on the basis of species or kind, not on the basis of being a tame individual. An elephant is considered wild regardless of its use. The scienter action is referred to in ''[[Rylands v. Fletcher]]'' in that one who keeps a wild thing "must keep it at his peril" to make reference to part of Justice [[Colin Blackburn]]'s comment.

==General use==

Scienter is generally used as a necessary condition of certain causes of civil action and as a standard for civil liability or criminal [[guilt (law)|guilt]]. For instance, Section 1960 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] provides a ''scienter'' condition, requiring that the accused "knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns" a prohibited type of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of scienter is uniformly expressed in the text of the U.S. Code as the word ''know'', appearing as "knowingly", "actual knowledge", "known", "knowledge fairly implied", etc.  The word ''scienter'' is not used in the text of the U.S. Code, although it appears once in a section title.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|7706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This use reflects the development of American law speaking plainly instead of employing Latin phrases of [[legal English]].

==In contract law==

''Scienter'' is also an element of the [[contract law]] [[cause of action]] for [[breach of contract]] in which the aggrieved party alleges some destruction of the [[meeting of the minds]], also known as mutual assent, because of [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]] or duress [[per minas]].

''Scienter'' can also be used as a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a breach of contract [[lawsuit]].

==Element of claim of securities fraud==
In the [[United States]], to prevail in a securities fraud claim under Section 10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant acted with ''scienter''.

The [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995 added the requirement that a plaintiff must plead facts giving rise to a "strong inference" of ''scienter''. The meaning of ''scienter'' under the 1995 law has been very controversial since its enactment. The [[United States Supreme Court]] issued a decision that clarified what was to be understood as a "strong inference." In ''Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, LTD'' (21 June 2007), an 8-1 ruling of the Court defined the standard that the plaintiff had to meet to proceed with a securities fraud litigation. A complaint must show "cogent and compelling evidence" of ''scienter''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23940">The '''simply typed lambda calculus''' (&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt;), a form
of [[type theory]], is a [[typed lambda calculus|typed interpretation]] of the [[lambda calculus]] with only one [[type constructor]]: &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; that builds [[function type]]s. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.  The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical uses of the [[untyped lambda calculus]], and it exhibits many desirable and interesting properties.

The term ''simple type'' is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as [[cartesian product|products]], [[coproduct]]s or [[natural number]]s ([[Dialectica interpretation|System T]]) or even full [[recursion]] (like [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]]). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (like [[System F]]) or [[dependent type]]s (like the [[LF (logical framework)|Logical Framework]]) are not considered ''simply typed''.  The former, except full recursion, are still considered  ''simple'' because the [[Church encoding]]s of such structures can be done using only &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.

== Syntax ==

In this article, we use &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to range over types. Informally, the ''function type'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; refers to the type of functions that, given an input of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, produce an output of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
By convention, &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; associates to the right: we read &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau\to\rho&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to(\tau\to\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

To define the types, we begin by fixing a set of ''base types'', &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These are sometimes called ''atomic types'' or ''type constants''. With this fixed, the syntax of types is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau ::= \tau \to \tau \mid T \quad \mathrm{where} \quad T \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;B = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, generates an infinite set of types starting with &lt;math&gt;a,b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to b,b\to b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;b\to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; a \to (a \to a),\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;(b\to a) \to (a\to b), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

We also fix a set of ''term constants'' for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type &lt;tt&gt;nat&lt;/tt&gt;, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types: &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of propositions" and &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of individuals". The type &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; has no term constants, whereas &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, is considered.

The syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus is essentially that of the lambda calculus itself.  We write &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; to denote that the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The term syntax, in BNF, is then:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.e \mid e \, e \mid c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a term constant.

That is, ''variable reference'', ''abstractions'', ''application'', and ''constant''.  A variable reference &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''bound'' if it is inside of an abstraction binding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  A term is ''closed'' if there are no unbound variables.

Compare this to the syntax of untyped lambda calculus:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x.e \mid e \, e&lt;/math&gt;

We see that in typed lambda calculus every function (''abstraction'') must specify the type of its argument.

== Typing rules ==

To define the set of well typed lambda terms of a given type, we will define a typing relation between terms and types.  First, we introduce ''typing contexts'' or ''[[typing environment]]s'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\Delta,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, which are sets of typing assumptions.  A ''typing assumption'' has the form &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''well-typed'' (having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;).  Instances of the typing relation are called ''typing judgements''.  The validity of a typing judgement is shown by providing a ''typing derivation'', constructed using [[type rules|typing rules]] (wherein the premises above the line allow us to derive the conclusion below the line).  Simply-typed lambda calculus uses these rules:

{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x\mathbin{:}\sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; (1)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c\mathbin{:}T}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\tau}{\Gamma\vdash (\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e)\mathbin{:}(\sigma \to \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\mathbin{:}\sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\mathbin{:}\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2\mathbin{:}\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
|}

In words,
# If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the context, we know that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
# Term constants have the appropriate base types.
# If, in a certain context with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then, in the same context without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If, in a certain context, &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of closed terms, ''i.e.'' terms typable in the empty context, are:
*For every type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; (identity function/I-combinator),
*For types &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\sigma \to \tau \to \sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the K-combinator), and
*For types &lt;math&gt;\tau,\tau',\tau''&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'\to\tau''.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'.\lambda z\mathbin{:}\tau.x z (y z) : (\tau\to\tau'\to\tau'')\to(\tau\to\tau')\to\tau\to\tau''&lt;/math&gt; (the S-combinator).
These are the typed lambda calculus representations of the basic combinators of [[combinatory logic]].

Each type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is assigned an order, a number &lt;math&gt;o(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. For base types, &lt;math&gt;o(T)=0&lt;/math&gt;; for function types, &lt;math&gt;o(\sigma\to\tau)=\mbox{max}(o(\sigma)+1,o(\tau))&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the order of a type measures the depth of the most left-nested arrow. Hence:

: &lt;math&gt;o(\iota \to \iota \to \iota) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;o((\iota \to \iota) \to \iota) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

=== Intrinsic vs. extrinsic interpretations ===

Broadly speaking, there are two different ways of assigning meaning to the simply typed lambda calculus, as to typed languages more generally, sometimes called ''intrinsic'' vs. ''extrinsic'', or ''[[Alonzo Church|Church]]-style'' vs. ''[[Haskell Curry|Curry]]-style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = John | last = Reynolds | author-link=John_C._Reynolds
| publisher = Cambridge University Press
| location = Cambridge, England
| title=Theories of Programming Languages
| year=1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An intrinsic/Church-style semantics only assigns meaning to well-typed terms, or more precisely, assigns meaning directly to typing derivations.  This has the effect that terms differing only by type annotations can nonetheless be assigned different meanings.  For example, the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on integers and the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on booleans may mean different things.  (The classic intended interpretations
are the identity function on integers and the identity function on boolean values.)
In contrast, an extrinsic/Curry-style semantics assigns meaning to terms regardless of typing, as they would be interpreted in an untyped language.  In this view, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; mean the same thing (''i.e.'', the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;).

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic semantics is sometimes associated with the presence or absence of annotations on lambda abstractions, but strictly speaking this usage is imprecise.  It is possible to define a Curry-style semantics on annotated terms simply by ignoring the types (''i.e.'', through [[type erasure]]), as it is possible to give a Church-style semantics on unannotated terms when the types can be deduced from context (''i.e.'', through [[type inference]]).  The essential difference between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches is just whether the typing rules are viewed as defining the language, or as a formalism for verifying properties of a more primitive underlying language.  Most of the different semantic interpretations discussed below can be seen through either a Church or Curry perspective.

=== Equational theory ===

The simply typed lambda calculus has the same [[equational theory]] of βη-equivalence as [[Untyped lambda calculus#Reduction|untyped lambda calculus]], but subject to type restrictions.  The equation for [[beta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t)\,u =_{\beta} t[x:=u]&lt;/math&gt;
holds in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma \vdash t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash u\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, while the equation for [[eta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t\,x =_\eta t&lt;/math&gt;
holds whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t\!:\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not appear free in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Operational semantics ===

Likewise, the [[operational semantics]] of simply typed lambda calculus can be fixed as for the untyped lambda calculus, using [[call by name]], [[call by value]], or other [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]].  As for any typed language, [[type safety]] is a fundamental property of all of these evaluation strategies.  Additionally, the [[strong normalization]] property [[Simply typed lambda calculus#Important results|described below]] implies that any evaluation strategy will terminate on all simply typed terms.

=== Categorical semantics ===
The simply typed lambda calculus (with  &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence) is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs), as was first observed by [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]].  Given any specific CCC, the basic types of the corresponding lambda calculus are just the [[object (category theory)|objects]], and the terms are the [[morphism]]s. Conversely, every simply typed lambda calculus gives a CCC whose objects are the types, and morphisms are equivalence classes of terms.

To make the correspondence clear, a [[type constructor]] for the [[Cartesian product]] is typically added to the above.  To preserve the [[product (category theory)|categoricity of the Cartesian product]], one adds [[type rule]]s for ''pairing'', ''projection'', and a ''unit term''. Given two terms &lt;math&gt;s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the term &lt;math&gt;(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, if one has a term &lt;math&gt;u\mathbin{:}\tau_1\times\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there are terms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the projections of the Cartesian product. The ''unit term'', of type 1, is written as &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt; and vocalized as 'nil', is the [[final object]].  The equational theory is extended likewise, so that one has
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\pi_1(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau) , \pi_2(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau)) =u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}1 = ()&lt;/math&gt;
This last is read as "''if t has type 1, then it reduces to nil''".

The above can then be turned into a category by taking the types as the [[object (category theory)|objects]]. The [[morphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalence class]]es of pairs &lt;math&gt;(x\mathbin{:}\sigma, t\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is a variable (of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) and ''t'' is a term (of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) ''x''. Closure is obtained from [[currying]] and [[apply|application]], as usual.

More precisely, there exist [[functor]]s between the category of Cartesian closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.

It is common to extend this case to [[closed monoidal category|closed symmetric monoidal categories]] by using a [[linear type system]]. The reason for this is that the CCC is a special case of the closed symmetric monoidal category, which is typically taken to be the [[category of sets]].  This is fine for laying the foundations of [[set theory]], but the more general [[topos]] seems to provide a superior foundation.

=== Proof-theoretic semantics ===

The simply typed lambda calculus is closely related to the implicational fragment of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e., [[minimal logic]], via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]: terms correspond precisely to proofs in [[natural deduction]], and [[Type inhabitation|inhabited types]] are exactly the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of minimal logic.

== Alternative syntaxes ==

The presentation given above is not the only way of defining the syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus.  One alternative is to remove type annotations entirely (so that the syntax is identical to the untyped lambda calculus), while ensuring that terms are well-typed via [[Hindley–Milner type inference]].  The inference algorithm is terminating, sound, and complete: whenever a term is typable, the algorithm computes its type.  More precisely, it computes the term's [[principal type]], since often an unannotated term (such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;) may have more than one type (&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int} \to \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{bool} \to \mathtt{bool}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., which are all instances of the principal type &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

Another alternative presentation of simply typed lambda calculus is based on '''bidirectional type checking''', which requires more type annotations than Hindley–Milner inference but is easier to describe.  The [[type system]] is divided into two judgments, representing both ''checking'' and ''synthesis'', written &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; respectively.  Operationally, the three components &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are all ''inputs'' to the checking judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the synthesis judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; only takes &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; as inputs, producing the type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as output.  These judgments are derived via the following rules:
{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x \Rightarrow \sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; [1]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c \Rightarrow T}}&lt;/math&gt; [2]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.~e \Leftarrow \sigma \to \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [3]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\Rightarrow \sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\Leftarrow\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2 \Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [4]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Rightarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [5]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash (e\mathbin{:}\tau)\Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [6]
|}
Observe that rules [1]–[4] are nearly identical to rules (1)–(4) above, except for the careful choice of checking or synthesis judgments.  These choices can be explained like so:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is in the context, we can synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
# The types of term constants are fixed and can be synthesized.
# To check that &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; in some context, we extend the context with &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; (in some context), and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (in the same context), then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Observe that the rules for synthesis are read top-to-bottom, whereas the rules for checking are read bottom-to-top.  Note in particular that we do '''not''' need any annotation on the lambda abstraction in rule [3], because the type of the bound variable can be deduced from the type at which we check the function. Finally, we explain rules [5] and [6] as follows:
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then the explicitly annotated term &lt;math&gt;(e\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Because of these last two rules coercing between synthesis and checking, it is easy to see that any well-typed but unannotated term can be checked in the bidirectional system, so long as we insert "enough" type annotations.  And in fact, annotations are needed only at β-redexes.

== General observations ==

Given the standard semantics, the simply typed lambda calculus is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]: that is, well-typed terms always reduce to a value, i.e., a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction.  This is because recursion is not allowed by the typing rules: it is impossible to find types for [[fixed-point combinator]]s and the looping term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x.~x~x) (\lambda x.~x~x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recursion can be added to the language by either having a special operator &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{fix}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;of type &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt; or adding general [[recursive type]]s, though both eliminate strong normalization.

Since it is strongly normalising, it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] whether or not a simply typed lambda calculus program halts: in fact, it ''always'' halts. We can therefore conclude that the language is ''not'' [[Turing complete]].

== Important results ==

* Tait showed in 1967 that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-reduction is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. As a corollary &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Statman showed in 1977 that the normalisation problem is not [[elementary recursive]], a proof which was later simplified by Mairson (1992). A purely semantic normalisation proof (see [[normalisation by evaluation]]) was given by Berger and Schwichtenberg in 1991.
* The [[unification (computing)|unification]] problem for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is undecidable. Huet showed in 1973 that 3rd order unification is undecidable and this was improved upon by Baxter in 1978 then by Goldfarb in 1981 by showing that 2nd order unification is already undecidable. A proof that higher order matching (unification where only one term contains existential variables) is decidable was announced by Colin Stirling in 2006, and a full proof was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=Colin|title=Decidability of higher-order matching|journal=Logical Methods in Computer Science|date=22 July 2009|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1–52|doi=10.2168/LMCS-5(3:2)2009|arxiv=0907.3804|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* We can encode [[natural number]]s by terms of the type &lt;math&gt;(o\to o)\to(o \to o)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Church numeral]]s). Schwichtenberg showed in 1976 that in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; exactly the extended [[polynomial]]s are representable as functions over Church numerals; these are roughly the polynomials closed up under a conditional operator. 
* A ''full model'' of &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; is given by interpreting base types as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and function types by the set-theoretic [[function space]]. Friedman showed in 1975 that this interpretation is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence, if the base types are interpreted by infinite sets. Statman showed in 1983 that &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is the maximal equivalence which is ''typically ambiguous'', i.e. closed under type substitutions (''Statman's Typical Ambiguity Theorem''). A corollary of this is that the ''finite model property'' holds, i.e. finite sets are sufficient to distinguish terms which are not identified by &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence.
* Plotkin introduced logical relations in 1973 to characterize the elements of a model which are definable by lambda terms. In 1993 Jung and Tiuryn showed that a general form of logical relation (Kripke logical relations with varying arity) exactly characterizes lambda definability. Plotkin and Statman conjectured that it is decidable whether a given element of a model generated from finite sets is definable by a lambda term (''Plotkin–Statman conjecture''). The conjecture was shown to be false by Loader in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">In [[mathematics]], a '''singleton''', also known as a '''unit set''',&lt;ref name="Stoll"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Stoll  | first = Robert  | authorlink =   | title = Sets, Logic and Axiomatic Theories  | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | year = 1961  | location =   | pages = 5–6  | language =   | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with [[unique (mathematics)|exactly one]] element. For example, the set {0} is a singleton.

The term is also used for a 1-[[tuple]] (a [[sequence]] with one member).

==Properties==
Within the framework of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the [[axiom of regularity]] guarantees that no set is an element of itself. This implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains,&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt; thus 1 and {1} are not the same thing, and the [[empty set]] is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. A set such as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{1, 2, 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a singleton as it contains a single element (which itself is a set, however, not a singleton).

A set is a singleton [[if and only if]] its [[cardinality]] is {{num|1}}. In [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|von Neumann's set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers]], the number 1 is ''defined'' as the singleton {0}.

In [[axiomatic set theory]], the existence of singletons is a consequence of the [[axiom of pairing]]: for any set ''A'', the axiom applied to ''A'' and ''A'' asserts the existence of {''A'', ''A''}, which is the same as the singleton {''A''} (since it contains ''A'', and no other set, as an element).

If ''A'' is any set and ''S'' is any singleton, then there exists precisely one [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to ''S'', the function sending every element of ''A'' to the single element of ''S''. Thus every singleton is a [[terminal object]] in the [[category of sets]].

A singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is injective. The only non-singleton set with this property is the [[empty set]].

The [[Bell number]] integer sequence counts the number of [[partitions of a set]] ({{OEIS2C|A000110}}), if singletons are excluded then the numbers are smaller ({{OEIS2C|A000296}}).

== In category theory ==

Structures built on singletons often serve as [[terminal object]]s or [[zero object]]s of various [[category (category theory)|categories]]:
* The statement above shows that the singleton sets are precisely the terminal objects in the category '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s. No other sets are terminal.
* Any singleton admits a unique [[topological space]] structure (both subsets are open). These singleton topological spaces are terminal objects in the category of topological spaces and [[continuous function]]s. No other spaces are terminal in that category.
* Any singleton admits a unique [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure (the unique element serving as [[identity element]]). These singleton groups are [[Initial object|zero object]]s in the category of groups and [[group homomorphism]]s. No other groups are terminal in that category.

== Definition by indicator functions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (set theory)|class]] defined by an [[indicator function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;b: X \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''singleton'' if and only if there is some {{math|''y'' ∈ ''X''}} such that for all {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, 
:&lt;math&gt;b(x) = (x = y) &lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition in Principia Mathematica ==
The following definition was introduced by [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alfred North | last=Whitehead |author2=Bertrand Russell  | year=1910 | title=[[Principia Mathematica]]|volume=Vol. I | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x =\hat{y}(y = x)&lt;/math&gt; '''Df.'''
The symbol &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}(y = x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the class of objects identical with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; aka &lt;math&gt;\{y:y=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.  
This occurs as a definition in the introduction, which, in places, simplifies the argument in the main text, where it occurs as proposition 51.01 (p.357 ibid.).
The proposition is subsequently used to define the cardinal number 1 as
:&lt;math&gt;1=\hat{\alpha}((\exists x)\alpha=\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt; '''Df.'''  
That is, 1 is the class of singletons. This is definition 52.01 (p.363 ibid.)

The '''Smolin Gallery''' was an [[avant-garde]] art venue and gallery on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="Diggory2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diggory|first=Terence|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgsgw2xe-F0C&amp;pg=PT310|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1905-2|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its peak in the 1960s. It was known for its involvement with [[installation art]], [[performance art]] and experimental art, and was best known for the [[Allan Kaprow]] assemblage performance of September 11–12, 1962 entitled "Words",&lt;ref name="Hendricks2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendricks|first=Geoffrey|title=Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers University, 1958–1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40Qd97UAHPoC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3303-2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the first allowing the audience to participate in an art gallery context.

In May 1963 the Smolin Gallery sponsored innovative [[Wolf Vostell]] events on TV. ''Do it yourself Dé-coll/age'' featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to use their own DIY liquids to create poster art on the walls and Wolf Vostells [[installation art|installation]] ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV Dé-coll/age'') was shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage Wolf Vostell, ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV dé-coll/age''), 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salter2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salter|first=Chris|title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&amp;pg=PA122|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19588-1|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gallery sponsored the ''Yam Festival'' and served as an information center during the event. The ''Yam Festival'', held at [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]s farm, in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] was venue on May 19, 1963 to actions and [[Happening]]s by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]] and [[Wolf Vostell]] who made the happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref name="Banes1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banes|first=Sally|title=Democracy's Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeJm6G8-T3cC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-1399-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/images/2/ Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''square–cube law''' (or '''cube–square law''') is a mathematical principle, applied in a variety of scientific fields, which describes the relationship between the volume and the surface area as a shape's size increases or decreases. It was first described in 1638 by [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' as the "...ratio of two volumes is greater than the ratio of their surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=square+cube+law+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gTvbwNAElG&amp;sig=A5PVzej4PexQ4gzIt9mytn2Nw6k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Y2iVb_nEorGogTYiImICg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=square%20cube%20law%20galileo&amp;f=false  |title=How Mechanics Shaped the Modern World|work=book|author=David H. Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from [[mechanical engineering]] to [[biomechanics]]. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like [[elephants]] have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller [[skyscrapers]] is increasingly difficult.

==Description==
[[File:Comparison of surface area vs volume of shapes.svg|thumb|Graphs of surface area, ''A'' against volume, ''V'' of the Platonic solids and a sphere, showing that the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases with increasing volume.]]

The square–cube law can be stated as follows:

{{quote|When an object undergoes a proportional increase in size, its new surface area is proportional to the square of the multiplier and its new volume is proportional to the cube of the multiplier.}}

Represented mathematically:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.world-builders.org/lessons/less/les9/area.html  |title=World Builders: The Sizes of Living Things|work=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_2=A_1\left(\frac{\ell_2}{\ell_1}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original surface area and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new surface area.

:&lt;math&gt;V_2=V_1\left(\frac{\ell_2}{\ell_1}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original volume, &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new volume, &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is the original length and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; is the new length.

For example, a cube with a side length of 1 meter has a surface area of 6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volume of 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the ''square'' of 2 and become 24&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Its volume would be multiplied by the ''cube'' of 2 and become 8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square–cube law.  This principle applies to all solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/|title=The Biology of B-Movie Monsters|work=|author=Michael C. LaBarbera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Engineering===
When a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its volume and mass are increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area increases only by the square of said multiplier.  This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object.

Consider a simple example of a body of mass, M, having an acceleration, a, and surface area, A, of the surface upon which the accelerating force is acting.  The force due to acceleration, &lt;math&gt;F= M a&lt;/math&gt; and the thrust pressure,  &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{F}{A} = M\frac{a}{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, consider the object be exaggerated by a multiplier factor = x so that it has a new mass, &lt;math&gt;M' = x^3 M&lt;/math&gt;, and the surface upon which the force is acting has a new surface area, &lt;math&gt;A' = x^2 A&lt;/math&gt;.

The new force due to acceleration &lt;math&gt;F' = x^3 Ma&lt;/math&gt; and the resulting thrust pressure,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T' &amp;= \frac{F'}{A'}\\
   &amp;= \frac{x^3}{x^2} \times M\frac{a}{A}\\
   &amp;= x \times M \frac{a}{A}\\
   &amp;= x \times T\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
                                  
Thus, just scaling up the size of an object, keeping the same material of construction (density), and same acceleration, would increase the thrust by the same scaling factor. This would indicate that the object would have less ability to resist stress and  would be more prone to collapse while accelerating.

This is why large vehicles perform poorly in crash tests and why there are limits to how high buildings can be built.  Similarly, the larger an object is, the less other objects would resist its motion, causing its deceleration.

====Engineering examples====
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=September 2018}}
*[[Watt steam engine|Steam engine]]: [[James Watt]], working as an instrument maker for the [[University of Glasgow]], was given a scale model [[Newcomen steam engine]] to put in working order.  Watt recognized the problem as being related to the square–cube law, in that the surface to volume ratio of the model's cylinder was greater than that of the much larger commercial engines, leading to excessive heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments with this model led to Watt's famous improvements to the steam engine.

* [[Airbus A380]]: the lift and control surfaces (wings, rudders and elevators) are relatively big compared to the fuselage of the airplane. For example, taking a [[Boeing 737]] and merely magnifying its dimensions to the size of an A380 would result in wings that are too small for the aircraft weight, because of the square–cube rule.
* [[Expander cycle]] [[rocket engines]] suffer from the square–cube law. Their size, and therefore thrust, is limited by [[heat transfer]] [[efficiency]] due to the surface area of the nozzle increasing slower than the volume of fuel flowing through the nozzle.
* A [[clipper]] needs relatively more sail surface than a [[sloop]] to reach the same speed, meaning there is a higher sail-surface-to-sail-surface ratio between these craft than there is a weight-to-weight ratio.
* [[Aerostats]] generally benefit from the square–cube law. As the radius (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) of a balloon is increased, the cost in surface area increases quadratically (&lt;math&gt;r ^ 2&lt;/math&gt;), but the lift generated from volume increases cubically (&lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt;).
* [[Structural Engineering]]: Materials that work at small scales may not work at larger scales. For example, the compressive stress at the bottom of small free-standing column scales at the same rate as the size of the column. Therefore, there exists a size for a given material and density at which a column will collapse on itself.

===Biomechanics===
If an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the ''square'' of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the ''cube'' of the scaling factor.  As a result of this, cardiovascular  and respiratory functions would be severely burdened.

In the case of flying animals, the wing loading would be increased if they were isometrically scaled up, and they would therefore have to fly faster to gain the same amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]].  Air resistance per unit mass is also higher for smaller animals, which is why a small animal like an [[ant]] cannot be seriously injured from impact with the ground after being dropped from any height.

As stated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], large animals do not look like small animals: an elephant cannot be mistaken for a mouse scaled up in size.  This is due to [[allometry|allometric scaling]]: the bones of an elephant are necessarily proportionately much larger than the bones of a mouse, because they must carry proportionately higher weight. Haldane illustrates this in his seminal 1928 essay ''On Being the Right Size'' in referring to [[allegory|allegorical ]] giants: "...consider a man 60 feet high...Giant Pope and Giant Pagan in the illustrated ''Pilgrim's Progress:'' ...These monsters...weighed 1000 times as much as [[Pilgrim's Progress|Christian]]. Every square inch of a giant bone had to support 10 times the weight borne by a square inch of human bone.  As the average human thigh-bone breaks under about 10 times the human weight, Pope and Pagan would have broken their thighs every time they took a step."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haldane|first1=J. B. S.|title=On Being the Right Size|url=http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html|website=Internet Research Lab|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, most animals show [[allometry|allometric scaling]] with increased size, both among species and within a species. The giant creatures seen in monster movies (e.g., [[Godzilla]] or [[King Kong]]) are also unrealistic, as their sheer size would force them to collapse.

However, the buoyancy of water negates to some extent the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures that would be required of similarly sized land creatures, and it is no coincidence that the largest animals to ever exist on earth are [[Largest organisms#Animals|aquatic animals]].

The metabolic rate of animals scales with a mathematical principle named [[Kleiber's law|quarter-power scaling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/011299sci-scaling.html| title=Of Mice and Elephants: A Matter of Scale| author=George Johnson| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=January 12, 1999| accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[metabolic theory of ecology]].

=== Mass and heat transfer ===
Mass transfer such as diffusion to smaller objects such as living cells is faster than diffusion to larger objects such as entire animals. Thus, in chemical processes that take place on a surface - rather than in the bulk - finer-divided material is more active. For example, the activity of a heterogeneous [[catalyst]] is higher when it is divided into finer particles.

Heat production from a chemical process scales with the cube of the linear dimension (height, width) of the vessel, but the vessel surface area scales with only the square of the linear dimension. Consequently, larger vessels are much more difficult to cool. Also, large-scale piping for transferring hot fluids is difficult to simulate in small scale, because heat is transferred faster out from smaller pipes. Failure to take this into account in process design may lead to catastrophic [[thermal runaway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">A theory of '''substantial forms''' asserts that forms (or ideas) organize matter and make it [[Intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligible]]. Substantial forms are the source of properties, order, unity, identity, and information about objects.

The idea of substantial forms dominates [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and [[medieval philosophy]], but has fallen out of favour in modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselmphilosophy.com/substance/ David Banach. What Killed Substantial Form?]&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of substantial forms has been abandoned for a [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]], or "bottom-up" theory of organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2c_51Hill.pdf Benjamin Hill.  Substantial Forms and the Rise of Modern Science]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such mechanistic treatments have been criticized for the same reasons [[atomism]] has received criticism, viz., for merely denying the existence of certain kinds of substantial forms in favor of others (here, that of atoms, which are then thought to be arranged into things possessing accidental forms) and not denying substantial forms as such, an impossible move.

==Articulation==

===Platonic forms===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] maintains in the ''[[Phaedo]]'' regarding our knowledge of equals:&lt;br&gt;
:''"Do they [equal things] seem to us to be equal in the same sense as what is Equal itself? Is there some deficiency in their being such as the Equal, or is there not?
::*''[Simias]-A considerable deficiency.
:''Whenever someone, on seeing something, realizes that that which he now sees wants to be like some other reality but falls short and cannot be like that other since it is inferior, do we agree that the one who thinks this must have prior knowledge of that to which he says it is like, but deficiently so?
::*''[Simmias] Necessarily. ...
:''We must then possess knowledge of the Equal before that time when we first saw the equal objects and realized that all these objects strive to be like the Equal but are deficient in this."

===Aristotelian forms===
{{main|Hylomorphism|Aristotle's biology}}
[[Aristotle]] was the first to distinguish between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] (''[[hyle]]'') and form (''morphe''). For Aristotle, [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] is the undifferentiated primal element: it is rather that from which things develop than a [[thing in itself]]. The development of particular things from this germinal matter consists in differentiation, the acquiring of particular forms of which the knowable universe consists (cf. [[Formal cause]]). The perfection of the form of a thing is its [[entelechy]] in virtue of which it attains its fullest realization of function ([[De anima]], ii. 2). Thus the entelechy of the [[human body|body]] is the [[soul]]. The origin of the differentiation process is to be sought in a [[Unmoved mover|prime mover]], i.e. pure form entirely separate from all matter, eternal, unchangeable, operating not by its own activity but by the impulse which its own absolute existence excites in matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Form}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early adoption===
Both Platonic and Aristotelian forms appear in [[medieval philosophy]].

Medieval theologians, newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christianity, such as to the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine to the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

The Aristotelian conception of form was adopted by the [[Scholastics]], to whom, however, its origin in the observation of the physical universe was an entirely foreign idea. The most remarkable adaptation is probably that of [[Aquinas]], who distinguished the spiritual world with its subsistent forms (formae separatae) from the material with its inherent forms which exist only in combination with matter.

==Criticism==
[[René Descartes|Descartes]], referring to substantial forms, says:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] They were introduced by philosophers solely to account for the proper action of natural things, of which they were supposed to be the principles and bases ... But no natural action at all can be explained by these substantial forms, since their defenders admit that they are occult, and that they do not understand them themselves. If they say that some action proceeds from a substantial form, it is as if they said it proceeds from something they do not understand; which explains nothing. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Descartes. "Letter to Regius," January 1642, in Oeuvres de Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

==Response to criticism==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] made efforts to return to forms. Substantial forms, in the strictest sense for Leibniz, are primitive active forces and are required for his metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert Merrihew. Leibniz: Determinist, Theist, Idealist, February 1999, pp. 308-341 (34)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/leib-met.htm#SH9c Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' (§10): &lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] the belief in substantial forms has a certain basis in fact, but that these forms effect no changes in the phenomena and must not be employed for the explanation of particular events. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020612043559/https://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#X|url=https://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#X|title=Discourse on Metaphysics|author=G W Leibniz|archivedate=12 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Swarm''' is the name of an open-source [[agent-based model]]ing simulation package, useful for simulating the interaction of [[Intelligent agent|agent]]s (social or biological) and their [[emergence|emergent]] collective behaviour.  Swarm was initially developed at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in the mid-1990s, and since 1999 has been maintained by the non-profit [[Swarm Development Group]].  Also known as the Swarm Simulation System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm_main_page Swarm]&lt;/ref&gt; it is available for free &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_software_main_page download Software main page downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and use, covered by the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early development work on Swarm was completed by Chris Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (SFI), Manor Askenazi (SFI), Glen Ropella (SFI), Marcus Daniels (SFI), and Alex Lancaster (SFI). Since that time, many hundreds of people around the world have contributed to the continued open source development of the suite of Swarm ABM tools.

== Applications ==

=== Scientific applications===
Agent-based modeling seeks to replicate these complexities and adaptations in computational environments where these interactive [[emergent behavior]]s can be analyzed multi-dimensionally. By defining and assigning agencies reflective of prescribed behaviors, known or estimated, to active software agents in a [[computer simulation]], scientists can approximate experimental results not possible in natural temporal frameworks.

Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms afford scientists the opportunity to conduct and [[Scientific visualization|visualize]] experiments in these synthetic macro and microenvironments for testing scientific theories, natural data sets, and other analyses while free of pressing constraints like time, volume, hazards, or many other parameters.

=== Commercial applications ===
Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include:
* [[supply chain optimization]] and [[logistics]];
* modeling of [[consumer behavior]], including [[word of mouth]] and [[social network]] effects;
* [[distributed computing]];
* [[workforce management]];
* [[traffic management]]; and
* [[Investment management|portfolio management]].
In these and other applications, the system of interest is simulated by capturing the behavior of individual agents and their interconnections. Agent-based modeling tools can be used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the overall, emergent system behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11597">[[Image:JO199411392.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The '''Toubon Law''' (full name: ''law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the [[French language]]'') is a law of the French government mandating the use of the [[French language]] in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See the text of the Toubon Law in English at [http://www.dglf.culture.gouv.fr/droit/loi-gb.htm La Délégation Générale à la Langue Française].&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting [[Commerce|commercial activity]]. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and "original version" films.&lt;ref name="OpenSociety"&gt;See [http://www.eumap.org/topics/media/television_europe/national/france/media_fra1.pdf Television Regulation in France] a 2005 report sponsored by the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast musical works are subject to [[Quota share|quota]] rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language.&lt;ref name=OpenSociety /&gt; 

The law takes its common name from [[Jacques Toubon]], who was [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the [[National Assembly of France]]. A nickname is ''Loi Allgood'' &amp;ndash; "Allgood" is a [[morpheme]]-for-morpheme translation of "Toubon" into [[English language|English]] ("All Good" being a translation of "Tout bon") &amp;ndash; as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also ‘came under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961967|title=Identity, insecurity and image : France and language|last=E.|first=Ager, D.|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=|isbn=1853594431|location=Clevedon, England|pages=44|oclc=44961967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the law==
One broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that "any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French." Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that "these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report on GE Medical Systems case: French court fines US company for not using French language in France|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html|archivedate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000006948282 Ruling] from the Versailles Court of Appeal, 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided.

A similar restriction—though implemented by [[primary legislation]] regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubon—applies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006292770 Code de la consommation R112-8]&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with [[Law of the European Union|European law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61998J0366:EN:NOT Ruling C-366-98 of 12 September 2000], [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the [[European Union]]. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Frangi, ''[http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-economique-2003-1-page-135.htm Le consommateur français entre loi Toubon et droit communautaire]'', Revue internationale de droit économique, De Boeck Université, t. XVII, 1 2003/1, pp. 135-144, {{ISBN|2-8041-4232-9}}, {{DOI|10.3917/ride.171.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another provision, the law specifies obligations for public [[Legal personality#Juridicial persons|legal persons]] (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French.

Under the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding.

Other restrictions concern the use of French in [[academic conference]]s. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the "hard" scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/1990/qSEQ901012253.html Question] from senator Danielle Bidard-Reydet and answer by the Minister of Research [[Hubert Curien]], 1991: the conclusion of a commission of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] is that enforcing the use of French in scientific conferences, through the use of simultaneous translations, would be not only costly but useless, and would damage the reputation of France among the international scientific community. The Ministry thus does not envision coercive measures, which would have the result of reducing the number of internal scientific conferences in France. Thus, the use of simultaneous translation is ''recommended'' (not impose).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/rapport/2008/Rapport_Parlement08.pdf 2008 Report from the General delegation to French language] to [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], pp. 33-39. The [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Centre for Scientific Research]] indicates that strict observance of the law would pose considerable problems. Page 39: 78% of research laboratories have organized or co-organized seminars, in France during the 2006-2007 school year. Out of that number, 62% organized sittings that took place essentially in a foreign language: 47% in humanities and social sciences, 71% in exact sciences. The operators indicated that sometimes sittings took place in a foreign language even though all participants were francophone. This situation took place within 35% of relevant laboratories (thus 16% of all laboratories), in approximately the same proportion in exact sciences and humanities and social sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/1994/94-345-dc/decision-n-94-345-dc-du-29-juillet-1994.10568.html 94-345 DC]&lt;/ref&gt; on grounds that they violated [[freedom of speech]], and the final form of the law was modified accordingly.

===Enforcement against French subsidiaries of US-based organizations===

In the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groups—the ''Association pour la Défense de la Langue Française'' and the ''L'Avenir de la Langue Française''—filed a complaint against [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]], the [[Metz]] campus of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial [[advertisement]] for the school's courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruno|last=Giussani|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/euro/1231euro.html|title=Georgia Tech Is Sued For Non-French Web Site|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-12-31|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/cyberia-l/msg01052.html|title=Victory in France|publisher=[[Findlaw]]|date=1997-06-09|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.georgiatech-metz.fr/ Georgia Tech Lorraine website today].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company [[General Electric|General Electric Medical Systems]] was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase" /&gt;

A '''trichotomy''' is a three-way classificatory division. Some philosophers pursued trichotomies.

Important trichotomies discussed by [[Aquinas]] include the causal principles (agent, patient, act), the potencies for the intellect (imagination, cogitative power, and memory and reminiscence), and the acts of the intellect (concept, judgment, reasoning), with all of those rooted in Aristotle; also the transcendentals of being (unity, truth, goodness) and the requisites of the beautiful (wholeness, harmony, radiance).

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] expounded a [[category (Kant)#The table of judgments|table of judgments]] involving four three-way alternatives, in regard to (1) Quantity, (2) Quality, (3) Relation, (4) Modality, and, based thereupon, a [[category (Kant)#The table of categories|table of four categories]], named by the terms just listed, and each with three subcategories. Kant also adapted the Thomistic acts of intellect in his trichotomy of higher cognition—(a) understanding, (b) judgment, (c) reason—which he correlated with his adaptation in the soul's capacities—(a) cognitive faculties, (b) feeling of pleasure or displeasure, and (c) faculty of desire&lt;ref name=Kant&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''The Critique of Judgment'', 2007 edition, Cosimo Classics, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;—of [[Johannes Nikolaus Tetens|Tetens]]'s trichotomy of feeling, understanding, will.&lt;ref name=Tetens&gt;Teo, Thomas (2005), ''The critique of psychology: from Kant to postcolonial theory'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] held that a thing's or idea's internal contradiction leads in a dialectical process to a new synthesis that makes better sense of the contradiction. The process is sometimes described as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Triads|thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]. It is instanced across a pattern of trichotomies (e.g. being-nothingness-becoming, immediate-mediate-concrete, abstract-negative-concrete); such trichotomies are not just three-way classificatory divisions; they involve trios of elements functionally interrelated in a process. They are often called triads (but 'triad' does not have that as a fixed sense in philosophy generally).

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] built his philosophy on trichotomies and triadic relations and processes, and framed the "[[categories (Peirce)|Reduction Thesis]]" that every predicate is essentially either monadic (quality), dyadic (relation of reaction or resistance), or triadic (representational relation), and never genuinely and irreducibly tetradic or larger.

'''Upcycling''', also known as '''creative reuse''', is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

Upcycling is the opposite of [[downcycling]], which is the other face of the [[recycling]] process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web | title=Recycling| url=http://blumarble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recycling.pdf| website=Environmental Protection Agency| accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''downcycling'' was first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salvoweb.com/files/sn99sm24y94tk181119.pdf Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. "Recycling," he said, "I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is upcycling, where old products are given more value, not less." He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg, while just down the road a load of similar block was scrapped. In the road outside his premises was the result of the Germans' demolition "waste" recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles, and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?}}

''Upsizing'' was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in 1998 by [[Gunter Pauli]] and given the revised title of ''Upcycling'' in 1999. The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the [[Volkshochschule]] in [[Osnabrück]]. The concept was later incorporated by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new [[raw materials]] when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]] and even [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

This is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner, healthier, and usually have a better value than the material inputs.

For example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications.  However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product.

In 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones: &lt;blockquote&gt;Supporters of the [[environmentally friendly]] practice of upcycling say people in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years, using old packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries, reflecting an increased interest in [[Sustainable products|eco-friendly products]], particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. "If upcycling is going to become mainstream, then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable," said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although the trend is still in its infancy with industry-wide figures yet to be produced.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|date=2009-09-30|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/smallBusinessNews/idUSTRE58T3HX20090930|title=Trash or Treasure? Upcycling Becomes Growing Green Trend|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example, the number of products on [[Etsy]] or [[Pinterest]] tagged with the word "upcycled" increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year later—an increase of 275%.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219310  |title=Upcycling Becomes a Treasure Trove for Green Business Ideas |website=[[Entrepreneur Magazine]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|04}}, that number stood at 263,685, an additional increase of 879%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/news/article_a8276afa-e288-50f3-8573-203e788f9366.html|title=Upcycle trend hits Faribault area|website=Southernminn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material [[downcycling]] occurs when it is not economic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Jonathan|date=2017|title=Circular Economy: Theoretical Benchmark or Perpetual Motion Machine?|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=483–486|doi=10.1111/jiec.12599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material ''upcycling'', in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the last case, ''upcycling'' may be considered worst for environmental emissions strategies if energy comes from fossil fuels.

The tradition of reusing [[found objects]] (''objet trouvé'') in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the 20th century, although it has long been a means of production in [[folk art]].  The [[Amish]] [[quilt]], for example, came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] (1921–1954) in [[Los Angeles]] exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal, pottery and broken glass on a grand scale; it consists of 17 structures, the tallest reaching over 30 meters into the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] skyline.

Intellectually, upcycling bears some resemblance to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] art of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Dadaists]].  Duchamp's "[[Bicycle Wheel]]" (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work.  Pablo Picasso's "[[Bull's Head]]" (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Eric, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703551304576261042931202326 "A Magical Metamorphosis of the Ordinary"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the mid-century the artist [[Joseph Cornell]] fabricated collages and boxed [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] works from old books, found objects and [[ephemera]]. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] collected trash and disused objects, first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York, to incorporate into his art works.

The idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement, however, rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production, is largely a late 20th century concept. [[Romuald Hazoumé]], an artist from the [[West Africa]]n [[Bénin]], was heralded in 2007 for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at [[Documenta]] 12 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]].  Hazoumé has said of these works, "I send back to the West that which belongs to them, that is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caacart.com/pigozzi-artist.php?i=Hazoume-Romuald&amp;m=35|title=Romuald Hazoumé|website=Contemporary African Art Collection – The Pigozzi Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Wassmann]], an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841–1898).  In "''Vorwarts'' (Go Forward)" (pictured), Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the 20th century: an early optometry chart as background, a [[clock spring]] as eye, a 19th-century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of [[dentures]] found on an Australian beach as mouth.  Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the [[commodification]] of his end product.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676092105.html "Hoax Most Perfect"], ''The Age'', October 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of [[street art]] at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on [[acrylic glass]] with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to [[stained glass]] window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in [[Freiburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designmesse für Recycling &amp; Upcycling|url=http://frei-cycle.de/|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
A prominent example is the [[Recycled Orchestra of Cateura]] in [[Paraguay]], created in 2006 by the program '''[http://www.sonidosdelatierra.org.py/ Sounds of the Earth]''', directed by [[Luis Szaran]]. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of [[Asunción]], whose name comes from the [[Cateura]] lagoon in the area. A limited part of its real history is narrated in the film "[[Landfill Harmonic]]", according to the version of [[Favio Chavez]], ex-coordinator of "Sounds of the Earth"&lt;ref name="National Public Radio 14 September 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Tsioulcas |first= Anastasia | authorlink= |title= From Trash To Triumph: The Recycled Orchestra|url= https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2016/09/14/493794763/from-trash-to-triumph-the-recycled-orchestra| date= 14 September 2016|work= [[NPR]] |location=Washington, D.

== In industry ==
Many industrial processes, like plastic and electronic fabrication, rely on the consumption of finite resources.&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes"&gt;Martin, M. and Parsapour, A. 2012. "Upcycling wastes with biogas production : An exergy and economic analysis". Venice 2012: International Symposium on Energy from Biomass and Waste (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carbon nanomaterial"&gt;Zhuo, C. and Levendis, Y. A. 2014. "Upcycling waste plastics into carbon nanomaterials: A review". ''Journal of Applied Polymer Science''. 131, 4 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health.&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes" /&gt; Within this context, upcycling describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and [[resource consumption]] by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams.
INDUSTRIAL UPCYCLING is new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late 2015 on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE, Ostrava, Czech Republic, it was named for the first time INDUSTRY 5.0. It consist of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada, who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Sung|first1=K.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Kettley|first3=S.|date=2014|title=Individual Upcycling Practice: Exploring the Possible Determinants of Upcycling Based on a Literature Review|location=Copenhagen|conference=Sustainable Innovation 2014 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer electronics, the process of re-manufacturing or [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbishment]] of second-hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re-manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it.&lt;ref name="remanufacturing"&gt;Steinhilper, R. and Hieber, M. 2001. "Remanufacturing-the key solution for transforming downcycling into upcycling of electronics". ''Electronics and the Environment'', 2001. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on (2001), 161–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Brewer's spent grain]], a waste product of [[brewing]] processes, as a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] in [[biogas]] processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate's price, a profit of approximately 20% of the operational costs is possible. In this process, the biogas plant acts as an "upcycler".&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes" /&gt;

== In libraries ==
[[File:Upcycled Roses.jpg|thumb|Roses made from upcycled library books.]]

As libraries are becoming more than just bricks, mortar and their collections, modern librarians are increasing their programming efforts. Upcycle programs or classes/clubs are becoming more and more popular, especially with the help of [[Pinterest]]. The Titusville Public Library has an upcycle class that started out by making roses.

An organization called ScrapDC&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrapdc.org/about/what-we-are/ About ScrapDC]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; led Upcycle classes at the [[District of Columbia Public Library]], more specifically their [[Southeast Neighborhood Library]]. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dclibrary.org/node/45020|title=Books, Upcycling, and 3-D Printing: Crafting for the Modern Age!|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jerry Falwell Library]] at [[Liberty University]] holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had 44 submissions of “Art Made from Books”. These submissions were three-dimensional upcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&amp;MID=131771|title=Students transform books into 3D art in library upcycling contest – Liberty University|website=www.liberty.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With food ==
Billions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world, but there are good ways that people reuse the food and find a way to upcycle. A way that is used very often is to feed it to animals because a lot of animals, such as a pig, will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don't eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and telling them how often and how much you can donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-animals|title=Reduce wasted food by feeding animals|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio-fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce a lot of electricity and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/industrial-uses-wasted-food|title=Industrial uses for wasted food|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the food isn't used in those ways, another way is to just break it down and use it in compost, which will improve the soil. Pretty much any type of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, egg shells, nuts, and nut shells, can be used in compost to make it richer soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting|title=reducing the impact of wasted food by feeding the soil and composting|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In design processes ==
Tonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform "trash" into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up-fuse.com/|title=Up-Fuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kubrick.com.hk/index.php/zh_hk/9789889891329.html|title=Kubrick Web Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and area rugs created by reusing hides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://upcyclerefinery.com/about/|title=What We Do – Upcycle Refinery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in [[Hong Kong]] in 2010, was the first experiment on upcycling systems design.  Spanning across material collecting, upcycling design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/culture/art/20130323/18204240|title=升級再造3：廢物‧迷思|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong local inventor [[Gary Chan (inventor)|Gary Chan]] is actively involved in designing and making 'upcycling' bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least 8 bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metropop.com.hk/contents/425/green/1484/|title=土炮發明王|date=2014-10-16|website=www.metropop.com.hk|language=zh-HK|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yp.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/92828/gary-chan-bad-boy-bicycle-building-hong-kong|title=Gary Chan is the bad boy of bicycle building in Hong Kong|website=Young Post {{!}} South China Morning Post|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas, hardwood plates of wardrobes, or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eweekly.hk/article/_title/%25E8%25BD%2586%25E8%25BD%2586%25E7%2584%25A1%25E7%25AA%25AE_kpdo78smj3|title=E Media+ {{!}} E週刊 {{!}}  e+娛樂 {{!}} Mode {{!}} 美食旅客|website=eweekly.hk|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts evolve allover the world to tackle issue of rising excess of waste through creation of [[Circular economy|circular economies]] within the communities.

== Potential technologies and applications ==
The worldwide plastic production was 280 million tons in 2011 and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]].&lt;ref name="carbon nanomaterial" /&gt; In order to solve this problem, the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them.

One approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics (like [[LDPE]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], and [[HDPE]]) into [[paramagnetic]], conducting microspheres&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013"&gt;Mondal, M., Gohs, U., Wagenknecht, U. and Heinrich, G. 2013. "Polypropylene/natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates by eco-friendly and sustainable electron induced reactive processing". ''Radiation Physics and Chemistry''. 88, 0 (2013), 74–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and [[chemical vapor deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Altalhi, Tushar Kumeria, Abel Santos, Dusan Losic, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.003 "Synthesis of well-organised carbon nanotube membranes from non-degradable plastic bags with tuneable molecular transport: Towards nanotechnological recycling"], ''Carbon'', Volume 63, November 2013, pp. 423-433, {{ISSN|0008-6223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a molecular level, the treatment of [[polymers]] like [[polypropylene]] or [[thermoplastics]] with [[electron beam]]s (doses around 150 [[gray (unit)|kGy]]) can increase material properties like [[bending strength]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and provides an eco-friendly and [[sustainable]] way to upcycle them.&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Czvikovszky, T. and Hargitai, H. 1997. "Electron beam surface modifications in reinforcing and recycling of polymers. Nuclear Instruments and Methods" in ''Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms''. 131, 1–4 (1997), 300–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active research is being carried out for the [[biotransformation]] upcycling of plastic waste (e.g., [[polyethylene terephthalate]] and [[polyurethane]]) into [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] [[bioplastic]] using bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p4sb.eu/|title=Homepage – P4SB|website=www.p4sb.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PET could be converted into the biodegradable [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets [[pyrolysis|pyrolized]] at 450&amp;nbsp;°C and the resulting [[terephthalic acid]] is used as a substrate for microorganisms, which convert it finally into PHA.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, S.T., Runic, J.N., Kaminsky, W., Woods, T., Babu, R.P., Keely, C.M., Blau, W. and O’Connor, K.E. 2008. "Up-Cycling of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) to the Biodegradable Plastic PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoate)". ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology''. 42, 20 (2008), 7696–7701.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic [[dye]]s from [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain, N., Basniwal, R. K., Suman, Srivastava, A. K., &amp; Jain, V. K. (2010). "Reusable nanomaterial and plant biomass composites for the removal of methylene blue from water", ''Environmental Technology'', 31(7), 755-760.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biotechnology]] companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste, or [[biomass]], to different chemicals or commodities.  One company in particular, [[BioTork]], has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the [[USDA]] to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into [[fish feed]].  As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii, BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality, omega-rich fish feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2014/08/07/hawaii-funds-biotork-advanced-biofuel-technology/|title=Hawaii Funds BioTork Advanced Biofuel Technology|website=Domestic Fuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Clothes == 
Designers have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre-consumer or post-consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre-consumer waste is made while in the factory, such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. post-consumer waste refers to the finished product when it’s no longer useful to the owner, such as donated clothes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.triplepundit.com/special/sustainable-fashion-2014/upcycling-new-wave-sustainable-fashion/|title=Upcycling: The New Wave of Sustainable Fashion|date=May 8, 2014|author= Beth Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Often, we practice linear economy where we are content to buy, use then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second-most polluting industry after oil &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://textilebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg|title=Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;. while most textiles produced are recyclable, around 85% end-up in landﬁlls in the USA alone &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=Sabine |last2=Lynes |first2=Jennifer |last3=Young |first3=Steven B. |title=Fashion interest as a driver for consumer textile waste management: reuse, recycle or disposal |journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies |date=March 2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=207–215 |doi=10.1111/ijcs.12328}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fast fashion companies are huge contributors to these problems as their whole purpose is to mass produce cheap clothing.
To live a sustainable life we need other clothing options that demonstrates the opposite to the throw away attitude fast fashion has lead us to. Upcycling can help us with this as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible, getting the most value out of them while in use, then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungart’s this has also been known as the cradle-to-cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.flinders.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2.pdf|title=Sustainability in Fashion|editor=Claudia E. Henninger|editor2=Panayiota J. Alevizou|editor3=Helen Goworek|editor4=Daniella Ryding|date=|website=flinders.edu.au|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only does upcycling help environmentally but there are also economic benefits. By reusing materials that others may not find as desirable there are huge savings that can be made on buying supplies for business or personal use. At schools or university upcycling for art, craft and design can be an easy and cheap way to prototype or finish a student project. The can also be an economic benefit with the final product. By it definition upcycling means increasing value to the original product and this can be done by changing/adding your own spin to the design or improving material quality or fixing broken clothes.

'''Viola Klein''' (1908–1973) was a sociologist in [[Great Britain]]. Her work demonstrated that objective ideas about women's attributes are socially constructed. Although her early training was in psychology and philosophy, her most prolific research engagements concerned women's social roles and how these changed after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. She was one of the first scholars to bring quantitative evidence to bear on this socio-economic topic. Her research not only illuminated the changing roles of women in society, but she also wrote and lectured on concrete social and political changes that would help facilitate these new roles.

==Early life==

Viola Klein was born in [[Vienna]] in 1908 to a [[Jew]]ish family. As a young student she moved to [[Prague]] with her family owing to political circumstances after studying one year at the [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]] and a short period at the [[University of Vienna]]. She continued her studies at the University in Prague and graduated in fields of [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]]. During her studies in Prague she worked as an assistant editor. Besides psychology and philosophy, she was also interested in [[French literature]]. Her first doctoral thesis was about the linguistic style of the modernist French author [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]] (Lyon 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;831). Because of her interest in the woman question she visited the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s. Inspired by this visit she wrote several articles in British magazines about “double speak” (Lyon 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;832). It represented the new role of women in society, marriage and the family.&lt;ref name="reading.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/adlib/Details/archiveSpecial/110014353|title=University of Reading - Archive and Museum Database -   Details|work=reading.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1938 she and her brother migrated to [[England]]. Shortly after fleeing, Viola's parents died in a [[Nazi concentration camp]].

As Jewish refugees, Viola and her brother had problems finding work in England. For a short period of time she worked as a domestic servant until she finally received a scholarship from the Czech government operating in exile (Lyon 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;832). This enabled her to enroll in the [[London School of Economics]] and to work on her second doctorate diploma. During her studies in [[London]] she met the well-known sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]], who became her supervisor. Because of their similar cultural background they were interested in similar social issues, literature and art. Both of them were collecting information and ideas relating to her thesis while traveling across the country between different universities. In 1946 Viola Klein published her second thesis, one of her best known publications - The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology. This publication was criticized because of its ostensibly militant feminism which departed from the traditional views and values. Her encouragement of women to work if they so desired, was perceived by critics as a destructive social force, provoking destabilization and family problems.&lt;ref name="reading.ac.uk"/&gt;

Viola worked in relatively lower status positions as editor, translator and teacher. However, she continued her research working on female employment in Great Britain (Lyon, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;834). Starting in 1951 she collaborated with the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] sociologist [[Alva Myrdal]] and together they eventually published the book Women's Two Roles: Home and Work. This publication helped her to increase her involvement in international research activities. In 1964 she was offered her first academic post as lecturer in the Sociology department at the University of Reading in Great Britain. After 3 years she was promoted to senior lecturer and in 1971 to reader.

In 1973, shortly after her retirement she died at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="reading.ac.uk"/&gt;

== General overview ==
Viola Klein's thoughts were constructed around the meaning of a femininity concept and the social creation of a feminine character. In her first important work: The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology, she claimed that attitudes in society considered as feminine are not factual observations but preconceptions and particular subjective interpretations (Klein, Correspondence, May 30, 1942, Klein papers). Providing a question about sources of the knowledge about womanhood and examining studies from the beginning of the 19th century, she wanted to prove that “what we think of specific perspectives are not guaranteed truths but the ideas subject to the influence of surrounding culture and personal bias” (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;134). With her work Klein wanted to demonstrate that scientists, whose assumptions result from particular branches of knowledge, are not free from the social, cultural and historical climates of their time (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;30). She observed that scientific objective studies about femininity are full of stereotypes and repeat particular traits like “passivity, emotionally, lack of abstract interests, greater intensity of personal relationships and, an instinctive tenderness for babies” (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;164). Therefore, she wanted to define a feminine nature, using notions of social and cultural expectations (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;171) “Klein sought to isolate psychological influences on sex difference by excluding sex-related traits that could be attributed to social function, historic tradition and prevailing ideology” (Klein, 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;129).

=== Gender, Sex Roles and Role Theory ===
For a long time before the concept of gender was used in scientific discourse (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995), Viola Klein considered Role Theory in her research on what is feminine (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;148; Klein 1946). Pointing out that every individual in society occupies various social positions; Klein wrote that each position includes particular patterns of roles and behaviors (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;136). According to Klein, the process of becoming an adult is the action of learning appropriate role patterns like mother's role, teacher's role, school girl's role (Terrant 2006) and within every particular society these patterns are understood differently (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;136). “Male and female roles are thought to be the new members of the social group in innumerable and subtle ways almost from birth. They are reinforced by experience, example, innuendos and the various others means by which social control is usually exercised” (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;136).Starting from stereotypes about womanhood and sex-role prejudices, Klein explained that the framework in which individuals develop and which shapes the way individuals adapt is full of common belief, social opinion, and tradition (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;1).

What Klein started in her research supervised by Mannheim and known as an ideology of feminine character (Klein 1946) came to be known as psychosocial orientation after 1975 and eventually subsumed into the nexus that we know today as gender. (Butler 1990). As Shira Terrant claimed, Klein's research about femininity conceptualized within Mannheim methodology - underestimated by the second-wave of feminists - in fact gave roots to this concept (Terrant 2006). Contrary to Parsons’ functionalistic understanding of Role Theory and sex-roles division, Klein understood the concept more broadly, that femininity and masculinity should include also personal traits that can be more or less assigned to the opposite sex's character (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;150) a concept later solidified in transgender and queer theory (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995).

=== The Sociology of knowledge ===
Within Mannheim's sociology of knowledge framework (Wikipedia outline: The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human  and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies) and its standpoint to understand how “individuals give meaning to their ongoing reality within context [that is] structured by specific institutions [and how] social values structure our perception, give legitimacy to certain ways of seeing the world, and give moral credence to particular patterns of relationships” (Farganias, p.&amp;nbsp;12-13) reality is understood by individuals within institutionally structured frameworks. Klein was the first who used Mannheim's theory and applied it to studies about a particular subject: femininity (Terrant 2006). Concerning the social world, “Mannheim’s perspective required the thinker to look for ways of interpreting the situation more clearly and productively” (Terrant 2006). Within this exposure and conceptualization of social reality this way of examining reality can provide motivation for women's emancipation.

Political thought of women (connecting gender, race, &amp; nationality)
Klein considered the problem of social construction of the feminine more widely, women and men of one society being participants of two cultural systems and in regards to hegemonic norms, one is dominant to the other (Klein 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;174). In this context, Klein understood that women have a secondary status like particular discriminated groups in society, for example black Americans, Jews or immigrants (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;171). What she believed to be the most challenging for women was that they “internalized the sense of secondary status” (Klein 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;174), thus many accepted their own suppression. Klein called this phenomenon “a collective inferiority complex” (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;152) which she saw as analogous to other minority groups (Klein 1942).

For Klein, the reason for women's conformity and acceptance of their secondary status, are social attitudes manifested in powerful institutions of sex-roles, power and dominance-submission relations, and group prejudices (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;152). The problem with the change of women's situations, according to her, was the strong character of stereotypes which are socially reproduced and carried from generation to generation enduring in people's minds (Terrant 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;153).

== Viola Klein and Karl Mannheim ==
During the period that Klein knew [[Karl Mannheim]], he was a good friend and a mentor to her. His theory of the sociology of knowledge as well as his scientific modus operandi greatly influenced Klein (Tarrant 2006). Both were refugees from the Nazi regime, they first encountered each other in the London School of Economics, where Mannheim helped and guided Klein in the process of earning her second doctorate, this time in sociology. At first naming her thesis “Feminism and Antifeminism: A Study in Ideologies and Social Attitudes”, by the time of its completion in 1944 and its publication in 1946 the title and subject had changed to The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology (Tarrant 2006, 137).

== The Feminine Character - History of an Ideology==
The book The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology [first published in 1946, second edition in 1971] is the second major thesis of Viola Klein. This work is introduced with a foreword by Karl Mannheim where he explains that the question of the feminine character cannot be reached with only one field of study; for instance he said that we can find this topic in “biology, philosophy, psycho-analysis, experimental psychology, psychometrics, history, literary history, anthropology and sociology.” (p. vii). All these fields of knowledge have their own rules of research, with different results but complementarity of themes and utilities. According to Mannheim “All of the social sciences have a common method to - the understanding of human behavior; a common method the quantitative analysis of behavior records; and a common aspiration - to devise ways of experimenting upon behavior.” (p. xii). In this foreword, he argues in favor of Viola Klein's intentions which had been criticized by other authors. To him she took old research not to plagiarize, but to give rise to another outlook. He explains that she tried to create new questioning based on already completed research in different fields of studies.

In the preface to the second edition, Viola Klein responds to criticism from other authors, especially sociologists who reproach her for a lack of own research and sociological studies. The writer Rosa Macaulay, was one such critic who accused her of using “secondary sources” instead of doing “original research”  (p. xv). Viola Klein explains that the universal theme that is the feminine role deserves to be constantly re-examined and matched with old and new studies, because scholars’ ways of thinking guide our understandings of society more subjectively than objectively, regardless of the empirical framework. Given the universal theme of women and femininity she argues looking at the historical background of the social status of women, to see and compare feminine traits according to politics, socio-economics, and epochs, is perennially useful to social scientists, if not lay thinkers in general.

“The feminine character” is her a psycho-sociological term to label “femininity” as a “psychosexual orientation” (p. xvii). This idea of psychosexual orientation comes from biology where the feminine character is only defined by the physiological sex concept. From this point of view Klein wanted to show how Role Theory has been developed. This theory is not about “sex roles” but more about male and female behavior, “temperament” that the society assigns to them. Even though her book was criticized for the way she researched and wrote, it helped develop the [[Psychometrics|psychometric method]].

The aim of her book was the “clarification of the idea of “femininity” (p.&amp;nbsp;1). Some main questions about the evolution of new women's roles and traits, structure Viola Klein's thesis: What is the new ideal of femininity? What are the effects on women's personality and how are they represented and considered by other social groups?
Trying to answer these issues, the book shows that as long as society's expectations are changing, the feminine character will change in shape. Comparing different research demonstrates that the scientific knowledge has directly or indirectly influenced the “general trend of intellectual and emotional development.” This influence by sciences is called “the mental climate” (p.&amp;nbsp;2). She especially notes the difference between scientific and social knowledge. In regards to sociology for example it is difficult to determine the “truth” when constructing an analysis. Scholars are heavily influenced by their social and cultural backgrounds which add to the subjectivity found in sociology. Scientific knowledge relies on such pragmatic instruments for analysis like theorems and formulas. That's why she mentions that relativism is avoided as long as possible.

Some contexts are given to conform with research on: “(a) the status of women in a given society; (b) the prevailing ideologies concerning women in a certain historical period, and (c) the author’s personal attitudes towards women.” (p.&amp;nbsp;3-4). The masculine standards influencing society situate women as an “outgroup”. This term describes implicitly the unequal strata of society. The concept of “outgroup” is based on “physical characteristics, historical tradition, social role and different process of socialization.” (p.&amp;nbsp;4).
Some turning points began the process of emancipation of women and their roles inside the social group that they are assigned to in societies. The first one was the Industrial Revolution; technological changes and surges in demand for labor implied that physical strength or traditional forms of labor no longer defined who could be productive. Then World War II led women to take on both male and female types of work, because only men were sent to fight and die, while women were left to maintain society and families (in both care and economic stability). Moreover, the capitalist ideology, itself supported by the spreading of democracy during the second part of the twentieth century, celebrated women's emancipation as labor was the engine of production, and more laborers meant more profits. The democracy ideology extols the equality between all human beings. Thus this thought reevaluates the role of the woman in society. Democratic institutions inevitably lead to enfranchisement. Also to be noted is that development led to the size of families decreasing, meaning that women had less (second shift) work to do in the family. All of these changes lead to a shift in how society views women.

"Owing, presumably, to the emotional character of philanthropic work and to the absence of pecuniary profit attaching to it, it did not seem “improper” for women of standing to engage in charitable activities, and soon we find ladies of rank and consequence running charity organizations, working for prison reform, collecting rent in the slums of the East End of London, embarking on propaganda for the abolition of slavery, against cruelty to children, against alcoholism and prostitution, and for the emancipation of women. The social history of the nineteenth century is full of women pioneers in all fields of social reform." (p.17).

== Women's Two Roles ==
This book was co-written by Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, and supported by the International Federation of University of Women (IFUW) “to make an international survey of the needs for social reforms if women are to be put into a position to reconcile family and professional life” (p.&amp;nbsp;IX). The method was essentially questionnaires distributed by the IFUW in developed countries (USA, UK, France and Sweden).
Women's roles had been changing for many decades. They shifted from a paradigm of “What can women do?” to “what should women do ?” (p. xi). Women are thought to be the strong link between family and the human role of “continuation of the race” (p. xi). Here, there have been two conflicting roles since the industrial revolution: taking part in societal roles of economic and even political natures, and having home roles of caring and household management.

Both roles were formerly situated within household which were both the main centers of family care and economic production. After the industrial revolution society needs to “regenerate itself” (p. xii) perpetually, because development and progress demand that women continue in the economic sphere as they had in former times, but this takes them out of the household and into the factory or office. Many different cultural-institutional traditions, e.g. Christianity, Islam, Communism and National Socialism, have divergent ideologies for the role(s) of women.

The women's social revolution took place in two main phases; the first one being the acceptance of women in a larger variety of jobs that were formerly restricted to “masculine jobs” (p.&amp;nbsp;1), and the second being “the growing number of women [combining] family and employment” (p.&amp;nbsp;1). Before the Industrial Revolution, women had an economic function within the family; they weren’t working in a company but instead at home, crafting clothes, baking bread, making soap, raising the family (p.&amp;nbsp;4). After the industrial revolution, the economic function shifted to companies, this fueled not working as “a high standard of living” for women to define their upper class statuses.

During this period, publications were released measuring comparative aptitudes and traits of men and women. Psychologists and sociologists proved that women and men were not so different and if a man tended to be stronger for example, a woman was more agile. This process had been accelerated by both the World Wars, women had a huge importance in economic capital when men were fighting on the battlefield. After these wars, women had more favorable positions in economic progress: “Our society has begun to accept the fact that women are in jobs to stay” (p.&amp;nbsp;4). With it also came the emancipation of women with the right to vote, to work, and to education. The right to vote earned after World War I in the US, UK, Sweden and after World War II in France (p.&amp;nbsp;7) meant women were now political equals as well. The right to education allowed access to a larger range of fields like medicine formerly restricted to males.The right to work finally claimed by women “to regain position in the economic productivity and sense of social usefulness, the restitution of their lost share (…) Work moved out of the home, women wanted to move after it” (p.&amp;nbsp;7).

The second phase of this social revolution had two major developments; “the increased average life-expectancy” and “the change of the size and structure of the family” (p.&amp;nbsp;13). Better hygienic conditions in societies and massive increases in medical knowledge and technology led to infant mortality decreasing greatly between 1850 and 1950 coupled with longer life expectancy, with averages crossing 70 years of age whereas “one half of female population died before the age of 45” (p.&amp;nbsp;7) a hundred years before. Over the decades the average family size shrank. While in Victorian times, families had more than 5 children, the average was between 2 and 5 children in 1920 (p.&amp;nbsp;20) and in 1951 the proportion of women under 50 who had more than 5 children was merely 4,4% (p.&amp;nbsp;23). Myrdal and Klein predicted that families in the future would have an average of three children. Moreover, the interval between marriage and the first child should be two years and between every birth there should be a space of two years. If a woman got married at 22, the period of motherhood would be around 10 years “after which her expectation of life would be a further 40 years” (p.&amp;nbsp;24), a large period ripe with opportunities for other productive activities. Also there was a new development in the family structure; daughters were leaving home at the same time as sons, demanding independence that is “high in our scale of social value” (p.&amp;nbsp;25) to go to university, look for a job, and pursue independence. Daughters were not leaving home anymore just because they were getting married.

Today there exist two spheres of work and home. The equilibrium between the demands of the community and the needs of individuals was more stable in former times when these spheres shared the same geographic location by family (p.&amp;nbsp;29), “families work and leisure were shared much more evenly between men and women”, leading to an asymmetric but more efficient partnership (p.&amp;nbsp;29). With the industrial revolution, things changed; the sphere of work was created and belonged to men while the home sphere was “the woman’s world” (p.&amp;nbsp;28). But when women got access to education, work, etc.
the home role “should be done jointly by men and women if the ideal of a happy home is to become a reality” (p.&amp;nbsp;29). Nevertheless, a majority of men enjoyed using their leisure time to accomplish some work-hobbies at home, becoming an amateur painter, carpenter, etc. while women still took on the lion's share of household duties.

The authors separate a woman's adulthood into three phases. The first one is a step that lasts around 7–10 years in European countries and 5 years in the USA. It corresponds to the first years in adulthood, after school but before marriage. Only a few will stay in this phase corresponding to women who don't get married. In European countries 82% of women in this phase were working whereas it fell down to 51% in the USA. In this phase women are living a kind of “man’s life” before their marriage; they are independent.
When getting married the second phase of woman's adulthood begins, motherhood. Due to child rearing, the home becomes their workplace. The weekly work load for a housewife rises depending on the number of children: an average of 56 hrs with no children and up to 78 hrs for three. The crucial fact described is that for working women the weekly work load in both spheres is 84 hrs with no children and 85 hrs with three, which goes to show the result of the combined strain of both spheres of life. Afterwards women enter the third phase of adulthood, when their children grow up and leave home. A period of crisis can follow, the housewife is now alone, she does not have as much to do at home as before and looking for a job at 40 is complicated. “The traditional stereotype is still at work in the minds of women themselves, making them believe that they are much older and much less capable than they in fact are” (p.&amp;nbsp;40).

The authors noticed sex divisions were different in observed countries except in nursing and teaching. Pharmacology and dentistry in France and Sweden became feminine fields of work. In the US, it was in finance, insurance and real estates (44% of women in UK work in this field) (p.&amp;nbsp;76). These conditions resulted from local conditions and traditions. One thing the authors were sure about was that the choice made by women was “strongly influenced by the role they hope to play in family” (p.&amp;nbsp;77). In the future women will constitute a good portion of the labor market and it will permit women to soon do “more heart-searching when choosing a career” (p.&amp;nbsp;156) and obviously it is still important that they continue to fight for equality of rights between men and women.

'''Violence in sports''' usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a [[sports|sports game]], often in relation to contact sports such as [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], [[rugby football]], [[lacrosse]], [[association football]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], and [[water polo]] and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.

==Causes==
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are "mock battles" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salamone |first1=Frank A. |title=Society, Culture, Leisure and Play |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=9780761816256 |pages=273–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence by athletes==
Through a "civilizing process", many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"/&gt;
 
Athletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.

In boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in [[ice hockey]] and [[Australian Football League]] matches.

===Ritual violence===
High school, college, and even professional sports teams often include [[initiation]] ceremonies (known as [[hazing]] in the USA) as a [[rite of passage]]. A 1999 study by [[Alfred University]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/.|title=Alfred University : News : NCAA Sports Survey|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.

Violence may also be related to nationalism or as an outlet for underlying social tensions. It is often [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]-related.

Violence by supporters of sports teams dates back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots. Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The [[Nika riots]] of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.

In periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans – the [[Astor Place Riot]] in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.

The actions of English [[association football|football]] [[football hooliganism|hooligans]] and [[football firm|firms]] in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the recent [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] tournament, [[England national football team|England]] were publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Alan Rothenberg]] (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:

{{cquote|There were three countries in the world whose presence would have created logistical and security problems, so we're very pleased they won't be coming: Iraq, Iran and England.}}

===Notable examples of fan violence===

* In 532, the rivalry between supporters of the ''Blue'' and ''Green'' [[chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|chariot-racing]] teams in [[Constantinople]] led to 30,000 deaths in the [[Nika riots]].
* The first meeting in the [[Holy War (Utah vs. BYU)|American football rivalry]] between [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University]] and the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] took place in April 1896, when BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy. The two schools disagree to this day as to whether this game was official, but it mattered greatly to the spectators—at the end of the game, the two sets of fans fought one another.
* In the second edition of the [[Tour de France]] in [[1904 Tour de France|1904]], as the riders climbed the [[Col de la République]] in the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], supporters of regional favorite [[Antoine Faure]] physically attacked several of his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Woodland, Les (2007), ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey Press, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=2981&amp;Section=Route |title=Tour 1904 : mort de son succès| work=Vélo 101, le site officiel du vélo |publisher=Velo101.com |date=October 30, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2012|language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repercussions of this incident continue to this day—the Tour did not return to Loire until [[1950 Tour de France|1950]], and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Yellow Jersey Companion to the Tour de France|last= Woodland|first= Les| publisher=Yellow Jersey Press| year=2003 | isbn=0-224-063189|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 11 times since then, its appearances in the [[1903 Tour de France|1903]] and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|title=Col de la République was eerste berg in Tour de France|author=Van den Bogaart, Ronnie|language=Dutch|date=November 10, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2012|publisher=Sportgeschiedenis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226001610/http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|archive-date=February 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1972, [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] pummeled [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] 30–3 in their annual [[Civil War (college football game)|"Civil War"]] football rivalry game, held this season at Oregon State's [[Parker Stadium]]. After the game, jubilant Oregon fans rushed the field and tore down the south goal post. They then turned to do the same to the north goal post, but were met by Oregon State fans who had come on the field, resulting in a major brawl.&lt;ref name=TO112208&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindbeaversbeat/2008/11/civil_war_5_moments_that_fanne.html |title=Civil War: 5 moments that fanned the flames of the rivalry |first=Seth |last=Prince |work=The Oregonian |date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1975 Tour de France|1975]], cyclist [[Eddy Merckx]] was viciously punched by a spectator as he climbed the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] in the Tour de France. Merckx, who had won the Tour de France five times previously and at the time was in the leader's yellow jersey, finished the stage barely able to breathe, and went on to finish the tour in second place overall.
* The [[Scottish Cup 1979–80|1980 Scottish Cup Final]] between bitter [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] was marred by an on-pitch riot between rival fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daEMvQsWys8|title=Celtic 1 Rangers 0 1980 Scottish 'riot' Cup Final|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the banning of alcohol from Scottish football and rugby matches.
* After [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[Alan Minter]] in three rounds to win boxing's world middleweight title at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1980, many of Minter's supporters began to throw beer cans, bottles and other objects into the ring. Both Hagler and Minter, along with their respective handlers, had to be escorted out by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]].
* On August 12, 1984, during a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] that degenerated into a [[beanball]] war:&lt;ref name="Beanball war"&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball Hall of Shame |last=Nash |first=Bruce |author2=Zullo, Allan  |year=1989 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-671-68766-3 |pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtX4CreRGNEC&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=braves+padres+beanball+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nrJVzVYn9V&amp;sig=aYSg6y7nXtxQmR6Ip82h12bv0GI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CDq2TKy4GsSBlAfMrpnvBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** At least five fans were dragged from the field at [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] in handcuffs after participating in a bench-clearing brawl.
** One of the fans was charged with assault for throwing a full beer mug at the Padres' [[Kurt Bevacqua]], hitting him in the head, as he was returning to the dugout.
** The game ended with police riot squads on top of both dugouts in an obvious attempt to keep fans away from the players.
* At the end of [[1984 Major League Baseball season|the same season]], violence erupted outside of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in Detroit after the [[Detroit Tigers]] defeated the Padres in the [[World Series]]. A well known photo from the riot shows a Tigers fan holding a World Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car.
* [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] – 39 people died when a wall collapsed under pressure of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] supporters fleeing from 'football [[football hooliganism|hooligans]]' supporting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] during the [[1985 European Cup Final]].
* [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]] – a 1990 football match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] was abandoned after ten minutes with thousands of fans fighting each other and the police. One of the Zagreb players, [[Zvonimir Boban]], was seen to kick a policeman, and after an hour long riot, the stadium was set on fire. Dinamo fans saw the riot as the beginning of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montague|first=James|title=Five games that changed the world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/01/05/iraq.asia.six.games/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, a mentally ill tennis fan stabbed [[Monica Seles]] during a changeover at a tennis match in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175121/I-ballooned-size-8-18-I-stabbed-fan-says-tennis-ace-Monica-Seles.html|title='I ballooned from size 8 to 18 after I was stabbed by a fan,' says tennis ace Monica Seles|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, [[Vancouver Canucks]] fans [[1994 Stanley Cup riot|rioted]] in the streets of [[Vancouver]] after their team lost in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup finals]].
* During the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombian]] football (soccer) player [[Andrés Escobar]] accidentally scored an [[own goal]] in a match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], a match which Colombia lost 2–1.  On his return to [[Colombia]], Escobar was confronted outside a bar in [[Medellín]] by a gunman who shot the player six times, killing him.  The gunman reportedly shouted "''¡Gol!''" ("Goal!") for each bullet fired.
* Rioting Indian fans at the Eden Gardens stadium in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] forced the end of the semi-final match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]]. Fans started rioting when the home team, seemingly on the way to victory, underwent a dramatic batting collapse. [[Match referee]] [[Clive Lloyd]] brought the teams off the ground for their safety, then attempted to restart the match. When the fans remained throwing projectiles and damaging stadium facilities, the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka (who went on to win the World Cup).
* In 1996 during a night [[Australian Football League]] match at [[Waverley Park]] in [[Melbourne]] between [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a [[pitch invasion]] occurred when the lights went out during the third quarter. Initially, a serious car crash into power lines in the nearby area was reported to have caused the [[Power outage|blackout]], although it was later confirmed to be a major electrical fault. In the midst of the chaos, fans rioted and stormed the ground, some lighting bonfires in the centre square, and removing two of the behind posts. The incidents were filmed on [[Network Seven]], and the remaining quarter and a half was played three nights later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~brad/96/round10.htm Round 10 1996, Essendon vs. St Kilda], Bomber Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, [[Denver Broncos]] fans rioted in the streets of [[Denver]] after their team won [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Near-riots happened when the team won the Super Bowl again the following year and after the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] wins in 1996 and 2001.
* A similar incident occurred in [[Oakland, California]] in 2003 when fans rioted and destroyed property after the [[Oakland Raiders]] lost to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].
* In July 2000, 13 people were trampled to death in a riot at a [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifying match in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe after [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] took a 2–0 lead over [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]].
* In June 2000, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] fans stormed the streets of Los Angeles after the Lakers victory over the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] [[NBA Finals]]. Fans briefly celebrated by starting [[bonfire]]s, but it soon turned into a riot, with fans dancing and stomping on parked cars, and even turning a news van over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/798383.stm |work=BBC News | title=Riots after Lakers win NBA title | date=June 20, 2000 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2001 during an Australian Football League match between [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at [[Visy Park|Optus Oval]], Geelong's Darren Milburn executed a very late and illegal [[Bump (football)|bump]] on Carlton's [[Steven Silvagni]], collecting Silvagni's head with his hip, knocking Silvagni unconscious and leaving him having to be carried from the field by trainers. Milburn then proceeded to clap towards the crowd after being substituted, further igniting the situation; Carlton fans threatened Milburn, attempted to enter the interchange box to assault him, and attempted to attack Milburn's police escort in the car park after the match.&lt;ref&gt;Atwell, Glen. [http://www.sporttalk.com.au/afl-milburn-knocks-out-silvagni-2001/ AFL: Stephen Silvagni knocked out by Darren Milburn], SportTalk.com.au, May 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Milburn was suspended for three matches for the incident.
* In May 2004 after an [[Australian Football League]] Friday Night Football match between [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and St Kilda at [[AAMI Stadium]] which St Kilda won by 32 points, field umpires were booed and abused by Adelaide fans, and a drink bottle was thrown which hit a 12-year-old St Kilda fan. One fan was ejected and banned for one year from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/crows-fan-faces-ban/story-e6frecj3-1225698262430 Crows fan facing one year ban after young Saints fan injured]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2004 in the [[AFL Cairns|Cairns Australian Football League]] Grand Final between the North Cairns Tigers and the Port Douglas Crocs at [[Cazaly's Stadium]], a wild and violent 15&amp;nbsp;minute bench-clearing brawl erupted after Tigers players charged at the Crocs pre-match huddle at the end of the national anthem, and escalated when fans and team officials became involved. One fan was arrested and another five were ejected, while three Crocs players and a Crocs runner were left unconscious and having to be carried from the arena on stretchers. After a lengthy AFL investigation, the instigator, North Cairns Tigers coach and former VFL/AFL player Jason Love, was suspended for eight years, and the 22 North Cairns players were suspended for a total of 400 matches (suspensions ranging from 10 matches to five years) on a string of charges in relation to starting the brawl; the Tigers were forced to forfeit their first match of 2005 as a result of these suspensions. AFL Cairns declared the Grand Final a "no result" and withheld the 2004 premiership.&lt;ref name="ABC_AU_554742"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-20/probe-launched-into-cairns-afl-brawl/554742 |title=Probe launched into Cairns AFL brawl |date=September 20, 2004 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1203277.htm|title=PM – AFL yet to decide fate of brawling players|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/AFL/Eightyear-ban-for-exSwan/2005/02/23/1109046993483.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eight-year ban for ex-Swan | date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2004, fans of the Boston Red Sox rioted just outside Fenway Park after the Red Sox won the [[2004 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] over the New York Yankees. Police used "pepper guns" in some cases and an Emerson College student, [[Victoria Snelgrove]], was killed by a pepper filled paintball-like projectile which hit her in the eye.
* On November 19, 2004, near the end of an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]], a [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|brawl]] erupted between Pacers players and Pistons supporters.
* On April 12, 2005, the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarterfinal between [[local derby|intracity rivals]] [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]] was abandoned after Inter fans threw missiles and flares on to the pitch at the [[San Siro]] stadium, with A.C. Milan goalkeeper [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] hit by a flare.
* In May 2006 during an [[Australian Football League]] match between [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a North Melbourne fan had a provocative confrontation with coach [[Dean Laidley]], to which Laidley responded with a verbal barrage, inviting the fan to the club rooms to see how badly the players were feeling due to their consistently poor on-field performance. The incident was captured on Australian national television. The fan committed suicide by throwing himself in the path of an oncoming train the next morning.
* On June 6, 2010, the final game of the [[Greek Basket League]] finals between ancient rivals [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] (PAO), also respectively known as the "Reds" and "Greens" from their club colors, degenerated into what one commentator called a "night of shame" for [[Basketball in Greece|Greek basketball]].&lt;ref name="Night of shame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |title=On "Night of Shame", Panathinaikos Takes 8th Consecutive Greek Title in Riot Conditions |work=BallinEurope.com |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629090042/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panathinaikos entered the game, held at Olympiacos' home of [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], with a 2–1 lead in the best-of-5 series. The homestanding Reds fans were reportedly incensed at what they considered to be biased officiating in the Greens' favor in Game 3. The violence began even before tipoff, with police forced to use tear gas on rioting Reds fans; the game started 40 minutes late.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |title=Olympiakos fans force Game 4 to be suspended |work=SportinGreece.com |date=June 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054552/http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, with PAO leading 50–42, the game was halted for about an hour after Olympiacos fans threw various incendiaries at the PAO bench, with one smoke bomb exploding next to the bench.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; By the time the teams resumed play, all but about 2,000 fans had left.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; Then, with little over a minute left in the game and PAO ahead 76–69, many of the remaining Reds fans began throwing objects on the court, leading the officials to suspend play and forfeit the game to PAO, giving the Greens the title.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; The new champions had to be escorted off the floor by riot police.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; The league organizer, [[Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association|HEBA]], fined Olympiacos €111,000 and required them to play their first nine home games of the [[2010–11 Greek Basket League|2010–11 season]] behind closed doors and without live TV coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |title=Brutal Week for Greek Basketball Capped With 80–72 Loss to Spain |work=BallinEurope.com |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629072426/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Riot aftermath Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Damaged vehicle in the aftermath of the 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]]
* The [[2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]] immediately followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team to the Boston Bruins in the deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in June of that year.
* Later in the same month, major violence broke out involving supporters of historic Argentine football club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] during and after their promotion/relegation playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]]. The first leg on June 22 [[Estadio Gigante de Alberdi|in Córdoba]] was delayed for 20 minutes after River Plate hooligans tore through a fence and stormed the field to verbally and physically attack River players. The second leg, on June 26 at [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|El Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, had what was reported to be the largest security presence for any match in the country's history, with over 2,200 police called in. However, it was not enough to keep River hooligans, angered at what became the club's first relegation from the top flight in their history, from rushing the field. Violence quickly spread, with fires set in the stadium, pitched battles between hooligans and police, and looting in nearby areas. At least 35 police and 55 civilians were reported to have been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6706438/river-plate-relegated-argentine-2nd-division-first-time-club-history |title=Chaos erupts after River Plate relegated |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 21, 2011, a [[2011–12 KNVB Cup#Fourth round|fourth round]] match in the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup]] between [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] at Ajax's home of [[Amsterdam Arena]] was marred by a violent fan incident. In the 36th minute, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran on the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind at AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was [[Misconduct (association football)#Sending-off offences (red card)|sent off]] for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety [[Behind closed doors (football)|behind closed doors]] on January 19, 2012. Ajax was also fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan—who was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban—from entering the pitch, and given a suspended one-match spectator ban (not including the replay). Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had given the fan a 30-year stadium ban and a lifetime ban from the club and its season ticket list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7395584/ajax-az-alkmaar-cup-match-replayed-full |title=Ajax vs. Alkmaar to start from scratch |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=December 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athlete violence ==

===American football===
* In a [[National Football League]] game on November 1, 1970, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] led the [[Oakland Raiders]] 17–14, and a long run for a first-down run by quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet as he lay on the ground, provoking Chiefs’ receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, Taylor and Davidson were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor's unwise retaliation against Davidson's foul play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619085937/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Chiefs–Raiders rivalry]].

* April 2, 2005: [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] teammates [[Lee Bowyer]] and [[Kieron Dyer]] were sent off after fighting one another near the end of the team's 3–0 loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Several Newcastle players and a Villa player separated the two before either was seriously hurt, but Bowyer's shirt was ripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4404473.stm |title=Dyer &amp; Bowyer in amazing punch-up |work=BBC Sport |date=April 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
* In 1994 Swans recruit [[Dermott Brereton]] was suspended for 7 weeks for standing on [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] player [[Rayden Tallis]]' head during a practice match; he was suspended for another 7 matches later in the season for elbowing [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] captain Tony Free and breaking his jaw. When Brereton transferred to Collingwood at the end of 1994 the AFL decided that his 7-week suspension was no longer applicable as it was applied to the club (Sydney) and not to the player (Brereton). [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] forward [[Tony Lockett]] was suspended for 8 matches during the season for elbowing Sydney's Peter Caven and breaking his nose.&lt;ref name="Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996"&gt;Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perhaps the most violent match in AFL history took place on June 5, 2004 Round 11, at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] between Hawthorn and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. The final score was Hawthorn 12.8 (80) to Essendon 24.10 (154). During halftime, Brereton, by now Hawthorn club director, allegedly told Hawks players to draw a "line in the sand" and take a physical stand against the Bombers.&lt;ref name="dermie-ref"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Hinds|title=Heavier blows to come for Hawks, Bombers|date=June 7, 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/06/1086460175315.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, a number of on-field incidents led to several fights around the ground, culminating in a five-minute bench-clearing brawl.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most from a single match in VFL/AFL history. The fracas was described by Tribunal Chairman Brian Collis, QC, as bringing "football into disrepute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawks lose both players and respect|date=June 11, 2004|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/10/1086749836838.html|work=The Age |location=Melbourne|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match would enter AFL lore as the [[Line in the Sand Match]].

[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bench-clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] because of [[Coco Crisp]] getting hit by a pitch by [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].]]
* The first contest in what would become [[Utah–BYU rivalry|one of the most intense rivalries]] in U.S. college sports, an 1895 baseball game between Brigham Young Academy, now [[BYU Cougars|Brigham Young University]], and the [[Utah Utes|University of Utah]], ended in a scoreless tie, immediately followed by a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=1 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This was far from the last violent incident in the baseball version of the Utah–BYU rivalry:
** In one 1966 game, a Utah batter intentionally hit BYU's catcher with his bat.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html?pg=2 |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=2 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In another game in the mid-1980s, a number of BYU players were heckling Utah's pitcher. The pitcher went into his stretch, and then turned and fired a fastball into the BYU dugout, leading to a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
** Yet another game in the same era saw a Utah player get a base hit with two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game. The lead runner could have scored the winning run uncontested—but he instead went out of his way to run over BYU's catcher, who was standing on the first-base side of home plate (the opposite side from a runner heading for home). The runner was called out and ejected, and BYU went on to win in extra innings.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
* On August 12, 1984, a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] turned into what writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo later called "one of the worst [[beanball]] wars of modern times", starting with Braves pitcher [[Pascual Pérez (baseball)|Pascual Pérez]] [[hit by pitch|hitting]] [[Alan Wiggins]] with the game's first pitch, followed by four attempts by Padres pitchers to hit Pérez in retaliation, and ending in Braves reliever [[Donnie Moore]] hitting [[Graig Nettles]]. The chaos led to four bench-clearing incidents, one of which lasted at least 10&amp;nbsp;minutes; ejections of both managers and 12 players and coaches; multiple suspensions of individuals involved in the fracas; and fan involvement (see above).&lt;ref name="Beanball war"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |work=Page 2 |first=Jeff |last=Merron |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===

* In a 1972 [[college basketball]] game, [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State University]] were leading the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]] 50–44 with 36&amp;nbsp;seconds left to play in the game. Ohio State's [[Luke Witte]] was fouled hard going to the basket by Minnesota's Corky Taylor, who punched the dazed Witte in the face and kneed him in the groin. Gopher reserve [[Ron Behagen]] then stomped on Witte's neck and head. Witte was not the only victim of violence, as a larger brawl broke out, with two other Gophers, [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] and future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famer]] [[Dave Winfield]], attacking other Ohio State players. Witte was taken off the court on a stretcher and booed by Minnesota fans. He was the most seriously injured among three Buckeyes players taken to hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.10000takes.com/hall_of_shame/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game on December 9, 1977, [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] was already fighting with [[Kevin Kunnert]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] when [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] of the Rockets came running toward them. Seeing a man in an opponent uniform rushing at him, Washington instinctively turned and punched Tomjanovich in the face, resulting in a near-fatal season-ending injury to Tomjanovich. The NBA suspended Washington for 60 days (26 games) and fined him $10,000.  A civil jury awarded Tomjanovich $3.2 million.  This incident is the subject of the book ''The Punch'' by [[John Feinstein]].
* On November 19, 2004, the infamous [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] took place in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. It ranks among the worst episodes of sports violence in [[Sports in the United States|American sports]] history.
* On August 19, 2010, the final game of the [[Acropolis International Tournament 2010|Acropolis International Tournament]] between [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] and [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]] in Athens ended in a bench-clearing brawl with 2:40 left and Greece leading 74–73. The melee started when Greece's [[Antonis Fotsis]] moved threateningly toward Serbia's [[Miloš Teodosić]] after a hard foul. Teodosic responded by punching Fotsis in the face while [[Nenad Krstić]] also tried to grab the Greek player. Greece's 360&amp;nbsp;lb center [[Sofoklis Schortsanitis]] joined the fight attacking multiple Serbian players and spreading havoc. Krstic punched Schortsanitis several times in his back. When he started pursuing the retreating Krstić, the Serbian player responded by throwing a chair at him. The chair missed Schortsanitis but hit his teammate [[Ioannis Bourousis]] in the head, drawing blood. Players from both teams fought in the tunnel leading from the arena before being separated, and a few fans joined the fight but were quickly taken from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/08/19/friendly-acropolis-tourney-ends-bench-clearing-brawl-forces-abandonment-greece/ |title=Friendly Acropolis tourney ends when bench-clearing brawl forces abandonment of Greece-Serbia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krstić was arrested by Greek police, but was released the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5478923 |title=Police release Nenad Krstic after melee |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] responded by suspending two players from each team for part of the subsequent [[2010 FIBA World Championship|FIBA World Championship]]. For Serbia, Krstić was suspended for the tournament's first three games and Teodosić for two games; Greece's Fotsis and Schortsanitis were also suspended for two games each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=5502854 |title=Coach: Bans 'something unbelievable' |publisher=ESPN |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Later that year, on October 12, an exhibition match between the [[China national basketball team|China]] and [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] national teams in [[Xuchang]] was marred by rough play from both sides before escalating into open exchanges of kicks and punches, followed by a bench-clearing brawl. After the teams were separated, China players attacked the Brazilians as they were heading to the locker room. Brazil refused to return to the court or to play the fourth and final match in their scheduled series. The Chinese national federation issued an official apology to Brazil the following day. This was the latest in a series of incidents involving the China team that had already resulted in tens of thousands of US$ in fines from both FIBA and [[FIBA Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=5680189 |title=China apologizes for brawl with Brazil |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, China head coach [[Bob Donewald, Jr.]] was suspended for China's next three FIBA matches; three China players drew suspensions of one or two games; and the three match officials were suspended from FIBA matches for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/presRele/p/newsid/45415/presReleArti.html |title=PR N° 34 – China sanctioned for mass brawl in Brazil friendly |publisher=FIBA |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 18, 2011, another Chinese team, the [[Bayi Rockets]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]], was involved in a major scuffle with the touring [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University men's team]]. After three quarters of highly physical play from both sides, the game turned ugly with the teams tied at 64 with 9:32 remaining in the final quarter. At that point, both benches emptied and the teams began fighting one another. One Georgetown player had a chair thrown at him by an unidentified individual, with reports differing on whether he was hit. Another Georgetown player who had been struck during the brawl picked up a chair in apparent self-defense. As the brawl progressed, some fans joined in the action, with one wielding a stanchion. Hoyas coach [[John Thompson III]] pulled his team from the court; the team had to dodge water bottles and other objects thrown by fans, and one Georgetown fan was reportedly knocked to the ground by a thrown bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/6873726/georgetown-hoyas-chinese-professional-team-game-ends-brawl |title=Georgetown, Chinese pro team brawl |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN |date=August 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/fight-ends-georgetown-basketball-exhibition-in-china/2011/08/18/gIQAs1zeNJ_story.html |title=Georgetown basketball exhibition in China ends in brawl |first=Gene |last=Wang |work=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 2, 2018, [[Philippines–Australia basketball brawl |a bench-clearing brawl]] broke out between the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] men's national teams during a [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)#Group B|qualifier]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]]. With Australia leading by over 30 points with just over 4:00 left in the third quarter, play was halted for a foul. Australia's [[Daniel Kickert]] then swung his elbow at an [[Roger Pogoy|unsuspecting Philippines player]], immediately leading to both benches clearing and a melee spreading from the bench to one of the baskets. When order was restored and game officials reviewed video of the incident, a total of 13 players were ejected—four from Australia (including Kickert) and nine from the Philippines. This left the hosts with only three players to resume the game; after two of the remaining Philippines players fouled out, leaving that team with only one player, the officials called the game, with Australia winning 89–53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/23974221/milwaukee-bucks-center-thon-maker-brawl-fiba-qualifying-game |title=Bucks center Thon Maker in middle of brawl during FIBA qualifying game |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fight between [[Shawn Thornton]] and [[Wade Brookbank]]. Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition with a long history.]]
Violence has been a part of [[ice hockey]] since at least the early 1900s. According to the book ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.&lt;ref name="PeopleHistory"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history involving many levels of amateur and professional play and including some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, some administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as some players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntyre|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrie Examiner|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[St. Louis Blues]] on September 21, 1969, Bruins defenseman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|title=Legends of Hockey -- NHL Player Search -- Player -- Wayne Maki|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture and brain damage, forcing him to miss the entirety of the [[1969–70 NHL season]], with Maki emerging uninjured. As a result of the fight, Green played for the remaining nine years of his professional career with a pioneering variety of [[hockey helmet]] in both the NHL and WHA.
* April 20, 1984 – A bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoffs matchup between the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]], after many smaller-scale battles had occurred throughout the game. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 10 players were ejected. This game prompted referee [[Bruce Hood (ice hockey)|Bruce Hood]] to retire from the NHL once the playoffs ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lemieux|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly referred to as the ''[[Good Friday Massacre]]''.
* On January 4, 1987, the final game of the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], involving [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] and the Soviet Union, saw intense physical (and often dirty) play by both sides, culminating in [[Punch-up in Piešťany|a bench-clearing brawl]] that lasted over 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Event organizers, in a futile attempt to stop the fighting, turned the arena lights off. Eventually, the game was declared null and void, and both teams were ejected from the competition, costing the Canadians a medal. Virtually all of the players on the Canadian team got suspended for 18 months, while the Soviet Union players were permanently banned from international competition, and the coaching staffs of both teams were fired. The match referee, widely blamed for losing control of the game, never worked another international match.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{Harvnb|CBC|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 9, 2001 – A game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the British [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".  When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-29 |publisher=BBC | date=February 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 2007-12-24 |publisher = CBC | date=February 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1171302.stm |title=League punishes teams over brawl |date=February 15, 2001 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 5, 2004 – A Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90&amp;nbsp;minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maaddi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 9, 2010 – In a [[Kontinental Hockey League]] game between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]], a bench-clearing brawl broke out in the 4th minute of the first period, and a bench- and penalty-box-clearing brawl broke out 39&amp;nbsp;seconds later, forcing officials to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world-record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Lenta.ru | title = Матч КХЛ был сорван массовой дракой хоккеистов | url = http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/01/09/scuffle/ | accessdate = 2010-01-09 | publisher = lenta.ru | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/9/23770.html|title=This is hockey? |publisher=KHL.ru|date=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.&lt;ref name="bothteamslose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/10/23771.html|title=Both teams lose|publisher=KHL.ru|date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willful blindness''' (sometimes called '''ignorance of law''',&lt;ref name=CL /&gt;{{rp|761}} '''willful ignorance''' or '''contrived ignorance''' or '''Nelsonian knowledge''') is a term used in [[law]] to describe a situation in which a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by intentionally keeping himself or herself unaware of facts that would render him or her liable. In ''[[United States v. Jewell]]'', the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of [[knowledge (legal construct)|knowledge]] as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law – Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}}

Although the term was originally—and still is—used in legal contexts, the phrase "willful ignorance" has come to mean any situation in which people intentionally turn their attention away from an ethical problem that is believed to be important by those using the phrase (for instance, because the problem is too disturbing for people to want it dominating their thoughts, or from the knowledge that solving the problem would require extensive effort).

== Precedent in the United States ==
In ''[[United States v. Jewell]]'', the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of [[knowledge]] as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.&lt;ref name="CL" /&gt;{{rp|225}} In a number of cases in the United States of America, persons transporting packages containing illegal [[drug]]s have asserted that they never asked what the contents of the packages were and so lacked the requisite intent to break the law. Such defenses have not succeeded, as [[court]]s have been quick to determine that the [[defendant]] ''should'' have known what was in the package and exercised [[recklessness (law)|criminal recklessness]] by failing to find out the package's contents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Notably, this rule has only ever been applied to independent couriers, and has never been used to hold larger services that qualify as [[common carriers]] (e.g., [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], or the [[U.S. Postal Service]]) liable for the contents of packages they deliver.

A famous example of such a defense being denied occurred in ''[[In re Aimster Copyright Litigation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Case citation|334 F.3d 643]] ([[7th Cir.]] 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[defendant]]s argued that the [[file-swapping]] technology was designed in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. They suggested that their inability to monitor the activities of users meant that they could not be contributing to [[copyright infringement]] by the users. The court held that this was willful blindness on the defendant’s part and would not constitute a defense to a claim of contributory infringement.
