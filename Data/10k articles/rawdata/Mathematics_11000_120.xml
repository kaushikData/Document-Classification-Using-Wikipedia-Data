(1993) ''Substantiv-Derivation in Den Schriften Albrecht Dürers'', Walter de Gruyter. {{ISBN|3-11-012815-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[German art|painter]], [[Old master prints|printmaker]], and [[history of geometry#Renaissance|theorist]] of the [[German Renaissance]]. Born in [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]], Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality [[List of woodcuts by Dürer|woodcut prints]].
He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and from 1512 he was patronized by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. Dürer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches.

[[File:'The Expulsion From Paradise'.jpg|thumb|''The Expulsion From Paradise'']]

Dürer's vast body of work includes [[List of engravings by Dürer|engraving]]s, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, [[watercolour]]s and books. The woodcuts, such as the ''[[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse]]'' series (1498), are more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] than the rest of his work. 
His well-known engravings include the ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European [[landscape art]]ists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.

Dürer's introduction of [[Roman mythology|classical motifs]] into Northern art, through his knowledge of [[Italian Renaissance|Italian artists]] and [[Humanism in Germany|German humanists]], has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the [[Northern Renaissance]]. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, [[linear perspective|perspective]], and [[body proportions|ideal proportions]].

==Early life (1471–1490)==
[[File:Self-portrait at 13 by Albrecht Dürer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Self-portrait]] [[silverpoint]] drawing by the thirteen-year-old Dürer, 1484]]

Dürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children.  His father, [[Albrecht Dürer the Elder]] (originally Albrecht Ajtósi), was a successful [[goldsmith]] who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from {{ill|Ajtós|hu|Ajtós|fr|Ajtós}}, near [[Gyula (town)|Gyula]] in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="heaton"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Life of Albrecht Dürer of Nürnberg: With a Translation of His Letters and Journal and an Account of His Works|first=Mrs. Charles|last=Heaton|authorlink=Mary Margaret Heaton|publisher=Seeley, Jackson and Halliday|year=1881|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=netZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Albrecht's brothers, [[Hans Dürer]], was also a painter and trained under him. Another of Albrecht's brothers, Endres Dürer, took over their father's business and was a master goldsmith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Dürer – oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095736400?rskey=Y8iIbB&amp;result=0&amp;q=durer|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".&lt;ref name="heaton"/&gt; Initially, it was "Türer", meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door). A door is featured in the [[coat-of-arms]] the family acquired. Albrecht Dürer the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. Dürer the Elder married Barbara Holper, daughter of his master when he himself qualified as a master in 1467.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 93, note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Coat of Arms of the House of Dürer - WGA07258.jpg|thumb|upright|Woodcut by Dürer of his [[coat of arms]], which featured a door as a pun on his name, as well as the winged bust of a [[Moors|Moor]]]]

Dürer's godfather was [[Anton Koberger]], who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of Dürer's birth, and became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four [[printing-press]]es and built a number of offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the [[Wolgemut]] workshop. Dürer may have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"&gt;Giulia Bartrum, "Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy", British Museum Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Dürer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, Dürer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to [[Michael Wolgemut]] at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in [[silverpoint]], is dated 1484 ([[Albertina, Vienna]]) "when I was a child", as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially [[Venice]], a relatively short distance across the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

==''Wanderjahre'' and marriage (1490–1494)==
[[File:Albrecht-self.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest painted ''[[Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle (Albrecht Dürer)|Self-Portrait]]'' (1493) by Albrecht Dürer, oil, originally on [[vellum]] ([[Louvre]], [[Paris]])]]

After completing his apprenticeship, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking ''[[Wanderjahre]]''—in effect [[gap year]]s—in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.  He left in 1490, possibly to work under [[Martin Schongauer]], the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at [[Colmar]] in 1492. It is unclear where Dürer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In Colmar, Dürer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Dürer went to [[Strasbourg]], where he would have experienced the sculpture of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert]]. Dürer's first painted self-portrait (now in the [[Louvre]]) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

In early 1492 Dürer travelled to [[Basel]] to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.&lt;ref&gt;Here he produced a woodcut of [[St Jerome]] as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'. [[Erwin Panofsky]] argues that this print combined the '[[Ulm]]ian style' of Koberger's 'Lives of the Saints' (1488) and that of Wolgemut's workshop. Panofsky, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Dürer was married to [[Agnes Frey]] following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage, and with Albrecht the Dürer name died out. The marriage between Agnes and Albrecht was not a generally happy one, as indicated by the letters of Dürer in which he quipped to [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] in an extremely rough tone about his wife. He called her an "old crow" and made other vulgar remarks. Pirckheimer also made no secret of his antipathy towards Agnes, describing her as a miserly shrew with a bitter tongue, who helped cause Dürer's death at a young age.&lt;ref name="Wilmot-BuxtonPoynter1881"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harry John Wilmot-Buxton|author2=Edward John Poynter|title=German, Flemish and Dutch Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgnAAAAYAAJ|year=1881|publisher=Scribner and Welford|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated by many scholars Albrecht was bisexual, if not homosexual, due to several of his works containing themes of homosexual desire, as well as the intimate nature of his correspondence with certain very close male friends.&lt;ref name="Haggerty2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Haggerty|title=Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pez9AQAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-58513-6|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First journey to Italy (1494–1495)==
[[File:Agnes Duerer 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|Dürer's sketch of his wife Agnes Frey 1494]]

Within three months of his marriage, Dürer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving ''Nemesis''.

In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Raymond L. &amp; Alistair B. Fraser. (2001) ''The Rainbow Bridge'', Penn State Press. {{ISBN|0-271-01977-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Wolgemut's tutelage, Dürer had learned how to make prints in [[drypoint]] and design [[woodcut]]s in the German style, based on the works of [[Martin Schongauer]] and the [[Housebook Master]].&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that [[Giovanni Bellini]] was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], with his interest in the proportions of the body; [[Lorenzo di Credi]]; and [[Andrea Mantegna]], whose work he produced copies of while training.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Angela and Raftery, Andrew. "Remaking Dürer: Investigating the Master Engravings by Masterful Engraving," [http://artinprint.org/article/remaking-durer-investigating-the-master-engravings/ ''Art in Print'' Vol. 2 No. 4] (November–December 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer probably also visited [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] and [[Mantua]] on this trip.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for this trip is not conclusive; the suggestion it happened is supported by Panofsky (in his Albrecht Dürer, 1943) and others, but it has been disputed by other scholars, including Katherine Crawford Luber (in her Albrecht Dürer and the Venetian Renaissance, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Melencolia I - Google Art Project (427760).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), engraving]]

On his return to [[Nuremberg]] in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Dürer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1514. Arguably his best works in the first years of the workshop were his [[woodcut]] prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as ''The Men's Bath House'' (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

It is now thought unlikely that Dürer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Portrait of Oswolt Krel - WGA6934.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Oswolt Krel'', a merchant from [[Lindau]] ([[Lake Constance]]), participating in the South German medieval trade corporation Große [[Ravensburg]]er Handelsgesellschaft, 1499.]]

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;'' is dated 1498, as is his engraving of'' [[St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer|St. Michael Fighting the Dragon]]''. He made the first seven scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the [[Holy Family]] and saints. The ''[[Polyptych of the Seven Sorrows|Seven Sorrows Polyptych]]'', commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III of Saxony]] in 1496, was executed by Dürer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the ''Great Passion,'' were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

During the same period Dürer trained himself in the difficult art of using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the ''Prodigal Son'', which the Italian Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably ''Nemesis'' (1502), ''The Sea Monster'' (1498), and ''Saint Eustace'' (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as ''Pond in the Woods'' and ''Willow Mill'', are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer Betende Hände.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Praying Hands (Dürer)|Praying Hands]]'', pen-and-ink drawing (c. 1508)]]

The Venetian artist [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]], and [[Body proportions|proportion]] from him.  De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.

Dürer created large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the ''[[Betende Hände]]'' (''Praying Hands'') from circa 1508, a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He continued to make images in watercolour and [[bodycolour]] (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his ''[[Young Hare]]'' (1502) and the ''[[Great Piece of Turf]]'' (1503).

==Second journey to Italy (1505–1507)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Jesus among the Doctors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ among the Doctors (Dürer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (1506), [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]]]

In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in [[tempera]] on [[linen]]. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the [[Paumgartner altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Dürer)|Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt; By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]]. This was the altar-piece known as the ''[[Feast of the Rosary|Adoration of the Virgin]]'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to Prague. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', ''[[Christ among the Doctors (Dürer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.

==Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer, Adam and Eve, 1504, Engraving.jpg|thumb|''Adam and Eve'', 1504]]
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adam and Eve (Prado) 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'', 1507, [[Museo del Prado]]]]

Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and—mainly through [[Lorenzo di Credi]]—[[Leonardo da Vinci]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1507), ''[[The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (Dürer)|The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling effects,&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 135&lt;/ref&gt; creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.

Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous [[engraving]]s: ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513, probably based on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s treatise ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]''), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'', and the much-debated ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of Dürer´s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers [[lusterweibchen]].

In 1515, he created his ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|woodcut of a Rhinoceros]]'' which had arrived in [[Lisbon]] from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the [[Indian rhinoceros]], the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/durer.htm Dürer's hemispheres of 1515—the first European printed star charts]&lt;/ref&gt; and portraits in [[tempera]] on [[linen]] in 1516. His only experiments with [[etching]] came in this period, producing five 1515–1516 and a sixth 1518; a technique he may have abandoned as unsuited to his aesthetic of methodical, classical form.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D.

===Patronage of Maximilian I===
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Maximilian I'']]

From 1512, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'', a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of [[Horapollo]]'s ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by [[Johannes Stabius]], the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Dürer as designer-in-chief. ''The Arch'' was followed by ''[[The Triumphal Procession]]'', the program of which was worked out in 1512 by [[:de:Marx Treitzsaurwein|Marx Treitz-Saurwein]] and includes woodcuts by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and [[Hans Springinklee]], as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in [[lithography]]. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Baldung]]. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

==Journey to the Netherlands (1520–1521)==
[[File:Bezoek van Albrecht Dürer in Antwerpen in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen, 2198.jpg|thumb|400px|Visit of Albrecht Dürer in Antwerp in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]], 2198]]
Maximilian's death came at a time when Dürer was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by [[arthritis]]) and increasingly affected by the writings of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 204. Quotation from a letter to the secretary of the Elector of Saxony&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was to be crowned at [[Aachen]]. Dürer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]] and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of [[Stefan Lochner]]), [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Bruges]] (where he saw [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Madonna of Bruges]]), [[Ghent]] (where he admired [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]'s altarpiece), and [[Zeeland]].

Dürer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall:350-54 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Dürer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480–1530)|Margaret of Austria]], but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met [[Bernard van Orley]], [[Jan Provoost]], [[Gerard Horenbout]], [[Jean Mone]], [[Joachim Patinir]] and [[Tommaso Vincidor]], though he did not, it seems, meet [[Quentin Matsys]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of [[Christian II of Denmark]], Dürer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the [[Aztec]] treasure that [[Hernán Cortés]] had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Dürer wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s".&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; Dürer also appears to have been collecting for his own [[cabinet of curiosities]], and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].

Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky&lt;/ref&gt;—which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

Albrecht Dürer besides his enormous contribution to painting and science, had also contributed to the development of the German school of fencing. In 1512 he authored “the Book of Fencing”, and being a great painter himself, he expressed himself not in a textual form, but in drawings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Final years in Nuremberg (1521–1528)==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer 100.jpg|thumb|''Salvator Mundi'', an unfinished oil painting on wood, full painting]]

On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a [[Sacra conversazione]], though neither was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 223&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the [[body proportions|proportions]] of men and horses, and [[fortification]].

However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, Dürer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 078.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]], [[commons:File:Albrecht dürer salvator mundi.JPG|''Salvator Mundi '' (1526)]], and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 026.jpg|background]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] in the [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 027.jpg|background]]. This last great work, [[the Four Apostles]], was given by Dürer to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt;

[[File:Dürer Salvator Mundi detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A close up reveals Dürer's highly detailed preparatory drawing]]

As for engravings, Dürer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector [[Albert of Mainz]]; [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony; the [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]; [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. For those of [[Albert of Mainz|the Cardinal]], Melanchthon, and Dürer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Dürer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Dürer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corine Schleif]] (2010), "Albrecht Dürer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer", ''The Essential Dürer'', ed. Larry Silver and [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], Philadelphia, 85–205&lt;/ref&gt; He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Dürer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. "The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on [[mathematics]] in German,&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; as well as being cited later by [[Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. "The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt;

Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins – a considerable sum.  He is buried in the ''Johannisfriedhof'' cemetery.  [[Albrecht Dürer's House|His large house]] (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer [[Bernhard Walther]]), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt; It is now a museum.

===Dürer and the Reformation===
[[File:Durerhaus-nbg.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer's House]] in [[Nuremberg]]]]

Dürer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to [[Martin Luther]]'s ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. Dürer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;Price (2003), 225&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Nicholas Kratzer]] in 1524, Dürer wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics". Most tellingly, [[Willibald Pirckheimer|Pirckheimer]] wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory ... but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse." Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, Dürer had contacts with various reformers, such as [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and Cornelius Grapheus from whom Dürer received Luther's ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church|Babylonian Captivity]]'' in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Price:225–248&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nürnberger Feldschlange.JPG|thumb|right|''The Cannon'', Dürer's largest etching, 1518]]

Dürer's later works have also been claimed to show [[Protestant]] sympathies. For example, his woodcut of ''[[The Last Supper]]'' of 1523 has often been understood to have an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the [[Gospel]], as well the inclusion of the [[Eucharist]]ic cup, an expression of Protestant [[Utraquist|utraquism]],&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; although this interpretation has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Price:254&lt;/ref&gt; The delaying of the engraving of [[Philip the Apostle|St Philip]], completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to Dürer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if Dürer was not an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]], in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adoration of the Trinity (Landauer Altar) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Trinity'' (Landauer Altar)]]
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Feast of Rose Garlands - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Feast of the Rosary]]'' (1506)]]
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adorazione dei Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Magi'' (1504), oil on wood [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]

Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], and [[Parmigianino]], all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.

His work in [[engraving]] seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "[[Little Masters]]" who attempted few large engravings but continued Dürer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. [[Lucas van Leyden]] was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ([[Giulio Campagnola]], [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], [[Benedetto Montagna]] and [[Cristofano Robetta]]), or whole prints ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]]). However, Dürer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.

In painting, Dürer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Dürer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the ''Dürer Renaissance'' of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German [[nationalism]] from 1870 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Bartrum"/&gt;

Dürer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in his book ''On Growth and Form''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, D'Arcy|year=1917|title=On Growth and Form|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church]] remembers Dürer as a great Christian annually on 6 April,&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheranism 101'' edited by Scot A. Kinnaman, CPH, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Burgkmair]]. The [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States)]] remembers him, Cranach and [[Matthias Grünewald]] on 5 August.

==Theoretical works==

In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the [[German language]] rather than in [[Latin]], Dürer used graphic expressions based on a [[vernacular]], craftsmen's language. For example, "Schneckenlinie" ("snail-line") was his term for a spiral form. Thus, Dürer contributed to the expansion in German prose which [[Martin Luther]] had begun with his translation of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]].&lt;ref name="Panofsky"&gt;Erwin Panofsky, ''The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer'', Princeton, 1945, {{ISBN|0-691-00303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Four Books on Measurement''===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
Dürer's work on [[geometry]] is called the ''Four Books on Measurement'' (''Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt'' or ''Instructions for Measuring with [[Compass (drawing tool)|Compass]] and Ruler'').&lt;ref&gt;A. Koyre, "The Exact Sciences", in ''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, translated by A. J. Pomerans&lt;/ref&gt; The first book focuses on linear geometry. Dürer's geometric constructions include [[helices]], [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoids]] and [[epicycloid]]s. He also draws on [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], and [[Johannes Werner]]'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.

The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular [[polygon]]s. Here Dürer favours the methods of [[Ptolemy]] over [[Euclid]]. The third book applies these principles of geometry to [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[typography]].

In architecture Dürer cites [[Vitruvius]] but elaborates his own classical designs and [[classical orders|columns]]. In [[typography]], Dürer depicts the geometric construction of the [[Latin alphabet]], relying on [[History of western typography#Classical revival|Italian precedent]]. However, his construction of the [[Gothic alphabet]] is based upon an entirely different [[modular]] system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]]. Here Dürer discusses the five [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as seven [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.

In all these, Dürer shows the objects as [[Net (polyhedron)|nets]]. Finally, Dürer discusses the [[Doubling the cube|Delian Problem]] and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through [[linear perspective]]. It was in [[Bologna]] that Dürer was taught (possibly by [[Luca Pacioli]] or [[Bramante]]) the principles of [[linear perspective]], and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Although Dürer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Dürer discusses in this last book of ''Underweysung der Messung'' an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

===''Four Books on Human Proportion''===
[[File:Dürer - Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion ita., 1594 - 168613 Illustrazione 3v.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'']]

Dürer's work on [[body proportions|human proportions]] is called the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'' (''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion'') of 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|date=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Dürer based these constructions on both [[Vitruvius]] and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons",&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt; in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an [[Leone Battista Alberti|Albertian]] system, which Dürer probably learned from [[Francesco di Giorgio]]'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of [[convex mirror|convex]] and [[concave mirror]]s; here Dürer also deals with human [[physiognomy]]. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Dürer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Dürer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Dürer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or [[artistic inspiration|inspired]] to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.&lt;ref name="Panofsky"/&gt; In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Dürer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges''' ('''AMATYC''') is an organization dedicated to the improvement of education in the first two years of college [[mathematics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. AMATYC hosts an annual conference, summer institutes, workshops and mentoring for teachers in and outside math, and a semiannual [[math competition]]. AMATYC publishes one refereed journal, ''MathAMATYC Educator,'' and issues position statements on matters of mathematics education.

The math competition is held in spring and fall [[semester]] each year and is limited to problems in [[precalculus]]. Only students enrolled in [[community college|two-year colleges]] are eligible to participate. Only students who haven't received any degree/diploma, including within or outside of the U.S, can enter the competition.

AMATYC was founded in 1974. Its office is at [[Southwest Tennessee Community College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

AMATYC is divided into eight regions: Central, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, and West. A vice president is assigned to each region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1054">In the mathematical field of [[category theory]], an '''amnestic functor''' ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' is a [[functor]] for which an  ''A''-[[isomorphism]] ''&amp;fnof;'' is an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] whenever ''F&amp;fnof;'' is an identity.

An example of a functor which is ''not'' amnestic is the forgetful functor '''Met'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;→'''Top''' from the category of [[metric space]]s with [[continuous function]]s for morphisms to the [[category of topological spaces]]. If &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalent metrics]] on a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}\colon(X, d_1)\to(X, d_2)&lt;/math&gt; is a isomorphism that covers the identity, but is not an identity morphism (its domain and codomain are not equal).

A [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is in class Baire* one, written &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbf{B}^{*}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, and is called a Baire one star function, if for each [[perfect set]] &lt;math&gt;P \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, there is an [[open interval]] &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;P \cap I&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty, and the restriction &lt;math&gt;f |_{P \cap I}&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]]. The notion seems to have originated with B. Kerchheim in an article titled 'Baire one star functions' (Real Anal. Exch. 18 (1992/93), 385-399).
The terminology is actually due to Richard O'Malley,  'Baire* 1, Darboux functions' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 60 (1976) 187-192.  The concept itself (under a different name) goes back at least to 1951. See H. W. Ellis, 'Darboux properties and applications to nonabsolutely convergent integrals' Canad. Math. J., 3 (1951), 471-484, where the same concept is labelled as [CG] (for generalized continuity).

In [[physics]], the '''Bekenstein bound''' is an upper limit on the [[entropy]] ''S'', or [[information]] ''I'', that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy—or conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level.&lt;ref name="Bekenstein1981-1"&gt;Jacob D. Bekenstein, [http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/~bekenste/PRD23-287-1981.pdf "Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems"], ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review D]]'', Vol. 23, No. 2, (January 15, 1981), pp. 287-298, {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.23.287}}, {{bibcode|1981PhRvD..23..287B}}. [https://www.webcitation.org/5pvt5c96N?url=http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/%7Ebekenste/PRD23-287-1981.pdf Mirror link].&lt;/ref&gt; It implies that the information of a physical system, or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system, must be finite if the region of space and the energy is finite. In [[computer science]], this implies that there is a maximum information-processing rate ([[Bremermann's limit]]) for a physical system that has a finite size and energy, and that a [[Turing machine]] with finite physical dimensions and unbounded memory is not physically possible.

Upon exceeding the Bekenstein bound a storage medium would collapse into a [[black hole]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/04/is-information-fundamental/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations==
The universal form of the bound was originally found by [[Jacob Bekenstein]] as the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]&lt;ref name="Bekenstein1981-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bekenstein2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bekenstein2008"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S \leq \frac{2 \pi k R E}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' is the [[entropy]], ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''R'' is the [[radius]] of a [[sphere]] that can enclose the given system, ''E'' is the total [[mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] including any [[invariant mass|rest masses]], ''ħ'' is the [[Planck constant#Reduced Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]], and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. Note that while gravity plays a significant role in its enforcement, the expression for the bound does not contain the [[gravitational constant]]&amp;nbsp;''G''.

In informational terms, the bound is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I \leq \frac{2 \pi R E}{\hbar c \ln 2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the [[information]] expressed in number of [[bit]]s contained in the quantum states in the sphere. The [[Natural logarithm|ln]] 2 factor comes from defining the information as the [[logarithm]] to the [[radix|base]] [[Binary numeral system|2]] of the number of quantum states.&lt;ref name="Tipler2005b"&gt;[[Frank J. Tipler]], [http://math.tulane.edu/~tipler/theoryofeverything.pdf "The structure of the world from pure numbers"], ''[[Reports on Progress in Physics]]'', Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964, {{doi|10.1088/0034-4885/68/4/R04}}, {{bibcode|2005RPPh...68..897T}}, p. 902. [https://www.webcitation.org/5nx3CxKm0?url=http://math.tulane.edu/%7Etipler/theoryofeverything.pdf Mirror link]. Also released as [https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3276 "Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything"], {{arxiv|0704.3276}}, April 24, 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[mass energy equivalence]], the informational limit may be reformulated as

:&lt;math&gt;I \leq \frac{2 \pi c R m}{\hbar \ln 2} \approx 2.5769082\times 10^{43} m R&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the system in kilograms, and the radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is expressed in meters.

==Origins==
Bekenstein derived the bound from heuristic arguments involving [[black hole]]s. If a system exists that violates the bound, i.e., by having too much entropy, Bekenstein argued that it would be possible to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by lowering it into a black hole. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Ted Jacobson]] demonstrated that the [[Einstein field equations]] (i.e., [[general relativity]]) can be derived by assuming that the Bekenstein bound and the [[laws of thermodynamics]] are true.&lt;ref name="Jacobson1995"&gt;[[Theodore Jacobson|Ted Jacobson]], "Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State", ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', Vol. 75, Issue 7 (August 14, 1995), pp. 1260-1263, {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260}}, {{bibcode|1995PhRvL..75.1260J}}.

==Examples==
===Black holes===
It happens that the [[Black_hole_thermodynamics#Black_hole_entropy|Bekenstein-Hawking Boundary Entropy]] of three-dimensional [[black hole]]s exactly saturates the bound

:&lt;math&gt;r_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4 \pi r_s^2 = \frac{16 \pi G^2 M^2}{c^4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;l_P^2 = \hbar G/c^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S =\frac{kA}{4 l_P^2} = \frac{4 \pi k G M^2}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''A'' is the two-dimensional area of the black hole's event horizon in units of the [[Planck area]], &lt;math&gt;l_P^2 = \hbar G/c^3&lt;/math&gt;.

The bound is closely associated with [[black hole thermodynamics]], the [[holographic principle]] and the [[covariant entropy bound]] of quantum gravity, and can be derived from a conjectured strong form of the latter.

===Human brain===
An average [[human brain]] has a mass of 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg and a volume of 1260&amp;nbsp;cm{{sup|3}}. If the brain is approximated by a sphere, then [[Sphere#Volume_of_a_sphere|the radius will be]] 6.7 cm.

The informational Bekenstein bound will be &lt;math&gt;\approx 2.6 \times 10^{42}&lt;/math&gt; bits and represents the maximum information needed to perfectly recreate an average human brain down to the quantum level. This means that the number &lt;math&gt;O=2^I&lt;/math&gt; of [[quantum state|states]] of the human brain must be less than &lt;math&gt;\approx 10^{7.8 \times 10^{41}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[credibility theory]], a branch of study in [[actuarial science]], the '''Bühlmann model''' is a [[random effects model]] (or "variance components model" or [[hierarchical linear model]]) used in to determine the appropriate [[Insurance premium|premium]] for a group of insurance contracts. The model is named after Hans Bühlmann who first published a description in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bühlmann | first = Hans | year = 1967 | title = Experience rating and credibility | url = http://www.casact.org/library/astin/vol4no3/199.pdf | publisher = ASTIN Bulletin | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 99&amp;ndash;207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model description==

Consider ''i'' risks which generate random losses for which historical data of ''m'' recent claims are available (indexed by ''j''). A premium for the ''i''th risk is to be determined based on the expected value of claims. A linear estimator which minimizes the mean square error is sought. Write

* ''X''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; for the ''j''-th claim on the ''i''-th risk (we assume that all claims for ''i''-th risk are [[independent and identically distributed]])
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bar{X}_i=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for the average value.
* &lt;math&gt;\Theta_i&lt;/math&gt; - the parameter for the distribution of the i-th risk
* &lt;math&gt;m(\vartheta)= \operatorname E\left [ X_{ij} |\Theta_i = \vartheta\right ]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Pi=\operatorname E(m(\vartheta)|X_{i1},X_{i2},...X_{im})&lt;/math&gt; - premium for the i-th risk
* &lt;math&gt;\mu = \operatorname (m(\vartheta))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;s^2(\vartheta)=\operatorname{Var}\left [ X_{ij} |\Theta_i = \vartheta\right ]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2=\operatorname E\left [ s^2(\vartheta) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v^2=\operatorname{Var}\left [ m(\vartheta) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Note: &lt;math&gt;m(\vartheta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s^2(\vartheta)&lt;/math&gt; are functions of random parameter &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; 

The Bühlmann model is the solution for the problem: 
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{a_{i0},a_{i1},...,a_{im}}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \operatorname E\left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi \right)^2\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the estimator of premium &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; and [[arg min]] represents the parameter values which minimize the expression.

==Model solution==

The solution for the problem is: 

:&lt;math&gt;Z\bar{X}_i+(1-Z)\mu&lt;/math&gt; 

where: 
 
:&lt;math&gt;Z=\frac{1}{1+\frac{\sigma^2}{v^2m}}&lt;/math&gt; 

We can give this result the interpretation, that Z part of the premium is based on the information that we have about the specific risk, and (1-Z) part is based on the information that we have about the whole population.

===Proof===
The following proof is slightly different from the one in the original paper. It is also more general, because it considers all linear estimators, while original proof considers only estimators based on average claim.&lt;ref&gt;Proof can be found on this site: {{cite web |first=Hanspeter |last=Schmidli |title=Lecture notes on Risk Theory |publisher=Institute of Mathematics, University of Cologne |url=http://www.math.ku.dk/~schmidli/rt.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811041617/http://www.math.ku.dk/~schmidli/rt.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Lemma.''' The problem can be stated alternatively as:
::&lt;math&gt;f=\mathbb E\left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-m(\vartheta)\right )^2\right ]\to \min&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbb E\left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-m(\vartheta)\right )^2\right ] &amp;=\mathbb E\left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right )^2\right ]+\mathbb E\left [  \left ( m(\vartheta)-\Pi\right )^2\right ]+2\mathbb{E} \left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right ) \left ( m(\vartheta)-\Pi\right )\right ] \\
&amp;=\mathbb E\left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right )^2\right ]+\mathbb E\left [  \left ( m(\vartheta)-\Pi\right )^2\right ]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation follows from the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbb E\left [\left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right ) \left ( m(\vartheta)-\Pi\right )\right ] &amp;= \mathbb E_{\Theta}\left[\mathbb{E}_X\left. \left [  \left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right ) ( m(\vartheta)-\Pi) \right |  X_{i1},\ldots ,X_{im}\right ]\right ] \\
&amp;=\mathbb E_{\Theta}\left[\left ( a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-\Pi\right )\left [  \mathbb E_X\left [( m(\vartheta)-\Pi) |  X_{i1},\ldots ,X_{im}\right ]\right ] \right]\\
&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We are using here the law of total expectation and the fact, that &lt;math&gt;\Pi=\mathbb E [m(\vartheta)|X_{i1},\ldots, X_{im}].&lt;/math&gt;

In our previous equation, we decompose minimized function in the sum of two expressions. The second expression does not depend on parameters used in minimization. Therefore, minimizing the function is the same as minimizing the first part of the sum.

Let us find critical points of the function

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial a_{01}}=\mathbb E\left [a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-m(\vartheta)\right ]=a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}\mathbb E(X_{ij})-\mathbb E(m(\vartheta))=a_{i0}-\left (\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}-1  \right )\mu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a_{i0}=\left (\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}-1  \right )\mu&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;k\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial a_{ik}}=\mathbb E\left [ X_{ik}\left ( a_{i0} +\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}-m(\vartheta)\right ) \right ]=\mathbb E\left [ X_{ik} \right ]a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1, j\neq k}^{m}a_{ij}\mathbb E[X_{ik}X_{ij}]+a_{ik}\mathbb E[X^2_{ik}]-\mathbb E[X_{ik}m(\vartheta)]=0&lt;/math&gt;

We can simplify  derivative, noting that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbb E[X_{ij}X_{ik}] &amp; =\mathbb E \left [\mathbb E [X_{ij}X_{ik}|\vartheta] \right ]=\mathbb E[\text{cov}(X_{ij}X_{ik}|\vartheta)+\mathbb E(X_{ij}|\vartheta)\mathbb E(X_{ik}|\vartheta)]=\mathbb E[(m(\vartheta))^2]=v^2+\mu^2 \\
\mathbb E[X^2_{ik}] &amp;= \mathbb E \left [\mathbb E[X^2_{ik}|\vartheta] \right ]=\mathbb E[s^2(\vartheta)+(m(\vartheta))^2]=\sigma^2+v^2+\mu^2 \\
\mathbb E[X_{ik}m(\vartheta)] &amp; =\mathbb E[\mathbb E[X_{ik}m(\vartheta)|\Theta_i]=\mathbb E[(m(\vartheta))^2]=v^2+\mu^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking above equations and inserting into derivative, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial a_{ik}}=\left ( 1-\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij} \right )\mu^2+\sum_{j=1,j\neq k}^{m}a_{ij}(v^2+\mu^2)+a_{ik}(\sigma^2+v^2+\mu^2)-(v^2+\mu^2)=a_{ik}\sigma^2-\left ( 1-\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij} \right )v^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2a_{ik}=v^2\left (1-\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{ij}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Right side doesn't depend on ''k''. Therefore all &lt;math&gt;a_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; are constant

:&lt;math&gt;a_{i1}= \cdots =a_{im}=\frac{v^2}{\sigma^2+mv^2}&lt;/math&gt;

From the solution for &lt;math&gt;a_{i0}&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;a_{i0}=(1-ma_{ik})\mu=\left ( 1-\frac{mv^2}{\sigma^2+mv^2} \right )\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the best estimator is

:&lt;math&gt;a_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}X_{ij}=\frac{mv^2}{\sigma^2+mv^2}\bar{X_i}+\left ( 1-\frac{mv^2}{\sigma^2+mv^2} \right )\mu=Z\bar{X_i}+(1-Z)\mu&lt;/math&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''CAST-256''' (or '''CAST6''') is a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key]] [[block cipher]] published in June 1998. It was submitted as a candidate for the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES); however, it was not among the five [[AES finalists]]. It is an extension of an earlier cipher, [[CAST-128]]; both were designed according to the "CAST" design methodology invented by [[Carlisle Adams]] and [[Stafford Tavares]]. [[Howard Heys]] and [[Michael Wiener]] also contributed to the design. 

CAST-256 uses the same elements as CAST-128, including [[S-box]]es, but is adapted for a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 bits &amp;ndash; twice the size of its 64-bit predecessor. (A similar construction occurred in the evolution of [[RC5]] into [[RC6]]). Acceptable [[key size]]s are 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. CAST-256 is composed of 48 rounds, sometimes described as 12 "quad-rounds", arranged in a generalized [[Feistel network]].

In [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2612, the authors state that, "The CAST-256 cipher described in this document is available worldwide on a royalty-free and licence-free basis for commercial and non-commercial uses."

Currently, the best public cryptanalysis of CAST-256 in the standard single secret key setting that works for all keys is the zero-correlation cryptanalysis breaking 28 rounds with 2&lt;sup&gt;246.9&lt;/sup&gt; time and 2&lt;sup&gt;98.8&lt;/sup&gt; data.&lt;ref name="blnw12"&gt; {{cite journal | first = Andrey | last = Bogdanov |author2=Leander, Gregor |author3=Nyberg, Kaisa |author4=Wang, Meiqin | title = Integral and multidimensional linear distinguishers with correlation zero | publisher = Asiacrypt 2012 | journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science  | volume = 7658 | pages =244–261 | year = 2012 | url = http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~anbog/ac12-zerocorrelation.pdf | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-34961-4}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. '''Charles Edward Eppes''', [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], is a [[fictional character]] and one of the [[protagonist]]s of the [[CBS]] [[crime drama]] ''[[Numb3rs]]''. He is portrayed by [[David Krumholtz]].

Dr. Charles Eppes is portrayed as a young [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[genius]]  and [[professor]] of [[applied mathematics]] at the fictional ''California Institute of Science'', ''CalSci'' (primarily based on [[Caltech]], where some filming and mathematics consulting is done). As a world-class [[mathematician]], Charlie helps his brother [[Don Eppes]] solve many of his perplexing FBI cases, sometimes with the help of his best friend, mentor and colleague [[Larry Fleinhardt]] and his on-again off-again girlfriend, former student and now wife, [[Amita Ramanujan]], who further refines Charlie's approach and helps him stay focused. Charlie has consulted for the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), in part as a [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], for nearly five years, having attained TS/SCI security clearance. It was revoked at the end of season four after he transmitted information to Pakistan, but has recently been re-instated.

==Backstory==
According to Eppes' [[Alan Eppes|father]], he could multiply four-digit numbers mentally at age three and at the age of four required special teachers. In the second grade, he attempted to find a 70-digit [[narcissistic number]] in [[Duodecimal|base 12]]&amp;mdash;Eppes has described himself as "[[Quixotism|quixotic]]" in elementary school. A [[child prodigy|prodigy]], he attended [[Princeton University]] at the age of 13 after graduating from high school at the same time as his brother who is five years his senior ("Soft Target"), and took Professor Lawrence Fleinhardt's [[quantum physics]] course in his first year. They became fast friends, with Fleinhardt establishing his academic connections. Eppes published his first mathematical [[treatise]] at the age of 14 (in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'') and graduated at the age of 16. In fact, he was the youngest person to ever write a paper of importance.

It was his paper on the Eppes [[limit of a function|Convergence]], which concerned [[asymptote|asymptotics]] of [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] [[Random matrix|random matrices]], that made him a star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the FBI has prevented him from doing [[research]] significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on [[cognition|cognitive]] [[emergence|emergence theory]] ("the mathematics of the brain") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although he was a child prodigy, Charlie now laments the fact that his best years in his research will never come ahead of schedule again.

Eppes is a multiple [[Ph.D.]] ("Decoy Effect"), a recipient of the Milton Prize and a nominee for the [[Fields Medal]]. Following his five-year research on [[random matrix|random matrices]], Charlie worked on [[sequence]]s with [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Symmetry#In mathematics|symmetry]]. He has also provided insights for possibly solving the [[P versus NP problem|P vs. NP problem]] and published works on [[H∞|H-infinity]] [[Nonlinear control|control of nonlinear systems]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]], while his current research is in [[cognition|cognitive]] [[emergence|emergence theory]]. He has presented seminars on [[harmonic analysis]] and the [[Root of a function|zeros]] of [[Randomness#In mathematics|random]] [[orthogonal polynomials]] and given lectures on [[group theory]] and [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s. Eppes has taught courses on [[calculus]], [[chaos theory]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[game theory]] and [[probability]] at CalSci in addition to giving guest [[lecture]]s on [[probability theory|applied probability]]. The lecture in which he converted the classroom into a miniature [[casino]] for analyzing probabilities is considered an "Eppes Classic". Also, Eppes has taken over Fleinhardt's [[computational physics]] class when he was asked to do so, and has given a joint lecture on [[circular motion]] and the [[Coriolis effect]] with Fleinhardt. Professor [[List of Numb3rs characters#Otto Bahnoff|Otto Bahnoff]] took over Eppes' [[mathematical physics]] grad seminar on the day he got married.

==Characterization==
Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and frequently enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants to understand how the world works.&lt;ref name="Associated2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6845064/ |title=Shooting for right formula on ‘Numb3rs’
|accessdate=August 1, 2009|author=Associated Press |date= January 19, 2005 |publisher=MSN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses a big heart and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is "a talented [[theory|theoretician]] with an ego problem" and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a [[pragmaticism|pragmatist]]. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of [[Occam's razor]]) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as "[[Charlie Eppes#CharlieVision|audience visions]]" or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes [[equation]]s, often covering several [[blackboard|chalkboards]] with a staccato clacking and the aid of a red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted—he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), especially when it comes to work, but he's rather naïve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times.

He is extremely talented in [[chess]], as it requires both his father and brother to play against him and a distraction to defeat him. Charlie also has a vast understanding of [[theoretical physics]], often assisting Larry with his multi-dimensional [[supergravity|supergravity theory]] and papers on [[gravitational wave|gravity waves]], and [[biology]], extending to knowledge of [[ciliate]] [[protozoa]] and the spread of infectious diseases. While brilliant in some areas, he is lacking in others. Dr. Fleinhardt has stated that it is a good thing he went into applied mathematics as opposed to [[engineering]], as machines malfunction in his presence, though he was able to take apart and rebuild his father's cell phone to analyze its [[GPS]] transceiver. He is apparently a bad speller (e.g., he misspells "anomaly" and "conceited") and does not know the meaning of "[[defenestration]]" (for which Larry chastises him stating that the idealization is to be a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] and that even math and physics majors had to have a course on English). Thus, his father likes playing [[Scrabble]] with him.

Charlie is a rationalist.&lt;ref name="Paula Hendrickson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003055.html?categoryid=3611&amp;cs=1 |title=Spirituality adds depth to 'Numbers'|accessdate=July 7, 2009|author=Paula Hendrickson |date=April 30, 2009| publisher=Variety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is skeptical of UFOs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Noisy Edge |series=Numb3rs|serieslink=Numb3rs|airdate=May 6, 2005|season=1 |number =12}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychic ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mind Games |series=Numb3rs|serieslink=Numb3rs|airdate=March 10, 2006|season=2|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Trouble in Chinatown |series=Numb3rs|serieslink=Numb3rs|airdate=January 23, 2009|season=5 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gematria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title =Thirteen |series=Numb3rs|serieslink=Numb3rs|airdate=October 19, 2007|season=4 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;—all considered to be [[pseudosciences]].  He also does not like illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Magic Show |series=Numb3rs|serieslink=Numb3rs|airdate=November 7, 2008|season=5 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He, however, is also fairly open-minded in terms of faith and religion.&lt;ref name="Paula Hendrickson"/&gt;

==Evolution over the series==
The episode "Uncertainty Principle" is significant for the backstory it gives on the familial relationships, particularly Charlie's difficulty in dealing with his mother's death from cancer. While it's unclear how Don reacted, Charlie spent the last three months of his mother's life isolated in the garage, incessantly working on one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]], specifically [[P = NP problem|P vs NP]]; it's a point of contention between the brothers. Also, Charlie doesn't think Don understood what he went through during their school years, especially how he was treated as "Don's brainiac little brother" by his peers in high school, and how he often left him to his own resources as a child, though he was not as inept as Don had reasoned. However, Charlie's relationship with Don remains strong, as he has begun to increasingly fear for his brother's safety on the job and still looks to his older brother for acceptance. Charlie and his father worry about Don committing to relationships, and for a time, fear that he had been cheating on Robin Brooks. Ironically, Charlie has similar problems with women himself. After a couple dozen murder cases, Charlie is somewhat jaded and world-weary like his brother. FBI agent [[David Sinclair (Numb3rs)|David Sinclair]] of Don's team even comments that he has never seen two brothers so similar and yet so different. In "The Janus List", the brothers seem to take on each other's tendencies a bit. Though, in season five, Charlie is dismayed that Don does not reveal to him his newfound religious faith.

In "Prime Suspect," Charlie purchases the beautiful [[Arts and Crafts movement|Craftsman]] family home from his father, who continues to live with him. Now 30 years old, Charlie wants to be responsible and take care of his father but still believes that much of the pressures involving their dad has been put on his shoulders as Don doesn't seem to have enough time. Realizing this, Alan sets his sights on moving out to accomplish things on his own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full [[tenure]]d professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on "life-altering" mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, though Mr. Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] his father looks into information on the [[physicist]] and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother ([[JoBeth Williams]]) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up.

Charlie's research often interferes with his relationships: as with Amita on their first date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt says that it is a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry ([[Sonya Walger]]), an attractive [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] from [[London, England|London]]. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own [[Geometric phase|Berry's phase]]. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to [[England]]. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at [[Harvard University]] strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but by the middle of the third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being [[Jewish]], but the problem is that he is not [[India]]n-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.

Unforeseen complications with his work emerge as the new [[Chair (official)|Chair]] of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, [[List of Numb3rs characters#Mildred Finch|Dr. Mildred Finch]], in the episode "Waste Not", makes Charlie head of the [[Ph.D.]] admissions committee against his wishes, bogging him down with more work, and gives him pressures about using the school's [[supercomputer]] for FBI work or missing classes for such. This leads to Charlie being confrontational, but she calms him when she says she just wants him to be "the [[Sean Connery]] of the mathematics [[academic department|department]]." In the episode "Take Out", Charlie and Millie attend a black tie reception for CalSci fundraising and bond. Soon after, Charlie is asked by Millie to meet with Macmillan Pharmaceuticals, which according to Amita has a reputation for exploiting third-world countries. Amita serves as his conscience in this matter, and he goes to see Dr. Finch about it. With "Pythagorean wit," he dazzles Macmillan and is to serve as a mathematical consultant for the pharmaco-kinetic [[model (abstract)|modelling]] project, only under the provision that CalSci will administer the trials and monitor the drug at every step, all computational analyses are conducted by Charlie and his team, and 5% of the gross will go to third-world AIDS organizations chosen by Professors Eppes and Ramanujan . In "Democracy", as part of his duties, he recruits the young [[fantasy baseball]] and [[sabermetrics]] fanatic Oswald Kittner ([[Jay Baruchel]]), who shows great promise, to attend CalSci.

When Larry announces his leave of absence to board the [[International Space Station]] (in the episode "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in [[denial]] about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks involved will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, "[Charlie] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so he has no idea what it is like to want something he is not able to get. So how could he understand how much [Larry] you would give up when this chance comes along?" Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus [[steam tunnel]]s. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the [[academic]] firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt.

In "The Art of Reckoning", Charlie is initially overjoyed to see his friend Larry return, but Charlie is dismayed with Larry's lack of enthusiasm in life, so Charlie doesn't object to him readjusting at a monastery. His concern is apparent, and he says he just wants his friend back.

Since then, in "Trust Metric", Charlie is pleased to see his friend doing well, feeling that he needed a friend, and is glad to have focused on teaching while Don did not include him with FBI work; though, on previous occasions, he expressed the desire to be involved. Granger's escape from the prison bus causes him to become active in helping his brother once more, allowing him a chance to use set covering deployment.

Dr. Finch tells him to publish, and so he has renewed interest in old research, having decided to publish one of his eleventh-grade papers he started at nine years old, "The Mathematics of Friendship," with an addendum. A publishing company has turned his work into a classic book for those not mathematically inclined, while opting for a title with more pizazz, "Friendship, As Easy as Pi." Charlie takes joy in the belief that this book will allow his thoughts to reach a much wider audience than before. By the episode "In Security," the published book appears with the title "The Attraction Equation" and a dapper photo on the back cover of him holding a sculpture of a [[stellation|stellated]] [[icosidodecahedron]] with bevelled edges. A [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] approach to relationships is covered in the book. His proud father hands copies to friends and Larry sells signed copies on [[eBay]]. He apparently has some fans and gives into a televised interview.

In "Checkmate", Charlie is training in weapons and tactics in LA's FBI school, where he is shown to have a high skill in marksmanship at the range, impressing many of his FBI training peers as well as his instructor, which he credits to following [[Wyatt Earp]]'s preference for careful accuracy instead of rapid firing. He is given a certificate of marksmanship by the FBI. In the episode "Pay to Play", Charlie convinces Don to let him join the team when they go to arrest a suspect, mentioning that he passed the FBI course.

In the season four finale "When Worlds Collide", Charlie helps an innocent colleague accused of terrorism by sending genetic research to scientists at Pakistani universities which is prohibited, with full cognizance of the consequences. As a result, Charlie is arrested, loses his security clearance and ultimately loses his ability to help Don on FBI cases. Once again, Charlie holds strong to his ideals. In the previous season's "Burn Rate", Charlie has strong opinions concerning [[genetic engineering]], believing bomb suspect, fellow prodigy, and former [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] student Emmett Glaser's ideas about genetic predeterminism are rational, not incendiary, and helps to clear his name.

The charges against Dr. Eppes are dropped. For a time, Don Eppes' team is attempting to make do with Fleinhardt's and Amita's expertise, but Charles' assistance is sorely missed to the point of consulting him secretly.  For his part, Charles has been convinced by his lawyer and father to attempt to have his clearance restored. Even Don supports the idea and stands up to security clearance investigator Carl McGowan ([[Keith Carradine]]), stating to go after him, not his brother. Temporarily, Charlie works as a LAPD consultant until the fiasco with his security clearance can be resolved. He later gets his clearance back and is working with his brother and the FBI again. He is trying to assert himself in the methodology used to solve a crime, having struggled with not being included, but some friction arises with Amita and Larry.

Charlie works once again with rival Marshall Penfield, as they settle their differences ("Frienemies"). Also, he is chosen to be the head of the think tank model comprising himself, Larry, Alan, and Amita ("Jacked"). As Dr. Eppes applies the [[Turing Test]] to a seemingly unique artificial intelligence, he is tricked only to come to the realization that the computer only uses a recursive algorithm to apply the most human responses, while simultaneously being tempted by an offer to work for [[DARPA]]. Head of DARPA special projects Jane Karellen ([[Nancy Travis]]) knows that he has a limited window to use his genius and tells Charlie that he is one of the top five minds on the planet. Amita's life is even threatened by the advanced computer ("First Law").
  
Late in season five, Charlie moves into a new office.  While moving, he gets some inspiration for his cognitive emergence theory, which causes him to momentarily set aside his work on a series of home invasions for Don.  Don is stabbed while attempting to arrest the home invaders ("The Fifth Man").  Charlie blames himself for Don being stabbed and throws himself into his FBI consultation work as a result ("Disturbed").  This worries everyone, especially Don, who tells him to "do whatever you want to do" ("Greatest Hits") while visiting Charlie in his new office. Around this time, Charlie is also presented with a series of letters from previous successive holders of this prestigious office, wherein each celebrated mathematician writes of accomplishments they intend to achieve, passing down the torch to the next in line to do the same. At first Charlie is hesitant, until the very determined Amita convinces him to write the corresponding letter and eases his burdens, as Charlie fears he cannot meet his destiny with so much weight to succeed being placed on his shoulders his entire life.

At the end of the season, while leaving for dinner, Charlie is attacked, and Amita is kidnapped.  Charlie is so emotionally distraught that he cannot think of the math needed to find Amita. With the help of Don, Alan, and David, Charlie snaps out of it to locate Amita.  Amita is rescued.  He realizes that he did not want to lose Amita, and he proposes to her ("Angels and Devils").

At the end the premiere episode of the program's sixth season, it was revealed that Amita has accepted Charlie's proposal. The issue was skirted throughout the episode, as the two were waiting until Amita officially received permission from her parents. He and Amita discuss the number of children that they want to have, and they both decide that they may need to participate in the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brother/Big Sister]] program for some practical experience before having children. He and Amita attempt to find a wedding date that is suited to their and their families' schedules; Alan suggests that they should take his and Margaret's anniversary date as Charlie and Amita's date. Charlie and Amita have since pushed the date forward as his academic fantasy has come to light, being a [[visiting professor]] at [[Cambridge University]]. In the season finale, after the wedding ceremony presided over by Larry, he is happy but worries about disconnecting with Don and offers to have the garage renovated into a guest house for his father.

Long intrigued by mathematicians and scientists, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nick Falacci created a show with one as the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003056.html?categoryid=3611&amp;cs=1|title='Numbers' defies naysayers |accessdate=July 7, 2009 |author=Paula Hendrickson |date=April 30, 2009 |publisher=Variety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspiration for Charlie came specifically from [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/They're+hot!+They're+sexy!+They're+geeks!+TV+catches+up+with+real...-a0138683279

To prepare for his role of Charlie Eppes, Krumholtz spent some time at Caltech talking to professors and walking the Caltech campus,&lt;ref name="Rhonda2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pr.caltech.edu:16080/periodicals/CaltechNews/articles/v39/crime.html |title=Crime and Computation |accessdate=2009-02-22 |author=Rhonda Hillbery |year=2005 |work=Caltech News |publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to understand both the basics of the math and the mathematician's mind.&lt;ref name="Associated2005" /&gt;  He even spoke with Dr. Tony Chan of UCLA about mathematicians’ work while filming the first pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/zap-gf-numb3rssetvisit,0,3941312.story

==Reception==
Early reception of Charlie varied according to the audience in question. Due to television production's traditional approach of utilizing only two worlds for filming, production staff initially opposed the idea of Charlie being a college professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/864/864476p2.html |title=The Return of Numb3rs: Behind the Scenes |accessdate=September 2, 2009 |author=Travis Fickett |date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even unsuccessfully suggested to Heuton and Falacci that Charlie should be working with the FBI full-time as an employee.&lt;ref name="Travis Fickett"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/864/864476p3.html |title=The Return of Numb3rs: Behind the Scenes |accessdate=September 2, 2009 |author=Travis Fickett |date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the pilot was previewed, the reception was more positive.  CBS executive Nina Tassler liked Charlie.&lt;ref name="Travis Fickett"/&gt;  The focus group that watched the original pilot for ''Numb3rs'' loved him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003056.html?categoryid=3611&amp;cs=1 |title='Numbers' defies naysayers |accessdate=July 7, 2009 |author=Paula Hendrickson |date=April 30, 2009 |publisher=Variety.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lv0baMsv?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003056.html?categoryid=3611&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=December 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/0bc2323776c9f010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |title=Pop CSI: How Science Conquered TV |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |author=Speed Weed |date=December 2006 |volume=270 |issue=0161-7370 |publisher=''Popular Science'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106214332/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/0bc2323776c9f010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |archivedate=January 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Numb3rs'' was previewed for the TV critics, the reception was different.  Melanie McFarland, TV critic for the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', stated that Charlie was not original as of the [[Pilot (Numb3rs)|Pilot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/208727_numbers21.html |title=If you can't do the math, don't do the time |accessdate=August 14, 2009|author=Melanie McFarland |date=January 21, 2005 |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lauren Aaronson of ''[[Popular Science]]'', Charlie’s expertise seems a little bit incredible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-04/calculus-crime |title=Calculus of Crime Surprise!

Since the early days of the series, the character of Charlie Eppes has become more widely accepted.  Krumholtz appeared at the 2005 [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) convention in Anaheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20050408cbs01|title=Numb3rs Stars and Producers Observe "National Math Awareness Month" with Appearance |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |author=CBS |date=April 8, 2005 |publisher=The Futon Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Krumholtz receives cheers when he attends math conventions.&lt;ref name="Dana Meltzer Zepeda"/&gt;  In a public service announcement, Krumholtz congratulated the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] on their 100th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/multimedia/david_krumholz_102208/transcript.htm |title=David Krumholtz —&amp;ndash; Professor Charlie Epps on Numb3rs |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |author=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=October 22, 2008 |work=Celebrating a Century |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417185454/http://www.fbi.gov/multimedia/david_krumholz_102208/transcript.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie was one of the first [[geek]]s on primetime television who paved the way for other shows starring geeks such as ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV's+revenge+of+the+nerds.-a0170102930 |title=TV's revenge of the nerds |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |author=Mark Dawidziak |date=October 21, 2007 |publisher=The Free Library |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlie was a runner-up in the category of "Sexiest Brainiac" in TV Guide's poll in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publication-date =March 26 – April 1, 2007 | title =Sexiest Brainiac | periodical =TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''CharlieVision''==

''CharlieVision'' (as labeled by the show's creators) is the mode in which Charlie's insights are displayed on-screen. It consists of fast-paced visions or cutscenes often characterized by [[false-color image]]s that integrate his analogies and [[mathematical model]]s, usually followed by him rushing off to tell Don about his new insights. 'CharlieVision' is not to be confused with "audience visions," in which Charlie's voice uses an analogy to simplify a mathematical concept while corresponding images are flashed on screen.  [[Ridley Scott]] and [[Tony Scott]], executive producers for Numb3rs, designed the specifics of the Charlie-visions, such as the ash yellow color that appears on-screen when Charlie suddenly becomes inspired.&lt;ref name="Travis Fickett"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9975">In algebraic geometry, the '''Chow group of a stack''' is a generalization of the [[Chow group]] of a variety or scheme to [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s. For a [[quotient stack]] &lt;math&gt;X = [Y/G]&lt;/math&gt;, the Chow group of ''X'' is the same as the ''G''-'''equivariant Chow group''' of ''Y''.

A key difference from the theory of Chow groups of a variety is that a cycle is allowed to carry non-trivial automorphisms and consequently intersection-theoretic operations must take this into account. For example, the degree of a 0-cycle on a stack need not be an integer but is a rational number (due to non-trivial stabilizers).

== Definitions ==
{{harvtxt|Vistoli|1989}} develops the basic theory (mostly over '''Q''') for the Chow group of a (separated) [[Deligne–Mumford stack]]. There, the Chow group is defined exactly as in the classical case: it is the free abelian group generated by integral closed substacks modulo rational equivalence.

If a stack ''X'' can be written as the [[quotient stack]] &lt;math&gt;X = [Y/G]&lt;/math&gt; for some quasi-projective variety ''Y'' with a linearized action of a linear algebraic group ''G'', then the Chow group of ''X'' is defined as the ''G''-'''equivariant Chow group''' of ''Y''. This approach is introduced and developed by Edidin-Graham and Totaro. {{harvtxt|Kresch|1999}} later extended the theory to a stack admitting a stratification by quotient stacks.

For [[higher Chow group]]s (precursor of [[motivic homology|motivic homologies]]) of algebraic stacks, see Roy Joshua's Intersection Theory on Stacks:I and II. [https://people.math.osu.edu/joshua.1/pub.html]

== Examples ==
The calculations depend on definitions. Thus, here, we proceed somehow axiomatically. Specifically, we assume: given an algebraic stack ''X'' locally of finite type over a base field ''k'',
# (homotopy-invariance) if ''E'' is a rank-''n'' vector bundle on ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;A_{p}(E) = A_{p-n}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.
# for each integral substack ''Z'' of dimension &lt; ''p'', &lt;math&gt;A_p(X - Z) = A_p(X)&lt;/math&gt;, a corollary of a localization sequence.
These properties are valid if ''X'' is Deligne–Mumford and are expected to hold for any other reasonable theory.

We take ''X'' to be the classifying stack &lt;math&gt;B G&lt;/math&gt;, the stack of principal ''G''-bundles for a smooth linear algebraic group ''G''. By definition, it is the quotient stack &lt;math&gt;[*/G]&lt;/math&gt;, where * is viewed as the stack associated to * = Spec ''k''. We approximate it as follows. Given an integer ''p'', choose a representation &lt;math&gt;G \to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a ''G''-invariant open subset ''U'' of ''V'' on which ''G'' acts freely and the complement &lt;math&gt;Z = V - U&lt;/math&gt; has codimension &lt;math&gt;&gt; - \operatorname{dim} G - p&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;* \times_G V&lt;/math&gt; be the quotient of &lt;math&gt;* \times G&lt;/math&gt; by the action &lt;math&gt;(x, v) \cdot g = (xg, g^{-1} v)&lt;/math&gt;. Note the action is free and so &lt;math&gt;* \times_G V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle over &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt;. By Property 1 applied to this vector bundle,
:&lt;math&gt;A_p(BG) = A_{p+\dim V} (* \times_G V).&lt;/math&gt;
Then, since &lt;math&gt;* \times_G U = U/G&lt;/math&gt;, by Property 2,
:&lt;math&gt;A_{p + \dim V}(* \times_G V) = A_{p + \dim V}(U/G)&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\dim[Z/G] = \dim Z - \dim G &lt; \dim V + p&lt;/math&gt;.

As a concrete example, let &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt; and let it act on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^n&lt;/math&gt; by scaling. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt; acts freely on &lt;math&gt;U = \mathbb{A}^n - \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. By the above calculation, for each pair of integers ''n'', ''p'' such that &lt;math&gt;n+p \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A_p(B \mathbb{G}_m) = A_{p+n}(\mathbb{P}^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, for every integer ''p'' ≥ 0, &lt;math&gt;A_p(B \mathbb{G}_m) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, &lt;math&gt;A_{n-k}(\mathbb{P}^n) = \mathbb{Q}h^k&lt;/math&gt; for the hyperplane class ''h'', &lt;math&gt;h^k&lt;/math&gt; ''k''-times self-intersection and &lt;math&gt;h^k =0&lt;/math&gt; for negative ''k'' and so
:&lt;math&gt;A_p(B \mathbb{G}_m) = \mathbb{Q} h^{-1-p}&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side is independent of models used in the calculation (since different ''h''{{'}}s correspond under the [[projective variety#Projections|projections]] between projective spaces.) For &lt;math&gt;p = -1 = \dim B \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt;, the class &lt;math&gt;h^0 = [\mathbb{P}^{n}]&lt;/math&gt;, any ''n'', may be thought of as the fundamental class of &lt;math&gt;B \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we have
:&lt;math&gt;A^*(B \mathbb{G}_m) = \mathbb{Q}[c]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c = c_1(h)&lt;/math&gt; is the first Chern class of ''h'' (and ''c'' and ''h'' are identified when Chow groups and Chow rings of projective spaces are identified). Since &lt;math&gt;h^k = c \cdot h^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;A_*(B \mathbb{G}_m)&lt;/math&gt; is the free &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[c]&lt;/math&gt;-module generated by &lt;math&gt;h^0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Virtual fundamental class ==
The notion originates in the [[Kuranishi theory]] in [[symplectic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Fukaya and Kaoru Ono, Arnold conjecture and Gromov-Witten invariant, Topology 38 (1999), no. 5, 933–1048.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardon|first=John|date=2016-04-28|title=An algebraic approach to virtual fundamental cycles on moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic curves|journal=Geometry &amp; Topology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=779–1034|doi=10.2140/gt.2016.20.779|issn=1364-0380|arxiv=1309.2370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In § 2. of {{harvtxt|Behrend|2009}}, given a DM stack ''X'' and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[intrinsic normal cone]] to ''X'', K. Behrend defines the '''virtual fundamental class''' of ''X'' as
:&lt;math&gt;[X]^{\text{vir}} = s_0^![C_X]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the zero-section of the cone determined by the [[perfect obstruction theory]] and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[refined Gysin homomorphism]] defined just as in Fulton's "Intersection theory". The same paper shows that the degree of this class, morally the integration over it, is equal to the weighted Euler characteristic of the [[Behrend function]] of ''X''.

More recent (circa 2017) approaches do this type of construction in the context of [[derived algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;§ 1.2.1. of {{cite arxiv|last=Cisinski|first=Denis-Charles|last2=Khan|first2=Adeel A.|date=2017-05-09|title=Brave new motivic homotopy theory II: Homotopy invariant K-theory|eprint=1705.03340|class=math.AT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- use the material below to discuss EG, BG =[pt/G]
== Equivariant Chow ring ==
Let ''X'' be an equidimensional [[smooth scheme]] with the action of a [[linear algebraic group]] ''G''. We note:
# A universal ''G''-bundle ''EG'' on ''X'' admits an approximation by [[algebraic bundle]]s of arbitrary large codimension. (Note &lt;math&gt;EG&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ind-scheme]].)
# ''X'' can be covered by invariant quasi-projective open subsets.
(1. is always true and 2. holds by [[Sumihiro's theorem]] as ''X'' is normal.) Then one defines the equivariant Chow group to be
:&lt;math&gt;A^*_G(X) = \bigoplus A^n(EG(n) \times_G X)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;EG(n)&lt;/math&gt; is an invariant open subset with codimension at least ''n''. (The definition is an analog of [[equivariant cohomology]].) Like the usual [[Chow ring]], &lt;math&gt;A^*_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[graded ring]] with respect to [[intersection product]]. Moreover, it is a graded algebra over &lt;math&gt;A^*_G(pt)&lt;/math&gt; via the map induced by &lt;math&gt;X \times_G EG \to EG/G&lt;/math&gt;.

There is the cycle map
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}: A^*_G(X) \to H_G(X; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
from the equivariant Chow ring to the [[equivariant cohomology ring]]. The map is an isomorphism if ''X'' admits a cell decomposition (e.g., ''X'' is a ''T''-variety by the [[Białynicki-Birula decomposition]].)--&gt;

[[File:Brute force Clique algorithm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Brute-force search|brute force algorithm]] finds a 4-clique in this 7-vertex graph (the complement of the 7-vertex [[path graph]]) by systematically checking all [[Combination|C]](7,4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;35 4-vertex subgraphs for completeness.]]

In [[computer science]], the '''clique problem''' is the computational problem of finding [[clique (graph theory)|clique]]s (subsets of vertices, all [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] to each other, also called [[complete graph|complete]] [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]]) in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a [[maximum clique]] (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all [[maximal clique]]s (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the [[decision problem]] of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.

The clique problem arises in the following real-world setting. Consider a [[social network]], where the graph's [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] represent people, and the graph's [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] represent mutual acquaintance. Then a clique represents a subset of people who all know each other, and algorithms for finding cliques can be used to discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational chemistry]].

Most versions of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is [[NP-complete]] (one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter intractable]] and [[hardness of approximation|hard to approximate]]. And, listing all maximal cliques may require [[exponential time]] as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.

To find a maximum clique, one can systematically inspect all subsets, but this sort of [[brute-force search]] is too time-consuming to be practical for networks comprising more than a few dozen vertices.
Although no [[polynomial time]] algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient [[algorithm]]s than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the [[Bron–Kerbosch algorithm]] can be used to list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it is also possible to list them in polynomial time per clique.

==History and applications==
The study of complete subgraphs in mathematics predates the "clique" terminology. For instance, complete subgraphs make an early appearance in the mathematical literature in the graph-theoretic reformulation of [[Ramsey theory]] by {{harvtxt|Erdős|Szekeres|1935}}. But the term "clique" and the problem of algorithmically listing cliques both come from the social sciences, where complete subgraphs are used to model [[clique|social cliques]], groups of people who all know each other. {{harvtxt|Luce|Perry|1949}} used graphs to model social networks, and adapted the social science terminology to graph theory. They were the first to call complete subgraphs "cliques". The first algorithm for solving the clique problem is that of {{harvtxt|Harary|Ross|1957}},&lt;ref name="bbpp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bomze|Budinich|Pardalos|Pelillo|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Gutin|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who were motivated by the sociological application.
Social science researchers have also defined various other types of cliques and maximal cliques in social network, "cohesive subgroups" of people or actors in the network all of whom share one of several different kinds of connectivity relation. Many of these generalized notions of cliques can also be found by constructing an undirected graph whose edges represent related pairs of actors from the social network, and then applying an algorithm for the clique problem to this graph.{{sfnp|Wasserman|Faust|1994}}

Since the work of Harary and Ross, many others have devised algorithms for various versions of the clique problem.&lt;ref name="bbpp"/&gt; In the 1970s, researchers began studying these algorithms from the point of view of [[worst-case analysis]]. See, for instance, {{harvtxt|Tarjan|Trojanowski|1977}}, an early work on the worst-case complexity of the maximum clique problem. Also in the 1970s, beginning with the work of {{harvtxt|Cook|1971}} and {{harvtxt|Karp|1972}}, researchers began using the theory of [[NP-complete]]ness and related intractability results to provide a mathematical explanation for the perceived difficulty of the clique problem. In the 1990s, a breakthrough series of papers beginning with {{harvtxt|Feige|Goldwasser|Lovász|Safra|1991}} and reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'',{{sfnp|Kolata|1990}} showed that (assuming [[P ≠ NP]]) it is not even possible to [[approximation algorithm|approximate]] the problem accurately and efficiently.

Clique-finding algorithms have been used in [[chemistry]], to find chemicals that match a target structure{{sfnp|Rhodes|Willett|Calvet|Dunbar|2003}} and to model [[Docking (molecular)|molecular docking]] and the binding sites of chemical reactions.{{sfnp|Kuhl|Crippen|Friesen|1983}} They can also be used to find similar structures within different molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|National Research Council Committee on Mathematical Challenges from Computational Chemistry|1995}}. See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=YkArAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35 pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36].&lt;/ref&gt;
In these applications, one forms a graph in which each vertex represents a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms in which all the matches are compatible with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Muegge|Rarey|2001}}. See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=luNYUUfBQb4C&amp;pg=PA6 pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7].&lt;/ref&gt; A special case of this method is the use of the [[modular product of graphs]] to reduce the problem of finding the [[maximum common induced subgraph]] of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.{{sfnp|Barrow|Burstall|1976}}

In [[automatic test pattern generation]], finding cliques can help to bound the size of a test set.{{sfnp|Hamzaoglu|Patel|1998}} In [[bioinformatics]], clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer [[evolutionary tree]]s,{{sfnp|Day|Sankoff|1986}} [[protein structure prediction|predict protein structures]],{{sfnp|Samudrala|Moult|1998}} and find closely interacting clusters of proteins.{{sfnp|Spirin|Mirny|2003}} Listing the cliques in a [[dependency graph]] is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes.{{sfnp|Frank|Strauss|1986}} In mathematics, [[Keller's conjecture]] on face-to-face tiling of [[hypercube]]s was disproved by {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Shor|1992}}, who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;The Keller graph used by {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Shor|1992}} has 1048576 vertices and clique size 1024. They described a synthetic construction for the clique, but also used clique-finding algorithms on smaller graphs to help guide their search. {{harvtxt|Mackey|2002}} simplified the proof by finding a clique of size 256 in a 65536-vertex Keller graph.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Main|Clique (graph theory)}}
[[File:6n-graf-clique.svg|thumb|The graph shown has one maximum clique, the triangle {1,2,5}, and four more maximal cliques, the pairs {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}.]]
An [[undirected graph]] is formed by a [[finite set]] of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and a set of [[unordered pair]]s of vertices, which are called [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. By convention, in algorithm analysis, the number of vertices in the graph is denoted by {{mvar|n}} and the number of edges is denoted by {{mvar|m}}. A [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a graph {{mvar|G}} is a [[complete graph|complete]] [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of {{mvar|G}}. That is, it is a subset {{mvar|K}} of the vertices such that every two vertices in {{mvar|K}} are the two endpoints of an edge in {{mvar|G}}. A [[maximal clique]] is a clique to which no more vertices can be added. For each vertex {{mvar|v}} that is not part of a maximal clique, there must be another vertex {{mvar|w}} that is in the clique and non-adjacent to {{mvar|v}}, preventing {{mvar|v}} from being added to the clique. A [[maximum clique]] is a clique that includes the largest possible number of vertices. The clique number {{math|''ω''(''G'')}} is the number of vertices in a maximum clique of {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref name="bbpp"/&gt;

Several closely related clique-finding problems have been studied.&lt;ref name="v02p09"&gt;{{harvtxt|Valiente|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Pelillo|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum clique in the graph. If there are multiple maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="v02p09"/&gt;
*In the weighted maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique problem is the special case in which all weights are equal.{{sfnp|Pelillo|2009}} As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.{{sfnp|Sethuraman|Butenko|2015}}
*In the maximal clique listing problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a list of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique problem may be solved using as a subroutine an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques.{{sfnp||Valiente|2002}}
*In the {{mvar|k}}-clique problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number {{mvar|k}}. The output is a clique with {{mvar|k}} vertices, if one exists, or a special value indicating that there is no {{mvar|k}}-clique otherwise. In some variations of this problem, the output should list all cliques of size {{mvar|k}}.&lt;ref name="CN85"/&gt;
*In the clique decision problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number {{mvar|k}}, and the output is a [[truth value|Boolean value]]: true if the graph contains a {{mvar|k}}-clique, and false otherwise.{{sfnp|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001}}
The first four of these problems are all important in practical applications. The clique decision problem is not of practical importance; it is formulated in this way in order to apply the theory of [[NP-completeness]] to clique-finding problems.{{sfnp|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001}}

The clique problem and the [[independent set problem]] are complementary: a clique in {{mvar|G}} is an independent set in the [[complement graph]] of {{mvar|G}} and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001}}, Exercise 34-1, p.&amp;nbsp;1018.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, many computational results may be applied equally well to either problem, and some research papers do not clearly distinguish between the two problems. However, the two problems have different properties when applied to restricted families of graphs. For instance, the clique problem may be solved in polynomial time for [[planar graph]]s&lt;ref name="planar"&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|Yannakakis|1981}}; {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the independent set problem remains NP-hard on planar graphs.{{sfnp|Garey|Johnson|Stockmeyer|1976}}

==Algorithms==

===Finding a single maximal clique===
A [[maximal element|maximal]] clique, sometimes called inclusion-maximal, is a clique that is not included in a larger clique.  Therefore, every clique is contained in a maximal clique.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Frank|Strauss|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maximal cliques can be very small.  A graph may contain a non-maximal clique with many vertices and a separate clique of size 2 which is maximal.  While a maximum (i.e., largest) clique is necessarily maximal, the converse does not hold.  There are some types of graphs in which every maximal clique is maximum; these are the [[complement (graph theory)|complements]] of the [[well-covered graph]]s, in which every maximal independent set is maximum.{{sfnp|Plummer|1993}}
However, other graphs have maximal cliques that are not maximum.

A single maximal clique can be found by a straightforward [[greedy algorithm]]. Starting with an arbitrary clique (for instance, any single vertex or even the empty set), grow the current clique one vertex at a time by looping through the graph's remaining vertices. For each vertex {{mvar|v}} that this loop examines, add {{mvar|v}} to the clique if it is adjacent to every vertex that is already in the clique, and discard {{mvar|v}} otherwise. This algorithm runs in [[linear time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Skiena|2009}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7XUSn0IKQEgC&amp;pg=PA526 p.&amp;nbsp;526].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because of the ease of finding maximal cliques, and their potential small size,  more attention has been given to the much harder algorithmic problem of finding a maximum or otherwise large clique than has been given to the problem of finding a single maximal clique.
However, some research in [[parallel algorithm]]s has studied the problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the [[lexicographic ordering|lexicographically first]] maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) has been shown to be [[Complete (complexity)|complete]] for [[FP (complexity)|the class of polynomial-time functions]]. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class [[NC (complexity)|NC]].{{sfnp|Cook|1985}}

===Cliques of fixed size===
One can test whether a graph {{mvar|G}} contains a {{mvar|k}}-vertex clique, and find any such clique that it contains, using a [[brute-force search|brute force algorithm]]. This algorithm examines each subgraph with {{mvar|k}} vertices and checks to see whether it forms a clique. It takes time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, as expressed using [[big O notation]].
This is because there are {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} subgraphs to check, each of which has {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} edges whose presence in {{mvar|G}} needs to be checked. Thus, the problem may be solved in [[polynomial time]] whenever {{mvar|k}} is a fixed constant. However, when {{mvar|k}} does not have a fixed value, but instead may vary as part of the input to the problem, the time is exponential.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see {{harvtxt|Downey|Fellows|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest nontrivial case of the clique-finding problem is finding a triangle in a graph, or equivalently determining whether the graph is [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]].
In a graph with {{mvar|m}} edges, there may be at most {{math|Θ(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} triangles (using [[big theta notation]] to indicate that this bound is tight). The worst case for this formula occurs when {{mvar|G}} is itself a clique. Therefore, algorithms for listing all triangles must take at least {{math|Ω(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} time in the worst case (using [[big omega notation]]), and algorithms are known that match this time bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Itai|Rodeh|1978}} provide an algorithm with {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} running time that finds a triangle if one exists but does not list all triangles; {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}} list all triangles in time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}} describe an algorithm that sorts the vertices in order from highest degree to lowest and then iterates through each vertex {{mvar|v}} in the sorted list, looking for triangles that include {{mvar|v}} and do not include any previous vertex in the list. To do so the algorithm marks all neighbors of {{mvar|v}}, searches through all edges incident to a neighbor of {{mvar|v}} outputting a triangle for every edge that has two marked endpoints, and then removes the marks and deletes {{mvar|v}} from the graph. As the authors show, the time for this algorithm is proportional to the [[arboricity]] of the graph (denoted {{math|''a''(''G'')}}) multiplied by the number of edges, which is {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&amp;nbsp;''a''(''G''))}}. Since the arboricity is at most {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, this algorithm runs in time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. More generally, all {{mvar|k}}-vertex cliques can be listed by a similar algorithm that takes time proportional to the number of edges multiplied by the arboricity to the power {{math|(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)}}. For graphs of constant arboricity, such as planar graphs (or in general graphs from any non-trivial [[minor-closed graph family]]), this algorithm takes {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m'')}} time, which is optimal since it is linear in the size of the input.&lt;ref name="CN85"&gt;{{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If one desires only a single triangle, or an assurance that the graph is triangle-free, faster algorithms are possible. As {{harvtxt|Itai|Rodeh|1978}} observe, the graph contains a triangle if and only if its [[adjacency matrix]] and the square of the adjacency matrix contain nonzero entries in the same cell. Therefore, fast matrix multiplication techniques such as the [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] can be applied to find triangles in time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.376&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. {{harvtxt|Alon|Yuster|Zwick|1994}} used fast matrix multiplication to improve the {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} algorithm for finding triangles to {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''m''&lt;sup&gt;1.41&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. These algorithms based on fast matrix multiplication have also been extended to problems of finding {{mvar|k}}-cliques for larger values of {{mvar|k}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbrand|Grandoni|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Kloks|Kratsch|Müller|2000}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Poljak|1985}}; {{harvtxt|Vassilevska|Williams|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Yuster|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listing all maximal cliques===
By a result of {{harvtxt|Moon|Moser|1965}}, every {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph has at most {{math|3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt;}} maximal cliques. They can be listed by the [[Bron–Kerbosch algorithm]], a recursive [[backtracking]] procedure of {{harvtxt|Bron|Kerbosch|1973}}. The main recursive subroutine of this procedure has three arguments: a partially constructed (non-maximal) clique, a set of candidate vertices that could be added to the clique, and another set of vertices that should not be added (because doing so would lead to a clique that has already been found). The algorithm tries adding the candidate vertices one by one to the partial clique, making a recursive call for each one. After trying each of these vertices, it moves it to the set of vertices that should not be added again. Variants of this algorithm can be shown to have worst-case running time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, matching the number of cliques that might need to be listed.{{sfnp|Tomita|Tanaka|Takahashi|2006}} Therefore, this provides a worst-case-optimal solution to the problem of listing all maximal cliques. Further, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm has been widely reported as being faster in practice than its alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cazals|Karande|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Eppstein|Löffler|Strash|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the number of cliques is significantly smaller than its worst case, other algorithms might be preferable. As {{harvtxt|Tsukiyama|Ide|Ariyoshi|Shirakawa|1977}} showed, it is also possible to list all maximal cliques in a graph in an amount of time that is polynomial per generated clique. An algorithm such as theirs in which the running time depends on the output size is known as an [[output-sensitive algorithm]]. Their algorithm is based on the following two observations, relating the maximal cliques of the given graph {{mvar|G}} to the maximal cliques of a graph {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}} formed by removing an arbitrary vertex {{mvar|v}} from {{mvar|G}}:
*For every maximal clique {{mvar|K}} of {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}}, either {{mvar|K}} continues to form a maximal clique in {{mvar|G}}, or {{math|''K''&amp;nbsp;⋃&amp;nbsp;{''v''} }} forms a maximal clique in {{mvar|G}}. Therefore, {{mvar|G}} has at least as many maximal cliques as {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}} does.
*Each maximal clique in {{mvar|G}} that does not contain {{mvar|v}} is a maximal clique in {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}}, and each maximal clique in {{mvar|G}} that does contain {{mvar|v}} can be formed from a maximal clique {{mvar|K}} in {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}} by adding {{mvar|v}} and removing the non-neighbors of {{mvar|v}} from {{mvar|K}}.
Using these observations they can generate all maximal cliques in {{mvar|G}} by a recursive algorithm that chooses a vertex {{mvar|v}} arbitrarily and then, for each maximal clique {{mvar|K}} in {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}}, outputs both {{mvar|K}} and the clique formed by adding {{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|K}} and removing the non-neighbors of {{mvar|v}}. However, some cliques of {{mvar|G}} may be generated in this way from more than one parent clique of {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}}, so they eliminate duplicates by outputting a clique in {{mvar|G}} only when its parent in {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''v''}} is lexicographically maximum among all possible parent cliques. On the basis of this principle, they show that all maximal cliques in {{mvar|G}} may be generated in time {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''mn'')}} per clique, where {{mvar|m}} is the number of edges in {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices. {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}} improve this to {{math|O(''ma'')}} per clique, where {{mvar|a}} is the arboricity of the given graph. {{harvtxt|Makino|Uno|2004}} provide an alternative output-sensitive algorithm based on fast matrix multiplication. {{harvtxt|Johnson|Yannakakis|1988}} show that it is even possible to list all maximal cliques in [[lexicographic order]] with [[polynomial delay]] per clique. However, the choice of ordering is important for the efficiency of this algorithm: for the reverse of this order,
there is no polynomial-delay algorithm unless [[P = NP]].

On the basis of this result, it is possible to list all maximal cliques in polynomial time, for families of graphs in which the number of cliques is polynomially bounded. These families include [[chordal graph]]s, [[complete graph]]s, [[triangle-free graph]]s, [[interval graph]]s, graphs of bounded [[boxicity]], and [[planar graph]]s.{{sfnp|Rosgen|Stewart|2007}} In particular, the planar graphs have {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''n'')}} cliques, of at most constant size, that can be listed in linear time. The same is true for any family of graphs that is both [[dense graph|sparse]] (having a number of edges at most a constant times the number of vertices) and [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the operation of taking subgraphs.&lt;ref name="CN85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ELS10"/&gt;

===Finding maximum cliques in arbitrary graphs===
It is possible to find the maximum clique, or the clique number, of an arbitrary ''n''-vertex graph in time {{math|1={{italics correction|''O''}}(3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt;) = {{italics correction|''O''}}(1.4422&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} by using one of the algorithms described above to list all maximal cliques in the graph and returning the largest one. However, for this variant of the clique problem better worst-case time bounds are possible. The algorithm of {{harvtxt|Tarjan|Trojanowski|1977}} solves this problem in time {{math|1={{italics correction|''O''}}(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt;) = {{italics correction|''O''}}(1.2599&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. It is a recursive backtracking scheme similar to that of the [[Bron–Kerbosch algorithm]], but is able to eliminate some recursive calls when it can be shown that the cliques found within the call will be suboptimal. {{harvtxt|Jian|1986}} improved the time to {{math|1={{italics correction|''O''}}(2&lt;sup&gt;0.304''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = {{italics correction|''O''}}(1.2346&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, and {{harvtxt|Robson|1986}} improved it to {{math|1={{italics correction|''O''}}(2&lt;sup&gt;0.276''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = {{italics correction|''O''}}(1.2108&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} time, at the expense of greater space usage. Robson's algorithm combines a similar backtracking scheme (with a more complicated case analysis) and a [[dynamic programming]] technique in which the optimal solution is precomputed for all small connected subgraphs of the [[complement graph]]. These partial solutions are used to shortcut the backtracking recursion. The fastest algorithm known today is a refined version of this method by {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} which runs in time {{math|1={{italics correction|''O''}}(2&lt;sup&gt;0.249''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = {{italics correction|''O''}}(1.1888&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.{{sfnp|Robson|2001}}

There has also been extensive research on [[heuristic algorithm]]s for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including [[branch and bound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Balas|Yu|1986}}; {{harvtxt|Carraghan|Pardalos|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Pardalos|Rogers|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Östergård|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Fahle|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Tomita|Seki|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Tomita|Kameda|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Konc|Janežič|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local search (optimization)|local search]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Battiti|Protasi|2001}}; {{harvtxt|Katayama|Hamamoto|Narihisa|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[greedy algorithm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Abello|Pardalos|Resende|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Grosso|Locatelli|Della Croce|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[constraint programming]].{{sfnp|Régin|2003}} Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include [[DNA computing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ouyang|Kaplan|Liu|Libchaber|1997}}. Although the title refers to maximal cliques, the problem this paper solves is actually the maximum clique problem.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[adiabatic quantum computation]].{{sfnp|Childs|Farhi|Goldstone|Gutmann|2002}} The maximum clique problem was the subject of an implementation challenge sponsored by [[DIMACS]] in 1992–1993,{{sfnp|Johnson|Trick|1996}} and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge, which is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/challenge/graph/benchmarks/clique/ DIMACS challenge graphs for the clique problem], accessed 2009-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special classes of graphs===
[[File:Permutation graph.svg|thumb|In this [[permutation graph]], the maximum cliques correspond to the [[Longest increasing subsequence|longest decreasing subsequences]] (4,3,1) and (4,3,2) of the defining permutation.]]
[[Planar graph]]s, and other families of sparse graphs, have been discussed above: they have linearly many maximal cliques, of bounded size, that can be listed in linear time.&lt;ref name="CN85"/&gt; In particular, for planar graphs, any clique can have at most four vertices, by [[Kuratowski's theorem]].&lt;ref name="planar"/&gt;

[[Perfect graph]]s are defined by the properties that their clique number equals their [[chromatic number]], and that this equality holds also in each of their [[induced subgraph]]s. For perfect graphs, it is possible to find a maximum clique in polynomial time, using an algorithm based on [[semidefinite programming]].{{sfnp|Grötschel|Lovász|Schrijver|1988}}
However, this method is complex and non-combinatorial, and specialized clique-finding algorithms have been developed for many subclasses of perfect graphs.{{sfnp|Golumbic|1980}} In the [[complement graph]]s of [[bipartite graph]]s, [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]] allows the maximum clique problem to be solved using techniques for [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]. In another class of perfect graphs, the [[permutation graph]]s, a maximum clique is a [[Longest increasing subsequence|longest decreasing subsequence]] of the permutation defining the graph and can be found using known algorithms for the longest decreasing subsequence problem. Conversely, every instance of the longest decreasing subsequence problem can be described equivalently as a problem of finding a maximum clique in a permutation graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|1980}}, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Even|Pnueli|Lempel|1972}} provide an alternative quadratic-time algorithm for maximum cliques in [[comparability graph]]s, a broader class of perfect graphs that includes the permutation graphs as a special case.{{sfnp|Even|Pnueli|Lempel|1972}} In [[chordal graph]]s, the maximal cliques can be found by listing the vertices in an elimination ordering, and checking the clique [[neighborhood (graph theory)|neighborhoods]] of each vertex in this ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Blair|Peyton|1993}}, Lemma 4.5, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, these algorithms can be extended to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a [[circle graph]], the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gavril|1973}}; {{harvtxt|Golumbic|1980}}, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a [[unit disk graph]] (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.{{sfnp|Clark|Colbourn|Johnson|1990}}

The algorithmic problem of finding a maximum clique in a [[random graph]] drawn from the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] (in which each edge appears with probability {{math|1/2}}, independently from the other edges) was suggested by {{harvtxt|Karp|1976}}. Because the maximum clique in a random graph has logarithmic size with high probability, it
can be found by a brute force search in expected time {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;{{italics correction|''O''}}(log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is a [[Time complexity|quasi-polynomial time bound]].{{sfnp|Song|2015}} Although the clique number of such graphs is usually very close to {{math|2&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''}}, simple [[greedy algorithm]]s as well as more sophisticated randomized approximation techniques only find cliques with size {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''}}, half as big. The number of maximal cliques in such graphs is with high probability exponential in {{math|log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''}}, which prevents methods that list all maximal cliques from running in polynomial time.{{sfnp|Jerrum|1992}} Because of the difficulty of this problem, several authors have investigated the [[planted clique]] problem, the clique problem on random graphs that have been augmented by adding large cliques.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009}}, Example 18.2, pp.&amp;nbsp;362–363.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Spectral graph theory|spectral methods]]{{sfnp|Alon|Krivelevich|Sudakov|1998}} and [[semidefinite programming]]{{sfnp|Feige|Krauthgamer|2000}} can detect hidden cliques of size {{math|Ω({{radic|''n''}})}}, no polynomial-time algorithms are currently known to detect those of size {{math|''o''({{radic|''n''}})}} (expressed using [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|little-o notation]]).{{sfnp|Meka|Potechin|Wigderson|2015}}

===Approximation algorithms===
Several authors have considered [[approximation algorithm]]s that attempt to find a clique or independent set that, although not maximum, has size as close to the maximum as can be found in polynomial time.
Although much of this work has focused on independent sets in sparse graphs, a case that does not make sense for the complementary clique problem, there has also been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Boppana|Halldórsson|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Feige|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Halldórsson|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Feige|2004}} describes a polynomial time algorithm that finds a clique of size {{math|Ω((log&amp;nbsp;''n''/log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} in any graph that has clique number {{math|Ω(''n''/log&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''n'')}} for any constant {{mvar|k}}. By using this algorithm when the clique number of a given input graph is between {{math|''n''/log&amp;nbsp;''n''}} and {{math|''n''/log&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''n''}}, switching to a different algorithm of {{harvtxt|Boppana|Halldórsson|1992}} for graphs with higher clique numbers, and choosing a two-vertex clique if both algorithms fail to find anything, [[Uriel Feige|Feige]] provides an approximation algorithm that finds a clique with a number of vertices within a factor of {{math|O(''n''(log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/log&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''n'')}} of the maximum. Although the [[approximation ratio]] of this algorithm is weak, it is the best known to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Liu|Lu|Yang|Xiao|2015}}: "In terms of the number of vertices in graphs, Feige shows the currently known best approximation ratio". Liu et al. are writing about the [[maximum independent set]] but for purposes of approximation there is no difference between the two problems.&lt;/ref&gt; The results on [[hardness of approximation]] described below suggest that there can be no approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio significantly less than linear.

==Lower bounds==

===NP-completeness===
[[File:Sat reduced to Clique from Sipser.svg|thumb|The 3-CNF Satisfiability instance (x&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;x&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;y) ∧ (~x&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;~y&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;~y) ∧ (~x&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;y&amp;#x202F;∨&amp;#x202F;y) reduced to Clique. The green vertices form a 3-clique and correspond to a satisfying assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from {{harvtxt|Sipser|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The clique decision problem is [[NP-complete]]. It was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|Richard Karp's original 21 problems]] shown NP-complete in his 1972 paper "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems".{{sfnp|Karp|1972}}  This problem was also mentioned in [[Stephen Cook]]'s paper introducing the theory of NP-complete problems.{{sfnp|Cook|1971}} Because of the hardness of the decision problem, the problem of finding a maximum clique is also NP-hard. If one could solve it, one could also solve the decision problem, by comparing the size of the maximum clique to the size parameter given as input in the decision problem.

Karp's NP-completeness proof is a [[many-one reduction]] from the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].
It describes how to translate Boolean formulas in [[conjunctive normal form]] (CNF) into equivalent instances of the maximum clique problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cook|1971}} gives essentially the same reduction, from [[3-SAT]] instead of Satisfiability, to show that [[subgraph isomorphism]] is NP-complete.&lt;/ref&gt;
Satisfiability, in turn, was proved NP-complete in the [[Cook–Levin theorem]]. From a given CNF formula, Karp forms a graph that has a vertex for every pair {{math|(''v'',''c'')}}, where {{mvar|v}} is a variable or its negation and {{mvar|c}} is a clause in the formula that contains {{mvar|v}}. Two of these vertices are connected by an edge if they represent compatible variable assignments for different clauses. That is, there is an edge from {{math|(''v'',''c'')}} to {{math|(''u'',''d'')}} whenever {{math|''c''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''d''}} and {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are not each other's negations. If {{mvar|k}} denotes the number of clauses in the CNF formula, then the {{mvar|k}}-vertex cliques in this graph represent consistent ways of assigning [[truth values]] to some of its variables in order to satisfy the formula. Therefore, the formula is satisfiable if and only if a {{mvar|k}}-vertex clique exists.{{sfnp|Karp|1972}}

Some NP-complete problems (such as the [[travelling salesman problem]] in [[planar graph]]s) may be solved in time that is exponential in a sublinear function of the input size parameter {{mvar|n}},
significantly faster than a brute-force search.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is unlikely that such a subexponential time bound is possible for the clique problem in arbitrary graphs, as it would imply similarly subexponential bounds for many other standard NP-complete problems.{{sfnp|Impagliazzo|Paturi|Zane|2001}}

===Circuit complexity===
[[File:Monotone circuit for 3-clique.svg|thumb|A monotone circuit to detect a {{mvar|k}}-clique in an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph for {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3}} and {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4}}. Each input to the circuit encodes the presence or absence of a particular (red) edge in the graph. The circuit uses one internal and-gate to detect each potential {{mvar|k}}-clique.]]
The computational difficulty of the clique problem has led it to be used to prove several lower bounds in [[circuit complexity]]. The existence of a clique of a given size is a [[Hereditary property|monotone graph property]], meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any [[Glossary of graph theory terms#supergraph|supergraph]]. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only [[and gate]]s and [[or gate]]s, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|Boppana|1987}}. For earlier and weaker bounds on monotone circuits for the clique problem, see {{harvtxt|Valiant|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Razborov|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a small number of [[NOT gate]]s are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Amano|Maruoka|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded [[fan-in]] must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Goldmann|Håstad|1992}} used [[communication complexity]] to prove this result.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision tree complexity===

[[File:Decision tree for 3-clique no arrowheads.svg|thumb|A simple decision tree to detect the presence of a 3-clique in a 4-vertex graph. It uses up to 6 questions of the form "Does the red edge exist?", matching the optimal bound ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2.]]
The (deterministic) [[decision tree complexity]] of determining a [[graph property]] is the number of questions of the form "Is there an edge between vertex {{mvar|u}} and vertex {{mvar|v}}?" that have to be answered in the worst case to determine whether a graph has a particular property. That is, it is the minimum height of a boolean [[Decision tree model|decision tree]] for the problem. There are {{math|''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2}} possible questions to be asked. Therefore, any graph property can be determined with at most {{math|''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2}} questions. It is also possible to define random and quantum decision tree complexity of a property, the expected number of questions (for a worst case input) that a randomized or quantum algorithm needs to have answered in order to correctly determine whether the given graph has the property.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009}}, Chapter 12, "Decision trees", pp. 259–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the property of containing a clique is monotone, it is covered by the [[Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture]], which states that the deterministic decision tree complexity of determining any non-trivial monotone graph property is exactly {{math|''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2}}. For arbitrary monotone graph properties, this conjecture remains unproven. However, for deterministic decision trees, and for any {{mvar|k}} in the range {{math|2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}},  the property of containing a {{mvar|k}}-clique was shown to have decision tree complexity exactly {{math|''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2}} by {{Harvtxt|Bollobás|1976}}. Deterministic decision trees also require exponential size to detect cliques, or large polynomial size to detect cliques of bounded size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wegener|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture also states that the randomized decision tree complexity of non-trivial monotone functions is {{math|Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. The conjecture again remains unproven, but has been resolved for the property of containing a {{mvar|k}} clique for {{math|2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}. This property is known to have randomized decision tree complexity {{math|Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, this follows from {{Harvtxt|Gröger|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For quantum decision trees, the best known lower bound is {{math|Ω(''n'')}}, but no matching algorithm is known for the case of {{math|''k'' ≥ 3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Childs|Eisenberg|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Magniez|Santha|Szegedy|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed-parameter intractability===
[[Parameterized complexity]] is the [[computational complexity theory|complexity-theoretic]] study of problems that are naturally equipped with a small integer parameter {{mvar|k}} and for which the problem becomes more difficult as {{mvar|k}} increases, such as finding {{mvar|k}}-cliques in graphs. A problem is said to be fixed-parameter tractable if there is an algorithm for solving it on inputs of size {{mvar|n}}, and a function {{mvar|f}}, such that the algorithm runs in time {{math|''f''(''k'')&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{italics correction|''O''}}(1)&lt;/sup&gt;}}. That is, it is fixed-parameter tractable if it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed value of {{mvar|k}} and moreover if the exponent of the polynomial does not depend on {{mvar|k}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Downey|Fellows|1999}}. Technically, there is usually an additional requirement that {{mvar|f}} be a [[computable function]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For finding {{mvar|k}}-vertex cliques, the brute force search algorithm has running time {{math|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Because the exponent of {{mvar|n}} depends on {{mvar|k}}, this algorithm is not fixed-parameter tractable.
Although it can be improved by fast matrix multiplication the running time still has an exponent that is linear in {{mvar|k}} Thus, although the running time of known algorithms for the clique problem is polynomial for any fixed {{mvar|k}} these algorithms do not suffice for fixed-parameter tractability. {{harvtxt|Downey|Fellows|1995}} defined a hierarchy of parametrized problems, the W hierarchy, that they conjectured did not have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. They proved that independent set (or, equivalently, clique) is hard for the first level of this hierarchy, [[W(1)|W[1]]]. Thus, according to their conjecture, clique has no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. Moreover, this result provides the basis for proofs of W[1]-hardness of many other problems, and thus serves as an analogue of the [[Cook–Levin theorem]] for parameterized complexity.{{sfnp|Downey|Fellows|1995}}

{{harvtxt|Chen|Huang|Kanj|Xia|2006}} showed that finding {{mvar|k}}-vertex cliques cannot be done in time {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;''o''(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} unless the [[exponential time hypothesis]] fails. Again, this provides evidence that no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is possible.{{sfnp|Chen|Huang|Kanj|Xia|2006}}

Although the problems of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques are unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter {{mvar|k}}, they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems are known to be fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] of the input graph.&lt;ref name="ELS10"&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|Löffler|Strash|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardness of approximation===
[[File:Cube-face-intersection-graph.svg|thumb|A graph of compatibility relations among 2-bit samples of 3-bit proof strings. Each maximal clique (triangle) in this graph represents all ways of sampling a single 3-bit string. The proof of inapproximability of the clique problem involves [[induced subgraph]]s of analogously defined graphs for larger numbers of bits.]]
Weak results hinting that the clique problem might be hard to approximate have been known for a long time. {{harvtxt|Garey|Johnson|1978}} observed that, because of the fact that the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme|fully polynomial-time approximation scheme]]. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s. They used these connections to prove [[hardness of approximation]] results for the maximum clique problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kolata|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Feige|Goldwasser|Lovász|Safra|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Arora|Safra|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Arora|Lund|Motwani|Sudan|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
After many improvements to these results it is now known that, for every [[real number]] {{math|''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}}, there can be no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique to within a factor better than {{math|{{italics correction|''O''}}(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, unless [[P versus NP problem|P = NP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Håstad|1999}} showed inapproximability for this ratio using a stronger complexity theoretic assumption, the inequality of [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]. {{harvtxt|Khot|2001}} described more precisely the inapproximability ratio, but with an even stronger assumption. {{harvtxt|Zuckerman|2006}} [[derandomization|derandomized]] the construction weakening its assumption to P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rough idea of these inapproximability results is to form a graph that represents a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof if and only if it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.&lt;ref name="inapprox-redux"/&gt;

To transform a probabilistically checkable proof system of this type into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined by one of the possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has only a small number of checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name="inapprox-redux"&gt;This reduction is originally due to {{harvtxt|Feige|Goldwasser|Lovász|Safra|1991}} and used in all subsequent inapproximability proofs; the proofs differ in the strengths and details of the probabilistically checkable proof systems that they rely on.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[actuarial science]] and [[financial economics]] there are a number of ways that risk can be defined; to clarify the concept theoreticians have described a number of properties that a [[risk measure]] might or might not have. A '''coherent risk measure''' is a function &lt;math&gt;\varrho&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies properties of [[monotonicity]], [[Sub-additive|sub-additivity]], [[homogeneity (statistics)|homogeneity]], and [[translational invariance]].

==Properties==
Consider a random outcome &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; viewed as an element of a linear space &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; of measurable functions, defined on an appropriate probability space. A [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] &lt;math&gt;\varrho : \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;\R \cup \{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be coherent risk measure for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; if it satisfies the following properties:&lt;ref name="Artzner"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-9965.00068| title = Coherent Measures of Risk| year = 1999| last1 = Artzner | first1 = P. | last2 = Delbaen | first2 = F. | last3 = Eber | first3 = J. M. | last4 = Heath | first4 = D. | journal = Mathematical Finance| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normalized===
: &lt;math&gt;\varrho(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
That is, the risk of holding no assets is zero.

===Monotonicity===
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\; Z_1,Z_2 \in \mathcal{L} \;\mathrm{and}\; Z_1 \leq Z_2 \; \mathrm{a.s.} ,\; \mathrm{then} \; \varrho(Z_1) \geq \varrho(Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;
That is, if portfolio &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; always has better values than portfolio &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; under [[almost surely|almost all]] scenarios then the risk of &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; should be less than the risk of &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilmott|first=P.|year=2006|title=Quantitative Finance|publisher=Wiley|edition=2|volume=1|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.g. If &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; is an in the money call option (or otherwise) on a stock, and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; is also an in the money call option with a lower strike price. 
In financial risk management, monotonicity implies a portfolio with greater future returns has less risk.

===Sub-additivity===
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\; Z_1,Z_2 \in \mathcal{L} ,\; \mathrm{then}\; \varrho(Z_1 + Z_2) \leq \varrho(Z_1) + \varrho(Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, the risk of two portfolios together cannot get any worse than adding the two risks separately: this is the [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] principle.
In financial risk management, sub-additivity implies diversification is beneficial.  

===Positive homogeneity===
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\; \alpha \ge 0 \; \mathrm{and} \; Z \in \mathcal{L} ,\; \mathrm{then} \; \varrho(\alpha Z) = \alpha \varrho(Z)&lt;/math&gt;
Loosely speaking, if you double your portfolio then you double your risk.
In financial risk management, positive homogeneity implies the risk of a position is proportional to its size.

===Translation invariance===
If &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; is a deterministic portfolio with guaranteed return &lt;math&gt; a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Z \in \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; then
: &lt;math&gt;\varrho(Z + A) = \varrho(Z) - a &lt;/math&gt;
The portfolio &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; is just adding cash &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to your portfolio &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if  &lt;math&gt;a=\varrho(Z)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\varrho(Z+A)=0&lt;/math&gt;. 
In financial risk management, translation invariance implies that the addition of a sure amount of [[capital (economics)|capital]] reduces the risk by the same amount.

===Convex risk measures===
The notion of coherence has been subsequently relaxed. Indeed, the notions of Sub-additivity and Positive Homogeneity can be replaced by the notion of [[convex function|convexity]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Föllmer|first=H.|last2=Schied|first2=A.|year=2002|title=Convex measures of risk and trading constraints|journal=Finance and Stochastics|volume=6|issue=4|pages=429–447|doi=10.1007/s007800200072}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Convexity
: &lt;math&gt;\text{If }Z_1,Z_2 \in \mathcal{L}\text{ and }\lambda \in [0,1] \text{ then }\varrho(\lambda Z_1 + (1-\lambda) Z_2) \leq \lambda \varrho(Z_1) + (1-\lambda) \varrho(Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of risk measure==
=== Value at risk ===

It is well known that [[value at risk]] '''is not''' a coherent risk measure as it does not respect the sub-additivity property. An immediate consequence is that [[value at risk]] might discourage diversification.&lt;ref name="Artzner"/&gt;
[[Value at risk]] is, however, coherent, under the assumption of [[Elliptical distribution|elliptically distributed]] losses (e.g. [[normally distributed]]) when the portfolio value is a linear function of the asset prices. However, in this case the value at risk becomes equivalent to a mean-variance approach where the risk of a portfolio is measured by the variance of the portfolio's return.

The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the Value at Risk is &lt;math&gt;  g(x)=\mathbf{1}_{x\geq 1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The non-concavity of &lt;math&gt;  g&lt;/math&gt;  proves the non coherence of this risk measure.

;Illustration

As a simple example to demonstrate the non-coherence of value-at-risk consider looking at the VaR of a portfolio at 95% confidence over the next year of two default-able zero coupon bonds that mature in 1 years time denominated in our numeraire currency.

Assume the following:
* The current yield on the two bonds is 0%
* The two bonds are from different issuers
* Each bond has a 4% [[probability of default]]ing over the next year
* The event of default in either bond is independent of the other
* Upon default the bonds have a recovery rate of 30%

Under these conditions the 95% VaR for holding either of the bonds is 0 since the probability of default is less than 5%. However if we held a portfolio that consisted of 50% of each bond by value then the 95% VaR is 35% (= 0.5*0.7 + 0.5*0) since the probability of at least one of the bonds defaulting is 7.84% which exceeds 5%. This violates the sub-additivity property showing that VaR is not a coherent risk measure.

===Average value at risk===
The average value at risk (sometimes called [[expected shortfall]] or conditional value-at-risk or &lt;math&gt;AVaR&lt;/math&gt;) is a coherent risk measure, even though it is derived from Value at Risk which is not.  The domain can be extended for more general Orlitz Hearts from the more typical [[Lp space]]s.&lt;ref name=cheridito&gt;{{cite journal|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entropic value at risk===
The [[entropic value at risk]] is a coherent risk measure.&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=Entropic value-at-risk: A new coherent risk measure|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|year=2012|volume=155|pages=1105–1123|doi=10.1007/s10957-011-9968-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tail value at risk===
The [[tail value at risk]] (or tail conditional expectation) is a coherent risk measure only when the underlying distribution is [[continuous distribution|continuous]].

The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the [[tail value at risk]] is &lt;math&gt;  g(x)=\min(\frac{x}{\alpha},1)&lt;/math&gt;. The concavity of &lt;math&gt;  g&lt;/math&gt;  proves the coherence of this risk measure in the case of continuous distribution.

===Proportional Hazard (PH) risk measure ===
The PH risk measure (or Proportional Hazard Risk measure) transforms the hazard rates &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left( \lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{\bar{F}(t)}\right)&lt;/math&gt; using a  coefficient &lt;math&gt; \xi&lt;/math&gt;.

The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the PH risk measure is &lt;math&gt;  g_{\alpha}(x) = x^{\xi} &lt;/math&gt;. The concavity of &lt;math&gt;  g&lt;/math&gt;  if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \xi&lt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; proves the coherence of this risk measure.

===g-Entropic risk measures===
[[g-entropic risk measure]]s are a class of information-theoretic coherent risk measures that involve some important cases such as CVaR and EVaR.&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2 /&gt;

===The Wang risk measure=== 

The Wang risk measure is defined by the following Wang transform function (distortion function)  &lt;math&gt;  g_{\alpha}(x)=\Phi\left[ \Phi^{-1}(x)-\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)\right]&lt;/math&gt;. The coherence of this risk measure is a consequence of the concavity of &lt;math&gt;  g&lt;/math&gt;.

===Entropic risk measure===
The [[entropic risk measure]] is a convex risk measure which is not coherent.  It is related to the [[exponential utility]].

===Superhedging price===
The [[superhedging price]] is a coherent risk measure.

==Set-valued==
In a situation with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;-valued portfolios such that risk can be measured in &lt;math&gt;n \leq d&lt;/math&gt; of the assets, then a set of portfolios is the proper way to depict risk.

;Wang transform of the cumulative distribution function

A Wang transform of the cumulative distribution function  is an increasing function &lt;math&gt; g \colon [0,1] \rightarrow  [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; g(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; g(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Shuan|year=1996|title=Premium Calculation by Transforming the Layer Premium Density|journal=ASTIN Bulletin|volume=26|issue=1|pages=71–92|doi=10.2143/ast.26.1.563234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This function is called ''distortion function'' or Wang transform function.

The ''dual distortion function'' is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(x) = 1 - g(1-x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="PropertiesDRM"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balbás | first1 = A. | last2 = Garrido | first2 = J. | last3 = Mayoral | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1007/s11009-008-9089-z | title = Properties of Distortion Risk Measures | journal = Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 385 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wirch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distortion Risk Measures: Coherence and Stochastic Dominance|author=Julia L.

Given a [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt;, then for any [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and any distortion function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; we can define a new [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; it follows that
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(A) = g(\mathbb{P}(X \in A)).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="PropertiesDRM"/&gt;

;Actuarial premium principle

For any increasing concave Wang transform function, we could define a corresponding premium principle :&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \varrho(X)=\int_0^{+\infty}g\left(\bar{F}_X(x)\right) dx&lt;/math&gt;

;Coherent risk measure 

A coherent risk measure  could be defined by a Wang transform of the cumulative distribution function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if  &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  is concave.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

===Set-valued convex risk measure===
If instead of the sublinear property,''R'' is convex, then ''R'' is a set-valued convex risk measure.

==Dual representation==
A [[lower semi-continuous]] convex risk measure &lt;math&gt;\varrho&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as
: &lt;math&gt;\varrho(X) = \sup_{Q \in \mathcal{M}(P)} \{E^Q[-X] - \alpha(Q)\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Penalty function (risk)|penalty function]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of probability measures [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to ''P'' (the "real world" [[probability measure]]), i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P) = \{Q \ll P\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The dual characterization is tied to &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt; [[Lp space|spaces]], Orlitz hearts, and their dual spaces.&lt;ref name=cheridito/&gt;

A [[lower semi-continuous]] risk measure is coherent if and only if it can be represented as
: &lt;math&gt;\varrho(X) = \sup_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}} E^Q[-X]&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q} \subseteq \mathcal{M}(P)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hans|last1=Föllmer|first2=Alexander|last2=Schied|title=Stochastic finance: an introduction in discrete time|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|edition=2|isbn=978-3-11-018346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[elementary algebra]], '''completing the square''' is a technique for converting a [[quadratic polynomial]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;

to the form

: &lt;math&gt; a(x - h)^2 + k&lt;/math&gt;

for some values of ''h'' and ''k''.

Completing the square is used in
* solving [[quadratic equation]]s,
* graphing [[quadratic function]]s,
* evaluating [[integral]]s in calculus, such as [[Gaussian integral]]s with a linear term in the exponent,
* finding [[Laplace transform]]s.

In mathematics, completing the square is often applied in any computation involving quadratic polynomials. Completing the square is also used to derive the [[quadratic formula]].

==Overview==

===Background===
There is a simple formula in [[elementary algebra]] for computing the [[square (algebra)|square]] of a [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(x + p)^2 \,=\, x^2 + 2px + p^2.&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
(x+3)^2 \,&amp;=\, x^2 + 6x + 9 &amp;&amp; (p=3)\\[3pt]
(x-5)^2 \,&amp;=\, x^2 - 10x + 25\qquad &amp;&amp; (p=-5).
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

In any perfect square, the [[coefficient]] of ''x'' is twice the number ''p'', and the [[constant term]] is equal to ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Basic example===
Consider the following quadratic [[polynomial]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 10x + 28.&lt;/math&gt;

This quadratic is not a perfect square, since 28 is not the square of 5:

:&lt;math&gt;(x+5)^2 \,=\, x^2 + 10x + 25.&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 10x + 28 \,=\, (x+5)^2 + 3.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called '''completing the square'''.

===General description===
Given any [[Monic polynomial|monic]] quadratic

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + bx + c,&lt;/math&gt;

it is possible to form a square that has the same first two terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+\tfrac{1}{2} b\right)^2 \,=\, x^2 + bx + \tfrac{1}{4}b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This square differs from the original quadratic only in the value of the constant
term. Therefore, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + bx + c \,=\, \left(x + \tfrac{1}{2}b\right)^2 + k,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k \,=\, c - \frac{b^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;. This operation is known as '''completing the square'''.
For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{1}
x^2 + 6x + 11 \,&amp;=\, (x+3)^2 + 2 \\[3pt]
x^2 + 14x + 30 \,&amp;=\, (x+7)^2 - 19 \\[3pt]
x^2 - 2x + 7 \,&amp;=\, (x-1)^2 + 6.
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-monic case===
Given a quadratic polynomial of the form
:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
it is possible to factor out the coefficient ''a'', and then complete the square for the resulting [[monic polynomial]].

Example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  3x^2 + 12x + 27 &amp;= 3(x^2+4x+9)\\
          &amp;{}= 3\left((x+2)^2 + 5\right)\\
          &amp;{}= 3(x+2)^2 + 15
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This allows us to write any quadratic polynomial in the form
:&lt;math&gt;a(x-h)^2 + k.&lt;/math&gt;

===Formula===
====Algebraic case====
The result of completing the square may be written as a formula. For the general case:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Precalculus: Building Concepts and Connections
|first1=Revathi
|last1=Narasimhan
|publisher=Cengage Learning
|year=2008
|isbn=0-618-41301-4

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c \;=\; a(x-h)^2 + k,\quad\text{where}\quad h = -\frac{b}{2a} \quad\text{and}\quad k = c - ah^2 = c - \frac{b^2}{4a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Specifically, when ''a''=1:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + bx + c \;=\; (x-h)^2 + k,\quad\text{where}\quad h = -\frac{b}{2} \quad\text{and}\quad k = c - \frac{b^2}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Matrix case====
The matrix case looks very similar:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\mathrm{T}}Ax + x^{\mathrm{T}}b + c = (x - h)^{\mathrm{T}}A(x - h) + k \quad\text{where}\quad h = -\frac{1}{2}A^{-1}b \quad\text{and}\quad k = c - \frac{1}{4}b^{\mathrm{T}}A^{-1}b&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has to be symmetric.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetric the formulae for &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; have
to be generalized to:

:&lt;math&gt;h = -(A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b \quad\text{and}\quad k = c - h^{\mathrm{T}}A h = c - b^{\mathrm{T}} (A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1} A (A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b&lt;/math&gt;.

}}
In [[analytic geometry]], the graph of any [[quadratic function]] is a [[parabola]] in the ''xy''-plane. Given a quadratic polynomial of the form

:&lt;math&gt;(x-h)^2 + k \quad\text{or}\quad a(x-h)^2 + k&lt;/math&gt;

the numbers ''h'' and ''k'' may be interpreted as the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the [[Vertex (curve)|vertex]] (or [[stationary point]]) of the parabola. That is, ''h'' is the ''x''-coordinate of the axis of symmetry (i.e. the axis of symmetry has equation ''x=h''), and ''k'' is the [[maxima and minima|minimum value]] (or maximum value, if ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0) of the quadratic function.

One way to see this is to note that the graph of the function ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a parabola whose vertex is at the origin&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;0). Therefore, the graph of the function ''&amp;fnof;''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''h'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''h'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a parabola shifted to the right by ''h'' whose vertex is at (''h'',&amp;nbsp;0), as shown in the top figure. In contrast, the graph of the function ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'' =&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'' is a parabola shifted upward by ''k'' whose vertex is at (0,&amp;nbsp;''k''), as shown in the center figure. Combining both horizontal and vertical shifts yields ''&amp;fnof;''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''h'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'' =&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''h'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'' is a parabola shifted to the right by ''h'' and upward by ''k'' whose vertex is at (''h'',&amp;nbsp;''k''), as shown in the bottom figure.

==Solving quadratic equations==
Completing the square may be used to solve any [[Quadratic equation#By completing the square|quadratic equation]]. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to complete the square:

:&lt;math&gt;(x+3)^2 - 4 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Next we solve for the squared term:

:&lt;math&gt;(x+3)^2 = 4.&lt;/math&gt;

Then either

:&lt;math&gt;x+3 = -2 \quad\text{or}\quad x+3 = 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;x = -5 \quad\text{or}\quad x = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be applied to any quadratic equation. When the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a coefficient other than 1, the first step is to divide out the equation by this coefficient: for an example see the non-monic case below.

===Irrational and complex roots===
Unlike methods involving [[factorization|factoring]] the equation, which is reliable only if the roots are [[Rational number|rational]], completing the square will find the roots of a quadratic equation even when those roots are [[irrational number|irrational]] or [[Complex number|complex]]. For example, consider the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - 10x + 18 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Completing the square gives

:&lt;math&gt;(x-5)^2 - 7 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;(x-5)^2 = 7.&lt;/math&gt;

Then either

:&lt;math&gt;x-5 = -\sqrt{7} \quad\text{or}\quad x-5 = \sqrt{7},&lt;/math&gt;

In terser language:

:&lt;math&gt;x-5 = \pm \sqrt{7}.&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;x = 5 \pm \sqrt{7}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equations with complex roots can be handled in the same way. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
x^2 + 4x + 5 \,=\, 0 \\[6pt]
(x+2)^2 + 1 \,=\, 0 \\[6pt]
(x+2)^2 \,=\, -1 \\[6pt]
x+2 \,=\, \pm i \\[6pt]
x \,=\, -2 \pm i.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-monic case===
For an equation involving a non-monic quadratic, the first step to solving them is to divide through by the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
2x^2 + 7x + 6 \,=\, 0 \\[6pt]
x^2 + \tfrac{7}{2}x + 3 \,=\, 0 \\[6pt]
\left(x+\tfrac{7}{4}\right)^2 - \tfrac{1}{16} \,=\, 0 \\[6pt]
\left(x+\tfrac{7}{4}\right)^2 \,=\, \tfrac{1}{16} \\[6pt]
x+\tfrac{7}{4} = \tfrac{1}{4} \quad\text{or}\quad x+\tfrac{7}{4} = -\tfrac{1}{4} \\[6pt]
x = -\tfrac{3}{2} \quad\text{or}\quad x = -2.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this procedure to the general form of a quadratic equation leads to the [[Quadratic formula#Derivation of the formula|quadratic formula]].

==Other applications==

===Integration===
Completing the square may be used to evaluate any integral of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{ax^2+bx+c}&lt;/math&gt;

using the basic integrals

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{x^2 - a^2} = \frac{1}{2a}\ln\left|\frac{x-a}{x+a}\right| +C \quad\text{and}\quad
\int\frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} = \frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) +C.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{x^2 + 6x + 13}.&lt;/math&gt;

Completing the square in the denominator gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 4} \,=\, \int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 2^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can now be evaluated by using the [[integration by substitution|substitution]]
''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3, which yields

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 4} \,=\, \frac{1}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{x+3}{2}\right)+C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex numbers===
Consider the expression

:&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 - b^*z - bz^* + c,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' and ''b'' are [[complex number]]s, ''z''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[complex conjugate]]s of ''z'' and ''b'', respectively, and ''c'' is a [[real number]]. Using the identity |''u''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''uu''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; we can rewrite this as

:&lt;math&gt; |z-b|^2 - |b|^2 + c , &lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly a real quantity. This is because

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  |z-b|^2 &amp;{}=  (z-b)(z-b)^*\\
          &amp;{}=  (z-b)(z^*-b^*)\\
          &amp;{}= zz^* - zb^* - bz^* + bb^*\\
          &amp;{}=  |z|^2 - zb^* - bz^* + |b|^2 .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As another example, the expression

:&lt;math&gt; ax^2 + by^2 + c , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''x'', and ''y'' are real numbers, with ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, may be expressed in terms of the square of the [[absolute value]] of a complex number. Define

:&lt;math&gt; z = \sqrt{a}\,x + i \sqrt{b} \,y . &lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  |z|^2 &amp;{}= z z^*\\
        &amp;{}= (\sqrt{a}\,x + i \sqrt{b}\,y)(\sqrt{a}\,x - i \sqrt{b}\,y) \\
        &amp;{}= ax^2 - i\sqrt{ab}\,xy + i\sqrt{ba}\,yx - i^2by^2 \\
        &amp;{}= ax^2 + by^2 ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt; ax^2 + by^2 + c = |z|^2 + c . &lt;/math&gt;

===Idempotent matrix===
A [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' is [[idempotent matrix|idempotent]] when ''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''M''. Idempotent matrices generalize the idempotent properties of 0 and 1. The completion of the square method of addressing the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = a ,&lt;/math&gt;
shows that some idempotent 2 × 2 matrices are parametrized by a [[circle]] in the (''a,b'')-plane:

The matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b \\ b &amp; 1-a \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; will be idempotent provided &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = a ,&lt;/math&gt; which, upon completing the square, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;(a - \tfrac{1}{2})^2 + b^2 = \tfrac{1}{4} .&lt;/math&gt;
In the (''a,b'')-plane, this is the equation of a circle with center (1/2, 0) and radius 1/2.

==Geometric perspective==
[[Image:Completing the square.svg|right|250px]]

Consider completing the square for the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + bx = a.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; represents the area of a square with side of length ''x'', and ''bx'' represents the area of a rectangle with sides ''b'' and ''x'', the process of completing the square can be viewed as visual manipulation of rectangles.

Simple attempts to combine the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the ''bx'' rectangles into a larger square result in a missing corner. The term (''b''/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; added to each side of the above equation is precisely the area of the missing corner, whence derives the terminology "completing the square".

==A variation on the technique==
As conventionally taught, completing the square consists of adding the third term, ''v''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; to

:&lt;math&gt;u^2 + 2uv&lt;/math&gt;

to get a square. There are also cases in which one can add the middle term, either 2''uv'' or &amp;minus;2''uv'', to

:&lt;math&gt;u^2 + v^2&lt;/math&gt;

to get a square.

===Example: the sum of a positive number and its reciprocal===
By writing

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x + {1 \over x} &amp;{} = \left(x - 2 + {1 \over x}\right) + 2\\
                &amp;{}= \left(\sqrt{x} - {1 \over \sqrt{x}}\right)^2 + 2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

we show that the sum of a positive number ''x'' and its reciprocal is always greater than or equal to 2. The square of a real expression is always greater than or equal to zero, which gives the stated bound; and here we achieve 2 just when ''x'' is 1, causing the square to vanish.

===Example: factoring a simple quartic polynomial===
Consider the problem of factoring the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;x^4 + 324 . &lt;/math&gt;

This is

:&lt;math&gt;(x^2)^2 + (18)^2, &lt;/math&gt;

so the middle term is 2(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(18)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;36''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x^4 + 324 &amp;{}= (x^4 + 36x^2 + 324 ) - 36x^2  \\
&amp;{}= (x^2 + 18)^2 - (6x)^2 =\text{a difference of two squares} \\
&amp;{}= (x^2 + 18 + 6x)(x^2 + 18 - 6x) \\
&amp;{}= (x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(the last line being added merely to follow the convention of decreasing degrees of terms).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''Controlled Cryptographic Item''' (CCI) is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Security Agency]] term for secure telecommunications or information handling equipment, associated [[cryptography|cryptographic]] component or other hardware item which performs a critical [[communications security]] (COMSEC) function. Items so designated may be unclassified but are subject to special accounting controls and required markings.

Part of the physical security protection given to COMSEC equipment and material is afforded by its special handling and accounting. CCI equipment must be controlled in a manner that affords protection at least equal to that normally provided other high value equipment, such as money, computers, and [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]]-controlled. There are two separate channels used for the handling of such equipment and materials: "the COMSEC channel" and "the administrative channel." The COMSEC channel, called the COMSEC Material Control System, is used to distribute accountable COMSEC items such as [[Classified information|classified]] and CCI equipment, [[key (cryptography)|keying material]], and maintenance manuals. Some military departments have been authorized to distribute CCI equipment through their standard [[logistics]] system.

The COMSEC channel is composed of a series of COMSEC accounts, each of which has an appointed [[COMSEC Custodian]] who is personally responsible and accountable for all COMSEC materials charged to his/her account. The COMSEC Custodian assumes accountability for the equipment or material upon receipt, then controls its dissemination to authorized individuals on job requirements and a need-to-know basis. The administrative channel is used to distribute COMSEC information other than that which is accountable in the COMSEC Material Control System.

Persons with access to COMSEC materials are asked, among other restrictions, to avoid unapproved travel to any countries which are adversaries of the United States, or their establishments or facilities within the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2625.pdf U.S. DOD Controlled Cryptographic Item Briefing Form DD2625]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17681">'''Detection theory''' or '''signal detection theory''' is a means to measure the ability to differentiate between information-bearing patterns (called [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] in living organisms, [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (called [[Noise (electronics)|noise]], consisting of background stimuli and random activity of the detection machine and of the nervous system of the operator). In the field of [[electronics]], the separation of such patterns from a disguising background is referred to as '''''signal recovery'''''.&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst&gt;
{{cite book |title=Signal Recovery from Noise in Electronic Instrumentation |author=T. H. Wilmshurst |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49hfsIPpGwYC&amp;pg=PP11 |pages=11 ''ff'' |isbn=0-7503-0058-2 |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press |year=1990}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, there are a number of determiners of how a detecting system will detect a signal, and where its threshold levels will be. The theory can explain how changing the threshold will affect the ability to discern, often exposing how adapted the system is to the task, purpose or goal at which it is aimed.

Another field which is closely related to signal detection theory is called '''''[[compressed sensing]]''''' (or compressive sensing). The objective of compressed sensing is to recover high dimensional but with low complexity entities from only a few measurements. Thus, one of the most important applications of compressed sensing is in the recovery of high dimensional signals  which are known to be sparse (or nearly sparse) with only a few linear measurements. The number of measurements needed in the recovery of signals is by far smaller than what Nyquist sampling theorem requires provided that the signal is sparse, meaning that it only contains a few non-zero elements. There are different methods of signal recovery in compressed sensing including '''''[[basis pursuit]]''''' , '''''expander recovery algorithm'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafarpour|first=S.|last2=Xu|first2=W.|last3=Hassibi|first3=B.|last4=Calderbank|first4=R.|date=September 2009|title=Efficient and Robust Compressed Sensing Using Optimized Expander Graphs|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5208528/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=55|issue=9|pages=4299–4308|doi=10.1109/tit.2009.2025528|issn=0018-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt;''''', CoSaMP''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needell|first=D.|last2=Tropp|first2=J.A.|title=CoSaMP: Iterative signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate samples|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2008.07.002|journal=Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis|volume=26|issue=3|pages=301–321|doi=10.1016/j.acha.2008.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;and also '''''fast''''' '''''non-iterative algorithm'''''&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi, M.; Vidyasagar, M."[[arxiv:1708.03608|A Fast Noniterative Algorithm for Compressive Sensing Using Binary Measurement Matrices]]". &lt;/ref&gt;. In all of the recovery methods mentioned above, choosing an appropriate measurement matrix using probabilistic constructions or deterministic constructions, is of great importance. In other words, measurement matrices must satisfy certain specific conditions such as '''''[[Restricted isometry property|RIP]]''''' (Restricted Isometry Property) or '''''[[Nullspace property|Null-Space property]]''''' in order to achieve robust sparse recovery.

Back to the detecting theory, when the detecting system is a human being, characteristics such as experience, expectations, physiological state (e.g., fatigue) and other factors can affect the threshold applied.  For instance, a sentry in wartime might be likely to detect fainter stimuli than the same sentry in peacetime due to a lower criterion, however they might also be more likely to treat innocuous stimuli as a threat.

Much of the early work in detection theory was done by [[radar]] researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Detection theory was used in 1966 by [[John A. Swets]] and David M. Green for [[psychophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Swets, J.A. (ed.) (1964) ''Signal detection and recognition by human observers''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Green and [[John A. Swets|Swets]] criticized the traditional methods of psychophysics for their inability to discriminate between the real sensitivity of subjects and their (potential) [[response bias]]es.&lt;ref name="Green&amp;Swets"&gt;Green, D.M., Swets J.A. (1966) ''Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics''. New York: Wiley. ({{ISBN|0-471-32420-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Detection theory has applications in many fields such as [[diagnostics]] of any kind, [[quality control]], [[telecommunications]], and [[psychology]].  The concept is similar to the [[signal to noise ratio]] used in the sciences and [[confusion matrix|confusion matrices]] used in [[artificial intelligence]]. It is also usable in [[alarm management]], where it is important to separate important events from [[background noise|background]] [[noise (environmental)|noise]].

==Psychology==
Signal detection theory (SDT) is used when psychologists want to measure the way we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty, such as how we would perceive distances in foggy conditions or during [[eyewitness identification]]&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215602267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/dissertations/AAI3169457/&lt;/ref&gt;. SDT assumes that the decision maker is not a passive receiver of information, but an active decision-maker who makes difficult perceptual judgments under conditions of uncertainty. In foggy circumstances, we are forced to decide how far away from us an object is, based solely upon visual stimulus which is impaired by the fog. Since the brightness of the object, such as a traffic light, is used by the brain to discriminate the distance of an object, and the fog reduces the brightness of objects, we perceive the object to be much farther away than it actually is (see also [[decision theory]]). According to SDT, during eyewitness identifications, witnesses base their decision as to whether a suspect is the culprit or not based on their perceived level of familiarity with the suspect.

To apply signal detection theory to a data set where stimuli were either present or absent, and the observer categorized each trial as having the stimulus present or absent, the trials are sorted into one of four categories:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Respond "Absent"
! Respond "Present"
|-
! Stimulus Present
| [[Type 1 error#Type I and type II errors|Miss]]
| Hit
|-
! Stimulus Absent
| Correct Rejection
| [[Type 1 error#Type I and type II errors|False Alarm]]
|}

Based on the proportions of these types of trials, numerical estimates of sensitivity can be obtained with statistics like the [[sensitivity index|sensitivity index ''d''']] and A',&lt;ref name="Stanislaw 1999 137–49"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanislaw|first=H|author2=Todorov, N|title=Calculation of signal detection theory measures.|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers |date=February 1999|volume=31|issue=1|pages=137–49|pmid=10495845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and response bias can be estimated with statistics like c and β.&lt;ref name="Stanislaw 1999 137–49"/&gt;

Signal detection theory can also be applied to memory experiments, where items are presented on a study list for later testing. A test list is created by combining these 'old' items with novel, 'new' items that did not appear on the study list. On each test trial the subject will respond 'yes, this was on the study list' or 'no, this was not on the study list'. Items presented on the study list are called Targets, and new items are called Distractors. Saying 'Yes' to a target constitutes a Hit, while saying 'Yes' to a distractor constitutes a False Alarm.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Respond "No"
! Respond "Yes"
|-
! Target
| [[Type 1 error#Type I and type II errors|Miss]]
| Hit
|-
! Distractor
| Correct Rejection
| [[Type 1 error#Type I and type II errors|False Alarm]]
|}

== Applications ==

Signal Detection Theory has wide application, both in humans and [[Comparative psychology|animals]].  Topics include [[memory]], stimulus characterists of schedules of reinforcement, etc.

=== Sensitivity or discriminability ===

Conceptually, sensitivity refers to how hard or easy it is to detect that a target stimulus is present from background events. For example, in a recognition memory paradigm, having longer to study to-be-remembered words makes it easier to recognize previously seen or heard words. In contrast, having to remember 30 words rather than 5 makes the discrimination harder.  One of the most commonly used statistics for computing sensitivity is the so-called [[sensitivity index]] or ''d'''.  There are also [[non-parametric]] measures, such as the area under the [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC-curve]].&lt;ref name="Green&amp;Swets"/&gt;

=== Bias ===

Bias is the extent to which one response is more probable than another. That is, a receiver may be more likely to respond that a stimulus is present or more likely to respond that a stimulus is not present. Bias is independent of sensitivity. For example, if there is a penalty for either false alarms or misses, this may influence bias. If the stimulus is a bomber, then a miss (failing to detect the plane) may increase deaths, so a liberal bias is likely. In contrast, [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|crying wolf]] (a false alarm) too often may make people less likely to respond, grounds for a conservative bias.

==Mathematics==

=== P(H1|y) &gt; P(H2|y) / MAP testing ===
In the case of making a decision between two [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], ''H1'', absent, and ''H2'', present, in the event of a particular [[observation]], ''y'', a classical approach is to choose ''H1'' when ''p(H1|y) &gt; p(H2|y)'' and ''H2'' in the reverse case.&lt;ref name=Schonhoff&gt;Schonhoff, T.A. and Giordano, A.A. (2006) ''Detection and Estimation Theory and Its Applications''. New Jersey: Pearson Education ({{ISBN|0-13-089499-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that the two ''[[a posteriori]]'' [[probability|probabilities]] are equal, one might choose to default to a single choice (either always choose ''H1'' or always choose ''H2''), or might randomly select either ''H1'' or ''H2''. The ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' probabilities of ''H1'' and ''H2'' can guide this choice, e.g. by always choosing the hypothesis with the higher ''a priori'' probability.

When taking this approach, usually what one knows are the conditional probabilities, ''p(y|H1)'' and ''p(y|H2)'', and the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(H1) = \pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(H2) = \pi_2&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case,

&lt;math&gt;p(H1|y) = \frac{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1}{p(y)} &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;p(H2|y) = \frac{p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2}{p(y)} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p(y)'' is the total probability of event ''y'',

&lt;math&gt; p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

''H2'' is chosen in case

&lt;math&gt; \frac{p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2}{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2} \ge \frac{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1}{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)} \ge \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''H1'' otherwise.

Often, the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2}&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\tau_{MAP}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)}&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;L(y)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''[[Likelihood function|likelihood ratio]]''.

Using this terminology, ''H2'' is chosen in case &lt;math&gt;L(y) \ge \tau_{MAP}&lt;/math&gt;.  This is called MAP testing, where MAP stands for "maximum ''a posteriori''").

Taking this approach minimizes the expected number of errors one will make.

===Bayes criterion===

In some cases, it is far more important to respond appropriately to ''H1'' than it is to respond appropriately to ''H2''.  For example, if an alarm goes off, indicating H1 (an incoming bomber is carrying a [[nuclear weapon]]), it is much more important to shoot down the bomber if H1 = TRUE, than it is to avoid sending a fighter squadron to inspect a [[false alarm]] (i.e., H1 = FALSE, H2 = TRUE) (assuming a large supply of fighter squadrons).  The [[Thomas Bayes|Bayes]] criterion is an approach suitable for such cases.&lt;ref name=Schonhoff/&gt;

Here a [[utility]] is associated with each of four situations:
* &lt;math&gt;U_{11}&lt;/math&gt;:  One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H1 is true: fighters destroy bomber, incurring fuel, maintenance, and weapons costs, take risk of some being shot down;
* &lt;math&gt;U_{12}&lt;/math&gt;:  One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H2 is true: fighters sent out, incurring fuel and maintenance costs, bomber location remains unknown;
* &lt;math&gt;U_{21}&lt;/math&gt;:  One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H1 is true: city destroyed;
* &lt;math&gt;U_{22}&lt;/math&gt;:  One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H2 is true: fighters stay home, bomber location remains unknown;

As is shown below, what is important are the differences, &lt;math&gt;U_{11} - U_{21}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{22} - U_{12}&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, there are four probabilities, &lt;math&gt;P_{11}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., for each of the cases (which are dependent on one's decision strategy).

The Bayes criterion approach is to maximize the expected utility:

&lt;math&gt; U = P_{11} \cdot U_{11} + P_{21} \cdot U_{21} + P_{12} \cdot U_{12} + P_{22} \cdot U_{22} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; U = P_{11} \cdot U_{11} + (1-P_{11}) \cdot U_{21} + P_{12} \cdot U_{12} + (1-P_{12}) \cdot U_{22} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; U = U_{21} + U_{22} + P_{11} \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) - P_{12} \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) &lt;/math&gt;

Effectively, one may maximize the sum,

&lt;math&gt;U' = P_{11} \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) - P_{12} \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) &lt;/math&gt;,

and make the following substitutions:

&lt;math&gt;P_{11} = \pi_1 \cdot \int_{R_1}p(y|H1)\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{12} = \pi_2 \cdot \int_{R_1}p(y|H2)\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; are the ''a priori'' probabilities, &lt;math&gt;P(H1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(H2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is the region of observation events, ''y'', that are responded to as though ''H1'' is true.

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow U' = \int_{R_1} \left \{ \pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) \cdot p(y|H1) - \pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) \right \} \, dy &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are maximized by extending &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; over the region where

&lt;math&gt;\pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) \cdot p(y|H1) - \pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is accomplished by deciding H2 in case

&lt;math&gt;\pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) \ge \pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) \cdot p(y|H1) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow L(y) \equiv \frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)} \ge \frac{\pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21})}{\pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12})} \equiv \tau_B &lt;/math&gt;

and H1 otherwise, where ''L(y)'' is the so-defined ''[[Likelihood function|likelihood ratio]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">In algebraic geometry, the '''dualizing sheaf''' on a proper scheme ''X'' of dimension ''n'' over a field ''k'' is a [[coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\omega_X&lt;/math&gt; together with a linear functional
:&lt;math&gt;t_X: \operatorname{H}^n(X, \omega_X) \to k&lt;/math&gt;
that induces a natural isomorphism of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_X(F, \omega_X) \simeq \operatorname{H}^n(X, F)^*, \, \varphi \mapsto t_X \circ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
for each coherent sheaf ''F'' on ''X'' (the superscript * refers to a [[dual vector space]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. III, § 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear functional &lt;math&gt;t_X&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''trace morphism'''.

A pair &lt;math&gt;(\omega_X, t_X)&lt;/math&gt;, if it is exists, is unique up to a natural isomorphism. In fact, in the language of [[category theory]], &lt;math&gt;\omega_X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[representing object|object representing]] the contravariant functor &lt;math&gt;F \mapsto \operatorname{H}^n(X, F)^*&lt;/math&gt; from the category of coherent sheaves on ''X'' to the category of ''k''-vector spaces.

For a normal projective variety ''X'', the dualizing sheaf exists and it is in fact the [[canonical sheaf]]: &lt;math&gt;\omega_X = \mathcal{O}_X(K_X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K_X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[canonical divisor]]. More generally, the dualuzing sheaf exists for any projective scheme.

There is the following variant of [[Serre's duality theorem]]: for a projective scheme ''X'' of pure dimension ''n'' and a [[Cohen–Macaulay sheaf]] ''F'' on ''X'' such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}(F)&lt;/math&gt; is of pure dimension ''n'', there is a natural isomorphism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kollár–Mori|loc=Theorem 5.71.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{H}^i(X, F) \simeq \operatorname{H}^{n-i}(X, \operatorname{\mathcal{H}om}(F, \omega_X))^*&lt;/math&gt;.
In particular, if ''X'' itself is a [[Cohen–Macaulay scheme]], then the above duality holds for any locally free sheaf.&lt;!--==Generalization==
Given a ''S''-scheme ''X'', the '''trace morphism''' is
:&lt;math&gt;f_* \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_S&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5971">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''epi-convergence''' is a type of convergence for [[real-valued function|real-valued]] and [[extended real number line|extended real-valued]] functions. 

Epi-convergence is important because it is the appropriate notion of convergence with which to approximate minimization problems in the field of [[mathematical optimization]]. The symmetric notion of [[#Hypo-convergence|hypo-convergence]] is appropriate for maximization problems. [[Mosco convergence]] is a generalization of epi-convergence to infinite dimensional spaces.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]], and &lt;math&gt; f^{\nu}: X \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; a real-valued function for each [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt;. We say that the sequence &lt;math&gt; (f^{\nu}) &lt;/math&gt; '''epi-converges''' to a function &lt;math&gt; f: X \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; if for each &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \liminf_{\nu \to \infty} f^{\nu}(x^\nu) \geq f(x) \text{ for every } x^\nu \to x \text{ and } \\
&amp; \limsup_{\nu \to \infty} f^\nu(x^\nu) \leq f(x) \text{ for some } x^\nu \to x.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Extended real-valued extension ===
The following extension allows epi-convergence to be applied to a sequence of functions with non-constant domain.

Denote by &lt;math&gt; \overline{\mathbb{R}}= \mathbb{R} \cup \{ \pm \infty \} &lt;/math&gt; the [[extended real numbers]]. Let &lt;math&gt; f^\nu &lt;/math&gt; be a function &lt;math&gt; f^\nu:X \to \overline{\mathbb{R}} &lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt; \nu \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;. The sequence &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f: X \to \overline{\mathbb{R}} &lt;/math&gt; if for each &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \liminf_{\nu \to \infty} f^{\nu}(x^\nu) \geq f(x) \text{ for every } x^\nu \to x \text{ and } \\
&amp; \limsup_{\nu \to \infty} f^\nu(x^\nu) \leq f(x) \text{ for some } x^\nu \to x.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hypo-convergence ===

Epi-convergence is the appropriate topology with which to approximate minimization problems. For maximization problems one uses the symmetric notion of '''hypo-convergence'''. &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; hypo-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; if

: &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{\nu \to \infty} f^\nu(x^\nu) \leq f(x) \text{ for every } x^\nu \to x &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\liminf_{\nu \to \infty} f^\nu(x^\nu) \geq f(x) \text{ for some } x^\nu \to x. &lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to minimization problems==

Assume we have a difficult minimization problem 

: &lt;math&gt; \inf_{x \in C} g(x) &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt; g: X \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; C \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt;. We can attempt to approximate this problem by a sequence of easier problems

: &lt;math&gt; \inf_{x \in C^{\nu}} g^\nu(x) &lt;/math&gt; 

for functions &lt;math&gt; g^\nu &lt;/math&gt; and sets &lt;math&gt; C^\nu &lt;/math&gt;.

Epi-convergence provides an answer to the question: In what sense should the approximations converge to the original problem in order to guarantee that approximate solutions converge to a solution of the original?

We can embed these optimization problems into the epi-convergence framework by defining extended real-valued functions

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; = \begin{cases} g(x), &amp; x \in C, \\ \infty, &amp; x \not \in C, \end{cases} \\[4pt]
f^\nu(x) &amp; = \begin{cases} g^\nu(x), &amp; x \in C^\nu, \\ \infty, &amp; x \not \in C^\nu. \end{cases}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So that the problems &lt;math&gt; \inf_{x \in X} f(x) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \inf_{x \in X} f^\nu(x) &lt;/math&gt; are equivalent to the original and approximate problems, respectively.

If &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \limsup_{\nu \to \infty} [\inf f^\nu] \leq \inf f &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of minimizers of &lt;math&gt; f^\nu &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a minimizer of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. In this sense,

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{v \to \infty} \operatorname{argmin} f^\nu \subseteq \operatorname{argmin} f. &lt;/math&gt;

Epi-convergence is the weakest notion of convergence for which this result holds.

== Properties ==

* &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; (-f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; hypo-converges to &lt;math&gt; -f &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{epi} f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{epi} f &lt;/math&gt; as sets, in the Painlevé–Kuratowski sense of set convergence. Here, &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{epi} f &lt;/math&gt; is the [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] of the function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt; f^\nu &lt;/math&gt;  epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is lower semi-continuous.
* If &lt;math&gt; f^\nu &lt;/math&gt; is [[convex function | convex]] for each &lt;math&gt; \nu \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is convex.
* If &lt;math&gt; f^\nu_1 \leq f^\nu \leq f^\nu_2 &lt;/math&gt; and both &lt;math&gt; (f_1^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; (f_2^\nu)&lt;/math&gt; epi-converge to  &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges to  &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.
* If  &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; [[uniform convergence | converges uniformly]] to  &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; on each compact set of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; (f^\nu) &lt;/math&gt; epi-converges and hypo-converges to  &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;.
* In general, epi-convergence neither implies nor is implied by [[pointwise convergence]]. Additional assumptions can be placed on an pointwise convergent family of functions to guarantee epi-convergence.

The '''expectiminimax''' algorithm is a variation of the [[minimax]] algorithm, for use in [[artificial intelligence]] systems that play two-player [[zero-sum]] games, such as [[backgammon]], in which the outcome depends on a combination of the player's skill and [[games of chance|chance elements]] such as dice rolls. In addition to "min" and "max" nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has "chance" ("[[move by nature]]") nodes, which take the [[expected value]] of a random event occurring.&lt;ref name="RussellNorvig2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart J. Russell|author2=Peter Norvig|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jZBksh-bUMC&amp;pg=PA177|year=2009|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-604259-4|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[game theory]] terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an [[extensive-form game]] of [[perfect information|perfect]], but [[incomplete information]].

In the traditional [[minimax]] method, the levels of the tree alternate from max to min until the depth limit of the tree has been reached. In an expectiminimax tree, the "chance" nodes are interleaved with the max and min nodes. Instead of taking the max or min of the [[utility|utility values]] of their children, chance nodes take a weighted average, with the weight being the probability that child is reached.&lt;ref name="RussellNorvig2009"/&gt;

The interleaving depends on the game. Each "turn" of the game is evaluated as a "max" node (representing the AI player's turn), a "min" node (representing a potentially-optimal opponent's turn), or a "chance" node (representing a random effect or player).&lt;ref name="RussellNorvig2009"/&gt;

For example, consider a game in which each round consists of a single dice throw, and then decisions made by first the AI player, and then another intelligent opponent. The order of nodes in this game would alternate between "chance", "max" and then "min".&lt;ref name="RussellNorvig2009"/&gt;

==Pseudocode==

The expectiminimax algorithm is a variant of the [[minimax]] algorithm and was first proposed by [[Donald Michie]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Michie|D. Michie]] (1966). Game-playing and game-learning automata. In L. Fox (ed.), Advances in Programming and Non-Numerical Computation, pp. 183-200.&lt;/ref&gt;
Its [[pseudocode]] is given below. 

 '''function''' expectiminimax(node, depth)
     '''if''' node is a terminal node '''or''' depth = 0
         '''return''' the heuristic value of node
     '''if''' the adversary is to play at node
         // Return value of minimum-valued child node
         '''let''' α := +∞
         '''foreach''' child of node
             α := min(α, expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
     '''else if''' we are to play at node
         // Return value of maximum-valued child node
         '''let''' α := -∞
         '''foreach''' child of node
             α := max(α, expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
     '''else if''' random event at node
         // Return weighted average of all child nodes' values
         '''let''' α := 0
         '''foreach''' child of node
             α := α + (Probability[child] * expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
     '''return''' α

Note that for random nodes, there must be a known probability of reaching each child. (For most games of chance, child nodes will be equally-weighted, which means the return value can simply be the average of all child values.)

'''Francis Bonahon''' (9 September 1955, [[Tarbes]]) is a French mathematician, specializing  in [[low-dimensional topology]].

==Biography==
Bonahon received in 1972 his ''[[baccalauréat]]'', and was accepted in 1974 into the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He received in 1975 his ''maîtrise'' in mathematics from the [[University of Paris VII]], and in 1979 his doctorate from the [[University of Paris XI]] under [[Laurence Siebenmann]] with thesis ''Involutions et fibrés de Seifert dans les variétés de dimension 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=23186}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a postdoc he was for the academic year 1979/80 a ''Procter Fellow'' at [[Princeton University]]. In 1980 he became an ''attaché de recherche'' and in 1983 a ''chargé de recherche'' of the [[CNRS]]. In 1985 he received his [[habilitation]] from the University of Paris XI under Siebenmann with thesis ''Geometric structures on 3-manifolds and applications''. Bonahon became in 1986 an assistant professor, in 1988 an associate professor, and in 1989 a full professor at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|title=C.V., Francis Bonahon|url=http://dornsife.usc.edu/tools/mytools/PersonnelInfoSystem/DOC/Faculty/MATH/vita_1003116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a visiting professor in 1990 at the [[University of California, Davis]], in 1996 at the Centre Émile Borel and at the [[IHES]], in 1997 at [[Caltech]], in 2000 at IHES, and in 2015 at the [[MSRI]].&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

Bonahon's research deals with three-dimensional topology, knot theory, surface diffeomorphisms, hyperbolic geometry, and [[Kleinian group]]s.

He received in 1985 a bronze medal from [[CNRS]] and from 1989 to 1994 a Presidential Young Investigator Award. From 1987 to 1989 he was a [[Sloan Research Fellowship|Sloan Research Fellow]]. In 1990 he was an Invited Speaker with talk ''Ensembles limites et applications'' at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in [[Kyoto]]. He was elected a Fellow of [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2012.

His doctoral students include Frédéric Paulin.

In [[mathematics]], '''geometry and topology''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the historically distinct disciplines of [[geometry]] and [[topology]], as general frameworks allow both disciplines to be manipulated uniformly, most visibly in [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|local to global theorems]] in Riemannian geometry, and results like the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] and [[Chern–Weil theory]].

Sharp distinctions between geometry and topology can be drawn, however, as discussed below.{{clarify|how recognized are these sharp distinctions? Are they official in the sense of professional organizations or some such, or is it up to the practitioners?|date=December 2016}}

It is also the title of a journal ''[[Geometry &amp; Topology]]'' that covers these topics.

==Scope==
It is distinct from "geometric topology", which more narrowly involves applications of topology to geometry.

It includes:
* [[Differential geometry and topology]]
* [[Geometric topology]] (including [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[surgery theory]])

It does not include such parts of [[algebraic topology]] as [[homotopy theory]], but some areas of geometry and topology (such as surgery theory, particularly [[algebraic surgery theory]]) are heavily algebraic.

==Distinction between geometry and topology==
Geometry has ''local'' structure (or infinitesimal), while topology only has ''global'' structure. Alternatively, geometry has ''continuous'' [[moduli space|moduli]], while topology has ''discrete'' moduli.

By examples, an example of geometry is [[Riemannian geometry]], while an example of topology is [[homotopy theory]]. The study of [[metric space]]s is geometry, the study of [[topological space]]s is topology.

The terms are not used completely consistently: [[symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and [[Coarse structure|coarse geometry]] is global, not local.

===Local versus global structure===
By definition, [[differentiable manifold]]s of a fixed dimension are all locally diffeomorphic to [[Euclidean space]], so aside from dimension, there are no local invariants. Thus, differentiable structures on a manifold are topological in nature.

By contrast, the [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a local (indeed, infinitesimal) invariant{{clarify|not clear why curvature would be invariant|date=December 2016}} (and is the only local invariant under [[isometry]]).

===Moduli===
If a structure has a discrete moduli (if it has no [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s, or if a deformation of a structure is isomorphic to the original structure), the structure is said to be '''rigid''', and its study (if it is a geometric or topological structure) is topology. If it has non-trivial deformations, the structure is said to be '''flexible''', and its study is geometry.

The space of [[homotopy]] classes of maps is discrete,{{efn|Given point-set conditions, which are satisfied for manifolds; more generally homotopy classes form a [[totally disconnected]] but not necessarily discrete space; for example, the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hawaiian earring]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Specific claim about a topological space.}}}} so studying maps up to homotopy is topology.
Similarly, differentiable structures on a manifold is usually a discrete space, and hence an example of topology, but [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;s]] have continuous moduli of differentiable structures.

[[Algebraic varieties]] have continuous [[moduli space]]s, hence their study is [[algebraic geometry]]. These are finite-dimensional moduli spaces.

The space of Riemannian metrics on a given differentiable manifold is an infinite-dimensional space.

===Symplectic manifolds===
[[Symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and parts of their study are called [[symplectic topology]] and [[symplectic geometry]].

By [[Darboux's theorem]], a symplectic manifold has no local structure, which suggests that their study be called topology.

By contrast, the space of symplectic structures on a manifold form a continuous moduli, which suggests that their study be called geometry.

However, up to [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]], the space of symplectic structures is discrete (any family of symplectic structures are isotopic).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.duke.edu/~bryant/ParkCityLectures.pdf Introduction to Lie Groups and Symplectic Geometry], by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]], p. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4991">'''Grammar-based codes''' or '''Grammar-based compression''' are [[Data compression|compression]] algorithms based on the idea of constructing a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG) for the string to be compressed. Examples include universal [[lossless data compression]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kieffer  | first =  J. C.  | last2 = Yang | first2 = E.-H. | title = Grammar-based codes: A new class of universal lossless source codes | journal = IEEE Trans. Inf.

The problem of finding a smallest grammar for an input sequence is known to be NP-hard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Charikar  | first =  M.  | last2 = Lehman | first2 = E. | last3 = Liu | first3 = D. | last4 = Panigrahy | first4 = R. | last5 = Prabharakan | first5 = M. | last6 = Sahai | first6 = A. | last7 = Shelat | first7 = A. |  title = The Smallest Grammar Problem | journal = IEEE Trans.

Generally, the produced grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is further compressed by statistical encoders like [[arithmetic coding]].

== Examples and characteristics ==
The class of grammar-based codes is very broad. It includes [[block code]]s, variations of the incremental parsing [[LZ77 and LZ78|Lempel-Ziv code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kieffer | first = J. C. | last2 = Yang | first2 = E.-H.  | last3 = Nelson | first3 = G. | last4 = Cosman | first4 = P. | title = Universal lossless compression via multilevel pattern matching | journal = IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory | volume = 46 | pages = 1227–1245 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1109/18.850665 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the multilevel pattern matching (MPM) algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ziv | first = J. | last2 = Lempel | first2 = A. | title = Compression of individual sequences via variable rate coding | journal = IEEE Trans.

Grammar-based codes are universal in the sense that they can achieve asymptotically the [[entropy rate]] of any stationary, [[ergodic]] source with a finite alphabet.

== Practical algorithms ==
The compression programs of the following are available from external links.

* [[SEQUITUR algorithm|Sequitur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nevill-Manning  | first =  C. G.  | last2 = Witten | first2 = I. H. | title = Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm | journal =  Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research | volume = 7 | pages = 67–82 | year = 1997 | doi = | issue = 4 | hdl=10289/1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a classical grammar compression algorithm that sequentially translates an input text into a CFG, and then the produced CFG is encoded by an arithmetic coder.
* [[Re-Pair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Larsson  | first =  N. J.  | last2 = Moffat | first2 = A. | title = Offline Dictionary-Based Compression | journal = IEEE | volume = 88 | pages = 1722–1732| year = 2000 | issue = 11 | doi=10.1109/5.892708}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a greedy algorithm using the strategy of most-frequent-first substitution. The compressive performance is powerful, although the main memory space requirement is very large.
* [[GLZA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Conrad  | first =  Kennon J. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Paul R. | title = Grammatical Ziv-Lempel Compression: Achieving PPM-Class Text Compression Ratios with LZ-Class Decompression Speed | journal = IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC) | year = 2016 | doi=10.1109/DCC.2016.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constructs a grammar that may be reducible, i.e., contain repeats, where the entropy-coding cost of "spelling out" the repeats is less than the cost creating and entropy-coding a rule to capture them. (In general, the compression-optimal SLG is not irreducible, and the Smallest Grammar Problem is different from the actual SLG compression problem.)

Equivalently, it is the set of vertices with eccentricity equal to the graph's [[radius (graph theory)|radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=GraphCenter| title = Graph center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus vertices in the center ('''central points''') minimize the maximal distance from other points in the graph.

Finding the center of a graph is useful in [[facility location problem]]s where the goal is to minimize the worst-case distance to the facility.  For example, placing a hospital at a central point reduces the longest distance the ambulance has to travel.

The concept of the center of a graph is related to the [[closeness centrality]] measure in [[social network analysis]], which is the reciprocal of the mean of the distances ''d''(''A'',''B'').&lt;ref name="WF" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5797">In [[mathematics]], '''limit cardinals''' are certain [[cardinal number]]s. A cardinal number λ is a '''weak limit cardinal''' if  λ is neither a [[successor cardinal]] nor zero. This means that one cannot "reach" λ from another cardinal by repeated successor operations. These cardinals are sometimes called simply "limit cardinals" when the context is clear.

A cardinal λ is a '''strong limit cardinal''' if λ cannot be reached by repeated [[Power set|powerset]] operations. This means that λ is nonzero and, for all κ &lt; λ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; λ. Every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal, because κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; for every cardinal κ, where κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the successor cardinal of κ.

The first infinite cardinal, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; ([[Aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-naught]]), is a strong limit cardinal, and hence also a weak limit cardinal.

== Constructions ==

One way to construct limit cardinals is via the union operation: &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is a weak limit cardinal, defined as the union of all the alephs before it; and in general &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; for any [[limit ordinal]] λ is a weak limit cardinal.

The [[beth number|ב operation]] can be used to obtain strong limit cardinals.  This operation is a map from ordinals to cardinals defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{0} = \aleph_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+1} = 2^{\beth_{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt; (the smallest ordinal [[equinumerous]] with the powerset)
:If &amp;lambda; is a limit ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\lambda} = \bigcup \{ \beth_{\alpha} : \alpha &lt; \lambda\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The cardinal
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega} = \bigcup \{ \beth_{0}, \beth_{1}, \beth_{2}, \ldots \} = \bigcup_{n &lt; \omega}  \beth_{n} &lt;/math&gt;
is a strong limit cardinal of [[cofinality]] &amp;omega;. More generally, given any ordinal &amp;alpha;, the cardinal
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+\omega} = \bigcup_{n &lt; \omega} \beth_{\alpha+n} &lt;/math&gt;
is a strong limit cardinal. Thus there are arbitrarily large strong limit cardinals.

== Relationship with ordinal subscripts ==

If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, every cardinal number has an [[initial ordinal]]. If that initial ordinal is &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\lambda} \,,&lt;/math&gt; then the cardinal number is of the form &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for the same ordinal subscript &amp;lambda;. The ordinal &amp;lambda; determines whether &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a weak limit cardinal. Because &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha^+} = (\aleph_\alpha)^+ \,,&lt;/math&gt; if &amp;lambda; is a successor ordinal then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is not a weak limit. Conversely, if a cardinal &amp;kappa; is a successor cardinal, say &lt;math&gt;\kappa = (\aleph_{\alpha})^+ \,,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \aleph_{\alpha^+} \,.&lt;/math&gt; Thus, in general, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a weak limit cardinal if and only if &amp;lambda; is zero or a limit ordinal.

Although the ordinal subscript tells whether a cardinal is a weak limit, it does not tell whether a cardinal is a strong limit. For example, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] proves that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a weak limit cardinal, but neither proves nor disproves that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a strong limit cardinal (Hrbacek and Jech 1999:168). The [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] states that &lt;math&gt;\kappa^+ = 2^{\kappa} \,&lt;/math&gt; for every infinite cardinal &amp;kappa;. Under this hypothesis, the notions of weak and strong limit cardinals coincide.

== The notion of inaccessibility and large cardinals ==

The preceding defines a notion of "inaccessibility": we are dealing with cases where it is no longer enough to do finitely many iterations of the successor and powerset operations; hence the phrase "cannot be reached" in both of the intuitive definitions above. But the "union operation" always provides another way of "accessing" these cardinals (and indeed, such is the case of limit ordinals as well).  Stronger notions of inaccessibility can be defined using [[cofinality]]. For a weak (resp. strong) limit cardinal κ the requirement that cf(κ) = κ (i.e. κ be [[regular cardinal|regular]]) so that κ cannot be expressed as a sum (union) of fewer than κ smaller cardinals. Such a cardinal is called a [[inaccessible cardinal|weakly (resp. strongly) inaccessible cardinal]]. The preceding examples both are singular cardinals of cofinality ω and hence they are not inaccessible.

&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; would be an inaccessible cardinal of both "strengths" except that the definition of inaccessible requires that they be uncountable.  Standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) cannot even prove the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal of either kind above &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]].  More specifically, if &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is weakly inaccessible then &lt;math&gt;L_{\kappa} \models ZFC&lt;/math&gt;.  These form the first in a hierarchy of [[large cardinal]]s.

[[Image:VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png|right|250px|thumb|Stable limit cycle (shown in bold) for the [[Van der Pol oscillator]]]]
In [[mathematics]], in the study of [[dynamical systems]] with two-dimensional [[phase space]], a '''limit cycle''' is a closed [[trajectory]] in phase space having the property that at least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity or as time approaches negative infinity. Such behavior is exhibited in some [[nonlinear systems]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limit cycles have been used to model the behavior of a great many real world oscillatory systems.   The study of limit cycles was initiated by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1854–1912).

==Definition==
We consider a two-dimensional dynamical system of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x'(t)=V(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;V:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;
is a smooth function. A ''trajectory'' of this system is some smooth function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies this differential equation. Such a trajectory is called ''closed'' (or ''periodic'') if it is not constant but returns to its starting point, i.e. if there exists some &lt;math&gt;t_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x(t+t_0)=x(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. An [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a trajectory, a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. A ''closed orbit'', or ''cycle'', is the image of a closed trajectory. A ''limit cycle'' is a cycle which is the [[limit set]] of some other trajectory.

==Properties==
By the [[Jordan curve theorem]], every closed trajectory divides the plane into two regions, the interior and the exterior of the curve.

Given a limit cycle and a trajectory in its interior that approaches the limit cycle for time approaching &lt;math&gt;+ \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a neighborhood around the limit cycle such that ''all'' trajectories in the interior that start in the neighborhood approach the limit cycle for time approaching &lt;math&gt; + \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding statement holds for a trajectory in the interior that approaches the limit cycle for time approaching &lt;math&gt;- \infty&lt;/math&gt;, and also for trajectories in the exterior approaching the limit cycle.

==Stable, unstable and semi-stable limit cycles==
In the case where all the neighbouring trajectories approach the limit cycle as time approaches infinity, it is called a ''[[stable manifold|stable]]'' or ''attractive'' limit cycle (ω-limit cycle). If instead all neighbouring trajectories approach it as time approaches negative infinity, then it is an ''unstable'' limit cycle (α-limit cycle). If there is a neighbouring trajectory which spirals into the limit cycle as time approaches infinity, and another one which spirals into it as time approaches negative infinity, then it is a ''semi-stable'' limit cycle. There are also limit cycles which are neither stable, unstable nor semi-stable: for instance, a neighboring trajectory may approach the limit cycle from the outside, but the inside of the limit cycle is approached by a family of other cycles (which wouldn't be limit cycles).

Stable limit cycles are examples of [[attractor]]s. They imply self-sustained [[oscillations]]: the closed trajectory describes perfect periodic behavior of the system, and any small perturbation from this closed trajectory causes the system to return to it, making the system stick to the limit cycle.

==Finding limit cycles==
Every closed trajectory contains within its interior a [[stationary point]] of the system, i.e. a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V(p)=0&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Bendixson–Dulac theorem]] and the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] predict the absence or existence, respectively, of limit cycles of two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.

==Open problems==
Finding limit cycles in general is a very difficult problem. The number of limit cycles of a polynomial differential equation in the plane is the main object of the second part of [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]]. It is unknown, for instance, whether there is any system &lt;math&gt;x'=V(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the plane where both components of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are quadratic polynomials of the two variables, such that the system has more than 4 limit cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">In differential geometry, the '''localization formula''' states: for an equivariantly closed [[equivariant differential form]]  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; on an [[orbifold]] ''M'' with a [[torus action]] and for a sufficient small &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra of the torus ''T'',
:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over d_M} \int_M \alpha(\xi) = \sum_F {1 \over d_F} \int_F {\alpha(\xi) \over e_T(F)(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum runs over all connected components ''F'' of the set of fixed points &lt;math&gt;M^T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orbifold multiplicity]] of ''M'' (which is one if ''M'' is a manifold) and &lt;math&gt;e_T(F)&lt;/math&gt; is the equivariant [[Euler class|Euler form]] of the normal bundle of ''F''.

The formula allows one to compute the [[equivariant cohomology ring]] of the orbifold ''M'' (a particular kind of [[differentiable stack]]) from the equivariant cohomology of its fixed point components, up to multiplicities and Euler forms. No analog of such results holds in the non-equivariant cohomology.

One important consequence of the formula is the [[Duistermaat–Heckman theorem]], which states: supposing there is a Hamiltonian circle action (for simplicity) on a compact symplectic manifold ''M'' of dimension 2''n'',
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M e^{-tH} \omega^n/n! = \sum_p {e^{-tH(p)} \over t^n \prod \alpha_j(p)}.&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is Hamiltonian for the circle action, the sum is over points fixed by the circle action and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j(p)&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues on the tangent space at ''p'' (cf. [[Lie group action]].)

The localization formula can also computes the [[Fourier transform]] of (Kostant's symplectic form on) coadjoint orbit, yielding the [[Harish-Chandra's integration formula]], which in turns gives [[Kirillov's character formula]].

The localization theorem for equivariant cohomology in non-rational coefficients is discussed in [[Daniel Quillen]]'s papers.

== Non-abelian localization ==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The localization theorem states that the equivariant cohomology can be recovered, up to torsion elements, from the equivariant cohomology of the fixed point subset. This does not extend, in verbatim, to the non-abelian action. But there is still a version of the localization theorem for non-abelian actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9829">In [[computer science]], '''Luby transform codes''' ('''LT codes''') are the first class of practical [[fountain code]]s that are near-optimal [[erasure correcting code]]s. They were invented by [[Michael Luby]] in 1998 and published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Luby"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1181950 M.Luby, "LT Codes", The 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like some other [[fountain code]]s, LT codes depend on sparse [[bipartite graph]]s to trade reception overhead for encoding and decoding speed. The distinguishing characteristic of LT codes is in employing a particularly simple algorithm based on the [[exclusive or]] operation (&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;) to encode and decode the message.&lt;ref&gt;The ''exclusive or'' (XOR) operation, symbolized by &amp;oplus;, has the very useful property that ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;oplus;&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''A'' is an arbitrary string of [[bit]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

LT codes are ''rateless'' because the encoding algorithm can in principle produce an infinite number of message packets (i.e., the percentage of packets that must be received to decode the message can be arbitrarily small). They are ''erasure correcting codes'' because they can be used to transmit digital data reliably on an [[binary erasure channel|erasure channel]].

The next generation beyond LT codes are [[raptor codes]] (see for example IETF RFC 5053 or IETF RFC 6330), which have linear time encoding and decoding.  Raptor codes use two encoding stages for encoding, where the second stage is an LT encoding.

==Why use an LT code?==

The traditional scheme for transferring data across an erasure channel depends on continuous two-way communication.
*The sender encodes and sends a packet of information.
*The receiver attempts to decode the received packet. If it can be decoded, the receiver sends an acknowledgment back to the transmitter. Otherwise, the receiver asks the transmitter to send the packet again.
*This two-way process continues until all the packets in the message have been transferred successfully.

Certain networks, such as ones used for cellular wireless broadcasting, do not have a feedback channel. Applications on these networks still require reliability. [[Fountain code]]s in general, and LT codes in particular, get around this problem by adopting an essentially one-way communication protocol.
*The sender encodes and sends packet after packet of information.
*The receiver evaluates each packet as it is received. If there is an error, the erroneous packet is discarded. Otherwise the packet is saved as a piece of the message.
*Eventually the receiver has enough valid packets to reconstruct the entire message. When the entire message has been received successfully the receiver signals that transmission is complete.

==LT encoding==

The encoding process begins by dividing the uncoded message into ''n'' blocks of roughly equal length. Encoded packets are then produced with the help of a [[pseudorandom number generator]].
*The degree ''d'', 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', of the next packet is chosen at random.
*Exactly ''d'' blocks from the message are randomly chosen.
*If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''th block of the message, the data portion of the next packet is computed as

::&lt;math&gt;
M_{i_1} \oplus M_{i_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus M_{i_d}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:where {''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;} are the randomly chosen indices for the ''d'' blocks included in this packet.
*A prefix is appended to the encoded packet, defining how many blocks ''n'' are in the message, how many blocks ''d'' have been exclusive-ored into the data portion of this packet, and the list of indices {''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
*Finally, some form of error-detecting code (perhaps as simple as a [[cyclic redundancy check]]) is applied to the packet, and the packet is transmitted.

This process continues until the receiver signals that the message has been received and successfully decoded.

==LT decoding==

The decoding process uses the "[[exclusive or]]" operation to retrieve the encoded message.
*If the current packet isn't clean, or if it replicates a packet that has already been processed, the current packet is discarded.
*If the current cleanly received packet is of degree ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, it is first processed against all the fully decoded blocks in the message queuing area (as described more fully in the next step), then stored in a buffer area if its reduced degree is greater than 1.
*When a new, clean packet of degree ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (block ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is received (or the degree of the current packet is reduced to 1 by the preceding step), it is moved to the message queueing area, and then matched against all the packets of degree ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 residing in the buffer. It is exclusive-ored into the data portion of any buffered packet that was encoded using ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the degree of that matching packet is decremented, and the list of indices for that packet is adjusted to reflect the application of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*When this process unlocks a block of degree ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 in the buffer, that block is reduced to degree 1 and is in its turn moved to the message queueing area, and then processed against the packets remaining in the buffer.
*When all ''n'' blocks of the message have been moved to the message queueing area, the receiver signals the transmitter that the message has been successfully decoded.

This decoding procedure works because ''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for any bit string ''A''. After ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 distinct blocks have been exclusive-ored into a packet of degree ''d'', the original unencoded content of the unmatched block is all that remains. In symbols we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \qquad (M_{i_1} \oplus \dots \oplus M_{i_d}) \oplus
(M_{i_1} \oplus \dots \oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \oplus M_{i_{k+1}} \oplus \dots \oplus M_{i_d}) \\
&amp; = M_{i_1} \oplus M_{i_1} \oplus \dots \oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \oplus M_{i_k} \oplus
M_{i_{k+1}} \oplus M_{i_{k+1}} \oplus \dots \oplus M_{i_d} \oplus M_{i_d} \\
&amp; = 0 \oplus \dots \oplus 0 \oplus M_{i_k} \oplus 0 \oplus \dots \oplus 0 \\
&amp; =  M_{i_k} \,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Variations==

Several variations of the encoding and decoding processes described above are possible. For instance, instead of prefixing each packet with a list of the actual message block indices {''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;}, the encoder might simply send a short "key" which served as the seed for the [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG) or index table used to construct the list of indices. Since the receiver equipped with the same RNG or index table can reliably recreate the "random" list of indices from this seed, the decoding process can be completed successfully. Alternatively, by combining a simple LT code of low average degree with a robust error-correcting code, a [[raptor code]] can be constructed that will outperform an optimized LT code in practice.&lt;ref name="MacKay"&gt;[http://switzernet.com/people/emin-gabrielyan/060112-capillary-references/ref/MacKay05.pdf Fountain codes], by D.J.C. MacKay, first published in IEEE Proc.-Commun., Vol. 152, No. 6, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optimization of LT codes==

There is only one parameter that can be used to optimize a straight LT code: the degree distribution function (described as a pseudorandom number generator for the degree ''d'' in the '''LT encoding''' section above). In practice the other "random" numbers (the list of indices {&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;) are invariably taken from a uniform distribution on [0, ''n''), where ''n'' is the number of blocks into which the message has been divided.&lt;ref name="Tirronen"&gt;[http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/abi/publ/lt-resim-2006.pdf Optimizing the Degree Distribution of LT Codes with an Importance Sampling Approach], by Esa Hyytiä, Tuomas Tirronen, and Jorma Virtamo (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Luby himself&lt;ref name="Luby"/&gt; discussed the "ideal [[soliton distribution]]" defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{P}\{d=1\}&amp; = \frac{1}{n}\\[2pt]
\mathrm{P}\{d=k\}&amp; = \frac{1}{k(k-1)} \qquad (k=2,3,\dots,n). \,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This degree distribution theoretically minimizes the expected number of redundant code words that will be sent before the decoding process can be completed. However the ideal soliton distribution does not work well in practice because any fluctuation around the expected behavior makes it likely that at some step in the decoding process there will be no available packet of (reduced) degree 1 so decoding will fail. Furthermore, some of the original blocks will not be xor-ed into any of the transmission packets. Therefore, in practice, a modified distribution, the "robust [[soliton distribution]]", is substituted for the ideal distribution. The effect of the modification is, generally, to produce more packets of very small degree (around 1) and fewer packets of degree greater than 1, except for a spike of packets at a fairly large quantity chosen to ensure that all original blocks will be included in some packet.&lt;ref name="Tirronen"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''multiply perfect number''' (also called '''multiperfect number''' or '''pluperfect number''') is a generalization of a [[perfect number]].

For a given [[natural number]] ''k'', a number ''n'' is called ''k''-perfect (or ''k''-fold perfect) [[if and only if]] the sum of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' (the [[divisor function]], ''σ''(''n'')) is equal to ''kn''; a number is thus [[perfect number|perfect]] [[if and only if]] it is 2-perfect. A number that is ''k''-perfect for a certain ''k'' is called a multiply perfect number. As of 2014, ''k''-perfect numbers are known for each value of ''k'' up to 11.&lt;ref name=fl/&gt;

It can be proven that:

* For a given [[prime number]] ''p'', if ''n'' is ''p''-perfect and ''p'' does not divide ''n'', then ''pn'' is (''p''+1)-perfect.  This implies that an integer ''n'' is a 3-perfect number divisible by 2 but not by 4, if and only if ''n''/2 is an odd [[perfect number]], of which none are known.
* If 3''n'' is 4''k''-perfect and 3 does not divide ''n'', then ''n'' is 3''k''-perfect.

An open question is whether every ''k''-perfect numbers are divisible by ''k''!, where "!" is the [[factorial]].

[[File:Three apples(1).svg|right|thumb|Natural numbers can be used for counting (one [[apple]], two apples, three apples, …)]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''natural numbers''' are those used for [[counting]] (as in "there are ''six'' coins on the table") and [[total order|ordering]] (as in "this is the ''third'' largest city in the country"). In common mathematical terminology, words colloquially used for counting are "[[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]]" and words connected to ordering represent "[[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]]".

Some definitions, including the standard [[ISO 80000-2]],&lt;ref name = ISO80000 /&gt; begin the natural numbers with {{num|0}}, corresponding to the '''non-negative integers''' {{math|1=0, 1, 2, 3, …}}, whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the '''positive integers''' {{math|1={{num|1}}, {{num|2}}, {{num|3}}, …}}.&lt;ref&gt;

They follow that with their version of the Peano Postulates. (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;  Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the '''whole numbers''', but in other writings, that term is used instead for the integers (including negative integers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Jack G.

Any whole number.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural numbers are a basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension: the [[integer]]s ([[Grothendieck group]]), by including (if not yet in) the [[neutral element]] 0 and an [[additive inverse]] (−''n'') for each nonzero natural number ''n''; the [[rational number]]s, by including a [[multiplicative inverse]] (1/''n'') for each nonzero integer ''n'' (and also the product of these inverses by integers); the [[real number]]s by including with the rationals the [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] of (converging) [[Construction of the real numbers#Construction from Cauchy sequences|Cauchy sequences]] of rationals; the [[complex number]]s, by including with the real numbers the unresolved [[Imaginary unit|square root of minus one]] (and also the sums and products thereof); and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mendelson|2008}} says: "The whole fantastic hierarchy of number systems is built up by purely set-theoretic means from a few simple assumptions about natural numbers." (Preface, p. x)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bluman|2010}}: "Numbers make up the foundation of mathematics." (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically [[Embedding|embedded]] (identified) in the other number systems.

Properties of the natural numbers, such as [[divisibility]] and the distribution of [[prime number]]s, are studied in [[number theory]]. Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as [[Partition (number theory)|partitioning]] and [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerations]], are studied in [[combinatorics]].

In common language, for example in [[primary school]], natural numbers may be called '''counting numbers'''&lt;ref name=MathWorld_CountingNumber&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Counting Number|id=CountingNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt; both to intuitively exclude the negative integers and zero, and also to contrast the [[Discrete mathematics|discreteness]] of [[counting]] to the [[List of continuity-related mathematical topics|continuity]] of [[measurement]], established by the [[real number]]s.

The natural numbers can, at times, appear as a convenient set of names (labels), that is, as what [[linguists]] call [[nominal number]]s, foregoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense.

==History==

===Ancient roots===

[[UNESCO]]'s Portal to the Heritage of Astronomy&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to have been used 20,000 years ago for natural number arithmetic.]]

The most primitive method of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object. Later, a set of objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage, by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.

The first major advance in abstraction was the use of [[numeral system|numerals]] to represent numbers. This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers. The ancient [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] for&amp;nbsp;1, 10, and all the powers of&amp;nbsp;10 up to over 1&amp;nbsp;million. A stone carving from [[Karnak]], dating from around 1500&amp;nbsp;BC and now at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, depicts&amp;nbsp;276 as 2&amp;nbsp;hundreds, 7&amp;nbsp;tens, and 6&amp;nbsp;ones; and similarly for the number&amp;nbsp;4,622. The [[Babylonia]]ns had a [[Positional notation|place-value]] system based essentially on the numerals for&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;10, using base sixty, so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one, its value being determined from context.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers'', Wiley, 2000, {{isbn|0-471-37568-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much later advance was the development of the idea that&amp;nbsp;{{num|0}} can be considered as a number, with its own numeral. The use of a&amp;nbsp;0 [[numerical digit|digit]] in place-value notation (within other numbers) dates back as early as 700&amp;nbsp;BC by the Babylonians, but they omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Zero.html |title=A history of Zero |quote=… a tablet found at Kish … thought to date from around 700 BC, uses three hooks to denote an empty place in the positional notation. Other tablets dated from around the same time use a single hook for an empty place |website=MacTutor History of Mathematics |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Olmec]] and [[Maya civilization]]s used&amp;nbsp;0 as a separate number as early as the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}, but this usage did not spread beyond [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=1491: New Revelations Of The Americas Before Columbus|first=Charles C.|last=Mann|publisher=Knopf|year=2005|isbn=9781400040063|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw2TE_UNHJYC&amp;pg=PA19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Development of Mathematics Throughout the Centuries: A Brief History in a Cultural Context|first=Brian|last=Evans|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118853979|contribution=Chapter 10. Pre-Columbian Mathematics: The Olmec, Maya, and Inca Civilizations|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CPwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a numeral&amp;nbsp;0 in modern times originated with the [[India]]n mathematician [[Brahmagupta]] in 628. However, 0 had been used as a number in the medieval [[computus]] (the calculation of the date of [[Easter]]), beginning with [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525, without being denoted by a numeral (standard [[Roman numerals]] do not have a symbol for&amp;nbsp;0); instead ''nulla'' (or the genitive form ''nullae'') from ''nullus'', the Latin word for "none", was employed to denote a&amp;nbsp;0 value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Deckers |url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm |title=Cyclus Decemnovennalis Dionysii – Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius |publisher=Hbar.phys.msu.ru |date=2003-08-25 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic study of numbers as [[abstraction]]s is usually credited to the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Archimedes]]. Some Greek mathematicians treated the number&amp;nbsp;1 differently than larger numbers, sometimes even not as a number at all.&lt;ref&gt;This convention is used, for example, in [[Euclid's Elements]], see [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/defVII1.html Book VII, definitions 1 and 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent studies also occurred at around the same time in [[India]], [[China]], and [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris Kline, ''Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, 1990 [1972], {{isbn|0-19-506135-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern definitions===
In [[19th century]] [[Europe]], there was mathematical and philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers. A school{{which|date=March 2017}} of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] stated that the natural numbers were a direct consequence of the human psyche. [[Henri Poincaré]] was one of its advocates, as was [[Leopold Kronecker]] who summarized "God made the integers, all else is the work of man".&lt;ref&gt;The English translation is from Gray. In a footnote, Gray attributes the German quote to: "Weber 1891/92, 19, quoting from a lecture of Kronecker's of 1886."&lt;br /&gt;{{Citation |last=Gray |first=Jeremy |author-link=Jeremy Gray |year=2008 |title=Plato's Ghost: The Modernist Transformation of Mathematics |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-place= |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldzseiuZbsIC&amp;q=%22God+made+the+integers%2C+all+else+is+the+work+of+man.%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22God%20made%20the%20integers%2C%20all%20else%20is%20the%20work%20of%20man.%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= }}&lt;br /&gt;
Weber, Heinrich L. 1891-2. [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0002&amp;DMDID=dmdlog6 Kronecker]. [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/toc/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0002 ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung''] 2:5-23. (The quote is on p. 19.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the Naturalists, the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] saw a need to improve the logical rigor in the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Much of the mathematical work of the twentieth century has been devoted to examining the logical foundations and structure of the subject." {{harv|Eves|1990|p=606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Hermann Grassmann]] suggested a recursive definition for natural numbers thus stating they were not really natural but a consequence of definitions. Later, two classes of such formal definitions were constructed; later, they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications.

[[Set-theoretical definitions of natural numbers]] were initiated by [[Frege]] and he initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set, but this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including [[Russell's paradox]]. Therefore, this formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1990|loc=Chapter 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second class of definitions was introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], refined by [[Richard Dedekind]], and further explored by [[Giuseppe Peano]]; this approach is now called [[Peano arithmetic]]. It is based on an [[axiomatization]] of the properties of [[ordinal number]]s: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor. Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is [[ZFC]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation. Theorems that can be proved in ZFC but cannot be proved using the Peano Axioms include [[Goodstein's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Kirby; J. Paris, ''Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic'', Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society 14 (4): 285. doi:10.1112/blms/14.4.285, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

With all these definitions it is convenient to include&amp;nbsp;0 (corresponding to the [[empty set]]) as a natural number. Including&amp;nbsp;0 is now the common convention among [[set theory|set theorists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bagaria|first1=Joan|title=Set Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[logic]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrei|first1=Derek|title=Classic set theory : a guided independent study|date=1998|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.

See, for example, {{harvtxt|Carothers|2000|p=3}} or {{harvtxt|Thomson|Bruckner|Bruckner|2000|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since different properties are customarily associated to the tokens {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}, e.g., neutral elements for addition and multiplications, respectively, it is important to know which version of ''natural numbers'', generically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N,&lt;/math&gt; is employed in the case under consideration. This can be done by explanation in prose, by explicitly writing down the set, or by qualifying the generic identifier with a super- or subscript (see also in [[#Notation]]),&lt;ref name="ISO80000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimaldi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |first1=Ralph P. |title=Discrete and combinatorial mathematics : an applied introduction |publisher=Pearson Addison Wesley |isbn=0201726343 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., like this:

* Naturals with zero: &lt;math&gt;\;\{0,1,2,...\}=\mathbb{N}_0={\mathbb{N}}\cup\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;
* Naturals without zero: &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,...\}=\mathbb{N}^*=\mathbb{N}\smallsetminus\{0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==
[[File:U+2115.svg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Blackboard bold |double-struck]] capital N symbol, often used to denote the set of all natural numbers (see [[List of mathematical symbols]]).]]
Mathematicians use '''N''' or {{math|ℕ}} (an N in [[blackboard bold]]) to refer to the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all natural numbers. Older texts have also occasionally employed ''J'' as the symbol for this set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=W.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=25|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be unambiguous about whether 0 is included or not, sometimes a subscript (or superscript) "0" is added in the former case, and a superscript "{{math|*}}" or subscript "{{math|&gt;0}}" is added in the latter case:&lt;ref name = ISO80000 &gt;{{cite book|title=ISO 80000-2:2009|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31887|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]| chapter = Standard number sets and intervals | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=ℕ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ℕ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mset|0, 1, 2, …}}}}
:{{math|1=ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ℕ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ℕ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ℕ&lt;sub&gt;&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mset|1, 2, 3, …}}}}.

Alternatively, since natural numbers naturally [[embedding|embed]] in the [[integer]]s, they may be referred to as the positive, or the non-negative integers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimaldi|first1=Ralph P.|title=A review of discrete and combinatorial mathematics|date=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0201726343|page=133|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3,\dots\} = \mathbb Z^+&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, 2,\dots\} = \mathbb Z^{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

===Infinity===
The set of natural numbers is an [[infinite set]]. This kind of [[infinity]] is, by definition, called [[countably infinite|countable infinity]]. All sets that can be put into a [[bijective]] relation to the natural numbers are said to have this kind of infinity. This is also expressed by saying that the [[cardinal number]] of the set is [[Aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-naught]] ({{math|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |urlname=CardinalNumber |title=Cardinal Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addition===
One can recursively define an [[Addition in N|addition]] [[operation (mathematics)|operator]] on the natural numbers by setting {{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + ''S''(''b'') {{=}} ''S''(''a'' + ''b'')}} for all {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}. Here {{math|''S''}} should be read as "[[Successor function|successor]]". This turns the natural numbers {{math|(ℕ, +)}} into a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] with [[identity element]]&amp;nbsp;0, the so-called [[free object]] with one generator. This monoid satisfies the [[cancellation property]] and can be embedded in a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (in the mathematical sense of the word ''group''). The smallest group containing the natural numbers is the [[integer]]s.

If 1 is defined as {{math|''S''(0)}}, then {{math|''b'' + 1 {{=}} ''b'' + ''S''(0) {{=}} ''S''(''b'' + 0) {{=}} ''S''(''b'')}}. That is, {{math|''b'' + 1}} is simply the successor of {{math|''b''}}.

===Multiplication===
Analogously, given that addition has been defined, a [[multiplication]] operator × can be defined via {{math|''a'' × 0 {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''a'' × S(''b'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + ''a''}}. This turns {{math|(ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, ×)}} into a free commutative monoid with identity element&amp;nbsp;1; a generator set for this monoid is the set of [[prime number]]s.

===Relationship between addition and multiplication===
Addition and multiplication are compatible, which is expressed in the [[distributivity|distribution law]]: {{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}. These properties of addition and multiplication make the natural numbers an instance of a [[commutative]] [[semiring]]. Semirings are an algebraic generalization of the natural numbers where multiplication is not necessarily commutative. The lack of additive inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|ℕ}} is not [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under subtraction (i.e., subtracting one natural from another does not always result in another natural), means that {{math|ℕ}} is ''not'' a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; instead it is a [[semiring]] (also known as a ''rig'').

If the natural numbers are taken as "excluding 0", and "starting at 1", the definitions of + and × are as above, except that they begin with {{math|''a'' + 1 {{=}} ''S''(''a'')}} and {{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}.

===Order===
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as {{math|''ab''}} indicate the product {{math|''a'' × ''b''}}, and the standard [[order of operations]] is assumed.

A [[total order]] on the natural numbers is defined by letting {{math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if there exists another natural number {{math|''c''}} where {{math|''a'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''b''}}. This order is compatible with the [[arithmetical operations]] in the following sense: if {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are natural numbers and {{math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''}} and {{math|''ac'' ≤ ''bc''}}.

An important property of the natural numbers is that they are [[well-order]]ed: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an [[ordinal number]]; for the natural numbers, this is denoted as [[omega (ordinal)|{{math|''ω''}}]] (omega).

===Division===
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as {{math|''ab''}} indicate the product {{math|''a'' × ''b''}}, and the standard [[order of operations]] is assumed.

While it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result, the procedure of ''[[Division (mathematics)|division]] with remainder'' is available as a substitute: for any two natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} there are natural numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that
:{{math|''a'' {{=}} ''bq'' + ''r''}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{math|''r'' &lt; ''b''}}.

The number {{math|''q''}} is called the ''[[quotient]]'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by&amp;nbsp;{{math|''b''}}. The numbers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''b''}}. This [[Euclidean division]] is key to several other properties ([[divisibility]]), algorithms (such as the [[Euclidean algorithm]]), and ideas in number theory.

===Algebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers===
The addition (+) and multiplication (×) operations on natural numbers as defined above have several algebraic properties:
* [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]] under addition and multiplication: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' × ''b''}} are natural numbers.
* [[Associativity]]: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}} and {{math|''a'' × (''b'' × ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') × ''c''}}.
* [[Commutativity]]: for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' × ''a''}}.
* Existence of [[identity element]]s: for every natural number ''a'', {{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}.
* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}.
* No nonzero [[zero divisor]]s: if {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are natural numbers such that {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both).

==Generalizations==
Two important generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses of counting and ordering: [[cardinal number]]s and [[ordinal number]]s.
* A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set; more precisely, a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set, which is even suitable for infinite sets. This concept of "size" relies on maps between sets, such that two sets have [[equinumerosity|the same size]], exactly if there exists a [[bijection]] between them. The set of natural numbers itself, and any bijective image of it, is said to be ''[[countable set|countably infinite]]'' and to have [[cardinality]] [[Aleph number#Aleph-null|aleph-null]] ({{math|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}).
* Natural numbers are also used as [[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|linguistic ordinal numbers]]: "first", "second", "third", and so forth. This way they can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set, and also to the elements of any [[well-order]]ed countably infinite set. This assignment can be generalized to general well-orderings with a cardinality beyond countability, to yield the ordinal numbers. An ordinal number may also be used to describe the notion of "size" for a well-ordered set, in a sense different from cardinality: if there is an [[order isomorphism]] (more than a bijection!) between two well-ordered sets, they have the same ordinal number. The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as {{math|ω}}; this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself.

Many well-ordered sets with cardinal number {{math|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} have an ordinal number greater than {{math|ω}} (the latter is the lowest possible). The least ordinal of cardinality {{math|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (i.e., the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal]]) is {{math|ω}}.

For [[finite set|finite]] well-ordered sets, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers; therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number, the number of elements of the set. This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite, or an infinite, [[sequence]].

A countable [[non-standard model of arithmetic]] satisfying the Peano Arithmetic (i.e., the first-order Peano axioms) was developed by [[Skolem]] in 1933.  The [[hypernatural]] numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the [[ultrapower construction]].

[[Georges Reeb]] used to claim provocatively that ''The naïve integers don't fill up'' {{math|ℕ}}. Other generalizations are discussed in the article on [[number]]s.

==Formal definitions==

===Peano axioms===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}

Many properties of the natural numbers can be derived from the five [[Peano axioms]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamilton|1988}} calls them "Peano's Postulates" and begins with "1.{{spaces|2}}0 is a natural number." (p. 117f)&lt;br /&gt;
{{harvtxt|Halmos|1960}} uses the language of set theory instead of the language of arithmetic for his five axioms. He begins with "(I){{spaces|2}}{{math|0 ∈ ω}} (where, of course, {{math|0 {{=}} ∅}}" ({{math|ω}} is the set of all natural numbers). (p. 46)&lt;br /&gt;
{{harvtxt|Morash|1991}} gives "a two-part axiom" in which the natural numbers begin with 1. (Section 10.1: ''An Axiomatization for the System of Positive Integers'')
&lt;/ref&gt;

#  0 is a natural number.
#  Every natural number has a successor.
# 0 is not the successor of any natural number.
# If the successor of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; equals the successor of &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;.
# The [[axiom of induction]]: If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then the statement is true for every natural number.

These are not the original axioms published by Peano, but are named in his honor.  Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0.  In ordinary arithmetic, the successor of &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; x + 1&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing Axiom Five by an axiom schema one obtains a (weaker) first-order theory called ''Peano Arithmetic.''

===Constructions based on set theory===
{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}
{{Also|Ordinal number#Definitions}}

====Von Neumann ordinals&lt;!--'Von Neumann ordinal' and 'Von Neumann ordinals' redirect here--&gt;====

In the area of mathematics called [[set theory]], a specific construction due to [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref name="von Neumann1923pp199-208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Von Neumann|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{harv|Levy|1979|page=52}} attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916 and several papers by von Neumann the 1920s.&lt;/ref&gt; defines the natural numbers as follows:
*Set {{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}}, the [[empty set]],
*Define {{math|''S''(''a'') {{=}} ''a'' ∪ {{mset|''a''}}}} for every set {{math|''a''}}. {{math|''S''(''a'')}} is the successor of {{math|''a''}}, and {{math|''S''}} is called the [[successor function]].
*By the [[axiom of infinity]], there exists a set which contains 0 and is closed under the successor function. Such sets are said to be  'inductive'. The intersection of all such inductive sets is defined to be the set of natural numbers. It can be checked that the set of natural numbers satisfies the [[Peano axioms]].
*It follows that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it:
:*{{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}},
:*{{math|1 {{=}} 0 ∪ {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}},
:*{{math|2 {{=}} 1 ∪ {{mset|1}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}},
:*{{math|3 {{=}} 2 ∪ {{mset|2}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1, 2}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}}}},
:*{{math|''n'' {{=}} ''n''−1 ∪ {{mset|''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|0, 1, …, ''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, …, {{mset|{{mset| }}, {{mset|{{mset| }}}}, …}}}}}}, etc.

With this definition, a natural number {{math|''n''}} is a particular set with {{math|''n''}} elements, and {{math|''n'' ≤ ''m''}} if and only if {{math|''n''}} is a [[subset]] of {{math|''m''}}. The standard definition, now called definition of '''von Neumann ordinals'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is: "each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals."

Also, with this definition, different possible interpretations of notations like {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} ({{math|''n''}}-tuples versus mappings of {{math|''n''}} into {{math|ℝ}}) coincide.

Even if one [[finitism|does not accept the axiom of infinity]] and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.

====Zermelo ordinals&lt;!--'Zermelo ordinal' and 'Zermelo ordinals' redirects here--&gt;====

Although the standard construction is useful, it is not the only possible construction. [[Ernst Zermelo]]'s construction&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt; goes as follows:
*Set {{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}}
*Define {{math|''S''(''a'') {{=}} {{mset|''a''}}}},
*It then follows that
:*{{math|0 {{=}} {{mset| }}}}, 
:*{{math|1 {{=}} {{mset|0}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}, 
:*{{math|2 {{=}} {{mset|1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset|{{mset| }}}}}}}},
:*{{math|''n'' {{=}} {{mset|''n''−1}} {{=}} {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|…}}}}}}}}, etc.
:Each natural number is then equal to the set containing just the natural number preceding it. (This is the definition of '''Zermelo ordinals'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">In [[mathematics]], the '''normal form''' of a [[dynamical system]] is a simplified form that can be useful in determining the system's behavior.

Normal forms are often used for determining local [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]] in a system. All systems exhibiting a certain type of bifurcation are locally (around the equilibrium) [[topological conjugacy|topologically equivalent]] to the normal form of the bifurcation. For example, the normal form of a [[saddle-node bifurcation]] is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mu + x^2 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the bifurcation parameter. The transcritical bifurcation &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = r \ln x + x - 1 &lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt; x=1 &lt;/math&gt; can be converted to the normal form &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mu u - u^2 + O(u^3) &lt;/math&gt; with the transformation &lt;math&gt; u = x -1, \mu = r + 1 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="strogatz"&gt;Strogatz, Steven.

==Life and education==
Turán was born into a [[Jews of Hungary|Jewish]] family in [[Budapest]] on 18 August 1910.&lt;ref name="JNT obit"/&gt;{{Rp|271}}At the same period of time, Turán and Erdős were famous answerers in the journal ''[[KöMaL]]''. He received a teaching degree at the [[University of Budapest]] in 1933 and the [[Ph.D.]] degree under [[Lipót Fejér]] in 1935 at [[Eötvös Loránd University]].&lt;ref name="JNT obit"/&gt;{{Rp|271}}

As a Jew, he fell victim to [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in Hungary|numerus clausus]], and could not get a university job for several years.&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Turan|title=Paul Turán}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to [[Labour service (Hungary)|labour service]] at various times from 1940-44. He is said to have been recognized and perhaps protected by a fascist guard, who, as a mathematics student, had admired Turán's work.&lt;ref&gt;"An officer was standing nearby, watching us work. When he heard my name, he asked the comrade whether I was a mathematician. It turned out, that the officer, Joshef Winkler, was an engineer. In his youth, he had placed in a mathematical competition; in civilian life he was a proof-reader at the print shop where the periodical of the Third Class of the Academy (Mathematical and Natural sciences) was printed. There he had seen some of my manuscripts." P. Turán, "A note of welcome", [[Journal of Graph Theory]] '''1''' (1977), pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turán became associate professor at the [[University of Budapest]] in 1945 and full professor in 1949.&lt;ref name="JNT obit"/&gt;{{Rp|272}} Turán married Edit (Klein) Kóbor in 1939; they had one son, Róbert. Turán married, secondly, to [[Vera Sós]], a mathematician, in 1952; they had two children, György and Tamás.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-2001-03.ps|title=In and Out of Hungary: Paul Erdős, His Friends, and Times|accessdate=22 June 2008|last=Babai|first=László|authorlink=László Babai|year=2001|format=PostScript|publisher=University of Chicago|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207131035/http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-2001-03.ps|archivedate=7 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20}}

Turán worked primarily in [[number theory]],&lt;ref name="Erdos AA obit"/&gt;{{Rp|4}} but also did much work in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[graph theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Number theory===
In 1934, Turán used the [[Turán sieve]] to give a new and very simple proof of a 1917 [[Hardy–Ramanujan theorem|result]] of [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[Ramanujan]] on the [[normal order of an arithmetic function|normal order]] of the number of distinct prime divisors of a number ''n'', namely that it is very close to &lt;math&gt;\ln \ln n&lt;/math&gt;. In probabilistic terms he estimated the variance from &lt;math&gt;\ln \ln n&lt;/math&gt;. [[Gábor Halász (mathematician)|Halász]] says "Its true significance lies in the fact that it was the starting point of [[probabilistic number theory]]".&lt;ref name="Halasz AA obit"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halász|first=G.|year=1980|title=The number-theoretic work of Paul Turán|journal=Acta Arithmetica|volume=37|pages=9–19|issn=0065-1036|url=http://www.numbertheory.org/obituaries/AA/turan/turan_halasz/index.html|accessdate=22 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928070714/http://www.numbertheory.org/obituaries/AA/turan/turan_halasz/index.html|archivedate=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|16}} The [[Turán–Kubilius inequality]] is a generalization of this work.&lt;ref name="Erdos AA obit"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} &lt;ref name="Halasz AA obit"/&gt;{{Rp|16}}

Turán was very interested in the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, and he coined the term "prime number race" for irregularities in the [[distribution of prime numbers]] among [[Modular arithmetic|residue classes]].&lt;ref name="Erdos AA obit" /&gt;{{Rp|5}} With his coauthor Knapowski he proved results concerning [[Chebyshev's bias]]. The Erdős–Turán conjecture makes a statement about [[primes in arithmetic progression]]. Much of Turán's number theory work dealt with the [[Riemann hypothesis]] and he developed the power sum method (see below) to help with this. Erdős said "Turán was an 'unbeliever,' in fact, a 'pagan': he did not believe in the truth of Riemann's hypothesis."&lt;ref name="Erdos JAT"/&gt;{{Rp|3}}

===Analysis===
Much of Turán's work in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] was tied to his number theory work. Outside of this he proved [[Turán's inequalities]] relating the values of the [[Legendre polynomials]] for different indices, and, together with [[Paul Erdős]], the [[Erdős&amp;ndash;Turán inequality|Erdős&amp;ndash;Turán equidistribution inequality]].

===Graph theory===
Erdős wrote of Turán, "In 1940–1941 he created the area of extremal problems in graph theory which is now one of the fastest-growing subjects in combinatorics."&lt;ref name="Erdos JAT"/&gt;{{Rp|4}}[[Peter Frankl]] said of Turán, "He fell victim to Numerus clausus. Mathematicians have only paper and pen, he doesn't have anything in camp. So he created [[combinatorics]] which is not needed both thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imojp.org/column/index.htm|title=数学オリンピック財団|website=www.imojp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is known more briefly today as [[extremal graph theory]]. Turán's best-known result in this area is [[Turán's theorem|Turán's Graph Theorem]], that gives an upper bound on the number of edges in a graph that does not contain the [[complete graph]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a subgraph. He invented the [[Turán graph]], a generalization of the [[complete bipartite graph]], to prove his theorem. He is also known for the [[Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem]] bounding the number of edges that can exist in a bipartite graph with certain forbidden subgraphs, and for raising [[Crossing number (graph theory)|Turán's brick factory problem]], namely of determining the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph.

===Power sum method===
Turán developed the power sum method to work on the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Halasz AA obit" /&gt;{{Rp|9–14}} The method deals with inequalities giving lower bounds for sums of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \max_{\nu=m+1,\dots,m+n} \left | \sum_{j=1}^n b_j z_j^\nu \right |, &lt;/math&gt; hence the name "power sum".&lt;ref name="Tijdeman review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tijdeman|first=R.|authorlink=Robert Tijdeman|date=April 1986|title=Book reviews: On a new method of analysis and its applications|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=14|issue=2|pages=318–22|publisher=American Mathematical Society|location=Providence, RI|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183553181|format=PDF|accessdate=22 June 2008|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1986-15456-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|319}}

Aside from its applications in [[analytic number theory]], it has been used in [[complex analysis]], [[numerical analysis]], [[differential equations]], [[transcendental number theory]], and estimating the number of zeroes of a function in a disk.&lt;ref name="Tijdeman review"/&gt;{{Rp|320}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3847">In [[mathematics]], the '''Riesz mean''' is a certain [[mean]] of the terms in a [[Series (mathematics)|series]]. They were introduced by [[Marcel Riesz]] in 1911 as an improvement over the [[Cesàro mean]]{{ref|Rie11}}{{ref|Hard16}}. The Riesz mean should not be confused with the [[Bochner–Riesz mean]] or the [[Strong–Riesz mean]].

==Definition==
Given a series &lt;math&gt;\{s_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the Riesz mean of the series is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;s^\delta(\lambda) = 
\sum_{n\le \lambda} \left(1-\frac{n}{\lambda}\right)^\delta s_n &lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, a generalized Riesz mean is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R_n = \frac{1}{\lambda_n} \sum_{k=0}^n (\lambda_k-\lambda_{k-1})^\delta s_k&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are sequence with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{n+1}/\lambda_n\to 1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Other than this, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are otherwise taken as arbitrary.

Riesz means are often used to explore the [[summability]] of sequences; typical summability theorems discuss the case of &lt;math&gt;s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k&lt;/math&gt; for some sequence &lt;math&gt;\{a_k\}&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, a sequence is summable when the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} R_n&lt;/math&gt; exists, or the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\delta\to 1,\lambda\to\infty}s^\delta(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; exists, although the precise summability theorems in question often impose additional conditions.

==Special cases==
Let &lt;math&gt;a_n=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_{n\le \lambda} \left(1-\frac{n}{\lambda}\right)^\delta
= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} 
\frac{\Gamma(1+\delta)\Gamma(s)}{\Gamma(1+\delta+s)} \zeta(s) \lambda^s \, ds
= \frac{\lambda}{1+\delta} + \sum_n b_n \lambda^{-n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, one must take &lt;math&gt;c&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]] and &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. The power series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n b_n \lambda^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

can be shown to be convergent for &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the integral is of the form of an inverse [[Mellin transform]].

Another interesting case connected with [[number theory]] arises by taking &lt;math&gt;a_n=\Lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Von Mangoldt function]]. Then

:&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_{n\le \lambda} \left(1-\frac{n}{\lambda}\right)^\delta \Lambda(n)
= - \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} 
\frac{\Gamma(1+\delta)\Gamma(s)}{\Gamma(1+\delta+s)} 
\frac{\zeta^\prime(s)}{\zeta(s)} \lambda^s \, ds
= \frac{\lambda}{1+\delta} + 
\sum_\rho \frac {\Gamma(1+\delta)\Gamma(\rho)}{\Gamma(1+\delta+\rho)}
+\sum_n c_n \lambda^{-n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Again, one must take ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.  The sum over ''ρ'' is the sum over the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function, and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n c_n \lambda^{-n} \, &lt;/math&gt;

is convergent for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

The integrals that occur here are similar to the [[Nörlund–Rice integral]]; very roughly, they can be connected to that integral via [[Perron's formula]].

'''Sarah Flannery''' (born 1982, [[County Cork]], Ireland) was, at sixteen years old, the winner of the 1999 [[Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition|Esat Young Scientist Exhibition]] for development of the [[Cayley–Purser algorithm]], based on work she had done with researchers at [[Baltimore Technologies]] during a brief internship there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/rsa-weighs-in-on-teens-breakthrough/|title=RSA weighs in on teen's 'breakthrough' {{!}} ZDNet|last=Staff|first=ZDNet|work=ZDNet|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, entitled "Cryptography – A new algorithm versus the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]", also won her the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists|EU Young Scientist of the Year Award]] for 1999. Her book ''In Code'' (2001), co-written with her father, mathematician David Flannery, retells the story of the making and breaking of the algorithm, as well as the enjoyment she got from solving mathematical puzzles while growing up. She dedicates many of her accomplishments in the fields of mathematics and cryptography to her father's efforts during her childhood. 

She studied [[computer science]] at [[Peterhouse]], a college of the [[University of Cambridge]], graduating in 2003, and, as of 2006, worked for [[Electronic Arts]] as a software engineer. She worked at [[TirNua]] as a "Chief Scientist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sims.stratics.com/ Tirnua's Team Have EA in Common] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528002950/http://sims.stratics.com/ |date=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;She developed the virtual economy in the game and the back-end web services that powered the game features. She has also worked at RockYou, and several other institutions involved in software development and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=planetmath.org/sarahflannery|title=Sarah Flannery|last=|first=Miravinci|date=22 March 2013|website=planetmath.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time, her interests and achievements in cryptography as a teenager had manifested into a dedication to science in technology. 

Before working at TirNua, Flannery was software engineer working directly with then Electronic Arts Worldwide Chief Technology Officer, Scott Cronce, and, later, with many fellow Tirnua founders on her first virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/28/eas-top-geek-scott-cronce-steers-us-through-gamings-future-technology-interview/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At EA, she successfully set up the EA Open Source program using the [https://enterprise-architecture.org/ Essential Project]. Flannery created data visualizations on software architecture and game content creation which were used to directly impact the quality of both. She also successfully ran and turned around the virtual economy within EA-Land ([[wikipedia:The_Sims_Online|formerly The Sims Online]]).

Previously, she worked on the technical and scientific computing software product [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]] for [[Wolfram Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://company.wolfram.com/announcements/2000/mathematica-and-the-science-of-secrecy/|title=Wolfram Research Announcements » Mathematica and the Science of Secrecy|website=company.wolfram.com|access-date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lights on St. Patrick's Street, one of the main thoroughfares of Flannery's home city of Cork, are named after her.

==Family==

Sarah Flannery is the daughter of David and Elaine Flannery. She has four younger brothers: Mick, Brian, David and Eamonn. Her oldest brother is the singer-songwriter [[Mick Flannery]]. Her education included a primary all-girls school and a secondary co-ed school. 

In 2014, Flannery and her French-American husband, [[Luc Barthelet]], welcomed a child. She also has four stepchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10651">'''Scientific formalism''' is a family of approaches to the presentation of [[science]]. It is viewed as an important part of the [[scientific method]], especially in the [[physical sciences]].

==Levels of formalism==

There are multiple levels of scientific formalism possible. At the lowest level, scientific formalism deals with the symbolic manner in which the information is presented. To achieve formalism in a [[scientific theory]] at this level, one starts with a well defined set of [[axiom]]s, and from this follows a [[formal system]].

However, at a higher level, scientific formalism also involves consideration of the axioms themselves. These can be viewed as questions of [[ontology]]. For example, one can, at the lower level of formalism, define a [[property (philosophy)|property]] called 'existence'. However, at the higher level, the question of whether an [[electron]] exists in the same sense that a [[bacterium]] exists still needs to be resolved.

Some actual formal theories on [[fact]]s have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/formal-theories.html|title=Facts &gt; Some Formal Theories in the Literature (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern physics==

The scientific climate of the twentieth century revived these questions. From about the time of [[Isaac Newton]] to that of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] they had been dormant, in the sense that the physical sciences could rely on the status of the [[real number]]s as a description of the [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], and an agnostic view of [[atom]]s and their structure. [[Quantum mechanics]], the dominant physical theory after about 1925, was formulated in a way which raised questions of both types.

In the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] framework there was indeed a degree of comfort in the answers one could give. Consider for example the question of whether the [[Earth]] really goes round the [[Sun]]. In a [[frame of reference]] adapted to calculating the Earth's orbit, this is a mathematical but also tautological statement. [[Newtonian mechanics]] can answer the question, whether it is not equally the case that the Sun goes round the Earth, as it indeed appears to Earth-based astronomers. In Newton's theory there is a basic, fixed frame of reference that is [[inertial]]. The 'correct answer' is that the point of view of an observer in an inertial frame of reference is privileged: other observers see artifacts of their acceleration relative to an inertial frame (the [[Fictitious force|inertial forces]]). Before Newton, [[Galileo]] would draw the consequences, from the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[heliocentric]] model. He was, however, constrained to call his work (in effect) scientific formalism, under the old 'description' '''saving the phenomena'''. To avoid going against authority, the elliptic orbits of the heliocentric model could be labelled as a more convenient device for calculations, rather than an actual description of reality.

In [[general relativity]], Newton's inertial frames are no longer privileged. In quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]] argued that physical models were not there to provide semantic constructs allowing us to ''understand'' microscopic physics in language comparable to that we use on the familiar scale of everyday objects. His attitude, adopted by many [[theoretical physicist]]s, is that a good model is judged by our capacity to use it to calculate physical quantities that can be tested experimentally. Dirac's view is close to what [[Bas van Fraassen]] calls [[constructive empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/constructive-empiricism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Bradley|last1=Monton|first2=Chad|last2=Mohler|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duhem==
A physicist who took the issues involved seriously was [[Pierre Duhem]], writing at the beginning of the twentieth century. He wrote an extended analysis of the approach he saw as characteristically British, in requiring [[field theory (physics)|field theories]] of theoretical physics to have a mechanical-physical interpretation. That was an accurate characterisation of what Dirac (himself British) would later argue against. The national characteristics specified by Duhem do not need to be taken too seriously, since he also claimed that the use of [[abstract algebra]], namely [[quaternion]]s, was also characteristically British (as opposed to French or German); as if the use of [[classical analysis]] methods alone was important one way or the other.

Duhem also wrote on saving the phenomena. In addition to the [[Copernican revolution]] debate of "saving the phenomena" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: σῴζειν τὰ φαινόμενα, ''sozein ta phainomena''&lt;ref name= "sozein ta phainomena"&gt;An ancient view (attributed to [[Plato]] by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]]) on hypotheses, theories and phaenomena, on what scientists, or more historically accurately (ancient) astronomers, are for, are supposed to do; see

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19270">In [[information theory]], the '''Shannon–Hartley theorem''' tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in the presence of [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  It is an application of the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]] to the archetypal case of a [[continuous-time]] [[Analog signal|analog]] [[communications channel]] subject to [[Gaussian noise]]. The theorem establishes Shannon's [[channel capacity]] for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free [[information]] per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density.  The law is named after [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]] and [[Ralph Hartley]].

==Statement of the theorem==

The Shannon–Hartley theorem states the [[channel capacity]] ''C'', meaning the theoretical tightest upper bound on the [[information rate]] of data that can be communicated at an arbitrarily low [[bit error rate|error rate]] using an average received signal power ''S'' through an analog communication channel subject to [[additive white Gaussian noise]] of power ''N'':

:&lt;math&gt; C =  B \log_2 \left( 1+\frac{S}{N} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''C'' is the [[channel capacity]] in [[bits per second]], a theoretical upper bound on the [[net bit rate]] (information rate, sometimes denoted ''I'') excluding error-correction codes;
:''B'' is the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the channel in [[hertz]] ([[passband]] bandwidth in case of a bandpass signal);
: ''S'' is the average received signal power over the bandwidth (in case of a carrier-modulated passband transmission, often denoted ''[[Carrier-to-noise ratio|C]]''), measured in watts (or volts squared);
: ''N'' is the average power of the noise and interference over the bandwidth, measured in watts (or volts squared); and
:''S/N'' is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) or the [[carrier-to-noise ratio]] (CNR) of the communication signal to the noise and interference at the receiver (expressed as a linear power ratio, not as logarithmic [[decibels]]).

==Historical development==

During the late 1920s, [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]] developed a handful of fundamental ideas related to the transmission of information, particularly in the context of the [[telegraph]] as a communications system.  At the time, these concepts were powerful breakthroughs individually, but they were not part of a comprehensive theory.  In the 1940s, [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]] developed the concept of channel capacity, based in part on the ideas of Nyquist and Hartley, and then formulated a complete theory of information and its transmission.

===Nyquist rate===
{{main|Nyquist rate}}
In 1927, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the channel.  In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;f_p \le 2B &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the pulse frequency (in pulses per second) and ''B'' is the bandwidth (in hertz).  The quantity 2''B'' later came to be called the ''[[Nyquist rate]]'', and transmitting at the limiting pulse rate of 2''B'' pulses per second as ''signalling at the Nyquist rate''.  Nyquist published his results in 1928 as part of his paper "Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory."

===Hartley's law===

During 1928, Hartley formulated a way to quantify information and its [[line rate]] (also known as [[data signalling rate]] ''R'' bits per second).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. V. L. Hartley | title = Transmission of Information | url = http://www.dotrose.com/etext/90_Miscellaneous/transmission_of_information_1928b.pdf |format=PDF| journal = Bell System Technical Journal |date=July 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method, later known as Hartley's law, became an important precursor for Shannon's more sophisticated notion of channel capacity.

Hartley argued that the maximum number of distinguishable pulse levels that can be transmitted and received reliably over a communications channel is limited by the dynamic range of the signal amplitude and the precision with which the receiver can distinguish amplitude levels.  Specifically, if the amplitude of the transmitted signal is restricted to the range of [−''A'' ... +''A''] volts, and the precision of the receiver is ±Δ''V'' volts, then the maximum number of distinct pulses ''M'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;  M  =   1 +  {  A \over \Delta V }.  &lt;/math&gt;

By taking information per pulse in bit/pulse to be the base-2-[[logarithm]] of the number of distinct messages ''M'' that could be sent, Hartley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Theory; and its Engineering Applications | author = D. A. Bell | edition = 3rd | year = 1962 | publisher = Pitman | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a measure of the line rate ''R'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;  R  =   f_p \log_2(M), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the pulse rate, also known as the symbol rate, in symbols/second or [[baud]].

Hartley then combined the above quantification with Nyquist's observation that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a channel of bandwidth ''B'' [[hertz]] was 2''B'' pulses per second, to arrive at his quantitative measure for achievable line rate.

Hartley's law is sometimes quoted as just a proportionality between the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|analog bandwidth]], ''B'', in Hertz and what today is called the [[bandwidth (computing)|digital bandwidth]], ''R'', in bit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to Telecommunications | edition = 2nd| author = Anu A. Gokhale | publisher = Thomson Delmar Learning | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4018-5648-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QowmxWAOEtYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22hartley%27s+law%22+proportional }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other times it is quoted in this more quantitative form, as an achievable line rate of ''R'' bits per second:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Telecommunications Engineering | author = John Dunlop and D. Geoffrey Smith | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-kyPyn3Dst8C&amp;pg=RA4-PA30&amp;dq=%22hartley%27s+law%22 | isbn = 0-7487-4044-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R \le 2B \log_2(M). &lt;/math&gt;

Hartley did not work out exactly how the number ''M'' should depend on the noise statistics of the channel, or how the communication could be made reliable even when individual symbol pulses could not be reliably distinguished to ''M'' levels; with Gaussian noise statistics, system designers had to choose a very conservative value of ''M''  to achieve a low error rate.

The concept of an error-free capacity awaited Claude Shannon, who built on Hartley's observations about a logarithmic measure of information and Nyquist's observations about the effect of bandwidth limitations.

Hartley's rate result can be viewed as the capacity of an errorless ''M''-ary channel of 2''B'' symbols per second.  Some authors refer to it as a capacity.  But such an errorless channel is an idealization, and if M is chosen small enough to make the noisy channel nearly errorless, the result is necessarily less than the Shannon capacity of the noisy channel of bandwidth ''B'', which is the Hartley–Shannon result that followed later.

===Noisy channel coding theorem and capacity===
{{main|Noisy-channel coding theorem}}
[[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]]'s development of [[information theory]] during World War II provided the next big step in understanding how much information could be reliably communicated through noisy channels.  Building on Hartley's foundation, Shannon's [[noisy channel coding theorem]] (1948) describes the maximum possible efficiency of [[error-correcting code|error-correcting methods]] versus levels of noise interference and data corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Claude E. Shannon|C. E. Shannon]] | title = The Mathematical Theory of Communication | publisher = Urbana, IL:University of Illinois Press | origyear = 1949| year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Claude E. Shannon|C. E. Shannon]] | title = Communication in the presence of noise | url = http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–21 | date = January 1949 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100208112344/http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf | archivedate = 2010-02-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof of the theorem shows that a randomly constructed error-correcting code is essentially as good as the best possible code; the theorem is proved through the statistics of such random codes.

Shannon's theorem shows how to compute a [[channel capacity]] from a statistical description of a channel, and establishes that given a noisy channel with capacity C and information transmitted at a line rate ''R'', then if

:&lt;math&gt; R &lt; C &lt;/math&gt;

there exists a coding technique which allows the probability of error at the receiver to be made arbitrarily small. This means that theoretically, it is possible to transmit information nearly without error up to nearly a limit of C bits per second.

The converse is also important. If

:&lt;math&gt; R &gt; C &lt;/math&gt;

the probability of error at the receiver increases without bound as the rate is increased. So no useful information can be transmitted beyond the channel capacity.  The theorem does not address the rare situation in which rate and capacity are equal.

The Shannon–Hartley theorem establishes what that channel capacity is for a finite-bandwidth [[continuous-time]] channel subject to Gaussian noise.  It connects Hartley's result with Shannon's channel capacity theorem in a form that is equivalent to specifying the ''M'' in Hartley's line rate formula in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio, but achieving reliability through error-correction coding rather than through reliably distinguishable pulse levels.

If there were such a thing as a noise-free analog channel, one could transmit unlimited amounts of error-free data over it per unit of time (Note: An infinite-bandwidth analog channel can't transmit unlimited amounts of error-free data, without infinite signal power). Real channels, however, are subject to limitations imposed by both finite bandwidth and nonzero noise.

Bandwidth and noise affect the rate at which information can be transmitted over an analog channel. Bandwidth limitations alone do not impose a cap on the maximum information rate because it is still possible for the signal to take on an indefinitely large number of different voltage levels on each symbol pulse, with each slightly different level being assigned a different meaning or bit sequence. Taking into account both noise and bandwidth limitations, however, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be transferred by a signal of a bounded power, even when sophisticated multi-level encoding techniques are used.

In the channel considered by the Shannon–Hartley theorem, noise and signal are combined by addition.  That is, the receiver measures a signal that is equal to the sum of the signal encoding the desired information and a continuous random variable that represents the noise.   This addition creates uncertainty as to the original signal's value.   If the receiver has some information about the random process that generates the noise, one can in principle recover the information in the original signal by considering all possible states of the noise process.  In the case of the Shannon–Hartley theorem, the noise is assumed to be generated by a Gaussian process with a known variance.  Since the variance of a Gaussian process is equivalent to its power, it is conventional to call this variance the noise power.

Such a channel is called the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel, because Gaussian noise is added to the signal; "white" means equal amounts of noise at all frequencies within the channel bandwidth.  Such noise can arise both from random sources of energy and also from coding and measurement error at the sender and receiver respectively.  Since sums of independent Gaussian random variables are themselves Gaussian random variables, this conveniently simplifies analysis, if one assumes that such error sources are also Gaussian and independent.

==Implications of the theorem==

===Comparison of Shannon's capacity to Hartley's law===
Comparing the channel capacity to the information rate from Hartley's law, we can find the effective number of distinguishable levels ''M'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory: symbols, signals &amp; noise
| author = John Robinson Pierce | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fXxde44_0zsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=intitle:information+intitle:theory+inauthor:pierce | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-486-24061-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2B \log_2(M) = B \log_2 \left( 1+\frac{S}{N} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = \sqrt{1+\frac{S}{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The square root effectively converts the power ratio back to a voltage ratio, so the number of levels is approximately proportional to the ratio of signal [[RMS amplitude]] to noise standard deviation.

This similarity in form between Shannon's capacity and Hartley's law should not be interpreted to mean that ''M'' pulse levels can be literally sent without any confusion. More levels are needed to allow for redundant coding and error correction, but the net data rate that can be approached with coding is equivalent to using that ''M'' in Hartley's law.

==Alternative forms==

===Frequency-dependent (colored noise) case===

In the simple version above, the signal and noise are fully uncorrelated, in which case ''S'' + ''N'' is the total power of the received signal and noise together. A generalization of the above equation for the case where the additive noise is not white (or that the {{tmath|S/N}} is not constant with frequency over the bandwidth) is obtained by treating the channel as many narrow, independent Gaussian channels in parallel:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \int_{0}^B  \log_2 \left( 1+\frac{S(f)}{N(f)} \right) df  &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''C'' is the [[channel capacity]] in bits per second;
:''B'' is the bandwidth of the channel in Hz;
: {{tmath|S(f)}} is the signal [[power spectrum]]
: {{tmath|N(f)}} is the noise power spectrum
: {{mvar|f}} is frequency in Hz.

Note: the theorem only applies to Gaussian [[stationary process]] noise. This formula's way of introducing frequency-dependent noise cannot describe all continuous-time noise processes.  For example, consider a noise process consisting of adding a random wave whose amplitude is 1 or &amp;minus;1 at any point in time, and a channel that adds such a wave to the source signal.  Such a wave's frequency components are highly dependent.  Though such a noise may have a high power, it is fairly easy to transmit a continuous signal with much less power than one would need if the underlying noise was a sum of independent noises in each frequency band.

===Approximations===
For large or small and constant signal-to-noise ratios, the capacity formula can be approximated:

* If S/N &gt;&gt; 1, then

::&lt;math&gt; C \approx 0.332 \cdot B \cdot \mathrm{SNR\ (in\ dB)} &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR\ (in \ dB)} = 10\log_{10}{S \over N}. &lt;/math&gt;

* Similarly, if S/N &lt;&lt; 1,  then

::&lt;math&gt; C \approx 1.44 \cdot B \cdot {S \over N}.&lt;/math&gt;

:In this low-SNR approximation, capacity is independent of bandwidth if the noise is white, of [[spectral density]] &lt;Math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; watts per hertz, in which case the total noise power is &lt;math&gt;B \cdot N_0&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt; C \approx 1.44  \cdot {S \over N_0}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
# At a SNR of 0&amp;nbsp;dB (Signal power = Noise power) the Capacity in bits/s is equal to the bandwidth in hertz. 
# If the SNR is 20&amp;nbsp;dB, and the bandwidth available is 4&amp;nbsp;kHz, which is appropriate for telephone communications, then C = 4000 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1 + 100) = 4000 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (101) = 26.63 kbit/s. Note that the value of S/N = 100 is equivalent to the SNR of 20&amp;nbsp;dB.
# If the requirement is to transmit at 50 kbit/s, and a bandwidth of 10&amp;nbsp;kHz is used, then the minimum S/N required is given by 50000 = 10000 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1+S/N) so C/B = 5 then S/N = 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; −1 = 31, corresponding to an SNR of 14.91&amp;nbsp;dB (10 x log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(31)).
# What is the channel capacity for a signal having a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth, received with a SNR of -30&amp;nbsp;dB ? That means a signal deeply buried in noise. -30&amp;nbsp;dB means a S/N = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. It leads to a maximal rate of information of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1 + 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1443 bits/s. These values are typical of the received ranging signals of the GPS, where the navigation message is sent at 50 bits/s (below the channel capacity for the given S/N), and whose bandwidth is spread to around 1&amp;nbsp;MHz by a pseudo-noise multiplication before transmission.
# As stated above, channel capacity is proportional to the bandwidth of the channel and to the logarithm of SNR. This means channel capacity can be increased linearly either by increasing the channel's bandwidth given a fixed SNR requirement or, with fixed bandwidth, by using [[higher-order modulation]]s that need a very high SNR to operate. As the modulation rate increases, the [[spectral efficiency]] improves, but at the cost of the SNR requirement. Thus, there is an exponential rise in the SNR requirement if one adopts a 16QAM or 64QAM (see: [[Quadrature amplitude modulation]]); however, the spectral efficiency improves.
# In MIMO. When the number of antenna beams are increased the channel capacity also gets increased. The correlation between the number of MIMO antennas and throughput is still not linear.

This concept is usually applied to [[abstract strategy game]]s, and especially to games with full information and no element of chance;
solving such a game may use [[combinatorial game theory]] and/or computer assistance.

==Overview==
A [[two-player game]] can be solved on several levels:&lt;ref name="Allis"&gt;

;Ultra-weak
: Prove whether the first player will win, lose or draw from the initial position, given [[#Perfect play|perfect play]] on both sides. This can be a [[Constructive proof|non-constructive]] proof (possibly involving a [[strategy-stealing argument]]) that need not actually determine any moves of the perfect play.

;Weak
: Provide an algorithm that secures a win for one player, or a draw for either, against any possible moves by the opponent, from the beginning of the game. That is, produce at least one complete ideal game (all moves start to end) with proof that each move is optimal for the player making it. It does not necessarily mean a computer program using the solution will play optimally against an imperfect opponent. For example, the checkers program [[Chinook (draughts player)|Chinook]] will never turn a drawn position into a losing position (since the weak solution of checkers proves that it is a draw), but it might possibly turn a winning position into a drawn position because Chinook does not expect the opponent to play a move that will not win but could possibly lose, and so it does not analyze such moves completely.

;Strong
: Provide an algorithm that can produce perfect moves from any position, even if mistakes have already been made on one or both sides.

Despite their name, many game theorists believe that "ultra-weak" proofs are the deepest, most interesting and valuable. "Ultra-weak" proofs require a scholar to reason about the abstract properties of the game, and show how these properties lead to certain outcomes if perfect play is realized.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By contrast, "strong" proofs often proceed by brute force—using a computer to exhaustively search a game tree to figure out what would happen if perfect play were realized. The resulting proof gives an optimal strategy for every possible position on the board. However, these proofs are not as helpful in understanding deeper reasons why some games are solvable as a draw, and other, seemingly very similar games are solvable as a win.

Given the rules of any two-person game with a finite number of positions, one can always trivially construct a [[minimax]] algorithm that would exhaustively traverse the [[game tree]]. However, since for many non-trivial games such an algorithm would require an infeasible amount of time to generate a move in a given position, a game is not considered to be solved weakly or strongly unless the algorithm can be run by existing hardware in a reasonable time. Many algorithms rely on a huge pre-generated database, and are effectively nothing more.

As an example of a strong solution, the game of [[tic-tac-toe]] is solvable as a draw for both players with perfect play (a result even manually determinable by schoolchildren). Games like [[nim]] also admit a rigorous analysis using [[combinatorial game theory]].

Whether a game is solved is not necessarily the same as whether it remains interesting for humans to play. Even a strongly solved game can still be interesting if its solution is too complex to be memorized; conversely, a weakly solved game may lose its attraction if the winning strategy is simple enough to remember (e.g. [[Maharajah and the Sepoys]]). An ultra-weak solution (e.g. [[Chomp]] or [[Hex (board game)|Hex]] on a sufficiently large board) generally does not affect playability.

Moreover, even if the game is not solved, it is possible that an algorithm yields a good approximate solution: for instance, an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' from January 2015 claims that their [[Heads up poker|heads up]] limit [[Texas hold 'em]] poker bot [[Cepheus (poker bot)|Cepheus]] guarantees that a human lifetime of play is not sufficient to establish with statistical significance that its strategy is not an exact solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1259433 |title=Heads-up limit hold’em poker is solved | pmid=25574016 | volume=347 |date=Jan 2015 |journal=Science |pages=145–9|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Ebowling/papers/15science.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game Theorists Crack Poker |agency=Nature |website=Scientific American |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/game-theorists-crack-poker/ |author=Philip Ball |date=2015-01-08 |accessdate=2015-01-13 |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.16683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-conquers-texas-hold-em-canadian-researchers-say-1420743623 |title=Computer Conquers Texas Hold 'Em, Researchers Say |author=Robert Lee Hotz |date=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect play==

In [[game theory]], '''perfect play''' is the behavior or strategy of a player that leads to the best possible outcome for that player regardless of the response by the opponent. Perfect play for a game is known when the game is solved.&lt;ref name="Allis"/&gt; Based on the rules of a game, every possible final position can be evaluated (as a win, loss or draw). By [[backward chaining|backward reasoning]], one can recursively evaluate a non-final position as identical to the position that is one move away and best valued for the player whose move it is. Thus a transition between positions can never result in a better evaluation for the moving player, and a perfect move in a position would be a transition between positions that are equally evaluated. As an example, a perfect player in a drawn position would always get a draw or win, never a loss. If there are multiple options with the same outcome, perfect play is sometimes considered the fastest method leading to a good result, or the slowest method leading to a bad result.

Perfect play can be generalized to non-[[perfect information]] games, as the strategy that would guarantee the highest minimal [[expected value|expected outcome]] regardless of the strategy of the opponent. As an example, the perfect strategy for [[rock–paper–scissors]] would be to randomly choose each of the options with equal (1/3) probability. The disadvantage in this example is that this strategy will never exploit non-optimal strategies of the opponent, so the expected outcome of this strategy versus any strategy will always be equal to the minimal expected outcome.

Although the optimal strategy of a game may not (yet) be known, a game-playing computer might still benefit from solutions of the game from certain [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions (in the form of [[endgame tablebase]]s), which will allow it to play perfectly after some point in the game. [[Computer chess]] programs are well known for doing this.

==Solved games==

; [[Kalah]]
: Most variants solved by Geoffrey Irving, Jeroen Donkers and Jos Uiterwijk (2000) except Kalah (6/6). The (6/6) variant was solved by Anders Carstensen (2011). Strong first-player advantage was proven in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/~irving/papers/irving2000_kalah.pdf Solving Kalah] by Geoffrey Irving, Jeroen Donkers and Jos Uiterwijk.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kalaha.krus.dk/ Solving (6,6)-Kalaha] by Anders Carstensen.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Rawlings, of Gaithersburg, MD, has quantified the magnitude of the first player win in the (6/6) variant (2015).  After creation of 39 GB of endgame databases, searches totaling 106 days of CPU time and over 55 trillion nodes, it was proven that, with perfect play, the first player wins by 2. Note that all these results refer to the Empty-pit Capture variant and therefore are of very limited interest for the standard game.  Analysis of the standard rule game has now been posted for Kalah(6,4), which is a win by 8 for the first player, and Kalah(6,5), which is a win by 10 for the first player. Analysis of Kalah(6,6) with the standard rules is on-going, however, it has been proven that it is a win by at least 4 for the first player.

==Partially solved games==

; [[Chess]]
{{main|Solving chess}}
: Fully solving chess remains elusive, and it is speculated that the complexity of the game may preclude it ever being solved. Through [[retrograde analysis|retrograde computer analysis]], [[endgame tablebase]]s (strong solutions) have been found for all three- to seven-piece, and some eight-piece [[Chess endgame|endgames]], counting the two [[King (chess)|kings]] as pieces.
: Some [[Minichess|variants of chess on a smaller board with reduced numbers of pieces]] have been solved.

[[Image:Spherical_Harmonics.png|right|thumb|300px|Visual representations of the first few real spherical harmonics. Blue portions represent regions where the function is positive, and yellow portions represent where it is negative. The distance of the surface from the origin indicates the value of &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in angular direction &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In  [[mathematics]] and physical science, '''spherical harmonics''' are [[special function]]s defined on the surface of a [[sphere]]. They are often employed in solving [[partial differential equation]]s that commonly occur in science. The spherical harmonics are a complete set of [[orthogonal functions]] on the sphere, and thus may be used to represent functions defined on the surface of a sphere, just as circular functions (sines and cosines) are used to represent functions on a circle via [[Fourier series]]. Like the sines and cosines in Fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. Further, spherical harmonics are [[Basis function|basis functions]] for [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]], the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus play a central role in the [[group theory|group theoretic]] discussion of SO(3).

Despite their name, spherical harmonics take their simplest form in [[Cartesian coordinates]], where they can be defined as homogeneous polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; that obey [[Laplace's equation]]. Functions that satisfy Laplace's equation are often said to be [[harmonic function|harmonic]], hence the name spherical harmonics. The connection with [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] arises immediately if one uses the homogeneity to extract a factor of &lt;math&gt;r^\ell&lt;/math&gt; from the above-mentioned polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;; the remaining factor can be regarded as a function of the spherical angular coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; only, or equivalently of the orientational unit vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; specified by these angles. In this setting, they may be viewed as the angular portion of a set of solutions to Laplace's equation in three dimensions, and this viewpoint is often taken as an alternative definition.

A specific set of spherical harmonics, denoted &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m(\theta,\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m({\mathbf r})&lt;/math&gt;, are called Laplace's spherical harmonics, as they were first introduced by [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;A historical account of various approaches to spherical harmonics in three-dimensions can be found in Chapter IV of {{harvnb|MacRobert|1967}}.  The term "Laplace spherical harmonics" is in common use; see {{harvnb|Courant|Hilbert|1962}} and {{harvnb|Meijer|Bauer|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These functions
form an [[orthogonal]] system, and are thus basic to the expansion of a general function on the sphere as alluded to above.

Spherical harmonics are important in many theoretical and practical applications, e.g., the representation of multipole electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, computation of [[atomic orbital]] [[electron configuration]]s, representation of [[gravitational field]]s, [[geoid]]s, fiber reconstruction for estimation of the path and location of neural axons based on the properties of water diffusion from diffusion-weighted MRI imaging for streamline tractography, and the [[magnetic field]]s of [[Planet|planetary bodies]] and stars, and characterization of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. In [[3D computer graphics]], spherical harmonics play a role in a wide variety of topics including indirect lighting ([[ambient occlusion]], [[global illumination]], [[Precomputed Radiance Transfer|precomputed radiance transfer]], etc.) and modelling of 3D shapes.

==History==
Spherical harmonics were first investigated in connection with the [[Newtonian potential]] of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in three dimensions.  In 1782, [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] had, in his ''Mécanique Céleste'', determined that the [[gravitational potential]] at a point '''x''' associated with a set of point masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; located at points '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; was given by

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_i \frac{m_i}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each term in the above summation is an individual Newtonian potential for a point mass. Just prior to that time, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] had investigated the expansion of the Newtonian potential in powers of ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|'''x'''| and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|.  He discovered that if ''r'' ≤ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}|} = P_0(\cos\gamma)\frac{1}{r_1} + P_1(\cos\gamma)\frac{r}{r_1^2} + P_2(\cos\gamma)\frac{r^2}{r_1^3}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

where γ is the angle between the vectors '''x''' and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The functions ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Legendre polynomials]], and they are a special case of spherical harmonics. Subsequently, in his 1782 memoire, Laplace investigated these coefficients using spherical coordinates to represent the angle γ between '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''.  (See [[Legendre polynomials#Applications of Legendre polynomials in physics|Applications of Legendre polynomials in physics]] for a more detailed analysis.)

In 1867, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] introduced the [[solid spherical harmonics]] in their ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'', and also first introduced the name of "spherical harmonics" for these functions.  The solid harmonics were [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] polynomial solutions of [[Laplace's equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
By examining Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, Thomson and Tait recovered Laplace's spherical harmonics. (See the section below, "Harmonic polynomial representation".)  The term "Laplace's coefficients" was employed by [[William Whewell]] to describe the particular system of solutions introduced along these lines, whereas others reserved this designation for the [[zonal spherical harmonics]] that had properly been introduced by Laplace and Legendre.

The 19th century development of [[Fourier series]] made possible the solution of a wide variety of physical problems in rectangular domains, such as the solution of the [[heat equation]] and [[wave equation]].  This could be achieved by expansion of functions in series of [[trigonometric function]]s.  Whereas the trigonometric functions in a Fourier series represent the fundamental modes of vibration in a [[vibrating string|string]], the spherical harmonics represent the fundamental modes of vibration of a sphere in much the same way.  Many aspects of the theory of Fourier series could be generalized by taking expansions in spherical harmonics rather than trigonometric functions.  This was a boon for problems possessing [[spherical symmetry]], such as those of celestial mechanics originally studied by Laplace and Legendre.

The prevalence of spherical harmonics already in physics set the stage for their later importance in the 20th century birth of [[quantum mechanics]].  The spherical harmonics are [[eigenfunction]]s of the square of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] operator
:&lt;math&gt;-i\hbar\mathbf{r}\times\nabla,&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore they represent the different [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] configurations of [[atomic orbitals]].

[[File:Rotating spherical harmonics.gif|thumb|right|Real (Laplace) spherical harmonics {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for {{math|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, …, 4}} (top to bottom) and {{math|''m'' {{=}} 0, …, ''ℓ''}} (left to right). Zonal, sectoral, and tesseral harmonics are depicted along the left-most column, the main diagonal, and elsewhere, respectively. (The negative order harmonics &lt;math&gt;Y_{\ell}^{-m}&lt;/math&gt; would be shown rotated about the ''z'' axis by &lt;math&gt;90^\circ/m&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the positive order ones.)]]

[[Laplace's equation]] imposes that the [[divergence]] of the [[gradient]] of a scalar field {{math|''f''}} is zero. In [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] this is:&lt;ref&gt;The approach to spherical harmonics taken here is found in {{harv|Courant|Hilbert|1966|loc=§V.8, §VII.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right) 
  + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin\theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin\theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}\right) 
  + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \varphi^2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the problem of finding solutions of the form {{math|''f''(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'') {{=}} ''R''(''r'') ''Y''(''θ'', ''φ'')}}.  By [[separation of variables#pde|separation of variables]], two differential equations result by imposing Laplace's equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right) = \lambda,\qquad \frac{1}{Y}\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{Y}\frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\varphi^2} = -\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;
The second equation can be simplified under the assumption that {{math|''Y''}} has the form {{math|''Y''(''θ'', ''φ'') {{=}} Θ(''θ'') Φ(''φ'')}}. Applying separation of variables again to the second equation gives way to the pair of differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Phi} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\varphi^2} = -m^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\sin^2\theta + \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left(\sin\theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) = m^2&lt;/math&gt;

for some number {{math|''m''}}. A priori, {{math|''m''}} is a complex constant, but because {{math|Φ}} must be a [[periodic function]] whose period evenly divides {{math|2''π''}}, {{math|''m''}} is necessarily an integer and {{math|Φ}} is a linear combination of the complex exponentials {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;± ''imφ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The solution function {{math|''Y''(''θ'', ''φ'')}} is regular at the poles of the sphere, where {{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0, ''π''}}.  Imposing this regularity in the solution {{math|Θ}} of the second equation at the boundary points of the domain is a [[Sturm–Liouville problem]] that forces the parameter {{math|''λ''}} to be of the form {{math|''λ'' {{=}} ''ℓ'' (''ℓ'' + 1)}} for some non-negative integer with {{math|''ℓ'' ≥ {{!}}''m''{{!}}}}; this is also explained [[#Orbital angular momentum|below]] in terms of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]].  Furthermore, a change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} cos ''θ''}} transforms this equation into the [[associated Legendre function|Legendre equation]], whose solution is a multiple of the [[associated Legendre polynomial]] {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''(cos ''θ'')}} .  Finally, the equation for {{math|''R''}} has solutions of the form {{math|''R''(''r'') {{=}} ''A r&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''B r''&lt;sup&gt;−''ℓ'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}; requiring the solution to be regular throughout {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} forces {{math|''B'' {{=}} 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Physical applications often take the solution that vanishes at infinity, making {{math|''A'' {{=}} 0}}.  This does not affect the angular portion of the spherical harmonics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here the solution was assumed to have the special form {{math|''Y''(''θ'', ''φ'') {{=}} Θ(''θ'') Φ(''φ'')}}.  For a given value of {{math|''ℓ''}}, there are {{math|2''ℓ'' + 1}} independent solutions of this form, one for each integer {{math|''m''}} with {{math|−''ℓ'' ≤ ''m'' ≤ ''ℓ''}}.  These angular solutions are a product of [[trigonometric function]]s, here represented as a [[Euler's formula|complex exponential]], and associated Legendre polynomials:

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m (\theta, \varphi ) = N e^{i m \varphi } P_\ell^m (\cos{\theta} )&lt;/math&gt;

which fulfill

:&lt;math&gt; r^2\nabla^2 Y_\ell^m (\theta, \varphi ) = -\ell (\ell + 1 ) Y_\ell^m (\theta, \varphi ).&lt;/math&gt;

Here  {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is called a spherical harmonic function of degree {{math|''ℓ''}} and order {{math|''m''}}, {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is an [[associated Legendre polynomial]], {{math|''N''}} is a normalization constant, and {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''φ''}} represent colatitude and longitude, respectively. In particular, the [[colatitude]] {{math|''θ''}}, or polar angle, ranges from {{math|''0''}} at the North Pole, to {{math|''π''/2}} at the Equator, to {{math|''π''}} at the South Pole, and the [[longitude]] {{math|''φ''}}, or [[azimuth]], may assume all values with {{math|0 ≤ ''φ'' &lt; 2''π''}}.  For a fixed integer {{math|''ℓ''}}, every solution {{math|''Y''(''θ'', ''φ'')}} of the eigenvalue problem
:&lt;math&gt; r^2\nabla^2 Y = -\ell (\ell + 1 ) Y&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[linear combination]] of {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.  In fact, for any such solution, {{math|''r&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt; Y''(''θ'', ''φ'')}} is the expression in spherical coordinates of a [[homogeneous polynomial]] that is harmonic (see [[#Higher dimensions|below]]), and so counting dimensions shows that there are {{math|2''ℓ'' + 1}} linearly independent such polynomials.

The general solution to Laplace's equation in a ball centered at the origin is a [[linear combination]] of the spherical harmonic functions multiplied by the appropriate scale factor {{math|''r&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;''}},

:&lt;math&gt; f(r, \theta, \varphi) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell f_\ell^m r^\ell  Y_\ell^m (\theta, \varphi ), &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are constants and the factors {{math|''r&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt; Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are known as [[solid harmonics]].  Such an expansion is valid in the [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]

:&lt;math&gt; r &lt; R = \frac{1}{\limsup_{\ell\to\infty} |f_\ell^m|^{\frac{1}{\ell}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Orbital angular momentum===
In quantum mechanics, Laplace's spherical harmonics are understood in terms of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonds|1957|loc=§2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = -i\hbar (\mathbf{x}\times \mathbf{\nabla}) = L_x\mathbf{i} + L_y\mathbf{j}+L_z\mathbf{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
The {{math|''ħ''}} is conventional in quantum mechanics; it is convenient to work in units in which {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}}.  The spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{L}^2 &amp;= -r^2\nabla^2 + \left(r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+1\right)r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{\sin\theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\sin\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} - \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \varphi^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Laplace's spherical harmonics are the joint eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum and the generator of rotations about the azimuthal axis:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_z &amp;= -i\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y} - y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)\\
&amp;=-i\frac{\partial}{\partial\varphi}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These operators commute, and are [[unbounded operator|densely defined]]  [[self-adjoint operator]]s on the [[Hilbert space]] of functions ''f'' square-integrable with respect to the [[normal distribution]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}\int_{\mathbf{R}^3} |f(x)|^2 e^{-|x|^2/2}\,dx &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
Furthermore, '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[positive operator]].

If ''Y'' is a joint eigenfunction of '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, then by definition
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{L}^2Y &amp;= \lambda Y\\
L_zY &amp;= mY
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for some real numbers ''m'' and λ.  Here ''m'' must in fact be an integer, for ''Y'' must be periodic in the coordinate φ with period a number that evenly divides 2π.  Furthermore, since
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}^2 = L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2&lt;/math&gt;
and each of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are self-adjoint, it follows that λ&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Denote this joint eigenspace by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define the [[raising and lowering operators]] by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
L_+ &amp;= L_x + iL_y\\
L_- &amp;= L_x - iL_y
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; commute with '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Lie algebra generated by ''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[special linear Lie algebra]] of order 2, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;, with commutation relations
:&lt;math&gt;[L_z,L_+] = L_+,\quad [L_z,L_-] = -L_-, \quad [L_+,L_-] = 2L_z.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; : ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} (it is a "raising operator") and {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; : ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} (it is a "lowering operator").  In particular, {{nowrap|1=''L''{{su|b=+|p=''k''}} : ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''+''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be zero for ''k'' sufficiently large, because the inequality λ&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must hold in each of the nontrivial joint eigenspaces.  Let ''Y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;λ,''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be a nonzero joint eigenfunction, and let ''k'' be the least integer such that
:&lt;math&gt;L_+^kY = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, since
:&lt;math&gt;L_-L_+ = \mathbf{L}^2 - L_z^2 - L_z&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;0=L_-L_+^k Y = (\lambda - (m+k)^2-(m+k))Y.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ℓ(ℓ+1) for the positive integer {{nowrap|1=ℓ = ''m''+''k''}}.

==Harmonic polynomial representation==
See also the section below on spherical harmonics in higher dimensions.

The spherical harmonics can be expressed as the restriction to the unit sphere of certain polynomial functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, we say that a polynomial function &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; is ''homogeneous of degree'' &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; if 
:&lt;math&gt;p(c\mathbf x)=c^\ell p(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; 
for all real numbers &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is ''harmonic'' if
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p=0&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplacian]]. Then for each &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, we define
:&lt;math&gt;V_\ell=\{\text{harmonic polynomials on }\mathbb R^3 \text{ that are homogeneous of degree }\ell\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, when &lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is just the 3-dimensional space of all linear functions, since any such function is automatically harmonic. Meanwhile, when &lt;math&gt;\ell=2&lt;/math&gt;, we have a 5-dimensional space:
:&lt;math&gt;V_2=\mathrm{span}(x_1x_2,\,x_1x_3,\,x_2x_3,\,x_1^2-x_2^2,\,x_1^2-x_3^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

For any &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the space of spherical harmonics of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is just the space of restrictions to the sphere of the elements of &lt;math&gt;V_\ell&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.6&lt;/ref&gt; As suggested in the introduction, this perspective is presumably the origin of the term "spherical harmonic" (i.e., the restriction to the sphere of a harmonic function).

For example, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;p(x_1,x_2,x_3)=c(x_1+ix_2)^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
defines a homogeneous polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;, which happens to be independent of &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial is easily seen to be harmonic. If we write &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in spherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and then restrict to &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;p(\theta,\phi)=c\,\mathrm{sin}(\theta)^\ell (\mathrm{cos}(\phi)+i\,\mathrm{sin}(\phi))^\ell,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;p(\theta,\phi)=c\left(\sqrt{1-\mathrm{cos}^2(\theta)}\right)^\ell e^{i\ell\phi}.&lt;/math&gt;
After using the formula for the [[Associated Legendre polynomials|associated Legendre polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;P^\ell_\ell&lt;/math&gt;, we  may recognize this as the formula for the spherical harmonic &lt;math&gt;Y^\ell_\ell(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Lemma 17.16&lt;/ref&gt; (See the section below on special cases of the spherical harmonics.)

==Conventions==

===Orthogonality and normalization===
{{Disputed section|Condon-Shortley phase|date = December 2017}}

Several different normalizations are in common use for the Laplace spherical harmonic functions. Throughout the section, we use the standard convention that (see [[associated Legendre polynomials]])

:&lt;math&gt;P_\ell ^{-m} = (-1)^m \frac{(\ell-m)!}{(\ell+m)!} P_\ell ^{m}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the natural normalization given by Rodrigues' formula.

In [[acoustics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181010993|title=Fourier acoustics : sound radiation and nearfield acoustical holography|last=George)|first=Williams, Earl G. (Earl|date=1999|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0080506909|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=181010993}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Laplace spherical harmonics are generally defined as (this is the convention used in this article)

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) = \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}}  \, P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} ) \, e^{i m \varphi } &lt;/math&gt;
while in [[quantum mechanics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messiah|first=Albert|title=Quantum mechanics : two volumes bound as one|year=1999|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, NY|isbn=9780486409245|edition=Two vol. bound as one, unabridged reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, Franck Laloë; transl. from the French by Susan Reid Hemley ... [et|title=Quantum mechanics.|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=9780471569527}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) = (-1)^m \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}}  \, P_{\ell m} ( \cos{\theta} ) \, e^{i m \varphi } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{\ell m}&lt;/math&gt; are associated Legendre polynomials without the Condon–Shortley phase (to avoid counting the phase twice).

In both definitions, the spherical harmonics are orthonormal

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta=0}^\pi\int_{\varphi=0}^{2\pi}Y_\ell^m \, Y_{\ell'}^{m'}{}^* \, d\Omega=\delta_{\ell\ell'}\, \delta_{mm'},&lt;/math&gt;

where δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] and ''d''Ω = sinθ ''d''φ ''d''θ. This normalization is used in quantum mechanics because it ensures that probability is normalized, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\int{|Y_\ell^m|^2 d\Omega} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The disciplines of [[geodesy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blakely | first = Richard | title = Potential theory in gravity and magnetic applications | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0521415088 | page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spectral analysis use

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) =  \sqrt{{(2\ell+1) }{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}} \, P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} )\, e^{i m \varphi }  &lt;/math&gt;

which possess unit power

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 4 \pi} \int_{\theta=0}^\pi\int_{\varphi=0}^{2\pi}Y_\ell^m \, Y_{\ell'}^{m'}{}^* d\Omega=\delta_{\ell\ell'}\, \delta_{mm'}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Magnetism|magnetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blakely | first = Richard | title = Potential theory in gravity and magnetic applications | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0521415088 | page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; community, in contrast, uses Schmidt semi-normalized harmonics

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) = \sqrt{{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}}  \, P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} ) \, e^{i m \varphi }&lt;/math&gt;

which have the normalization

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\theta=0}^\pi\int_{\varphi=0}^{2\pi}Y_\ell^m \, Y_{\ell'}^{m'}{}^*d\Omega={4 \pi \over (2 \ell + 1)}\delta_{\ell\ell'}\, \delta_{mm'}.&lt;/math&gt;

In quantum mechanics this normalization is sometimes used as well, and is named Racah's normalization after [[Giulio Racah]].

It can be shown that all of the above normalized spherical harmonic functions satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^{m}{}^* (\theta, \varphi) = (-1)^m Y_\ell^{-m} (\theta, \varphi),&lt;/math&gt;

where the superscript {{math|*}} denotes complex conjugation. Alternatively, this equation follows from the relation of the spherical harmonic functions with the [[Wigner D-matrix#Relation to spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials|Wigner D-matrix]].

===Condon–Shortley phase===
One source of confusion with the definition of the spherical harmonic functions concerns a phase factor of (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, commonly referred to as the [[Edward Condon|Condon]]–Shortley phase in the quantum mechanical literature. In the quantum mechanics community, it is common practice to either include this [[phase factor]] in the definition of the [[associated Legendre polynomials]], or to append it to the definition of the spherical harmonic functions.  There is no requirement to use the Condon–Shortley phase in the definition of the spherical harmonic functions, but including it can simplify some quantum mechanical operations, especially the application of [[Ladder operator|raising and lowering operators]].  The geodesy&lt;ref&gt;Heiskanen and Moritz, Physical Geodesy, 1967, eq. 1-62&lt;/ref&gt; and magnetics communities never include the Condon–Shortley phase factor in their definitions of the spherical harmonic functions nor in the ones of the associated Legendre polynomials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Real form===
A real basis of spherical harmonics can be defined in terms of their complex analogues by setting

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Y_{\ell m} &amp;=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle {i \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_\ell^{m} - (-1)^m\, Y_\ell^{-m}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&lt;0\\
\displaystyle  Y_\ell^0 &amp; \text{if}\ m=0\\
\displaystyle  {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_\ell^{-m} + (-1)^m\, Y_\ell^{m}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&gt;0.
\end{cases}\\
&amp;=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle {i \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_\ell^{-|m|} - (-1)^{m}\, Y_\ell^{|m|}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&lt;0\\
\displaystyle  Y_\ell^0 &amp; \text{if}\ m=0\\
\displaystyle  {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_\ell^{-|m|} + (-1)^{m}\, Y_\ell^{|m|}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&gt;0.
\end{cases}\\
&amp;=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \sqrt{2} \, (-1)^m \, \operatorname{Im}[{Y_\ell^{|m|}}] &amp; \text{if}\ m&lt;0\\
\displaystyle  Y_\ell^0 &amp; \text{if}\ m=0\\
\displaystyle \sqrt{2} \, (-1)^m \, \operatorname{Re}[{Y_\ell^m}] &amp; \text{if}\ m&gt;0.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The Condon-Shortley phase convention is used here for consistency. The corresponding inverse equations are
: &lt;math&gt;
Y_{\ell}^{m} =
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_{\ell |m|} - i Y_{\ell,-|m|}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&lt;0 \\
\displaystyle  Y_{\ell 0} &amp;\text{if}\ m=0\\
\displaystyle  {(-1)^m \over \sqrt{2}} \left(Y_{\ell |m|} + i Y_{\ell,-|m|}\right) &amp; \text{if}\ m&gt;0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The real spherical harmonics are sometimes known as ''tesseral spherical harmonics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|Whittaker|1927|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These functions have the same orthonormality properties as the complex ones above.
The harmonics with ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 are said to be of cosine type, and those with ''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 of sine type. The reason for this can be seen by writing the functions in terms of the Legendre polynomials as

&lt;math&gt;
Y_{\ell m} =
\begin{cases}
 \displaystyle (-1)^m\sqrt{2} \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}{(\ell-|m|)!\over (\ell+|m|)!}} P_\ell^{|m|}(\cos \theta) \sin |m|\varphi  &amp;\mbox{if } m&lt;0 \\
 \displaystyle \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}} P_\ell^m(\cos \theta) &amp; \mbox{if } m=0\\
 \displaystyle (-1)^m\sqrt{2} \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}} P_\ell^m(\cos \theta) \cos m\varphi &amp; \mbox{if } m&gt;0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The same sine and cosine factors can be also seen in the following subsection that deals with the cartesian representation.

See [[Table of spherical harmonics#Real spherical harmonics|here]] for a list of real spherical harmonics up to and including &lt;math&gt;\ell = 4&lt;/math&gt;, which can be seen to be consistent with the output of the equations above.

==== Use in quantum chemistry ====

As is known from the analytic solutions for the hydrogen atom, the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the wave function are spherical harmonics.
However, the solutions of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation without magnetic terms can be made real.
This is why the real forms are extensively used in basis functions for quantum chemistry, as the programs don't then need to use complex algebra. Here, it is important to note that the real functions span the same space as the complex ones would.

For example, as can be seen from the [[Table of spherical harmonics#Spherical harmonics|table of spherical harmonics]], the usual ''p'' functions (&lt;math&gt;l=1&lt;/math&gt;) are complex and mix axis directions, but the [[Table of spherical harmonics#Real spherical harmonics|real versions]] are essentially just ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''.

===The Herglotz generating function===

If the quantum mechanical convention is adopted for the &lt;math&gt;Y_{\ell}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then,

:&lt;math&gt;
e^{v{\mathbf a}\cdot{\mathbf r}}
= \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m = -\ell}^{\ell}
    \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2\ell +1}}
       \frac{r^{\ell} v^{\ell} {\lambda^m}}{\sqrt{(\ell +m)!(\ell-m)!}} Y_{\ell}^m.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector with components &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf a}
 = {\mathbf{\hat z}}
   - \frac{\lambda}{2}({\mathbf{\hat x}} + i {\mathbf{\hat y}})
  + \frac{1}{2\lambda}({\mathbf{\hat x}} - i {\mathbf{\hat y}})
&lt;/math&gt;
is a vector with complex coefficients. It suffices to take &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as a real parameter.
The essential property of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf a}&lt;/math&gt; is that it is null:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf a}\cdot{\mathbf a} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In naming this generating function after [[Gustav Herglotz|Herglotz]], we follow {{harvnb|Courant|Hilbert|1962|loc= §VII.7}}, who credit unpublished notes by him for its discovery.

Essentially all the properties of the spherical harmonics can be derived from this generating function.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Appendix A of Garg, A., Classical Electrodynamics in a Nutshell (Princeton University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; An immediate benefit of this definition is that if the c-number vector
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the quantum mechanical spin vector operator &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf J}&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains a generating function for a standardized set of [[spherical tensor operator]]s,
&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Y}_{\ell}^m({\mathbf J})&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
e^{v{\mathbf a}\cdot{\mathbf J}}
= \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m = -\ell}^{\ell}
    \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2\ell +1}}
       \frac{v^{\ell} {\lambda^m}}{\sqrt{(\ell +m)!(\ell-m)!}}
         {\mathcal Y}_{\ell}^m({\mathbf J}).
&lt;/math&gt;

The parallelism of the two definitions ensures that the &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal Y}_{\ell}^m&lt;/math&gt;'s transform under rotations (see below) in the same way as the &lt;math&gt;Y_{\ell}^m&lt;/math&gt;'s, which in turn guarantees that they are spherical tensor operators, &lt;math&gt;T^{(k)}_q&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;k={\ell}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=m&lt;/math&gt;, obeying all the properties of such operators, such as the [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients|Clebsch-Gordan]] composition theorem, and the [[Wigner-Eckart theorem]]. They are, moreover, a standardized set with a fixed scale or normalization.

===Separated Cartesian form===
The Herglotzian definition yields polynomials which may, if one wishes, be further factorized into a polynomial of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and another of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, as follows (Condon-Shortley phase):
:&lt;math&gt;
r^\ell\,
\begin{pmatrix}
 Y_\ell^{m} \\
 Y_\ell^{-m}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\left[\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\right]^{1/2} \bar{\Pi}^m_\ell(z)  
\begin{pmatrix}
(-1)^m (A_m +  i B_m) \\
\qquad (A_m -  i B_m) \\
\end{pmatrix} ,
\qquad m &gt; 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
and for ''m'' = 0:
:&lt;math&gt;
r^\ell\,Y_\ell^{0} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}}
\bar{\Pi}^0_\ell  .
&lt;/math&gt;
Here
:&lt;math&gt;
A_m(x,y) = \sum_{p=0}^m \binom{m}{p} x^p y^{m-p} \cos ((m-p) \frac{\pi}{2}),
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B_m(x,y) = \sum_{p=0}^m \binom{m}{p} x^p y^{m-p} \sin ((m-p) \frac{\pi}{2}),
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\Pi}^m_\ell(z)
= \left[\frac{(\ell-m)!}{(\ell+m)!}\right]^{1/2}
\sum_{k=0}^{\left \lfloor (\ell-m)/2\right \rfloor} 
 (-1)^k 2^{-\ell} \binom{\ell}{k}\binom{2\ell-2k}{\ell} \frac{(\ell-2k)!}{(\ell-2k-m)!}
\; r^{2k}\; z^{\ell-2k-m}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt; this reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\Pi}^0_\ell(z)
= \sum_{k=0}^{\left \lfloor \ell/2\right \rfloor} 
 (-1)^k 2^{-\ell} \binom{\ell}{k}\binom{2\ell-2k}{\ell} \; r^{2k}\; z^{\ell-2k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt;{\bar\Pi}_\ell^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the associated Legendre polynomial &lt;math&gt;P_\ell^m(\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, and the factors &lt;math&gt;(A_m \pm i B_m)&lt;/math&gt; are essentially &lt;math&gt;e^{\pm i m\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Examples====

Using the expressions for &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Pi}_\ell^m(z)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_m(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B_m(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; listed explicitly above we obtain: 
:&lt;math&gt;
 Y^1_3 = - \frac{1}{r^3} \left[\tfrac{7}{4\pi}\cdot \tfrac{3}{16} \right]^{1/2} (5z^2-r^2)(x+iy) =
-  \left[\tfrac{7}{4\pi}\cdot  \tfrac{3}{16}\right]^{1/2} (5\cos^2\theta-1) (\sin\theta e^{i\varphi})
&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;
Y^{-2}_4 =  \frac{1}{r^4} \left[\tfrac{9}{4\pi}\cdot\tfrac{5}{32}\right]^{1/2}(7z^2-r^2) (x-iy)^2
=  \left[\tfrac{9}{4\pi}\cdot\tfrac{5}{32}\right]^{1/2}(7 \cos^2\theta -1) (\sin^2\theta e^{-2 i \varphi})
&lt;/math&gt;
It may be verified that this agrees with the function listed [[Table of spherical harmonics#Spherical harmonics with l .3D 3|here]] and  [[Table of spherical harmonics#Spherical harmonics with l .3D 4|here]].

====Real forms====

Using the equations above to form the real spherical harmonics, it is seen that for &lt;math&gt;m&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; only the &lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt; terms (cosines) are included, and for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; only the &lt;math&gt;B_m&lt;/math&gt; terms (sines) are included:

:&lt;math&gt;
r^\ell\,
\begin{pmatrix}
 Y_{\ell m} \\
 Y_{\ell -m}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{2\pi}} \bar{\Pi}^m_\ell(z)  
\begin{pmatrix}
 A_m \\
 B_m \\
\end{pmatrix} ,
\qquad m &gt; 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
and for ''m'' = 0:
:&lt;math&gt;
r^\ell\,Y_{\ell 0} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}}
\bar{\Pi}^0_\ell  .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases and values==
1. When &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the spherical harmonics reduce to the ordinary [[Legendre polynomials]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{\ell}^0(\theta,\varphi) = \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}} P_{\ell}(\cos\theta).
&lt;/math&gt;

2. When &lt;math&gt;m = \pm\ell&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{\ell}^{\pm\ell}(\theta,\varphi)
  = \frac{(\mp 1)^{\ell}}{2^{\ell}\ell!}
     \sqrt{\frac{(2\ell+1)!}{4\pi}} \sin^{\ell}\theta\, e^{\pm i\ell\varphi},
&lt;/math&gt;
or more simply in Cartesian coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
r^{\ell} Y_{\ell}^{\pm\ell}({\mathbf r})
  = \frac{(\mp 1)^{\ell}}{2^{\ell}\ell!}
     \sqrt{\frac{(2\ell+1)!}{4\pi}} (x \pm i y)^{\ell}.
&lt;/math&gt;

3. At the north pole, where &lt;math&gt; \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is undefined,
all spherical harmonics except those with &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; vanish:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{\ell}^m(0,\varphi) = Y_{\ell}^m({\mathbf z})
  = \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}} \delta_{m0}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Symmetry properties==
The spherical harmonics have deep and consequential properties under the operations of spatial inversion (parity) and rotation.

=== Parity ===
{{Main article|Parity (physics)}}
The spherical harmonics have definite parity. That is, they are either even or odd with respect to inversion about the origin. Inversion is represented by the operator &lt;math&gt;P\Psi(\mathbf r) = \Psi(-\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, as can be seen in many ways (perhaps most simply from the Herglotz generating function), with
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; being a unit vector,

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m(-\mathbf r) = (-1)^\ell Y_\ell^m(\mathbf r).&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the spherical angles, parity transforms a point with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\{\theta,\phi\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{\pi-\theta,\pi+\phi\}&lt;/math&gt;. The statement of the parity of spherical harmonics is then
:&lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi) \rightarrow Y_\ell^m(\pi-\theta,\pi+\phi) = (-1)^\ell Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;
(This can be seen as follows: The [[associated Legendre polynomial]]s gives (−1)&lt;sup&gt;ℓ+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and from the exponential function we have (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, giving together for the spherical harmonics a parity of (−1)&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;.)

Parity continues to hold for real spherical harmonics, and for spherical harmonics in higher dimensions: applying a [[point reflection]] to a spherical harmonic of degree ℓ changes the sign by a factor of (−1)&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Rotations===
Consider a rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt; about the origin that sends the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}'&lt;/math&gt;. Under this operation, a spherical harmonic of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; transforms into a linear combination of spherical harmonics of the same degree. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;
Y_\ell^m({\mathbf r}') = \sum_{m' = -\ell}^\ell A_{mm'} Y_\ell^{m'}({\mathbf r}),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of order &lt;math&gt;(2\ell + 1)&lt;/math&gt; that depends on the
rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is not the standard way of expressing this property. In the standard way one writes,

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_\ell^m({\mathbf r}') = \sum_{m' = -\ell}^\ell [D^{(\ell)}_{mm'}({\mathcal R})]^* Y_\ell^{m'}({\mathbf r}),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D^{(\ell)}_{mm'}({\mathcal R})^*&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of an element of the [[Wigner D-matrix]].

The rotational behavior of the spherical harmonics is perhaps their quintessential feature from the viewpoint of group theory. The &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m&lt;/math&gt;'s of degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; provide a basis set of functions for the irreducible representation of the group SO(3) of dimension &lt;math&gt;(2\ell + 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Many facts about spherical harmonics (such as the addition theorem) that are proved laboriously using the methods of analysis acquire simpler proofs and deeper significance using the methods of symmetry.

==Spherical harmonics expansion==
The Laplace spherical harmonics form a complete set of orthonormal functions and thus form an [[orthonormal basis]] of the [[Hilbert space]] of [[square-integrable function]]s. On the unit sphere, any square-integrable function can thus be expanded as a linear combination of these:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta,\varphi)=\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell f_\ell^m \, Y_\ell^m(\theta,\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

This expansion holds in the sense of mean-square convergence &amp;mdash; convergence in [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] of the sphere &amp;mdash; which is to say that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi \left|f(\theta,\varphi)-\sum_{\ell=0}^N \sum_{m=- \ell}^\ell f_\ell^m Y_\ell^m(\theta,\varphi)\right|^2\sin\theta\, d\theta \,d\varphi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The expansion coefficients are the analogs of [[Fourier series|Fourier coefficients]], and can be obtained by multiplying the above equation by the complex conjugate of a spherical harmonic, integrating over the solid angle Ω, and utilizing the above orthogonality relationships. This is justified rigorously by basic Hilbert space theory. For the case of orthonormalized harmonics, this gives:

: &lt;math&gt;f_\ell^m=\int_{\Omega} f(\theta,\varphi)\, Y_\ell^{m*}(\theta,\varphi)\,d\Omega = \int_0^{2\pi}d\varphi\int_0^\pi \,d\theta\,\sin\theta f(\theta,\varphi)Y_\ell^{m*} (\theta,\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

If the coefficients decay in ℓ sufficiently rapidly &amp;mdash; for instance, [[exponential decay|exponentially]] &amp;mdash; then the series also [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]] to ''f''.

A square-integrable function ''f'' can also be expanded in terms of the real harmonics ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ''m''&lt;/sub&gt; above as a sum

:&lt;math&gt; f(\theta, \varphi) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell f_{\ell m} \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi). &lt;/math&gt;

The convergence of the series holds again in the same sense, but the benefit of the real expansion is that for real functions ''f'' the expansion coefficients become real.

==Spectrum analysis==

===Power spectrum in signal processing===
The total power of a function ''f'' is defined in the [[signal processing]] literature as the integral of the function squared, divided by the area of its domain. Using the [[orthonormality]] properties of the real unit-power spherical harmonic functions, it is straightforward to verify that the total power of a function defined on the unit sphere is related to its spectral coefficients by a generalization of [[Parseval's theorem]] (here, the theorem is stated for Schmidt semi-normalized harmonics, the relationship is slightly different for orthonormal harmonics):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4 \, \pi} \int_\Omega  |f(\Omega)|^2\, d\Omega = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty S_{f\!f}(\ell),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;S_{f\!f}(\ell) = \frac{1}{2\ell+1}\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell  |f_{\ell m}|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the angular power spectrum (for Schmidt semi-normalized harmonics).  In a similar manner, one can define the cross-power of two functions as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4 \, \pi} \int_\Omega  f(\Omega) \, g^\ast(\Omega) \, d\Omega = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty S_{fg}(\ell),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;S_{fg}(\ell) = \frac{1}{2\ell+1}\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell  f_{\ell m} g^\ast_{\ell m} &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the cross-power spectrum. If the functions ''f'' and ''g'' have a zero mean (i.e., the spectral coefficients ''f''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; are zero), then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''fg''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) represent the contributions to the function's variance and covariance for degree ℓ, respectively. It is common that the (cross-)power spectrum is well approximated by a power law of the form

:&lt;math&gt;S_{f\!f}(\ell) = C \, \ell^{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

When β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the spectrum is "white" as each degree possesses equal power. When β&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, the spectrum is termed "red" as there is more power at the low degrees with long wavelengths than higher degrees. Finally, when β&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the spectrum is termed "blue".  The condition on the order of growth of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) is related to the order of differentiability of ''f'' in the next section.

===Differentiability properties===
One can also understand the [[derivative|differentiability properties]] of the original function ''f'' in terms of the [[asymptotics]] of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ).  In particular, if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) decays faster than any [[rational function]] of ℓ as ℓ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞, then ''f'' is [[infinitely differentiable]].  If, furthermore, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) decays exponentially, then ''f'' is actually [[real analytic]] on the sphere.

The general technique is to use the theory of [[Sobolev space]]s.  Statements relating the growth of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ff''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ) to differentiability are then similar to analogous results on the growth of the coefficients of [[Fourier series]].  Specifically, if
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty (1+\ell^2)^s S_{ff}(\ell) &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
then ''f'' is in the Sobolev space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  In particular, the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]] implies that ''f'' is infinitely differentiable provided that
:&lt;math&gt;S_{ff}(\ell) = O(\ell^{-s})\quad\rm{as\ }\ell\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''s''.

==Algebraic properties==

=== Addition theorem ===
A mathematical result of considerable interest and use is called the ''addition theorem'' for spherical harmonics. This is a generalization of the trigonometric identity
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta'-\theta)=\cos\theta'\cos\theta + \sin\theta\sin\theta'&lt;/math&gt;
in which the role of the trigonometric functions appearing on the right-hand side is played by the spherical harmonics and that of the left-hand side is played by the [[Legendre polynomial]]s.

The ''addition theorem'' states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmonds|first1=A. R.|title=Angular Momentum In Quantum Mechanics|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
P_\ell( \mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{y} ) = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1}\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{y}) \, Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{x})
\quad \forall \, \ell \in \N_0 \;
\forall\, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \R^2 \colon \; \| \mathbf{x} \|_2 = \| \mathbf{y} \|_2 = 1 \,,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Legendre polynomial]] of degree ℓ.  This expression is valid for both real and complex harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;This is valid for any orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics of degree ℓ. For unit power harmonics it is necessary to remove the factor of 4π.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result can be proven analytically, using the properties of the [[Poisson kernel]] in the unit ball, or geometrically by applying a rotation to the vector '''y''' so that it points along the ''z''-axis, and then directly calculating the right-hand side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|Whittaker|1927|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, when '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''y''', this gives Unsöld's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unsöld|1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{x}) \, Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{2\ell + 1}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
which generalizes the identity cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 to two dimensions.

In the expansion ({{EquationNote|1}}), the left-hand side ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''·'''y''') is a constant multiple of the degree ℓ [[zonal spherical harmonic]].  From this perspective, one has the following generalization to higher dimensions. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; be an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the space '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; of degree ℓ spherical harmonics on the ''n''-sphere.  Then &lt;math&gt;Z^{(\ell)}_{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;, the degree ℓ zonal harmonic corresponding to the unit vector ''x'', decomposes as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=§IV.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Z^{(\ell)}_{\mathbf{x}}({\mathbf{y}}) = \sum_{j=1}^{\dim(\mathbf{H}_\ell)}\overline{Y_j({\mathbf{x}})}\,Y_j({\mathbf{y}})&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Furthermore, the zonal harmonic &lt;math&gt;Z^{(\ell)}_{\mathbf{x}}({\mathbf{y}})&lt;/math&gt; is given as a constant multiple of the appropriate [[Gegenbauer polynomial]]:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Z^{(\ell)}_{\mathbf{x}}({\mathbf{y}}) = C_\ell^{((n-1)/2)}({\mathbf{x}}\cdot {\mathbf{y}})&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
Combining ({{EquationNote|2}}) and ({{EquationNote|3}}) gives ({{EquationNote|1}}) in dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 when '''x''' and '''y''' are represented in spherical coordinates.  Finally, evaluating at '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''y''' gives the functional identity
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dim \mathbf{H}_\ell}{\omega_{n-1}} = \sum_{j=1}^{\dim(\mathbf{H}_\ell)}|Y_j({\mathbf{x}})|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the (''n''−1)-sphere.

=== Contraction rule ===
Another useful identity expresses the product of two spherical harmonics as a sum over spherical harmonics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brink|first1=D. M.|last2=Satchler|first2=G. R.|title=Angular Momentum|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Y_{a,\alpha}\left(\theta,\varphi\right)Y_{b,\beta}\left(\theta,\varphi\right)=\sqrt{\frac{\left(2a+1\right)\left(2b+1\right)}{4\pi}}\sum_{c,\gamma}\left(-1\right)^{\gamma}\sqrt{2c+1}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a &amp; b &amp; c\\
\alpha &amp; \beta &amp; -\gamma
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a &amp; b &amp; c\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right) Y_{c,\gamma}\left(\theta,\varphi\right) &lt;/math&gt;
where the values of &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are determined by the selection rules for the [[3j-symbol]]s.

=== Clebsch–Gordan coefficients ===
{{Main article|Clebsch–Gordan coefficients}}
The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the product of two spherical harmonics in terms of spherical harmonics themselves.  A variety of techniques are available for doing essentially the same calculation, including the Wigner [[3-jm symbol]], the [[Racah coefficients]], and the [[Slater integrals]].  Abstractly, the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients express the [[tensor product]] of two [[irreducible representation]]s of the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group]] as a sum of irreducible representations: suitably normalized, the coefficients are then the multiplicities.

==Visualization of the spherical harmonics==
[[image:Spherical harmonics positive negative.svg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of &lt;math&gt;Y_{\ell m}&lt;/math&gt; on the unit sphere and its nodal lines. &lt;math&gt;\text{Re}[Y_{\ell m}]&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 0 along ''m'' [[great circle]]s passing through the poles, and along ℓ−''m'' circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each time it crosses one of these lines.]]

[[Image:Spherical harmonics.png|300px|thumb|right|3D color plot of the spherical harmonics of degree ''n'' = 5. Note that ''n'' = ℓ.]]

The Laplace spherical harmonics &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m&lt;/math&gt; can be visualized by considering their "[[nodal line]]s", that is, the set of points on the sphere where &lt;math&gt;\text{Re}[Y_\ell^m] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively where &lt;math&gt;\text{Im}[Y_\ell^m] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Nodal lines of &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m&lt;/math&gt; are composed of ℓ circles: there are |''m''| circles along longitudes and ℓ−|''m''| circles along latitudes.  One can determine the number of nodal lines of each type by counting the number of zeros of &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m&lt;/math&gt; in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions independently.  For the latitudinal direction,{{Clarify|date=May 2016}} the real and imaginary components of the associated Legendre polynomials each possess ℓ−|''m''| zeros, whereas for the longitudinal direction, the trigonometric sin and cos functions possess 2|''m''| zeros.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

{{anchor|Zonal|Tesseral|Sectoral}}When the spherical harmonic order ''m'' is zero (upper-left in the figure), the spherical harmonic functions do not depend upon longitude, and are referred to as '''[[zonal spherical harmonics|zonal]]'''.  Such spherical harmonics are a special case of [[zonal spherical function]]s.  When ℓ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''m''| (bottom-right in the figure), there are no zero crossings in latitude, and the functions are referred to as '''sectoral'''. For the other cases, the functions [[English draughts|checker]] the sphere, and they are referred to as '''tesseral'''.

More general spherical harmonics of degree ℓ are not necessarily those of the Laplace basis &lt;math&gt;Y_\ell^m&lt;/math&gt;, and their nodal sets can be of a fairly general kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eremenko|Jakobson|Nadirashvili|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of spherical harmonics==
{{Main article|Table of spherical harmonics}}

Analytic expressions for the first few orthonormalized Laplace spherical harmonics that use the Condon-Shortley phase convention:

:&lt;math&gt;Y_{0}^{0}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 2}\sqrt{1\over \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Y_{1}^{-1}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 2}\sqrt{3\over 2\pi} \, \sin\theta \, e^{-i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{1}^{0}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 2}\sqrt{3\over \pi}\, \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{1}^{1}(\theta,\varphi)={-1\over 2}\sqrt{3\over 2\pi}\, \sin\theta\, e^{i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Y_{2}^{-2}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 4}\sqrt{15\over 2\pi} \, \sin^{2}\theta \, e^{-2i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{2}^{-1}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 2}\sqrt{15\over 2\pi}\, \sin\theta\, \cos\theta\, e^{-i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{2}^{0}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 4}\sqrt{5\over \pi}\, (3\cos^{2}\theta-1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{2}^{1}(\theta,\varphi)={-1\over 2}\sqrt{15\over 2\pi}\, \sin\theta\,\cos\theta\, e^{i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{2}^{2}(\theta,\varphi)={1\over 4}\sqrt{15\over 2\pi}\, \sin^{2}\theta \, e^{2i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher dimensions==
The classical spherical harmonics are defined as functions on the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; inside three-dimensional Euclidean space. Spherical harmonics can be generalized to higher-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomentsev|2001}}; {{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=§Iv.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Let '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; denote the [[vector space|space]] of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree ℓ in ''n'' variables.  That is, a polynomial ''P'' is in '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; provided that

:&lt;math&gt;P(\lambda \mathbf{x}) = \lambda^\ell P(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

Let '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; denote the subspace of '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of all [[harmonic function|harmonic]] polynomials; these are the [[solid spherical harmonics]].  Let '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; denote the space of functions on the unit sphere
:&lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} = \{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{R}^n\,\mid\, |x|=1\}&lt;/math&gt;
obtained by restriction from '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The following properties hold:

* The sum of the spaces '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; is [[dense set|dense]] in the set of continuous functions on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to the [[uniform convergence|uniform topology]], by the [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]].  As a result, the sum of these spaces is also dense in the space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;) of square-integrable functions on the sphere.  Thus every square-integrable function on the sphere decomposes uniquely into a series a spherical harmonics, where the series converges in the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sense.
* For all ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;, one has
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{S^{n-1}}f = -\ell(\ell+n-2)f.&lt;/math&gt;
:where Δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  This operator is the analog of the angular part of the Laplacian in three dimensions; to wit, the Laplacian in ''n'' dimensions decomposes as
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 = r^{1-n}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}r^{n-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + r^{-2}\Delta_{S^{n-1}} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{n-1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + r^{-2}\Delta_{S^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

* It follows from the [[Stokes theorem]] and the preceding property that the spaces '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; are orthogonal with respect to the inner product from ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  That is to say,
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{S^{n-1}} f\bar{g}\,d\Omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:for ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;ℓ.

* Conversely, the spaces '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; are precisely the eigenspaces of Δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, an application of the [[Spectral theorem#Compact self-adjoint operators|spectral theorem]] to the [[Riesz potential]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{S^{n-1}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; gives another proof that the spaces '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; are pairwise orthogonal and complete in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;).
* Every homogeneous polynomial ''P''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; can be uniquely written in the form
::&lt;math&gt;P(x) = P_\ell(x) + |x|^2P_{\ell-2} + \cdots + \begin{cases} 
|x|^\ell P_0 &amp; \ell \rm{\ even}\\
|x|^{\ell-1} P_1(x) &amp; \ell\rm{\ odd}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In particular,
::&lt;math&gt;\dim \mathbf{H}_\ell = \binom{n+\ell-1}{n-1}-\binom{n+\ell-3}{n- 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

An orthogonal basis of spherical harmonics in higher dimensions can be constructed [[mathematical induction|inductively]] by the method of [[separation of variables]], by solving the Sturm-Liouville problem for the spherical Laplacian
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{S^{n-1}} = \sin^{2-n}\phi\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\sin^{n-2}\phi\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi} + \sin^{-2}\phi \Delta_{S^{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where φ is the axial coordinate in a spherical coordinate system on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The end result of such a procedure is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higuchi|first=Atsushi|title=Symmetric tensor spherical harmonics on the N-sphere and their application to the de Sitter group SO(N,1)|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|year=1987|volume=28|issue=7|doi=10.1063/1.527513 |url=http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v28/i7/p1553_s1|bibcode = 1987JMP....28.1553H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_{l_1, \dots l_{n-1}} (\theta_1, \dots \theta_{n-1}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{i l_1 \theta_1} \prod_{j = 2}^{n-1} {}_j \bar{P}^{l_{j-1}}_{l_j} (\theta_j)&lt;/math&gt;
where the indices satisfy |ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| &amp;le; ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ... &amp;le; ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; and the eigenvalue is −ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;(ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''−2). The functions in the product are defined in terms of the [[Legendre function]]
:&lt;math&gt;{}_j \bar{P}^l_{L} (\theta) = \sqrt{\frac{2L+j-1}{2} \frac{(L+l+j-2)!}{(L-l)!}} \sin^{\frac{2-j}{2}} (\theta) P^{-(l + \frac{j-2}{2})}_{L+\frac{j-2}{2}} (\cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

==Connection with representation theory==
The space '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; of spherical harmonics of degree ℓ is a [[group representation|representation]] of the symmetry [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations around a point ([[SO(3)]]) and its double-cover [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]. Indeed, rotations act on the two-dimensional [[sphere]], and thus also on '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; by function composition
:&lt;math&gt; \psi \mapsto \psi\circ\rho^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
for ψ a spherical harmonic and ρ a rotation.  The representation '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[irreducible representation]] of SO(3).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Corollary 17.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; arise as the restrictions to the sphere of elements of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;: harmonic polynomials homogeneous of degree ℓ on three-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  By [[polarization of an algebraic form|polarization]] of ψ&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;, there are coefficients &lt;math&gt;\psi_{i_1\dots i_\ell}&lt;/math&gt; symmetric on the indices, uniquely determined by the requirement
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \sum_{i_1\dots i_\ell}\psi_{i_1\dots i_\ell}x_{i_1}\cdots x_{i_\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;
The condition that ψ be harmonic is equivalent to the assertion that the [[tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\psi_{i_1\dots i_\ell}&lt;/math&gt; must be [[tensor contraction|trace]] free on every pair of indices.  Thus as an irreducible representation of SO(3), '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the space of traceless [[symmetric tensor]]s of degree ℓ.

More generally, the analogous statements hold in higher dimensions: the space '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; of spherical harmonics on the [[N-sphere|''n''-sphere]] is the irreducible representation of SO(''n''+1) corresponding to the traceless symmetric ℓ-tensors.  However, whereas every irreducible tensor representation of SO(2) and SO(3) is of this kind, the special orthogonal groups in higher dimensions have additional irreducible representations that do not arise in this manner.

The special orthogonal groups have additional [[spin representation]]s that are not tensor representations, and are ''typically'' not spherical harmonics.  An exception are the [[spin representation]] of SO(3): strictly speaking these are representations of the [[double cover (topology)|double cover]] SU(2) of SO(3).  In turn, SU(2) is identified with the group of unit [[quaternions]], and so coincides with the [[3-sphere]].  The spaces of spherical harmonics on the 3-sphere are certain spin representations of SO(3), with respect to the action by  quaternionic multiplication.

===Generalizations===
The [[conformal geometry|angle-preserving symmetries]] of the [[two-sphere]] are described by the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s PSL(2,'''C''').  With respect to this group, the sphere is equivalent to the usual [[Riemann sphere]].  The group PSL(2,'''C''') is isomorphic to the (proper) [[Lorentz group]], and its action on the two-sphere agrees with the action of the Lorentz group on the [[celestial sphere]] in [[Minkowski space]].  The analog of the spherical harmonics for the Lorentz group is given by the [[hypergeometric series]]; furthermore, the spherical harmonics can be re-expressed in terms of the hypergeometric series, as SO(3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PSU(2) is a [[subgroup]] of PSL(2,C).

More generally, hypergeometric series can be generalized to describe the symmetries of any [[symmetric space]]; in particular, hypergeometric series can be developed for any [[Lie group]].&lt;ref&gt;N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11598">In [[mathematics]], '''subharmonic''' and '''superharmonic''' functions are important classes of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] used extensively in [[partial differential equations]], [[complex analysis]] and [[potential theory]].

Intuitively, subharmonic functions are related to [[convex function]]s of one variable as follows. If the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a convex function and a line intersect at two points, then the graph of the convex function is ''below'' the line between those points. In the same way, if the values of a subharmonic function are no larger than the values of a [[harmonic function]] on the ''boundary'' of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], then the values of the subharmonic function are no larger than the values of the harmonic function also ''inside'' the ball.

''Superharmonic'' functions can be defined by the same description, only replacing "no larger" with "no smaller". Alternatively, a superharmonic function is just the [[additive inverse|negative]] of a subharmonic function, and for this reason any property of subharmonic functions  can be easily transferred to superharmonic functions.

==Formal definition==
Formally, the definition can be stated as follows. Let  &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb{R}}^n&lt;/math&gt; and let

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \colon G \to {\mathbb{R}} \cup \{ - \infty \}&lt;/math&gt;

be an [[semi-continuity|upper semi-continuous function]]. Then, &lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is called ''subharmonic'' if for any [[closed ball]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{B(x,r)}&lt;/math&gt; of center &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; contained  in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and every [[real number|real]]-valued [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;\overline{B(x,r)}&lt;/math&gt; that is [[harmonic function|harmonic]] in &lt;math&gt;B(x,r)&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y) \leq h(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; on the  [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]  &lt;math&gt;\partial B(x,r)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B(x,r)&lt;/math&gt; we have   &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y) \leq h(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all  &lt;math&gt;y \in B(x,r).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that by the above, the function which is identically &amp;minus;∞ is subharmonic, but some authors exclude this function by definition.

A function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is called ''superharmonic'' if &lt;math&gt;-u&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic.

==Properties==
* A function is [[harmonic function|harmonic]]  [[if and only if]] it is both subharmonic and superharmonic. 
* If &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[smooth function|twice continuously differentiable]]) on an [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb{R}}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic [[if and only if]] one has &lt;math&gt; \Delta \phi \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplacian]].
* The [[maxima and minima|maximum]] of a subharmonic function cannot be achieved in the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of its domain unless the function is constant, this is the so-called [[maximum principle]]. However, the [[minimum]] of a subharmonic function can be achieved in the interior of its domain.
* Subharmonic functions make a [[convex cone]], that is, a linear combination of subharmonic functions with positive coefficients is also subharmonic.
*The pointwise maximum of two subharmonic functions is subharmonic.
*The limit of a decreasing sequence of subharmonic functions is subharmonic (or identically equal to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;).
*Subharmonic functions are not necessarily continuous in the usual topology, however one can introduce the [[fine topology (potential theory)|fine topology]] which makes them continuous.

==Examples==
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[analytic function|analytic]] then &lt;math&gt;\log|f|&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic. More examples can be constructed by using the properties listed above,
by taking maxima, convex combinations and limits. In dimension 1, all subharmonic functions can be obtained in this way.

==Riesz Representation Theorem==
If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic in a region &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, in [[Euclidean space]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u\leq v&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
is called a harmonic majorant of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. If a harmonic majorant exists, then there exists the least harmonic majorant, and
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=v(x)-\int_D\frac{d\mu(y)}{|x-y|^{n-2}},\quad n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;
while in dimension 2,
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=v(x)+\int_D\log|x-y|d\mu(y),&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the least harmonic majorant, and  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Borel measure]] in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.
This is called the [[Friedrich Riesz|Riesz]] representation theorem.

==Subharmonic functions in the complex plane==
Subharmonic functions are of a particular importance in [[complex analysis]], where they are intimately connected to [[holomorphic function]]s.

One can show that a real-valued, continuous function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of a complex variable (that is, of two real variables) defined on a set &lt;math&gt;G\subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic if and only if for any closed disc &lt;math&gt;D(z,r) \subset G&lt;/math&gt; of center &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi(z) \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \varphi(z+ re^{i\theta}) \, d\theta. &lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this means that a subharmonic function is at any point no greater than the [[arithmetic mean|average]] of the values in a circle around that point, a fact which can be used to derive the [[maximum principle]].

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a holomorphic function, then 
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(z) = \log \left| f(z) \right|&lt;/math&gt; 
is a subharmonic function if we define the value of  &lt;math&gt;\varphi(z)&lt;/math&gt; at the zeros of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be &amp;minus;∞. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_\alpha(z) = \left| f(z) \right|^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
is subharmonic for every ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0. This observation plays a role in the theory of [[Hardy spaces]], especially for the study of ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' when 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

In the context of the complex plane, the connection to the [[convex function]]s can be realized as well by the fact that a subharmonic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a domain &lt;math&gt;G\subset\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; that is constant in the imaginary direction is convex in the real direction and vice versa.

===Harmonic majorants of subharmonic functions===
If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is subharmonic in a [[Region (mathematical analysis)|region]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the complex plane, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Harmonic function|harmonic]] on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a '''harmonic majorant''' of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;≤&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Such an inequality can be viewed as a growth condition on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, Marvin; Rovnyak, James (1994), p.35 (see References)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subharmonic functions in the unit disc. Radial maximal function ===
Let ''φ'' be subharmonic, continuous and non-negative in an open subset ''Ω'' of the complex plane containing the closed unit disc ''D''(0,&amp;nbsp;1). The ''radial maximal function'' for the function ''φ'' (restricted to the unit disc) is defined on the unit circle by
:&lt;math&gt; (M \varphi)(e^{i\theta}) = \sup_{0 \le r &lt; 1} \varphi(re^{i\theta}). &lt;/math&gt;
If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Poisson kernel]], it follows from the subharmonicity that
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \le  \varphi(re^{i\theta}) \le \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} P_r\left(\theta- t\right) \varphi\left(e^{it}\right) \, \mathrm{d} t, \ \ \ r &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that the last integral is less than the value at e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[Hardy–Littlewood maximal function]] ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; of the restriction of ''φ'' to the unit circle '''T''',
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi^*(e^{i\theta}) = \sup_{0 &lt; \alpha \le \pi} \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \int_{\theta - \alpha}^{\theta + \alpha} \varphi\left(e^{it}\right) \, \mathrm{d}t,&lt;/math&gt;
so that 0&amp;nbsp;≤ ''M''&amp;nbsp;''φ''&amp;nbsp;≤ ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. It is known that the Hardy–Littlewood operator is bounded on [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')]] when 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞.
It follows that for some universal constant ''C'',

::&lt;math&gt; \|M \varphi\|_{L^2(\mathbf{T})}^2 \le C^2 \, \int_0^{2\pi} \varphi(e^{i\theta})^2 \, \mathrm{d}\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is a function holomorphic in ''Ω'' and 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, then the preceding inequality applies to ''φ''&amp;nbsp;= |''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''/2&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be deduced from these facts that any function ''F'' in the classical Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' satisfies
::&lt;math&gt; \int_0^{2\pi} \Bigl( \sup_{0 \le r &lt; 1} |F(re^{i\theta})| \Bigr)^p \, \mathrm{d}\theta \le C^2 \, \sup_{0 \le r &lt; 1} \int_0^{2\pi} |F(re^{i\theta})|^p \, \mathrm{d}\theta.&lt;/math&gt;
With more work, it can be shown that ''F'' has radial limits ''F''(e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;) almost everywhere on the unit circle, and (by the [[dominated convergence theorem]]) that ''F&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', defined by ''F&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= ''F''(''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;) tends to ''F'' in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''').

== Subharmonic functions on Riemannian manifolds ==
Subharmonic functions  can be defined on an arbitrary [[Riemannian manifold]].

''Definition:'' Let ''M'' be a Riemannian manifold, and &lt;math&gt;f:\; M \to {\Bbb R}&lt;/math&gt; an [[upper semicontinuous]] function. Assume that for any open subset &lt;math&gt;U\subset M&lt;/math&gt;, and any [[harmonic function]] ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' on ''U'', such that &lt;math&gt;f_1\geq f&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary of ''U'', the inequality &lt;math&gt;f_1\geq f&lt;/math&gt; holds on all ''U''. Then ''f'' is called ''subharmonic''.

This definition is equivalent to one given above. Also, for twice differentiable functions, subharmonicity is equivalent to the inequality &lt;math&gt;\Delta f\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the usual [[Laplace–Beltrami_operator|Laplacian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''The Principles of Mathematics''''' ('''''PoM''''') is a book written by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1903. In it he presented his famous [[Russell's paradox|paradox]] and argued his thesis that mathematics and [[logic]] are identical.&lt;ref name="Principles 1"/&gt;
 
The book presents a view of the [[foundations of mathematics]] and has become a classic reference. It reported on developments by [[Giuseppe Peano]], [[Mario Pieri]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], and others.

In 1905 [[Louis Couturat]] published a partial French translation&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Couturat]] (1905) ''Les Principes des mathématiques: avec un appendice sur la philosophie des mathématiques de Kant''. Republished 1965, Georg Olms&lt;/ref&gt; that expanded the book's readership. In 1937 Russell prepared a new introduction saying, "Such interest as the book now possesses is historical, and consists in the fact that it represents a certain stage in the development of its subject." Further editions were printed in 1938, 1951, 1996, and 2009.

==Contents==
''The Principles of Mathematics'' consists of 59 chapters divided into seven parts: indefinables in mathematics, number, quantity, order, infinity and continuity, space, matter and motion.

In chapter one, "Definition of Pure Mathematics", Russell asserts that : 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Principles of Mathematics'' (1903), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is an anticipation of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] physics in the final part as the last three chapters consider Newton's laws of motion, absolute and relative motion, and Hertz's dynamics. However, Russell rejects what he calls "the relational theory", and says on page 489 : 
:For us, since [[absolute space and time]] have been admitted, there is no need to avoid absolute motion, and indeed no possibility of doing so.
In his review, [[G. H. Hardy]] says "Mr. Russell is a firm believer in absolute position in space and time, a view as much out of fashion nowadays that Chapter [58: Absolute and Relative Motion] will be read with peculiar interest."&lt;ref name=Hardy/&gt;

==Early reviews==
Reviews were prepared by [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], but Moore's was never published&lt;ref name="Quin 1"/&gt; and that of Peirce was brief and somewhat dismissive. He indicated that he thought it unoriginal, saying that the book "can hardly be called literature" and "Whoever wishes a convenient introduction to the remarkable researches into the logic of mathematics that have been made during the last sixty years [...] will do well to take up this book."&lt;ref name="Peirce"/&gt;

[[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a favorable review&lt;ref name=Hardy&gt;[[G. H. Hardy]] (18 September 1903) "The Philosophy of Mathematics", [[Times Literary Supplement]] #88&lt;/ref&gt; expecting the book to appeal more to philosophers than mathematicians. But he says : 
:[I]n spite of its five hundred pages the book is much too short. Many chapters dealing with important questions are compressed into five or six pages, and in some places, especially in the most avowedly controversial parts, the argument is almost too condensed to follow. And the philosopher who attempts to read the book will be especially puzzled by the constant presupposition of a whole philosophical system utterly unlike any of those usually accepted.
In 1904 another review appeared in [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] (11(2):74–93) written by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]]. He says "The delicacy of the question is such that even the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of to-day have made what seem to be substantial slips of judgement and have shown on occasions an astounding ignorance of the essence of the problem which they were discussing. ... all too frequently it has been the result of a wholly unpardonable disregard of the work already accomplished by others." Wilson recounts the developments of [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] that Russell reports, and takes the occasion to correct [[Henri Poincaré]] who had ascribed them to [[David Hilbert]]. In praise of Russell, Wilson says "Surely the present work is a monument to patience, perseverance, and thoroughness." (page 88)

==Second edition==
In 1938 the book was re-issued with a new preface by Russell. This preface was interpreted as a retreat from the [[Philosophical realism|realism]] of the first edition and a turn toward [[nominalism|nominalist]] philosophy of [[symbolic logic]]. James Feibleman, an admirer of the book, thought Russell’s new preface went too far into nominalism so he wrote a rebuttal to this introduction.&lt;ref&gt;James Feibleman (1944) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3627102;view=1up;seq=179 Reply to the Introduction of the Second Edition], pages 157 to 174 of ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', P.A. Schilpp, editor, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt; Feibleman says, "It is the first comprehensive treatise on symbolic logic to be written in English; and it gives to that system of logic a realistic interpretation."

==Later reviews==
In 1959 Russell wrote ''[[My Philosophical Development]]'', in which he recalled the impetus to write the ''Principles'':
:It was at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in the year 1900 that I became aware of the importance of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... I was impressed by the fact that, in every discussion, [Peano] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ... It was [Peano's works] that gave the impetus to my own views on the principles of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ''My Philosophical Development'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recalling the book after his later work, he provides this evaluation:
:''The Principles of Mathematics'', which I finished on 23 May 1902, turned out to be a crude and rather immature draft of the subsequent work &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, from which, however, it differed in containing controversy with other philosophies of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ''My Philosophical Development'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such self-deprecation from the author after half a century of philosophical growth is understandable. On the other hand, [[Jules Vuillemin]] wrote in 1968: 
:''The Principles'' inaugurated contemporary philosophy. Other works have won and lost the title. Such is not the case with this one. It is serious, and its wealth perseveres. Furthermore, in relation to it, in a deliberate fashion or not, it locates itself again today in the eyes of all those that believe that contemporary science has modified our representation of the universe and through this representation, our relation to ourselves and to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jules Vuillemin]] (1968) ''Leçons sur la primière philosophie de Russell'', page 333, Paris: Colin&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[W. V. O. Quine]] penned his autobiography, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[W. V. O. Quine]] (1985) ''The Time of My Life'', page 59, [[MIT Press]] {{ISBN|0-262-17003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Peano's symbolic notation took Russell by storm in 1900, but Russell’s ''Principles'' was still in unrelieved prose. I was inspired by its profundity [in 1928] and baffled by its frequent opacity. In part it was rough going because of the cumbersomeness of ordinary language as compared with the suppleness of a notation especially devised for these intricate themes. Rereading it years later, I discovered that it had been rough going also because matters were unclear in Russell's own mind in those pioneer days.

''The Principles'' was an early expression of [[analytic philosophy]] and thus has come under close examination.&lt;ref name=Hylton&gt;Peter Hylton (1990) ''Russell, Idealism, and the Emergence of Analytic Philosophy'', chapter 5: Russell’s ''Principles of Mathematics'', pp 167 to 236, [[Clarendon Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-824626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Hylton wrote, "The book has an air of excitement and novelty to it ... The salient characteristic of ''Principles'' is ... the way in which the technical work is integrated into metaphysical argument."&lt;ref name=Hylton/&gt;{{rp|168}}

[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] made an in-depth study of ''Principles''. First he published ''Dear Russell – Dear Jourdain'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (1977) ''Dear Russell – Dear Jourdain: a commentary on Russell’s logic, based on his correspondence with Philip Jourdain'', [[Duckworth Overlook]] {{ISBN|0-7156-1010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included correspondence with [[Philip Jourdain]] who promulgated some of the book’s ideas. Then in 2000 Grattan-Guinness published ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870 – 1940'' which considered the author’s circumstances, the book’s composition and its shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2000) ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870–1940: Logics, Set Theories, and the Foundations of Mathematics from Cantor through Russell to Gödel'', [[Princeton University Press]] {{ISBN|0-691-05858-X}}. See pages 292–302 and 310–326&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Philip Ehrlich]] challenged the validity of Russell's analysis of infinitesimals in the Leibniz tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Thomas Jones''' (23 June 1756 – 18 July 1807) was Head Tutor at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] for twenty years and an outstanding teacher of mathematics. He is notable as a mentor of [[Adam Sedgwick]].

==Biography==
Jones was born at [[Berriew]], [[Montgomeryshire]], in [[Wales]].

On completing his studies at [[Shrewsbury School]], Jones was admitted to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] on 28 May 1774, as a 'pensioner' (i.e. a fee-paying student, as opposed to a scholar or [[sizar]]).&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|JNS774T|Thomas Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was believed to be an illegitimate son of Mr Owen Owen, of [[Tyncoed]], and his housekeeper, who afterwards married a Mr Jones, of [[Traffin]], [[County Kerry]], Thomas then being brought up as his son.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt;

On 27 June 1776, Jones migrated from St John's College to Trinity College. He became a scholar in 1777 and obtained his BA in 1779, winning the First [[Smith's Prize]] and becoming [[Senior Wrangler]]. In 1782, he obtained his MA and became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1781{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}. He became a Junior Dean, 1787–1789 and a Tutor, 1787–1807. He was ordained a deacon at the [[Peterborough]] parish on 18 June 1780. Then he was ordained priest, at the [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] parish on 6 June 1784, [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Fen Ditton]], Cambridgeshire, in 1784, and then canon of [[Swaffham Prior]], also 1784. On 11 December 1791, he preached before the University, at [[Great St Mary's]], a sermon against duelling (from Exodus XX. 13), which was prompted by a duel that had lately taken place near [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] between [[Henry Applewhaite]] and [[Richard Ryecroft]], undergraduates of Pembroke, in which the latter was fatally wounded. Jones died on 18 July 1807, in lodgings in [[Edgware Road]], [[London]]. He is buried in the cemetery of [[Dulwich College]]. A bust and a memorial tablet are in the ante-chapel of Trinity College.

His academic mentor was [[John Cranke]] (1746–1816). His Cambridge tutor was [[Thomas Postlethwaite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3494">In mathematics, a '''unipotent representation''' of a [[reductive group]] is a [[group representation|representation]] that has some  similarities with [[unipotent]] [[conjugacy class]]es of groups. 

Informally, [[Langlands philosophy]] suggests that there should be a correspondence between representations of a reductive group and conjugacy classes a [[Langlands dual group]], and the unipotent representations should be roughly the ones corresponding to unipotent classes in the dual group.

Unipotent representations are supposed to be the basic "building blocks" out of which one can construct all other representations in the following sense. 
Unipotent representations should form a small (preferably finite) set of irreducible representations for each reductive group, such that all irreducible representations can be obtained from unipotent representations of possibly smaller groups by some sort of systematic process, such as (cohomological or parabolic) induction.

==Finite fields==

Over finite fields, the unipotent representations are those that occur in the decomposition of the [[Deligne–Lusztig theory|Deligne–Lusztig characters]] ''R''{{su|p=1|b=''T''}} of the trivial representation 1 of a torus ''T'' . They were classified by {{harvs|txt|last=Lusztig|year1=1978|year2=1979}}.
Some examples of unipotent representations over finite fields are the trivial 1-dimensional representation, the [[Steinberg representation]], and [[θ10|θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Non-archimedean local fields==

{{harvtxt|Lusztig|1995}} classified the unipotent characters over non-archimedean local fields.

==Archimedean local fields==

{{harvtxt|Vogan|1987}} discusses several different possible definitions of unipotent representations of real Lie groups.

'''William Hugh Woodin''' (born April 23, 1955) is an American mathematician and [[set theory|set theorist]] at [[Harvard University]]. He has made many notable contributions to the theory of [[inner model]]s and [[determinacy]]. A type of [[large cardinal]], the [[Woodin cardinal]], bears his name.

==Biography==

Born in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], Woodin earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His dissertation title was ''Discontinuous Homomorphisms of C''(''Omega'') ''and Set Theory''. He served as [[chairman|chair]] of the Berkeley mathematics department for the 2002–2003 academic year. Woodin is a managing editor of the [[Journal of Mathematical Logic]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the great-grandson of [[William Hartman Woodin]], former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].

==Work==
He has done work on the theory of generic multiverses and the related concept of [[Ω-logic]], which suggested an argument that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is either undecidable or false in the sense of [[mathematical platonism]]. Woodin criticizes this view arguing that it leads to a counterintuitive reduction in which all truths in the set theoretical universe can be decided from a small part of it. He claims that these and related mathematical results lead (intuitively) to the conclusion that Continuum Hypothesis has a [[truth value]] and the Platonistic approach is reasonable.

Woodin now predicts that there should be a way of constructing an inner model for almost all known large cardinals, which he calls the Ultimate L and which would have similar properties as [[Constructible_universe|Gödel's constructible universe]]. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis would be true in this universe.{{fact|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolchover, Natalie|title=To Settle Infinity Dispute, a New Law of Logic|journal=[[Quanta Magazine]]|date=26 November 2013|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131126-to-settle-infinity-question-a-new-law-of-logic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Y-Δ transform''', also written '''wye-delta''' and also known by many other names, is a mathematical technique to simplify the analysis of an [[electrical network]]. The name derives from the shapes of the [[Circuit diagram|circuit diagrams]], which look respectively like the letter Y and the Greek capital letter [[Δ]]. This circuit transformation theory was published by [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Kennelly, "Equivalence of triangles and three-pointed stars in conducting networks", ''Electrical World and Engineer'', vol. 34, pp. 413&amp;ndash;414, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is widely used in analysis of [[three-phase electric power]] circuits. 

The Y-Δ transform can be considered a special case of the [[star-mesh transform]] for three [[Resistor|resistors]].  In mathematics, the Y-Δ transform plays an important role in theory of [[Circular planar graph|circular planar graphs]].&lt;ref&gt;E.B. Curtis, D. Ingerman, J.A. Morrow, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379598100873 Circular planar graphs and resistor networks], ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'', vol. 238, pp. 115–150, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
[[File:Theoreme de kennelly2.svg|thumb|300x300px|Illustration of the transform in its T-Π representation.]]
The '''Y-Δ transform''' is known by a variety of other names, mostly based upon the two shapes involved, listed in either order. The '''Y''', spelled out as '''wye''', can also be called '''T''' or '''star'''; the '''Δ''', spelled out as '''delta''', can also be called '''triangle''', '''[[Π]]''' (spelled out as '''pi'''), or '''mesh'''. Thus, common names for the transformation include '''wye-delta''' or '''delta-wye''', '''star-delta''', '''star-mesh''', or '''T-Π'''. {{clear}}

==Basic Y-Δ transformation==
[[Image:Wye-delta-2.svg|right|thumb|300px|Δ and Y circuits with the labels which are used in this article.]]
The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals. Where three elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is eliminated by transforming the impedances. For equivalence, the impedance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks. The equations given here are valid for complex as well as real impedances

===Equations for the transformation from Δ to Y===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Template:Network analysis navigation]]. Changing this heading will break the template unless updated there also.--&gt;
The general idea is to compute the impedance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{Y}&lt;/math&gt; at a terminal node of the Y circuit with impedances &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R''&lt;/math&gt; to adjacent nodes in the Δ circuit by

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{Y} = \frac{R'R''}{\sum R_\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\Delta&lt;/math&gt; are all impedances in the Δ circuit. This yields the specific formulae

===Equations for the transformation from Y to Δ===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Template:Network analysis navigation]]. Changing this heading will break the template unless updated there also.--&gt;
The general idea is to compute an impedance &lt;math&gt;R_\Delta&lt;/math&gt; in the Δ circuit by

:&lt;math&gt;R_\Delta = \frac{R_P}{R_\text{opposite}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_P = R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the products of all pairs of impedances in the Y circuit and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{opposite}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of the node in the Y circuit which is opposite the edge with &lt;math&gt;R_\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. The formula for the individual edges are thus

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  R_\text{a} &amp;= \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_1} \\[3pt]
  R_\text{b} &amp;= \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_2} \\[3pt]
  R_\text{c} &amp;= \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if using admittance instead of resistance:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Y_\text{a} &amp;= \frac{Y_3 Y_2}{\sum Y_\text{Y}} \\[3pt]
  Y_\text{b} &amp;= \frac{Y_3 Y_1}{\sum Y_\text{Y}} \\[3pt]
  Y_\text{c} &amp;= \frac{Y_1 Y_2}{\sum Y_\text{Y}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the general formula in Y to Δ using admittance is similar to Δ to Y using resistance.

==A proof of the existence and uniqueness of the transformation==
The feasibility of the transformation can be shown as a consequence of the [[superposition theorem|superposition theorem for electric circuits]]. A short proof, rather than one derived as a corollary of the more general [[star-mesh transform]], can be given as follows. The equivalence lies in the statement that for any external voltages (&lt;math&gt;V_1, V_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_3&lt;/math&gt;) applying at the three nodes (&lt;math&gt;N_1, N_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_3&lt;/math&gt;), the corresponding currents (&lt;math&gt;I_1, I_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt;) are exactly the same for both the Y and Δ circuit, and vice versa. In this proof, we start with given external currents at the nodes. According to the superposition theorem, the voltages can be obtained by studying the superposition of the resulting voltages at the nodes of the following three problems applied at the three nodes with current:

# &lt;math&gt;  \frac{1}{3}\left(I_1 - I_2\right),   -\frac{1}{3}\left(I_1 - I_2\right), 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0,\frac{1}{3}\left(I_2 - I_3\right),   -\frac{1}{3}\left(I_2 - I_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt; -\frac{1}{3}\left(I_3 - I_1\right), 0, \frac{1}{3}\left(I_3 - I_1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence can be readily shown by using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] that &lt;math&gt;I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Now each problem is relatively simple, since it involves only one single ideal current source. To obtain exactly the same outcome voltages at the nodes for each problem, the equivalent resistances in the two circuits must be the same, this can be easily found by using the basic rules of [[series and parallel circuits]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
        R_3 + R_1 = \frac{\left(R_\text{c} + R_\text{a}\right)R_\text{b}}{R_\text{a} + R_\text{b} + R_\text{c}},\quad
  \frac{R_3}{R_1} = \frac{R_\text{a}}{R_\text{c}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Though usually six equations are more than enough to express three variables (&lt;math&gt;R_1, R_2, R_3&lt;/math&gt;) in term of the other three variables(&lt;math&gt;R_\text{a}, R_\text{b}, R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;), here it is straightforward to show that these equations indeed lead to the above designed expressions.

In fact, the superposition theorem establishes the relation between the values of the resistances, the [[electromagnetism uniqueness theorem|uniqueness theorem]] guarantees the uniqueness of such solution.

==Simplification of networks==
Resistive networks between two terminals can theoretically be [[Equivalent impedance transforms|simplified]] to a single equivalent resistor (more generally, the same is true of impedance). Series and parallel transforms are basic tools for doing so, but for complex networks such as the bridge illustrated here, they do not suffice. 

The Y-Δ transform can be used to eliminate one node at a time and produce a network that can be further simplified, as shown. 

[[Image:wye-delta bridge simplification.svg|center|thumb|480px|Transformation of a bridge resistor network, using the Y-Δ transform to eliminate node ''D'', yields an equivalent network that may readily be simplified further.]]

The reverse transformation, Δ-Y, which adds a node, is often handy to pave the way for further simplification as well.

[[Image:delta-wye bridge simplification.svg|center|thumb|336px|Transformation of a bridge resistor network, using the Δ-Y transform, also yields an equivalent network that may readily be simplified further.]]

Every two-terminal network represented by a [[planar graph]] can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor by a sequence of series, parallel, Y-Δ, and Δ-Y transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Truemper.  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgt.3190130202/abstract On the delta-wye reduction for planar graphs]. ''J. Graph Theory'' 13(2):141–148, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are non-planar networks that cannot be simplified using these transformations, such as a regular square grid wrapped around a [[torus]], or any member of the [[Petersen family]].

==Graph theory==
In [[graph theory]], the Y-Δ transform means replacing a Y [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of a graph with the equivalent Δ subgraph. The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s. Two graphs are said to be '''Y-Δ equivalent''' if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Δ transforms in either direction. For example, the [[Petersen family]] is a Y-Δ [[equivalence class]].

==Demonstration==
===Δ-load to Y-load transformation equations===
[[Image:Wye-delta-2.svg|right|thumb|325px|Δ and Y circuits with the labels that are used in this article.]]

To relate &lt;math&gt;\left\{R_\text{a}, R_\text{b}, R_\text{c}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; from Δ to &lt;math&gt;\left\{R_1, R_2, R_3\right\}&lt;/math&gt; from Y, the impedance between two corresponding nodes is compared.  The impedance in either configuration is determined as if one of the nodes is disconnected from the circuit.
 
The impedance between ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; disconnected in Δ:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
  R_\Delta\left(N_1, N_2\right)
    &amp;= R_\text{c} \parallel (R_\text{a} + R_\text{b}) \\[3pt]
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_\text{c}} + \frac{1}{R_\text{a} + R_\text{b}}} \\[3pt]
    &amp;= \frac{R_\text{c}\left(R_\text{a} + R_\text{b}\right)}{R_\text{a} + R_\text{b} + R_\text{c}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To simplify, let &lt;math&gt;R_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; be the sum of &lt;math&gt;\left\{R_\text{a}, R_\text{b}, R_\text{c}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; R_\text{T} = R_\text{a} + R_\text{b} + R_\text{c} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;R_\Delta\left(N_1, N_2\right) = \frac{R_\text{c}(R_\text{a} + R_\text{b})}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding impedance between N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Y is simple:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{Y}\left(N_1, N_2\right) = R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt;

hence:

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2 = \frac{R_\text{c}(R_\text{a} + R_\text{b})}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;   (1)

Repeating for &lt;math&gt;R(N_2,N_3)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 + R_3 = \frac{R_\text{a}(R_\text{b} + R_\text{c})}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;   (2)

and for &lt;math&gt;R\left(N_1, N_3\right)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_3 = \frac{R_\text{b}\left(R_\text{a} + R_\text{c}\right)}{R_\text{T}}.&lt;/math&gt;   (3)

From here, the values of &lt;math&gt;\left\{R_1, R_2, R_3\right\}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by linear combination (addition and/or subtraction).

For example, adding (1) and (3), then subtracting (2) yields

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  R_1 + R_2 + R_1 + R_3 - R_2 - R_3 &amp;=
    \frac{R_\text{c}(R_\text{a} + R_\text{b})}{R_\text{T}} +
    \frac{R_\text{b}(R_\text{a} + R_\text{c})}{R_\text{T}} -
    \frac{R_\text{a}(R_\text{b} + R_\text{c})}{R_\text{T}} \\[3pt]
                 {}\Rightarrow 2R_1 &amp;=
    \frac{2R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}} \\[3pt]
                  {}\Rightarrow R_1 &amp;=
    \frac{R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For completeness:

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;   (4)
:&lt;math&gt;R_2 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;   (5)
:&lt;math&gt;R_3 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}}{R_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;   (6)

===Y-load to Δ-load transformation equations===
Let 

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{T} = R_\text{a} + R_\text{b} + R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can write the Δ to Y equations as

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}} &lt;/math&gt;   (1)
:&lt;math&gt;R_2 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}} &lt;/math&gt;   (2)
:&lt;math&gt;R_3 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}}{R_\text{T}}. &lt;/math&gt;   (3)

Multiplying the pairs of equations yields

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 R_2 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}^2 }{R_\text{T}^2}&lt;/math&gt;   (4)
:&lt;math&gt;R_1 R_3 = \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}^2 R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}^2}&lt;/math&gt;   (5)
:&lt;math&gt;R_2 R_3 = \frac{R_\text{a}^2 R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}^2}&lt;/math&gt;   (6)

and the sum of these equations is

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3 = \frac{
    R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}^2 +
    R_\text{a}R_\text{b}^2R_\text{c} +
    R_\text{a}^2R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}
  {R_\text{T}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;   (7)

Factor &lt;math&gt;R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; from the right side, leaving &lt;math&gt;R_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; in the numerator, canceling with an &lt;math&gt;R_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3
    &amp;={} \frac{
           \left(R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}\right)
           \left(R_\text{a} + R_\text{b} + R_\text{c}\right)
         }{R_\text{T}^2} \\
    &amp;={} \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;   (8)

Note the similarity between (8) and {(1), (2), (3)}

Divide (8) by (1)

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}{R_1}
    &amp;={} \frac{R_\text{a}R_\text{b}R_\text{c}}{R_\text{T}} \frac{R_\text{T}}{R_\text{b}R_\text{c}} \\
    &amp;={} R_\text{a},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation for &lt;math&gt;R_\text{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Dividing (8) by (2) or (3) (expressions for &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;) gives the remaining equations.
