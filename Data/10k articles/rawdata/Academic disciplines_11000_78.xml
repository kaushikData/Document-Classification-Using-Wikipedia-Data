In molecular biology, the '''BSD domain''' is an approximately 60-amino-acid-long [[protein domain]] named after the [[BTF2]]-like [[transcription factors]], [[synapse]]-associated [[protein]]s and DOS2-like proteins in which it is found. It is also found in several hypothetical proteins. The BSD domain occurs in one or two copies in a variety of species ranging from primal [[protozoan]] to [[Homo sapiens|human]]. It can be found associated with other domains such as the [[BTB domain]] or the [[U-box]] in multidomain proteins. The function of the BSD domain is as yet unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid11943536"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doerks T, Huber S, Buchner E, Bork P | title = BSD: a novel domain in transcription factors and synapse-associated proteins | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 168–70 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11943536 | doi = 10.1016/s0968-0004(01)02042-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secondary structure]] prediction indicates the presence of three predicted alpha helices, which probably form a three-helical bundle in small |domains. The third predicted [[helix]] contains neighbouring [[phenylalanine]] and [[tryptophan]] residues – less common [[amino acid]]s that are invariant in all the BSD domains identified and that are the most striking [[sequence (biology)|sequence]] features of the domain.&lt;ref name="pmid11943536"/&gt;

Some proteins known to contain one or two BSD domains are listed below:
* [[Mammalia]]n [[TFIIH]] basal [[transcription factor]] [[Protein complex|complex]] p62 subunit ([[GTF2H1]]).
* [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Yeast]] [[RNA polymerase II]] transcription factor B 73 kDa subunit (TFB1), the [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of [[BTF2]].
* [[Yeast]] DOS2 protein, involved in single-copy DNA replication and [[ubiquitination]].
* [[Drosophila]] synapse-associated protein SAP47.
* [[Mammalian]] [[SYAP1]].
* Various ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]] thaliana'' (mouse-ear cress) hypothetical proteins.

'''Bugchasing''', also known in slang as '''charging''', is the practice of pursuing [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals in order to contract HIV. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers. It is a form of [[self-harm]]. Bugchasers seek [[sexual partner]]s who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having [[Bareback (sex)|unprotected sex]] and becoming HIV-positive; '''giftgivers''' are HIV-positive individuals who comply with the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV.

Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers engage in the activity for the excitement and intimacy inherent in pursuing such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crossley Michelle | year = 2004 | title = 'Resistance' and health promotion | doi = 10.1348/0144666041501679 | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 225–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggest that the behavior may stem from a "resistance to dominant heterosexual norms and mores" due to a defensive response by gay men to repudiate stigmatization and rejection by society.&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt;

Some people consider bugchasing "intensely erotic" and the act of being infected through the "fuck of death" as the "ultimate taboo, the most extreme sex act left."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory A. Freeman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |title=Rolling Stone : Bug Chasers |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are HIV negative and in a [[Serodiscordant|relationship]] with someone who is HIV-positive may seek infection as a way to remain in the relationship, particularly when the HIV-positive partner may wish to break up to avoid infecting the HIV negative partner.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt; It has also been used as a form of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere | title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656| doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. | title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442| doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440 | pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

By design, bug chasing involves [[unprotected sex]], but members of the [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] subculture are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent:

{{quote|text=In reviewing the scarce unpublished and published materials on bugchasing, as well as general healthcare speculations, a common theme appears — the lumping of bug chasers with barebackers.... Although these two groups share some of the same practices, namely unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), there are distinctions that differentiate bug chasing...even though all bug chasers are indeed barebackers, not all barebackers are bugchasers.&lt;ref name="pmid17612955"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moskowitz DA, Roloff ME |title=The existence of a bug chasing subculture |journal=Cult Health Sex |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17612955 |doi=10.1080/13691050600976296 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13691050600976296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In simple terms, bugchasers engage in unprotected intercourse, and seek out partners with HIV, because they desire infection. Barebackers engage in unprotected intercourse because they prefer the sensation of it but generally prefer to avoid contracting STIs. While actual activity is the same for both groups the two do not share the same psychology. Barebackers conceptually have the same motivation as heterosexual couples that use non-barrier methods of birth control (more enjoyable sex), and, in contrast with bugchasers, do not deliberately seek HIV-infected partners.

As many "bugchasers" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with [[Munchausen syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Dr Mark|title=Contract Killing: A brief look at ‘bug chasing’|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201410/contract-killing|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.Gauthier|first=Deann|last2=J.Forsyth|first2=Craig|date=1999-01-01|title=bareback sex, bug chasers, and the gift of death|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016396299266605|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=20|issue=1|pages=85–100|doi=10.1080/016396299266605|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew [[condom]]s and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV.

Dr. Richard Tewksbury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewksbury|first=Richard|date=2003-09-01|title=bareback sex and the quest for HIV: assessing the relationship in internet personal advertisements of men who have sex with men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713840245|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=467–482|doi=10.1080/713840245|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the [[Internet]] to assist their [[Seroconversion|seroconversive]] efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics.

Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bug Chasing and Gift Giving: The Potential for HIV Transmission Among Barebackers on the Internet|last1=Grov|first1=Christian|last2=Parsons|first2=Jeffrey T.|date=2006|doi=10.1521/aeap.2006.18.6.490|journal=AIDS Education and Prevention|volume=18|issue=6|pp=490–503|pmid=17166076}}&lt;/ref&gt; research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers.

# "The Committed Bug Chaser" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent [[anal sex|anal receptive]]). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers.
# "The Opportunistic Bug Chaser" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner’s HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning [[anal receptive]] and [[anal insertive]]) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers.
# "The Committed Gift Giver" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category.
# "The Opportunistic Gift Giver" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner’s status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample.
# "The Serosorter" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their [[User profile|Internet profile]], behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were [[serosorting]] for partners of similar HIV status.
# "The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample.

In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers.

Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely [[sex addict]]s. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk-oriented high.

Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Exploratory Study of  Bug Chasers|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20321517|journal=Sociological imagination|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1077-5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge "common sense" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens.  Few respondents identified "getting it over with" as a motivating factor.

Some limited identification of becoming part of the "community" or "brotherhood" was identified.  Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical response==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Bugchasing has, more recently, been taken more seriously by medical health promotion bodies, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control]], which hosted a workshop on the topic, hosted by Dr. Michael Graydon of [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa]], at the 2004 National [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] Prevention Conference.

==In mainstream media==
The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304003441/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|archivedate=2008-03-04|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|title=In Search of Death|author=Gregory A. Freeman|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 December 2009|date=23 January 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Roeper&gt;{{Cite news| title = What makes bug chasers, gift givers do such a thing? | first = Richard | last = Roeper | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2003-04-22 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya&gt;{{Cite news| title = A new generation rethinks AIDS risk | page = 1D |department=Island Life | newspaper = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 2003-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but ''Rolling Stone'' stands behind the story.&lt;ref name = Roeper/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = n TRANSMISSION |journal= AIDS Policy and Law |volume= 18 |issue= 4 | date = 2003-03-03 | publisher = LRP Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mnookin&gt;{{Cite news| title = Using 'Bug Chasers' | page = 10 | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | publisher = Newsweek | date = 2003-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's [[Fenway Health|Fenway Community Health]], was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bugged&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bugged Out Over AIDS Story | page = 10 | publisher = New York Post | date = 2003-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the statements "entirely a fabrication," but ''Rolling Stone'' also stood behind them.&lt;ref name = Bugged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated? | newspaper = Newsweek | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | date = 2003-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weinstein, then editor of the ''New York Blade'', an established gay newspaper, called the article "less than truthful" and attributed it to a ''Rolling Stone'' editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing "lad mag" who wished to make a sensation for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Steve | title = Chasing the bug chasers [editorial] | journal = Washington Blade | date = May 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the article, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] put out an action alert, calling its members to "PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Savage Love |department=Hot Spot | page = 171 | authorlink = Dan Savage | first = Dan | last = Savage | newspaper = The Village Voice | date = 2003-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Men Who Want AIDS | first = Matthew | last = Laza | pages = 21–24 | newspaper = The Spectator | date = 2003-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to cut down on its AIDS funding.&lt;ref name = Mnookin/&gt;

Writer/[[film director|director]] Daniel Bort made a [[2003 in film|2003]] short film  on the subject called ''Bugchaser'', which premièred at the 16th Annual [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in [[New York City|New York]] [[sex club]]s. In an interview with the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', he explained: ''"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way."'' At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Gift (2003 film)|The Gift]]'' by Louise Hogarth.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 [[BBC]] programme, ''I love being HIV+'', said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising.&lt;ref name="HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4895012.stm|title=HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? |accessdate=2008-07-06|publisher=BBC News|author=Richard Pendry   | date=2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, "Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy." The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, "The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, "There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asked Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience "the gift". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the NBC series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', Season 7, Episode 13, Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asked the HIV-negative patient if he is "bug chasing".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter [[Marc with a C]] has a song on the subject entitled "Chasing the Bug".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42598">'''Calcium looping''' (CaL), or the '''regenerative calcium cycle''' (RCC), is a second-generation [[Carbon capture and storage#Capture|carbon capture]] technology. It is the most developed form of carbonate looping, where a metal (M) is reversibly reacted between its carbonate form (MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and its oxide form (MO) to separate carbon dioxide from other gases coming from either power generation or an industrial plant. In the calcium looping process, the two species are [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[calcium oxide]] (CaO). The captured carbon dioxide can then be [[Carbon capture and storage#Transport|transported]] to a [[Carbon sequestration|storage site]], used in [[enhanced oil recovery]] or used as a [[Carbon capture and utilization|chemical feedstock]]. Calcium oxide is often referred to as the ''sorbent''.

Calcium looping is being developed as it is a more efficient, less toxic alternative to current post-combustion capture processes such as [[amine scrubbing]].&lt;ref name="Ahn et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Hyungwoong|author2=Luberti, Mauro |author3=Liu, Zhengyi |author4= Brandani, Stefano |title=Process configuration studies of the amine capture process for coal-fired power plants|journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control|date=August 2013|volume=16|pages=29–40|doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.03.002|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/7478246/Final_published_paper_IJGGC2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has interesting potential for integration with the [[cement]] industry.&lt;ref name="Dean et al CaL for powergen, cem + H2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=C.C.|author2=Blamey, J. |author3=Florin, N.H. |author4=Al-Jeboori, M.J. |author5= Fennell, P.S. |title=The calcium looping cycle for CO2 capture from power generation, cement manufacture and hydrogen production|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=June 2011|volume=89|issue=6|pages=836–855|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2010.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean et al 11 Potential Synergy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=Charles C.|author2=Dugwell, Denis |author3=Fennell, Paul S. |title=Investigation into potential synergy between power generation, cement manufacture and CO2 abatement using the calcium looping cycle|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=2050|doi=10.1039/C1EE01282G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic concept ==

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{CaCO3 &lt;=&gt; {CaO} + CO2 \qquad\qquad \Delta H} = +178\ \ce{kJ/mol} &lt;/math&gt;

There are two main steps in CaL:&lt;ref name="Blamey review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blamey|first=J.|author2=Anthony, E.J. |author3=Wang, J. |author4= Fennell, P.S. |title=The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO2 capture|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|date=April 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=260–279|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Calcination]]: Solid calcium carbonate is fed into a [[calciner]], where it is heated to 850-950&amp;nbsp;°C to cause it to thermally decompose into gaseous carbon dioxide and solid calcium oxide (CaO). The almost-pure stream of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then removed and purified so that it is suitable for storage or use. This is the 'forward' reaction in the equation above.
* [[Carbonation]]: The solid CaO is removed from the calciner and fed into the ''carbonator''. It is cooled to approximately 650&amp;nbsp;°C and is brought into contact with a flue gas containing a low to medium concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The CaO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; react to form CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, thus reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the flue gas to a level suitable for emission to the atmosphere. This is the 'backward' reaction in the equation above.

Note that carbonation is calcination in reverse.

Whilst the process can be theoretically performed an infinite amount of times, the calcium oxide sorbent degrades as it is cycled.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; For this reason, it is necessary to remove (''purge'') some of the sorbent from the system and replace it with fresh sorbent (often in the carbonate form). The size of the purge stream compared with the amount of sorbent going round the cycle affects the process considerably.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Calciner heat requirements"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=N.|author2=Alonso, M. |author3=Grasa, G. |author4= Abanades, J. Carlos |title=Heat requirements in a calciner of CaCO3 integrated in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Carbon capture and storage|capture system]] using CaO|journal=Chemical Engineering Journal|date=May 2008|volume=138|issue=1-3|pages=148–154|doi=10.1016/j.cej.2007.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the Ca-looping process, a CaO-based sorbent, typically derived from limestone, reacts via the reversible reaction described in Equation (1) and is repeatedly cycled between 2 vessels.

{{NumBlk|:|ΔH {{=}} +178kJ/mol |{{EquationRef|1}}|LnSty=1px dashed }}

The forward, [[endothermic]] step is called [[calcination]] while the backward, [[exothermic]] step is [[carbonation]].

A typical Ca-looping process for post-combustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture is shown in Figure 1, followed by a more detailed description.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 1 wiki.png|thumb|Figure 1: A potential post combustion process using the calcium looping cycle (Blamey et al., 2010)]] --&gt;

Flue gas containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is fed to the first vessel (the carbonator), where [[carbonation]] occurs. The CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formed is passed to another vessel (the calciner). [[Calcination]] occurs at this stage, and the regenerated CaO is quickly passed back to the carbonator, leaving a pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  stream behind. As this cycle continues, CaO sorbent is constantly replaced by fresh (reactive) sorbent.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010, p. 260-279"&gt;Blamey, J.; Anthony, E.J.; Wang, J.; Fennell, P.S. 2010, The Calcium Looping Cycle for large-scale CO2 capture. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science vol. 36 (2) p. 260-279&lt;/ref&gt; The highly concentrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the calciner is suitable for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]], and the spent CaO has potential uses elsewhere, most notably in the cement industry.  The heat necessary for calcination can be provided by [[oxy-combustion]] of coal below.

Oxy-combustion of coal: Pure oxygen rather than air is used for combustion, eliminating the large amount of nitrogen in the flue-gas stream. After particulate matter is removed, flue gas consists only of water vapor and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, plus smaller amounts of other pollutants. After compression of the flue gas to remove water vapor and additional removal of air pollutants, a nearly pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stream suitable for storage is produced.

The carbonator's operating temperature of 650-700 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is chosen as a compromise between higher equilibrium (maximum) capture at lower temperatures due to the [[exothermic]] nature of the carbonation step, and a decreased reaction rate. Similarly, the temperature of &gt;850 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C in the calcinator strikes a balance between increased rate of calcination at higher temperatures and reduced rate of degradation of CaO sorbent at lower temperatures.

== Process description ==

CaL is usually designed using a [[Fluidised bed|dual fluidised bed system]] to ensure sufficient contact between the gas streams and the sorbent.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Hot lime"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=N.|author2=Alonso, M. |author3=Grasa, G. |author4= Abanades, J.

Calcination is an endothermic process and as such requires the application of heat to the calciner. The opposite reaction, carbonation, is exothermic and heat must be removed. Since the exothermic reaction happens at about 650&amp;nbsp;°C and the endothermic reaction at 850-950&amp;nbsp;°C, the heat from the carbonator cannot be directly used to heat the calciner.

The fluidisation of the solid bed in the carbonator is achieved by passing the flue gas through the bed. In the calciner, some of the recovered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is recycled through the system.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; Some oxygen may also be passed through the reactor if fuel is being burned in the calciner to provide energy.

=== Provision of energy to the calciner ===

Heat can be provided for the endothermic calcination step either directly or indirectly.

Direct provision of heat involves the combustion of fuel in the calciner itself ([[Fluidized bed combustion|fluidised bed combustion]]). This is generally assumed to be done under [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-fuel]] conditions; i.e. oxygen rather than air is used to burn the fuel to prevent dilution of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with nitrogen. The provision of oxygen for the combustion uses lots of electricity; other [[Air separation#Cryogenic liquification process|air separation processes]] are being developed.&lt;ref name="CCS Update" /&gt;

Indirect provision of heat to the calciner involves either:
* Combustion of fuel outside the vessel and conduction of energy in to the vessel&lt;ref name=Calix&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalytic Flash Calcination (CFC) Technology|url=http://www.calix.com.au/catalytic_flash_calcination__cfc__technology.html|publisher=Calix Limited|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Combustion of fuel in another vessel and use of a heat transfer medium.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Hot lime" /&gt;

Indirect methods are generally less efficient but do not require the provision of oxygen for combustion within the calciner to prevent dilution. The flue gas from the combustion of fuel in the indirect method could be mixed with the flue gas from the process that the CaL plant is attached to and passed through the carbonator to capture the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Recovery of energy from the carbonator ==
Although the heat from the carbonator is not at a high enough temperature to be used in the calciner, the high temperatures involved (&gt;600&amp;nbsp;°C) mean that a relatively efficient [[Rankine cycle]] for generating electricity can be operated.&lt;ref name="Romeo 08 Efficiency and Cost"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romeo|first=Luis M.|author2=Abanades, J. Carlos |author3=Escosa, Jesús M. |author4=Paño, Jara |author5=Giménez, Antonio |author6=Sánchez-Biezma, Andrés |author7= Ballesteros, Juan C. |title=Oxyfuel carbonation/calcination cycle for low cost CO2 capture in existing power plants|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|date=October 2008|volume=49|issue=10|pages=2809–2814|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2008.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the waste heat from the market-leading [[Amine scrubbing|amine scrubbing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture process]] is emitted at a maximum of 150&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="CCS Update"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boot-Handford|first=Matthew E. |author2=Abanades, Juan C. |author3=Anthony, Edward J. |author4=Blunt, Martin J. |author5=Brandani, Stefano |author6=Mac Dowell, Niall |author7=Fernández, José R. |author8=Ferrari, Maria-Chiara |author9=Gross, Robert |author10=Hallett, Jason P. |author11=Haszeldine, R.

This electricity generation is one of the main benefits of CaL over lower-temperature post-combustion capture processes as the electricity is an extra revenue stream (or reduces costs).

== Sorbent degradation ==
It has been shown that the activity of the sorbent reduces quite markedly in laboratory, bench-scale and pilot plant tests. This degradation has been attributed to three main mechanisms, as shown below.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt;

=== Attrition ===
Calcium oxide is friable, that is, quite brittle. In fluidised beds, the calcium oxide particles can break apart upon collision with the other particles in the fluidised bed or the vessel containing it. [REF] The problem seems to be greater in pilot plant tests&lt;ref name="Lu et al 08 Pilot plant attrition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=Dennis Y.|author2=Hughes, Robin W. |author3=Anthony, Edward J. |title=Ca-based sorbent looping combustion for CO2 capture in pilot-scale dual fluidized beds|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|date=December 2008|volume=89|issue=12|pages=1386–1395|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2008.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; than at a bench scale.


=== Sulfation ===
Sulfation is a relatively slow reaction (several hours) compared with carbonation (&lt;10 minutes); thus it is more likely that SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will come into contact with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than CaO. However, both reactions are possible, and are shown below.

:Indirect sulfation: &lt;chem&gt; CaO + SO2 + 1/2 O2 -&gt; CaSO4 &lt;/chem&gt;
:Direct sulfation: &lt;chem&gt; CaCO3 + SO2 + 1/2 O2 -&gt; CaSO4 + CO2 &lt;/chem&gt;

Because [[calcium sulfate]] has a greater molar volume than either CaO or CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a sulfated layer will form on the outside of the particle, which can prevent the uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the CaO further inside the particle.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; Furthermore, the temperature at which calcium sulfate dissociates to CaO and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively high, precluding sulfation's reversibility at the conditions present in CaL.

== Technical implications ==
Calcium looping technology offers several technical advantages over [[amine scrubbing]] for carbon capture. Firstly, both carbonator and calciner can use [[fluidized bed]] technology, due to the good gas-solid contacting and uniform bed temperature. Fluidized bed technology has already been demonstrated at large scale: large (460MWe) atmospheric and pressurized systems exist, and there is not a need for intensive scaling up as there is for the solvent scrubbing towers used in [[amine scrubbing]].&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blamey | first1 = J. | last2 = Anthony | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = J. | last4 = Fennell | first4 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = The Calcium Looping Cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture | url = | journal = Progress in Energy and Combustion Science | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 260–279 | doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the calcium looping process is energy efficient.  The heat required for the endothermic calcination of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the heat required to raise the temperature of fresh limestone from ambient temperature, can be provided by in-situ oxy-fired combustion of fuel in the calciner.  Although additional energy is required to separate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the majority of the energy input can be recovered because the carbonator reaction is exothermic and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the calciner can be used to power a steam cycle. A solid purge heat exchanger can also be utilized to recover energy from the deactivated CaO and coal ashes from the calciner.&lt;ref&gt;Romeo LM, Abanades JC, Escosa JM, Pano J, Giminez A, Sanchez-Biezma A,et al. Oxyfuel carbonation/calcination cycle for low cost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture in existing power plants. ''Energy Conversion and Management'' 2008;49(10):2809–14&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a relatively small efficiency penalty is imposed on the power process, where the efficiency penalty refers to the power losses for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compression, air separation and steam generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abanades | first1 = JC | last2 = Anthony | first2 = EJ | last3 = Wang | first3 = J | last4 = Oakey | first4 = JE | year = 2005 | title = Fluidized bed combustion systems integrating [[Carbon capture and storage|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture]] with CaO | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 39 | issue = 8| page = 2861 | doi=10.1021/es0496221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated at 6-8 % points, compared to 9.5-12.5 % from post combustion amine capture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blamey J., Anthony EJ, Wang J, Fennell PS, The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO2 capture, ''Progress in Energy and Combustion Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The main shortcoming of Ca-looping technology is the decreased reactivity of CaO through multiple calcination-carbonation cycles. This can be attributed to sintering and the permanent closure of small pores during [[carbonation]].

Figure 2 Repeated calcination/carbonation cycles of limestone in a TGA (Blamey et al, 2010)

===Closure of small pores===
The [[carbonation]] step is characterized by a fast initial reaction rate abruptly followed by a slow reaction rate (Figure 2).  The carrying capacity of the sorbent is defined as the number of moles of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted in the period of fast reaction rate with respect to that of the reaction stoichiometry for complete conversion of CaO to CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. As seen in Figure 2, while mass after calcination remains constant, the mass change upon carbonation- the carrying capacity- reduces with a large number of cycles. In calcination, porous CaO (molar volume =16.9cm3/g) is formed in place of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (36.9cm3/g.). On the other hand, in carbonation, the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formed on the surface of a CaO particle occupies a larger molar volume. As a result, once a layer of carbonate has formed on the surface (including on the large internal surface of porous CaO), it impedes further CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. This product layer grows over the pores and seals them off, forcing carbonation to follow a slower, [[diffusion]] dependent mechanism.

===Sintering===
CaO is also prone to [[sintering]], or change in pore shape, shrinkage and grain growth during heating.&lt;ref&gt;Blamey J., Anthony EJ, Wang J, Fennell PS, "The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, ''Progress in Energy and Combustion Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic compounds such as CaO mostly sinter because of volume diffusion or [[lattice diffusion]] mechanics. As described by sintering theory,&lt;ref&gt;German RM. Sintering Theory and Practice. New York: Wiley, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; vacancies generated by temperature sensitive defects direct void sites from smaller to larger ones, explaining the observed growth of large pores and the shrinkage of small pores in cycled limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = P | last2 = Grace | first2 = JR | last3 = Lim | first3 = CJ | last4 = Anthony | first4 = EJ | year = 2007 | title = The effect of CaO sintering on cyclic CO2 capture in energy systems | url = | journal = AIChE Journal | volume = 53 | issue = 9| pages = 2432–42 | doi=10.1002/aic.11251}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that sintering of CaO increases at higher temperatures and longer calcination durations, whereas carbonation time has minimal effect on particle sintering. A sharp increase in sintering of particles is observed at temperatures above 1173 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borgwardt | first1 = RH | year = 1989 | title = Sintering of nascent calcium oxide | url = | journal = Chemical Engineering Science | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 53–60 | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(89)85232-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a reduction in reactive surface area and a corresponding decrease in reactivity.

Solutions: Several options to reduce sorbent deactivation are currently being researched. An ideal sorbent would be mechanically strong, maintain its reactive surface through repeated cycles, and be reasonably inexpensive. Using thermally pre-activated particles or reactivating spent sorbents through hydration are two promising options.  Thermally pre-activated particles have been found to retain activity for up to a thousand cycles. Similarly, particles reactivated by hydration show improved long term (after~20 cycles) conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manovic | first1 = V | last2 = Anthony | first2 = EJ | year = 2008 | title = Thermal activation of CaO-based sorbent and self reactivation during CO2 capture looping cycles | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = 11| pages = 4170–4 | doi=10.1021/es800152s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disposal of waste sorbent ==

=== Properties of waste sorbent ===
After cycling several times and being removed from the calcium loop, the waste sorbent will have attrited, sulfated and become mixed with the ash from any fuel used. The amount of ash in the waste sorbent will depend on the fraction of the sorbent being removed and the ash and calorific content of the fuel. The size fraction of the sorbent is dependent on the original size fraction but also the number of cycles used and the type of limestone used.&lt;ref name="Belen thesis"&gt;{{cite book|last=González|first=Belén|title=Comportiamento de CaO Como Sorbente Regenerable para la Captura de CO2 (in Spanish)|date=May 2010|publisher=Universidad de Oviedo|location=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disposal routes ===
Proposed disposal routes of waste sorbent include:
* Landfill;
* Disposal at sea;
* Use in cement manufacture;
* Use in flue gas desulfurisation (FGD).

The lifecycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for power generation with CaL and the first three disposal techniques have been calculated.&lt;ref name="Hurst LCA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurst|first=Thomas F.|author2=Cockerill, Timothy T. |author3=Florin, Nicholas H. |title=Life cycle greenhouse gas assessment of a coal-fired power station with calcium looping CO2 capture and offshore geological storage|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2012|volume=5|issue=5|pages=7132|doi=10.1039/C2EE21204H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before disposal of the CaO coal power with CaL has a similar level of lifecycle emissions as amine scrubbing but with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing properties of CaO CaL becomes significantly less polluting. Ocean disposal was found to be the best, but [[London Convention (1972)|current laws relating to dumping waste at sea prevent this]]. Next best was use in cement manufacture, reducing emissions over an unabated coal plant by 93%.

==== Use in cement manufacture ====
[[Portland cement]] is approximately two-thirds calcium oxide by mass and its manufacture is responsible for approximately 8% of the world's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  emissions. 60% of this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  comes from the calcination of calcium carbonate as shown earlier in this article, and the other 40% from fossil fuel combustion. By replacing some or all of the calcium carbonate entering the plant with waste calcium oxide, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  caused from calcination can be avoided, as well as some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  from fossil fuel combustion.

This calcium oxide could be sourced from other point sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  such as power stations, but most effort has been focussed on integrating calcium looping with Portland cement manufacture. By replacing the calciner in the cement plant with a calcium looping plant, it should be possible to capture 90% or more of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  relatively inexpensively. There are alternative set-ups such as placing the calcium looping plant in the preheater section so as to make the plant as efficient as possible.

Some work has been undertaken into whether calcium looping affects the quality of the Portland cement produced, but results so far seem to suggest that the production of strength-giving phases such as [[alite]] are similar for calcium looped and non-calcium looped cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Charles.|last2=Hills|first2=Thomas.|last3=Florin|first3=Nick.|last4=Dugwell|first4=Denis.|last5=Fennell|first5=Paul S.|title=Integrating Calcium Looping CO2 Capture with the Manufacture of Cement|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2013|volume=37|pages=7078–7090|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2013.06.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic implications ==
Calcium looping has several economic advantages.

=== Cost per metric ton for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured ===
Firstly, Ca-looping offers greater cost advantage compared to conventional amine-scrubbing technologies. The cost/metric ton for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through Ca-looping is ~$23.70 whereas that for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through [[amine scrubbing]] is about $35–$96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = A | last2 = Granatstein | first2 = DL | last3 = Anthony | first3 = EJ | last4 = Abanades | first4 = JC | year = 2007 | title = Economics of CO2 capture using the calcium cycle with a pressurized fluidized bed combustion | url = | journal = Energy &amp; Fuels | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 920–6 | doi=10.1021/ef0603378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be attributed to the high availability and low cost of the CaO sorbent (derived from limestone) as compared to MEA. Also, as discussed in section 2, Ca-looping imposes a lower energy penalty than amine scrubbing, resulting in lower energy costs. The amine scrubbing process is energy intensive, with approximately 67% of the operating costs going into steam requirements for solvent regeneration. A more detailed comparison of Ca-looping and amine scrubbing is shown below.

===Cost of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided through Ca-looping===

In addition, the cost of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided through Ca-looping is lower than the cost of emissions avoided via an oxyfuel combustion process (~$23.8USD/t). This can be explained by the fact that, despite the capital costs incurred in constructing the carbonator for Ca-looping, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not only be captured from the oxy-fired combustion, but also from the main combustor (before the carbonator). The oxygen required in the calciners is only 1/3 that required for an oxyfuel process, lowering air separation unit capital costs and operating costs.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 3 wiki.png|thumb|Figure 3: Project Sensitivity Analysis (Mackenzie, 2007)]] --&gt;
Sensitivity Analysis: Figure 3 shows how varying 8 separate parameters affects the cost/metric ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through Ca-looping. It is evident that the dominant variables that affect cost are related to sorbent use, the Ca/C ratio and the CaO deactivation ratio. This is because the large sorbent quantities required dominate the economics of the capture process.

These variables should therefore be taken into account to achieve further cost reductions in the Ca-looping process. The cost of limestone is largely driven by market forces, and is outside the control of the plant. Currently, carbonators require a Ca/C ratio of 4 for effective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. However, if the Ca/C ratio or CaO deactivation is reduced (i.e. the sorbent can be made to work more efficiently), the reduction in material consumption and waste can lower feedstock demand and operating costs.

===Cement production===
Finally, favorable economics can be achieved by using the purged material from the calcium looping cycle in cement production. The raw feed for cement production includes ~ 85&amp;nbsp;wt% limestone with the remaining material consisting of clay and additives (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Alsop, P. A., Chen, H., Tseng, H., 2007. The Cement Plant Operations Handbook, Fifth Edition, Tradeship Publications, Surrey, UK. Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in the process involves calcinating limestone to produce CaO, which is then mixed with other materials in a kiln to produce clinker.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 4 Wiki.png|thumb|Figure 4: Process flow diagram of a cement production (Alsop et al., 2007)]] --&gt;

Using purged material from a Ca-looping system would reduce the raw material costs for cement production. Waste CaO and ash can be used in place of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (the main constituent cement feed). The ash could also fulfill the aluminosilicate requirements otherwise supplied by additives. Since over 60% of the energy used in cement production goes into heat input for the precalciner, this integration with Ca-looping and the consequent reduced need for a calcination step, could lead to substantial energy savings (EU, 2001). However, there are problems with using the waste CaO in cement manufacture. For example, adding Ca-looping to all coal-fired plants in the UK would generate enough waste for 33&amp;nbsp;Mtonnes/yr of cement production, whereas current cement production in the UK is only 12.5&amp;nbsp;Mtonnes/yr. Hence, if the technology is applied on a large scale, the purge rate of CaO should be optimized to minimize waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = A | last2 = Granatstein | first2 = DL | last3 = Anthony | first3 = EJ | last4 = Abanades | first4 = JC | year = 2007 | title = Economics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture using the calcium cycle with a pressurized fluidized bed combustor | url = | journal = Energy &amp; Fuels | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 920–6 | doi=10.1021/ef0603378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and environmental implications ==
To fully gauge the viability of calcium looping as a capture process, it is necessary to consider the political, environmental, and health effects of the process as well.

===Political implications===
Though many recent scientific reports (e.g.: the seven-wedge stabilization plan by Pacala and Socolow) convey an urgent need to deploy CCS, this urgency has not spread to the political establishment,&lt;ref&gt;Pacala S., Socolow R. Stabilizations Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies. Science, 2004. 305(5686), 968-972&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to the high costs and energy penalty of CCS &lt;ref&gt;Haszeldine R. Carbon Capture and Storage: How Green Can Black Be? Science, 2009. 325(5948), 1647-1652&lt;/ref&gt; The economics of calcium looping are integral to its political viability.  One economic and political advantage is the ability for Ca-looping to be retrofitted onto existing power plants, rather than requiring new plants to be built. The IEA sees power plants as an important target for carbon capture, and has set the goal to have all fossil fuel based power plants deploy CCS systems by 2040.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;IEA. Technology Roadmap: Carbon Capture and Storage. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, power plants are expensive to build, and long lived. Retrofitting of post-combustion capture systems, such as Ca-looping, seems to be the only politically and economically viable way to achieve the IEA’s goal.

A further political advantage is the potential synergy between calcium looping and cement production.  An IEA report concludes that to meet emission reduction goals, there should be 450 CCS projects in India and China by 2050.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, this could be politically difficult, especially with these nations’ numerous other development goals. After all, for a politician to commit money to CCS might be less advantageous than to commit it to job schemes or agricultural subsidies. Here, the integration of calcium looping with the prosperous and (particularly with infrastructure expansion in the developing world) vital cement industry might prove compelling to the political establishment.

This potential synergy with the cement industry also provides environmental benefits by simultaneously reducing the waste output of the looping process and decarbonizing cement production.  Cement manufacture is energy and resource intensive, consuming 1.5 tonnes of material per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jankovic, Alex. Walter Valery, Eugene Davis, "Cement grinding optimisation, ''Minerals Engineering'', Volume 17, Issues 11–12, November–December 2004, Pages 1075-1081&lt;/ref&gt; In the developing world, economic growth will drive infrastructure growth, increasing cement demand. Deploying a waste product for cement production could therefore have a large, positive environmental impact.

===Environmental implications===
The starting material for calcium looping is limestone, which is environmentally benign and widely available, accounting for over 10% (by volume) of all sedimentary rock. Limestone is already mined and cheaply obtainable. The mining process has no major known adverse environmental effects, beyond the unavoidable intrusiveness of any mining operation. However, as the following calculation shows, despite integration with cement industry, waste from Ca-looping can still be a problem.

From the environmental and health standpoint, Ca-looping compares favorably with amine scrubbing. Amine scrubbing is known to generate air pollutants, including amines and ammonia, which can react to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.&lt;ref&gt;Lag M., Lindeman B., Instanes C., Brunborg B., &amp; Schwarze P. Health effects of amines and derivatives associated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Norwegian Institute of Public Health: 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium looping, on the other hand, does not produce harmful pollutants. In addition, not only does it capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it also removes the pollutant SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gas.&lt;ref&gt;Coppola A., Montagnaro F., Salatino P., Scala F. Fluidized bed calcium looping: The effect of SO2 on sorbent attrition and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture capacity, Chemical Engineering Journal, Volumes 207–208, 1 October 2012, 445-449&lt;/ref&gt;  This is both an advantage and disadvantage, as the air quality improves, but the captured SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a detrimental effect on the cement that is generated from the calcium looping wastes.

== Advantages and drawbacks ==

=== Advantages of the process ===
Calcium looping is considered as potential promising solutions to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture energy penalty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidic.it/cet/13/35/070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods. Firstly, the method has been proved to yield a low efficiency penalties (5-8% points) while other mature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   capture systems yield a higher efficiency penalties (8-12.5%).&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ee/c5ee02950c#!divAbstract&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the method is well suited for a wide range of flue gases. Calcium looping is applicable for new builds and retrofits to existing power stations or other stationary industrial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources because the method can be implemented using large-scale circulating fluidized beds while other methods such as amine scrubbing is required a vastly upscale solvent scrubbing towers.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blamey | first1 = J. | last2 = Anthony | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = J. | last4 = Fennell | first4 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture | url = | journal = Progress in Energy and Combustion Science | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 260–279 | doi = 10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, crushed limestone used in calcium looping as the sorbent is a natural product, which is well distributed all over the world, non-hazardous and inexpensive. Many cement manufacturers or power plants located close to limestone sources could conceivably employ Calcium looping for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture. The waste sorbent can be used in cement manufacture.

=== Drawbacks ===
Apart from these advantages, there are several disadvantages needed to take into considerations.  The plant integrating Ca-Looping might require a high construction investment because of the high thermal power of the post-combustion calcium loop. The sorbent capacity decreases significantly with the number of cycles for every [[carbonation]]-[[calcination]] cycle so the calcium-looping unit will require a constant flow of limestone. In order to increase the long-term reactivity of the sorbent or to reactivate the sorbent, some methods are under investigation such as thermal pretreatment, [[chemical doping]] and the production of artificial sorbents.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; The method applying the concept of fluidized bed reactor, but there are some problems causing the uncertainty for the process. Attrition of the limestone can be a problem during repeated cycling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Benefits of calcium looping compared with other post-combustion capture processes ==
Calcium looping compares favorably with several post-combustion [[Carbon capture and storage|capture technologies]]. [[Amine scrubbing]] is the capture technology closest to being market-ready, and calcium looping has several marked benefits over it. When modeled on a 580&amp;nbsp;MW coal-fired power plant, Calcium looping experienced not only a smaller efficiency penalty (6.7-7.9% points compared to 9.5% for [[monoethanolamine]] and 9% for chilled ammonia) but also a less complex retrofitting process. Both technologies would require the plant to be retrofitted for adoption, but the calcium looping retrofitting process would result in twice the net power output of the scrubbing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanak | first1 = D. | last2 = Biliyok | first2 = C | last3 = Anthony | first3 = E | last4 = Manovic | first4 = V. | year = | title = Modelling and comparison of calcium looping and chemical solvent scrubbing retrofits for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plant | url = | journal = International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control | volume = 2015 | issue = | pages = 226–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this advantage can be compounded by introducing technology such as cryogenic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage systems. This ups the efficiency of the calcium looping technology by increasing the energy density by 57.4%, making the already low energy penalties even less of an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Hanak D., Biliyok C, Manovic V. Calcium looping with inherent energy storage for [[decarbonization]] of coal-fired power plant. Energy and Environmental Science 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium looping already has an energy advantage over [[amine scrubbing]], but the main problem is that amine scrubbing is the more ''market-ready technology''. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent scrubbing towers, the likes of which have never been used on an industrial scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine scrubbing system has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint.

== Sample evaluation ==

=== Assumptions ===
#  For a Ca-looping cycle installed on a 500 MW power plant, the purge rate is 12.6&amp;nbsp;kg CaO/s.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010, p. 260-279"/&gt;
#  For the cement production process, 0.65&amp;nbsp;kg CaO is required/ kg cement produced.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010, p. 260-279"/&gt;
#  U.S. electric generation capacity (only fossil fuels): Natural gas = 415 GW, Coal= 318 GW &amp; Petroleum = 51 GW &lt;ref&gt;EIA. Electricity: Electricity Generating Capacity (2013). http://www.eia.gov/electricity/capacity/
&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Cement consumption in U.S. = 110,470&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons = 1.10470&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons = 1.10470&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;USGS Mineral Resources Program. Cement. &lt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/170400.pdf&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculations ===
For a single Ca-looping cycle installed on a 500MW power plant:

# Amount of CaO from purge annually = 12.6&amp;nbsp;kg CaO/s&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;365 days/year&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;24 hr/day&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3600s / hour = 3.97&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg CaO/ year
# Cement that can be obtained from purge annually= 3.97&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg CaO/ year&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;kg cement/ 0.65&amp;nbsp;kg CaO = 6.11&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg cement/year
# Net electricity generation in US:  (415 + 318 + 51) GW = 784 GW = 7.84&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; W
# Number of 500 MW power plants: 7.84&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; W / 5.00&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; W = 1568 power plants
# Amount of cement that can be produced from Ca-looping waste: 1568&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;6.11&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg cement/ year = 9.58&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg cement/year
# Production from Ca-looping waste as percent of total annual cement consumption = [(9.58&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)/ (1.10470&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)]&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;100 = 870%

Therefore, amount of cement production from Ca-looping waste of all fossil fuel based electric power plants in US will be far greater than net consumption. To make Ca-looping more viable, waste must be minimized (i.e. sorbent degradation reduced) to ideally about 1/10th of current levels.

{{Split portions|Cat communication|discuss=Talk:Cat_behavior#Overlap_with_.22Cat_communication.22|date=July 2014}}
'''Cat behaviour''' includes [[body language]], elimination habits, aggression, play, communication, [[hunting]], [[personal grooming#In animals|grooming]], [[Territory (animal)#scent marking|urine marking]], and face rubbing in [[domestic cat]]s.  It varies among individuals, colonies, and breeds.

[[cat communication|Communication]] and [[cat#Sociability|sociability]] can vary greatly among individual cats. In a family with many cats, the interactions can change depending on which individuals are present and how restricted the territory and resources are. One or more individuals may become aggressive: fighting may occur with the attack resulting in scratches and deep bite wounds.

A cat's eating pattern in domestic settings are essential for the cat/owner bond to form. This happens because cats form attachments to households that regularly feed them.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, J. W. S., &amp; Cook, S. E. (1996). Patterns of Pet Cat Behaviour at Feeding Occasions. Applied Animal Behavioural Science 47(1), 61-64. DOI: doi.org/10.1016/0168-1591(95)01011-4&lt;/ref&gt; Some cats ask for food dozens of times a day, including at night, with rubbing, pacing, and meowing.

==Communication==
{{main|Cat communication}}

Kittens need vocalization early on in order to develop communication properly. The change in intensity of vocalization will change depending on how loud their feedback is. Some examples of different vocalizations are described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shipley|first1=C|last2=Buchwald|first2=J.S|last3=Carterette|first3=E.C|title=The role of auditory feedback in the vocalizations of cats|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=January 1988|volume=69|issue=2|pages=431–438|accessdate=|doi=10.1007/bf00247589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purring or a soft buzz, can mean that the cat is content or possibly that they are sick. Meows are a frequently used greeting. Meows occur when a mother is interacting with her young. Hissing or spitting indicate the cat is angry or defensive. Yowls can mean that the cat is in distress or feeling aggressive. Chattering occurs when they are hunting or being restrained from hunting. If you see your cat making quick chirps, and moving their mouths extremely quickly while their eyes are set and staring at on place, they are chattering, and channeling their inner urge to hunt. Big cats do this as well, but since domesticated cats are not in the wild, they still have their innate need to hunt. Grown cats also do not meow to other grown cats. Cats meow in adult form to talk to other animals, such as dogs, and more importantly humans. Meowing to humans has been researched as that they do it to manipulate humans into what they want and need. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonumous|title=Interpreting feline vocalization patterns|url=http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/interpreting-feline-vocalization-patterns|accessdate=27 November 2016|agency=DMV360|issue=37|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body language===
[[File:Two orange tabby cats greeting by rubbing-Hisashi-01.jpg|thumb|Cats greeting by rubbing against each other; the upright "question mark shape" tails also indicate happiness or friendship]]
Cats rely strongly on [[cat body language|body language]] to communicate. A cat may rub against an object, lick a person, and [[purr]]. Much of a cat's body language is through its tail, ears, head position, and back posture.  Cats flick their tails in an oscillating, snake-like motion, or abruptly from side to side, often just before pouncing on an object or animal in what looks like "play" hunting behavior.  If spoken to, a cat may flutter its tail in response, which may be the only indication of the interaction, though movement of its ears or head toward the source of the sound may be a better indication of the cat's awareness that a sound was made in their direction. 
When cats greet another cat in their vicinity, they can do a slow, languid, long blink to communicate affection if they trust the person or animal they are in contact with. It is a sign of trust. A way to communicate love and trust to your cat from a human perspective is to say their name, and get their attention, and then look them the eyes and slowly blink at them to emulate trust and love, and they may return to gesture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pachel|first1=Christopher|title=Intercat Aggression: Restoring Harmony in the Home: A Guide for Practitioners|journal=The Veterinary clinics of North America. Small animal practice|date=May 2014|volume=44|issue=3|pages=565–579|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2014.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scent rubbing and spraying===
These [[behaviors]] are thought to be a way of marking territory. Facial marking behavior is used to mark their territory as "safe". The cat rubs its cheeks on prominent objects in the preferred territory, depositing a chemical pheromone produced in glands in the cheeks. This is known as a contentment pheromone. Synthetic versions of the feline facial pheromone are available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic Feline Facial Pheromones: Making Recommendations in the Absence of Definitive Data, Part 1|url=http://www.petmd.com/blogs/fullyvetted/2013/april/synthetic-feline-facial-pheromones-30115#.Utgn3fsyPmE|publisher=petMD|author=Dr. Jennifer Coates, DVM|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feliway.com/|title=Feliway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats have anal sacs or scent glands. Scent is deposited on the feces as it is eliminated. Unlike intact male cats, female and neutered male cats usually do not [[spray urine]]. Spraying is accomplished by backing up against a vertical surface and spraying a jet of urine on that surface. Unlike a [[dog's penis]], a [[cat's penis]] points backward. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering. Urinating on horizontal surfaces in the home, outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of [[Feline lower urinary tract disease|urinary tract problems]]. Male cats on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency.

===Body postures===
A cat's posture communicates its emotions.  It is best to observe cats' natural behavior when they are by themselves, with humans, and with other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indoor Cat Initiative|url=http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/assets/pdf/education/courses/vm720/topic/indoorcatmanual.pdf|publisher=The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine|accessdate=22 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118090619/http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/assets/pdf/education/courses/vm720/topic/indoorcatmanual.pdf#|archive-date=2012-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their postures can be friendly or aggressive, depending upon the situation.  Some of the most basic and familiar cat postures include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test to determine how well you know feline body language|url=http://dusikcat.com/felines/tests/1-how-well-do-you-know-cats-language/?src=wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Ethogram for Behavioural Studies of the Domestic Cat|publisher=UFAW Animal Welfare Research Report No 8. UK Cat Behaviour Working Group, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Relaxed posture''' – The cat is seen lying on the side or sitting. Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended.  The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing.
*'''Stretching posture''' – another posture indicating cat is relaxed.
*[[File:Cat yawning Pixabay.jpg|thumb|Cat yawning posture]]'''Yawning posture''' – either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat.
*'''Alert posture''' – The cat is lying on its belly, or it may be sitting. Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards.
*'''Tense posture''' – The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its legs, including the hind legs are bent, and its front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up.
*'''Anxious/ovulating posture''' – The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side).
*'''Fearful posture''' – The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours.
*'''Terrified posture''' – The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Your Cat|url=http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232348/http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DERBYSHIRE|first1=DAVID|title=Can you speak CAT?

== Grooming ==
[[File:Cat_Self-Cleaning_1_2016-07-26.webm|thumb|alt=|Cat grooming itself.]]
Oral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in removing fleas. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control ectoparasites but scratch grooming as well may aid in dislodging fleas from the head and neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eckstein | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Hart | first2 = Benjamin L. | year = 2000 | title = Grooming and Control of Fleas in Cats | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 141–50 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(00)00095-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kneading==
{{main|Kneading (cats)}}
[[File:Amasamiento de un gato.ogv|thumb|Classic kneading of a cat]]
Kittens "knead" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother.

Cats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats "nurse", i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, opening its toes to expose its claws, then closes its claws as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.

Since most of the preferred "domestic traits" are [[Neoteny#Domestication|neotenous]] or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stefanie|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=June 2003|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526–32|accessdate=|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also [[stimulate]] the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human [[stretching]]. Kneading is often a precursor to [[sleep]]ing. Many cats [[purr]] while kneading. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=F.J|last2=Chenoweth|first2=P.J|title=Mammalian sexual dimorphism|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|date=April 2012|volume=131|issue=3–4|pages=109–122|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panting==
[[File:Una gata jadeando.JPG|thumb|A cat panting]]
Unlike dogs, [[Thermoregulation|panting]] is a rare occurrence in cats, except in warm weather environments. Some cats may pant in response to anxiety, fear or excitement. It can also be caused by play, exercise, or stress from things like car rides. However, if panting is excessive or the cat appears in distress, it may be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as a nasal blockage, [[heartworm]] disease, head [[physical trauma|trauma]], or drug [[poison]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petplace.com/cats/panting-in-cats-is-it-normal/page1.aspx# |title=Panting in Cats: Is It Normal? |author=Spielman, Dr. Bari |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, feline panting, especially if accompanied by other symptoms, such as [[cough]]ing or shallow breathing ([[dyspnea]]), is considered to be abnormal, and treated as a medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cat-health-guide.org/cat-panting.html|title=Cat Panting Explained|publisher=The Cat Health Guide|accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reflexes==
===Righting reflex===
[[File:Falling cat 1894.jpg|thumb|[[Chronophotography]] of a falling cat by [[Étienne-Jules Marey]], 1894]]
{{main|Cat righting reflex}}
The righting reflex is the attempt of cats to land on their feet at the completion of a jump or a fall. They can do this more easily than other animals due to their flexible spine, floating [[collar bone]], and loose skin. Cats also use vision and their vestibular apparatus to help tell which way to turn. They then can stretch themselves out and relax their muscles. The righting reflex does not always result in the cat landing on its feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Cecil |title=Do cats always land unharmed on their feet, no matter how far they fall? |work=The Straight Dope |publisher=Chicago Reader |date=1996-07-19 |url= http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_190.html |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
at the completion of the fall.

===Freeze reflex===
Adult cats are able to make use of [[pinch-induced behavioural inhibition]] to induce a 'freeze reflex' in their young which enables them to be transported by the neck without resisting. This reflex can also be exhibited by adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-one-myth-about-cats-thats-actually-true-1469745000 ''The one myth about cats that's actually true''] by Robbie Gonzalez.

==Food eating patterns==
[[File:Cat Eating Catgrass.jpg|thumb|Cat eating "[[cat grass]]"]]
Cats are [[obligate carnivores]], and do not do well on vegetarian diets. Felines in the wild usually hunt smaller mammals to keep themselves nourished.  Many cats find and chew small quantities of long grass but this is not for its nutritional value per se. The eating of grass seems to stem from feline ancestry and has nothing to do with dietary requirements. It is believed that feline ancestors instead ate grass for the purging of intestinal parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Benjamin|title=Why do dogs and cats eat grass?|journal=Veterinary Medicine|date=Dec 2008|volume=103|issue=12|page=648|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats have no sweet taste receptors on their tongue and thus cannot taste sweet things at all. Cats mainly smell for their food and what they taste for is amino acids instead. This may be a cause of cats being diagnosed with diabetes. The food that domestic cats get have a lot of carbohydrates in them and a high sugar content cannot be efficiently processed by the digestive system of cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Xia|title=Cats lack a sweet taste receptor|journal=the Journal of Nutrition|date=July 2006|volume=136|issue=7|pages=1932S–1934S|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/jn/136.7.1932s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats drink water by lapping the surface with their tongue. A fraction of a teaspoon of water is taken up with each lap. Although some desert cats are able to obtain much of their water needs through the flesh of their prey, most cats come to bodies of water to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macdonald|first1=Rogers|title=Nutrition of the domestic cat, a mammalian carnivore|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=1984|volume=4|pages=521–562|accessdate=|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.4.1.521|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialization==
[[Socialization]] is defined as a member of a specific group learning to be part of that said group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/socialization|title=Socialization|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be a continuous learning process that allows an individual to learn the necessary skills and behaviours required for a particular social position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/socialization|title=Socialization|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2018|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats, domestic or wild, do participate in social behaviours, even though it is thought that cats (besides lions) are solitary, anti-social animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Free-Ranging Cats: Behaviour, Ecology, &amp; Management|last=Spotte|first=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-88401-0|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=49-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain circumstances, such as food availability, shelter, or protection, cats can be seen in groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The social behaviours that cats participate in are colony organization, social learning, socialization between cats, and socialization with humans.

====Colony organization ====
=====In Lions=====
Lions are the most well known wild cat that form very prominent colonies, known as prides. The social structure of these prides are very interesting. Within prides, the female lions play a crucial role. They form the center of the pride along with their young.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cat Behaviour: The Predatory &amp; Social Behaviour of Domestic &amp; Wild Cats|last=Leyhausen|first=Paul|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1979|isbn=0-8240-7017-8|location=New York, New York|pages=164-216, 227-231}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also responsible for hunting and feeding the members of the pride.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Male lions are in small numbers, about 2 - 5, are present in a pride and are around for reproduction and defensive purposes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The number of members within a pride stay constant. Young male and female lions only get to stay in the pride to make up numbers that have dwindled from death.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Female lions that are kicked out of their original pride roam alone in search for territory to start her own pride or to find a pride low in numbers that will take her in.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Females within a pride are better protected and this protection allows for better hunting efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haas|first=S. K.|last2=Hayssen|first2=V|last3=Krausman|first3=P. R.|date=2005|title=Panthera leo|url=|journal=Mammalian Species|volume=762|issue=1|pages=1-11|doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2005)762[0001:PL]2.0.0.CO|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring survival. Male lions that are kicked out usually stick together in groups and search for a female pride in need of males or they will compete with other males for their pride.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== In Free Living Domestic Cats =====
Free living domestic cats tend to form small to large colonies&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Crowell-Davis|first=Sharon, L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=Netherlands|pages=|chapter=Cat Behaviour: Social Organization, Communication, &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small colonies consist of one female, known as a queen, and her kittens. Large colonies consist of several queens and their kittens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male cats are present in both types of colonies and serve the purpose of reproduction and defending territory. Within these colonies altruistic behaviour occurs. This means that if an expecting queen helps another queen that just gave birth, then the helping queen will get help when she gives birth in return&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Although free living cats are found in colonies. Stable social order, like that of the lion, does not exist.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Free-Ranging Cats: Behaviour, Ecology, &amp; Management|last=Spotte|first=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-88401-0|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=49-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free living cats usually are found in colonies for protection against predators, and food availability.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Although there are many advantages of group living, such as easy access to mates, and defensive measures to protect food, there are also disadvantages such as, sexual competitions for mates, and if the group becomes too big then fights may break out over food. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Social Learning ====
Cats are [[Observational learning|observational learners]]. &lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Crowell-Davis|first=Sharon, L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=Netherlands|pages=|chapter=Cat Behaviour: Social Organization, Communication, &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Behaviour of the Domestic Cat|last=Bradshaw|first=John W. S.|publisher=CAB International|year=1992|isbn=0 85198 715 X|location=Wallingford|pages=78, 198-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of learning emerges early in a cats life,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alder|first=H.E.|date=1955|title=Some Factors of Observational Learning|url=https://search-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/docview/1297110751/fulltext/599AAA1E6420404EPQ/1?accountid=12378|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=86|pages=159-177|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown in many laboratory studies. Young kittens learn to hunt from their mothers by observing their techniques when catching prey.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The mother ensures their kittens learn hunting techniques by first bringing dead prey to the litter, than live prey. With the live prey, she demonstrates the techniques required for successful capture to her kittens. Once this is done, she then brings live prey to the litter for the kittens to catch themselves.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Prey-catching behaviour of kittens improves over time when mothers are present over when they are not. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caro|first=T. M.|date=1980|title=Effects of the Mother, Object Play, and Adult Experience on Predation in Cats|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163104780924565|journal=Behavioural and Neural Biology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=29-51|doi=|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational learning for cats can be described in the terms of the drive to complete the behaviour, the cue that initiates the behaviour, the response to the cue, and the reward for completing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is shown above when cats learn predatory behaviour from their mothers. The drive is hunger, the cue is the prey, the response is to catch the prey, and the reward is to relieve the hunger sensation.

Kittens also show observational learning when they are socializing with humans. They are more likely to initiate socialization with humans when their mothers are exhibiting non-aggressive and non-defensive behaviours.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Even though mothers spend most time with their kittens, male cats play an important role by breaking up fights among litter mates.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Observational learning is not limited to kitten-hood, it can also be observed during adulthood. Studies have been done with adult cats performing task, such as pressing a lever after a visual cue.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Adult cats that see others performing the tasks, learn to perform the same task faster than those who did not witness another cat.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==== Socialization Between Cats ====
When strange cats meet, ideally they would cautiously allow the strange cat to smell its hindquarters, but this does not happen very often.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cat Behaviour: The Predatory &amp; Social Behaviour of Domestic &amp; Wild Cats|last=Leyhausen|first=Paul|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1979|isbn=0-8240-7017-8|location=New York, New York|pages=164-216, 227-231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually when strange cats meet, one cat makes a sudden movement that puts the other cat into a defensive mode. The cat will then draw in on itself and prepare to attack if needed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If an attack were to happen the subordinate cat will usually run away, but this does not happen all the time and it could lead to a tomcat duel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dominance is also seen as an underlying factor for how [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] interact with each other.

===== Dominance =====
Dominance can be seen among cats in multi-cat households. It can be seen when other cats submit to the "dominant" cat. Behaviours such as walking around the dominant cat, waiting for the dominant cat to walk pass, avoiding eye contact, and retreating when the dominant cat approaches.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Crowell-Davis|first=Sharon, L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=Netherlands|pages=|chapter=Cat Behaviour: Social Organization, Communication, &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant cats present a specific body posture as well. The cat displays ears straight up, the base of its tail will be arched, and it looks directly at subordinate cats.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These dominant cats are usually not aggressive, but if a subordinate cat blocks food they will become aggressive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cat: History, Biology, and Behaviour.|last=Beadle|first=Muriel|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1977|isbn=0-671-22451-4|location=New York, New York|pages=100-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this aggressive behaviour occurs it could also lead to the dominant cat preventing subordinate cats from eating and using the litter box.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This can cause the subordinate cat to defecate somewhere else and create problems with human interaction.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

===== Social Conflicts =====
[[File:Catplay-fight.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Catplay-fight.JPG|thumb|235x235px|A display of two cats fighting]]
Social conflicts among cats depends solely on the behaviour of the cat. Some research has shown that cats rarely pick fights, but when they do its usually for protecting food and/or litters, and defending territory.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cat: History, Biology, and Behaviour.|last=Beadle|first=Muriel|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1977|isbn=0-671-22451-4|location=New York, New York|pages=100-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sign of a tom cat duel is when both cat draws themselves up high on their legs, all hair along the middle of their backs are standing straight up, and they mew and howl loudly as they approach one another.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cat Behaviour: The Predatory &amp; Social Behaviour of Domestic &amp; Wild Cats|last=Leyhausen|first=Paul|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1979|isbn=0-8240-7017-8|location=New York, New York|pages=164-216, 227-231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps the cats make become slower and shorter the closer they become to one another. Once they are close enough to attack, they pause slightly, and then one cat leaps and tries to bite the nape of the other cat.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The other cat has no choice but to retaliate and both cats are rolling aggressively on the ground, and loud intense screams come from both cats.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Before you know it both cats separate and stand face to face to begin the attack all over again. This can go on for some time until one cat does not get up again and remains seated.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The defeated cat does not move until the victor has completed a sniff of the area and moves outside the fighting area. Once this happens the defeated cat leaves the area ending the duel.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Socialization With Humans ====
Humans and cats have a long history starting back with the ancient Egyptians, who were the first to domesticate cats.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Bernstein|first=Penny L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=|pages=47-89|chapter=The Human-Cat Relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats between the age of three to nine weeks are sensitive to human socialization&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour|last=Turner|first=Dennis C.|last2=Bateson|first2=Patrick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-521-35447-1|location=Cambridge|pages=112-113, 159-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after this period socialization can less effective.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Studies have shown that the earlier the kitten is handled, the less fearful the kitten will be towards humans.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other factors that can enhance the socialization are having many people handle the kitten frequently, the presence of the mother, and feeding.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The presence of the mother is important because cats are observational learners. If the mother is comfortable around humans then it can reduce anxiety in the kitten and promote the kitten-human relationship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For Feral kittens around two to seven weeks old can be socialized usually within a month of capture.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Rachel|last2=Bradshaw|first2=John|date=November 2008|title=The effects of additional socialisation for kittens in a rescue centre on their behaviour and suitability as a pet|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=114|issue=1–2|pages=196–205|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of cats cannot be socialized towards humans because of factors like genetic influence and in some cases specific learning experiences.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The best way to get a kitten to socialize is to handle the kitten for many hours a week.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The process is made easier if there is another socialized cat present but not necessarily in the same space as the feral. If the handler can get a cat to urinate in the litter tray, then the others in a litter will usually follow. Initial contact with thick gloves is highly recommended until trust is established, usually within the first week. It is a challenge to socialize an adult. Socialized adult feral cats tend to trust only those who they trusted in their socialization period, and therefore can be very fearful around strangers.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

Cats are also used for companion animals. Studies have shown that these animals provide many physiological and psychological benefits for the owner.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Bernstein|first=Penny L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=|pages=47-89|chapter=The Human-Cat Relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of cat behaviour that are deemed advantageous for the human-cat bond are cat hygiene (cats are known for good hygiene)&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Heath|first=Sarah E.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=|pages=91-107|chapter=Behaviour Problems and Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they do not have to be taken outside (use of the litter box), they are perfect for smaller spaces, and they have no problems with being left alone for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Even though there are a number of benefits for owning a cat, there are a number of problematic behaviours that affect the human-cat relationship. One behaviour is when cats attack people by clawing and biting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Behaviour of the Domestic Cat|last=Bradshaw|first=John W. S.|publisher=CAB International|year=1992|isbn=0 85198 715 X|location=Wallingford|pages=78, 198-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often occurs all of a sudden or could be triggered by sudden movements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another problematic behaviour is the 'petting and biting syndrome', which involves the cat being pet and then suddenly attacking and running away.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other problems are house soiling, scratching furniture, and when a cat brings dead prey into the house.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is because of these kinds of behaviours that puts a strain on the socialization between cats and people.

==Cat environment==

Cats like to organize their environment based on their needs. Like their ancestors, domestic cats still have an inherent desire to maintain an independent territory but are generally content to live with other cats for company as they easily get bored. Living alone for a longer time may let them forget how to communicate with other cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2012/06/one-kitten-or-two.html|title=One Kitten or Two?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, however, adding a kitten to a household can be a bad idea. If there already is an older cat present and another cat is added to their environment it may be better to get another older cat that has been socialized with other cats. When a kitten is introduced to a mature cat, that cat may show feline asocial aggression where they feel threatened and act aggressive to drive off the intruders. If this happens, the kitten and the cat should be separated, and slowly introduced by rubbing towels on the animals and presenting the towel to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beaver|first1=Bonnie|title=Fractious cats and feline aggression|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|date=September 2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=13–18|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.jfms.2003.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats use scent and [[pheromone]]s to help organize their territory by marking prominent objects. If these objects or scents are removed it upsets the cat's perception of its environment.

=== Importance of space for domestic and feral cats ===

The domestic cat has become more sociable through contact of its own species through domestication. The domestic cat is more juvenile than the African wildcat; this promotes greater tolerance of other cats and domestic animals.

It has been documented that feral cat colonies have a social structure whereas the females of the group live together and help with each other's kittens whereas the males do not. There are also studies that cats do form hierarchies when housed in a limited space. It is known that cats show higher levels of stress during the first couple of weeks at a shelter vs. in a group house controlled together for 2–16 weeks.{{clarify|this sentence does not make any sense|date=October 2017}} This study showed that those cats housed in smaller spaces are forced to interact with each other while the more space per cat the less stress related behaviours.&lt;ref name="journals1.scholarsportal.info.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2016.05.030 | volume=182 | title=The effect of space on behaviour in large groups of domestic cats kept indoors | year=2016 | journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science | pages=23–29 | last1 = Loberg | first1 = Jenny M. | last2 = Lundmark | first2 = Frida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiment approved by the Swedish Ethical Committee in Gothenburg, concluded “From our result we conclude that increasing the space for group housed cats, from 1&amp;nbsp;[[square meter|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/cat to 4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cat, increases the amount of play behavior. The amount of licking and body contact (i.e. positive inactivity) between cats, and the activity increases when cats are housed on 4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cat compared to 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cat. Play has been used as an indicator of positive welfare in other species, and licking and body contact can indicate positive contact between individuals, we therefore argue that the increase in space given to these cats slightly increased their welfare. However, further studies are needed on the effect of space and density of cats when housed together in groups.”{{clarify|This is barely coherent English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19066">'''Cellular noise''' is random variability in quantities arising in [[cellular biology]]. For example, cells which are genetically identical, even within the same tissue, are often observed to have different expression levels of proteins, different sizes and structures.&lt;ref name = "kaernrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "oshearev" /&gt; These apparently random differences can have important biological and medical consequences.&lt;ref name = "johnstonsig" /&gt;

Cellular noise was originally, and is still often, examined in the context of gene expression levels – either the concentration or copy number of the products of genes within and between cells. As [[gene expression]] levels are responsible for many fundamental properties in cellular biology, including cells' physical appearance, behaviour in response to stimuli, and ability to process information and control internal processes, the presence of noise in gene expression has profound implications for many processes in cellular biology.

== Definitions ==
The most frequent quantitative definition of noise is the [[coefficient of variation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta_X = \frac{\sigma_X}{\mu_X},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_X&lt;/math&gt; is the noise in a quantity &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard deviation]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This measure is [[dimensionless]], allowing a relative comparison of the importance of noise, without necessitating knowledge of the absolute mean.

Other quantities often used for mathematical convenience are the [[Fano factor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;F_X = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X}.&lt;/math&gt;

and the normalized variance:

: &lt;math&gt;N_X = \eta_X^2 = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Intrinsic and extrinsic noise ==
[[File:Extrinsic and intrinsic noise in cellular biology.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic illustration of a dual reporter study. Each data point corresponds to a measurement of the expression level of two identically-regulated genes in a single cell: the scatter reflects measurements of a population of cells. Extrinsic noise is characterised by expression levels of both genes covarying between cells, intrinsic by internal differences.]]

Cellular noise is often investigated in the framework of ''intrinsic'' and ''extrinsic'' noise. Intrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities within a single cell: for example, the intra-cell variation in expression levels of two identically-controlled genes. Extrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities between different cells: for example, the cell-to-cell variation in expression of a given gene.

Intrinsic and extrinsic noise levels are often compared in '''dual reporter studies''', in which the expression levels of two identically-regulated genes (often fluorescent reporters like [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] and [[Yellow fluorescent protein|YFP]]) are plotted for each cell in a population.&lt;ref name = "elowitz" /&gt;

;Intrinsic noise
* ''Low copy-number effects (including discrete birth and death events)'': the random ([[stochastic]]) nature of production and degradation of cellular components means that noise is high for components at low copy number (as the magnitude of these random fluctuations is not negligible with respect to the copy number);
* ''Diffusive cellular dynamics'':&lt;ref name = "tenwolde" /&gt; many important cellular processes rely on collisions between reactants (for example, RNA polymerase and DNA) and other physical criteria which, given the [[Diffusion|diffusive]] dynamic nature of the cell, occur stochastically.
* ''Noise propagation'': Low copy-number effects and diffusive dynamics result in each of the biochemical reactions in a cell occurring randomly. Stochasticity of reactions can be either attenuated or amplified. Contribution each reaction makes to the intrinsic variability in copy numbers can be quantified via [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].&lt;ref name = "decomposingnoise" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "stochdecomp" /&gt;
;Extrinsic noise
* ''Cellular age / cell cycle stage'': cells in a dividing population that is not synchronised will, at a given snapshot in time, be at different [[cell cycle]] stages, with corresponding biochemical and physical differences;&lt;ref name = "newman" /&gt;
* ''Physical environment (temperature, pressure, ...)'': physical quantities and chemical concentrations (particularly in the case of cell-to-cell signalling) may vary spatially across a population of cells, provoking extrinsic differences as a function of position;&lt;ref name = "athale" /&gt;
* ''Organelle distributions'': random factors in the quantity and quality of organelles (for example, the number and functionality of [[mitochondria]]&lt;ref name = 'dasneves' /&gt;) lead to significant cell-to-cell differences in a range of processes&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt; (as, for example, mitochondria play a central role in the energy budget of eukaryotic cells);
* ''Inheritance noise'': uneven partitioning of cellular components between daughter cells at [[mitosis]] can result in large extrinsic differences in a dividing population.&lt;ref name = "huh" /&gt;

Note that extrinsic noise can affect levels and types of intrinsic noise:&lt;ref name = "shahrezaei" /&gt; for example, extrinsic differences in the mitochondrial content of cells lead, through differences in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] levels, to some cells transcribing faster than others, affecting the rates of gene expression and the magnitude of intrinsic noise across the population.&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;

== Effects ==
''Note'': These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise effects is an active and expanding area of research.

* ''Gene expression levels'': noise in gene expression causes differences in the fundamental properties of cells, limits their ability to biochemically control cellular dynamics,&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt; and directly or indirectly induce many of the specific effects below;
* ''Energy levels and transcription rate'': [[Transcriptional noise|noise in transcription rate]], arising from sources including [[transcriptional bursting]], is a significant source of noise in expression levels of genes. Extrinsic noise in [[mitochondria]]l content has been suggested to propagate to differences in the ATP concentrations and transcription rates (with functional relationships implied between these three quantities) in cells, affecting cells' energetic competence and ability to express genes;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Phenotype selection'': bacterial populations exploit extrinsic noise to choose a population subset to enter a quiescent state.&lt;ref name = "fraser" /&gt; In a bacterial infection, for example, this subset will not propagate quickly but will be more robust when the population is threatened by antibiotic treatment: the rapidly replicating, infectious bacteria will be killed more quickly than the quiescent subset, which may be capable of restarting the infection. This phenomenon is why courses of antibiotics should be finished even when symptoms seem to have disappeared;
* ''Development and stem cell differentiation'': [[developmental noise]] in biochemical processes which need to be tightly controlled (for example, patterning of gene expression levels that develop into different body parts) during organismal development can have dramatic consequences, necessitating the evolution of robust cellular machinery. [[Stem cells]] differentiate into different cell types depending on the expression levels of various characteristic genes:&lt;ref name = "enver" /&gt; noise in gene expression can clearly perturb and influence this process, and noise in transcription rate can affect the structure of the dynamic landscape that differentiation occurs on;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Cancer treatments'': recent work has found extrinsic differences, linked to gene expression levels, in the response of cancer cells to anti-cancer treatments, potentially linking the phenomenon of fractional killing (whereby each treatment kills some but not all of a tumour) to noise in gene expression.&lt;ref name = "spencer" /&gt;  Because individual cells could repeatedly and stochastically perform transitions between states associated with differences in responsiveness to a therapeutic modality (chemotherapy, targeted agent, radiation, etc.), therapy might need to be administered frequently (to ensure cells are treated soon after entering a therapy-responsive state, before they can rejoin the therapy-resistant subpopulation and proliferate) and over long times (to treat even those cells emerging late from the final residue of the therapy-resistant subpopulation).&lt;ref name = "liaoconceptualizing" /&gt;
* ''Information processing'': as cellular regulation is performed with components that are themselves subject to noise, the ability of cells to process information and perform control is fundamentally limited by intrinsic noise&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "swaininfo" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Modelling stochastic gene expression.svg|thumb|400px|A canonical model for stochastic gene expression, known as the two-state or telegraph &lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt; model. DNA flips between "inactive" and "active" states (involving, for example, [[chromatin|chromatin remodelling]] and [[transcription factor]] binding). Active DNA is transcribed to produce mRNA which is translated to produce protein, both of which are degraded. All processes are [[Poisson process|Poissonian]] with given rates.]]

As many quantities of cell biological interest are present in discrete copy number within the cell (single DNAs, dozens of mRNAs, hundreds of proteins), tools from discrete [[Stochastic process|stochastic mathematics]] are often used to analyse and model cellular noise.&lt;ref name = "paulsson" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wilkinson" /&gt; In particular, [[master equation]] treatments – where the probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; of observing a system in a state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are linked through [[Ordinary differential equation|ODEs]] – have proved particularly fruitful. A canonical model for noise gene expression, where the processes of [[Transcription factor|DNA activation]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] are all represented as [[Poisson processes]] with given rates, gives a master equation which may be solved exactly (with [[generating functions]]) under various assumptions or approximated with stochastic tools like [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].

Numerically, the [[Gillespie algorithm]] or stochastic simulation algorithm is often used to create realisations of stochastic cellular processes, from which statistics can be calculated.

The problem of inferring the values of parameters in stochastic models ([[Parametric statistics|parametric inference]]) for biological processes, which are typically characterised by sparse and noisy experimental data, is an active field of research, with methods including [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Bayesian MCMC]] and [[approximate Bayesian computation]] proving adaptable and robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sunnåker et al |title=Approximate bayesian computation |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |date=2013 |volume=9 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the two-state model, a moment-based method was described for parameters inference from mRNAs distributions.&lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt;

'''Cognitive complexity''' describes [[cognition]] along a simplicity-complexity axis. It is the subject of academic study in fields including [[personal construct psychology]],&lt;ref name='bell.2004'&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=R.C. |title=Cognitive complexity |work=The Internet Encyclopaedia of Personal Construct Psychology |publisher=The Psychology of Personal Constructs |date=2004-02-14 |url=http://www.pcp-net.org/encyclopaedia/cogcom.html |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[organizational studies|organisational theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www83.homepage.villanova.edu/richard.jacobs/MPA%208002/Powerpoint/cogcomp/ |title=Analyzing Organizations Through Cognitive Complexity |author=Villanova University |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[human–computer interaction]].&lt;ref name='Rauterberg'&gt;{{cite conference |title=How to Measure Cognitive Complexity in Human–Computer Interaction |last=Rauterberg |first=Matthias |year=1996 |volume=II |editor=Robert Trappl(ed) |booktitle=Proceedings of the Thirteenth European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research |url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/17603063 |pages=815–820 |location=University of Vienna, Austria |conference=Thirteenth European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research |conferenceurl=http://www.osgk.ac.at/emcsr/96/ |isbn=3-85206-133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
First proposed by [[James Bieri]] in 1955.&lt;ref name='bell.2004'/&gt;

==In psychology==
{{More footnotes|date=April 2010}}
Cognitive complexity is a [[psychological]] characteristic or psychological variable that indicates how complex or simple is the [[framing (social sciences)|frame]] and [[perception|perceptual]] skill of a person. A person who is measured high on [[cognitive]] complexity tends to perceive nuances and subtle differences which a person with a lower measure, indicating a less complex cognitive [[structure]] for the task or activity, does not.
{{Quote box |quote=an aspect of a person's cognitive functioning which at one end is defined by the use of many constructs with many relationships to one another (complexity) and at the other end by the use of few constructs with limited relationships to one another (simplicity) |source=[[Lawrence Pervin]], ''Personality''&lt;ref name='Rauterberg'/&gt; |width=33% |align=right}}

It is used as part of one of the several variations of the viable non-empirical evaluation model [[GOMS]] (goals, operators, methods, and selection rules); in particular the [[GOMS/CCT]] methodology.

Cognitive complexity can have various meanings:
* the number of mental structures we use, how abstract they are, and how elaborately they interact to shape our perceptions.
* "an individual-difference variable associated with a broad range of communication skills and related abilities ... [which] indexes the degree of differentiation, articulation, and integration within a cognitive system".&lt;ref&gt;Burleson, B.R., &amp; Caplan, S.E. (1998), "Cognitive complexity". In J.C. McCroskey, J.A. Daly, M.M. Martin, &amp; M.J. Beatty (Eds.), ''Communication and personality: Trait perspectives'' (233–286). Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer science==
{{further|Complexity}}
In [[human–computer interaction]], cognitive (or psychological) complexity distinguishes human factors (related to [[psychology]] and human cognition) from, for example, [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].&lt;ref name=thomas:2008&gt;{{cite book |first1=John C. |last1=Thomas |first2=John T. |last2=Richards |editor-last=Sears |editor-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Jacko |editor2-first=Julie A. |chapter=Achieving Psychological Simplicity: Methods And Measures To Reduce Cognitive Complexity |year=2008 |pages=498–507 |title=The human–computer interaction handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications |edition=2nd |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |url=http://www.isrc.umbc.edu/HCIHandbook/ |isbn=978-0-8058-5870-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In artificial intelligence==

In an attempt to explain how humans perceive relevance, cognitive complexity is defined as an extension of the notion of [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. It amounts to the length of the shortest description ''available to the observer''.
Here is an example :
Individuating a particular Inuit woman among one hundred people is simpler in a village in Congo rather than in an Inuit village.

Cognitive complexity is related to probability (see [[Simplicity theory]]): situations are cognitively improbable if they are simpler to describe than to generate.
Human individuals attach two complexity values to events:
* description complexity (see above definition)
* generation complexity: the size of the minimum set of parameter values that the 'world' (as imagined by the observer) needs to generate the event.

To 'generate' an event such as an encounter with an Inuit woman in Congo, one must add up the complexity of each event in the causal chain that brought her there. The significant gap between both complexities (hard to produce, easy to describe) makes the encounter improbable and thus narratable.

==Related terms==
Related to cognitive complexity is the term '''behavioral complexity''', used by some researchers in [[organizational studies]], [[organizational culture]] and [[management]].&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Hooijberg, ''Behavioral complexity and managerial effectiveness: a new perspective on managerial leadership'', University of Michigan, 1992; [[Daniel R. Denison]], Robert Hooijberg, Robert E. Quinn, [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/35553/1/b1714508.0001.001.txt Toward a theory of behavioral complexity in managerial leadership], University of Michigan, September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from traditional gene knockout because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional gene knockout technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional [[gene knockout]]. In traditional gene knockout, embryonic death from a gene [[mutation]] can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to knockout genes at a specific stage in development and study how the knockout of a gene in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues.&lt;ref name="germline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Alan|title=Manipulating the germline: its impact on the study of carcinogenesis|journal=Carcinogenesis|date=21 March 2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=435–441|pmid=10688863|doi=10.1093/carcin/21.3.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cre"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jian|last2=Zhao|first2=Jing|title=Conditional gene manipulation: Cre-ating a new biological era|journal=J Zheijang Univ Sci B|date=July 2012|volume=13|issue=7|pages=511–524|pmc=3390709|doi=10.1631/jzus.b1200042|pmid=22761243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Conditional_Knockout_Mouse.jpg|frame|Diagram showing how to generate a conditional knockout mouse: A mouse containing the Cre gene and a mouse containing the lox gene were bred to generate a conditional knockout for a particular gene of interest. The mice do not naturally express Cre recombinase or lox sites, but they have been engineered to express these gene products to create the desirable offspring.]]
The most commonly used technique is the Cre-lox recombination system. The Cre recombinase enzyme specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it.&lt;ref name="zebrafish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt; This whole system is inducible so a chemical can be added to knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the most commonly used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be the most difficult part of this technique.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

==Uses==
The conditional gene knockout method is often used to model human diseases in other mammals.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; It has increased scientists’ ability to study diseases, such as cancer, that develop in specific cell types or developmental stages.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; It is known that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to breast cancer. Scientists used conditional gene knockout to delete the BRCA1 [[allele]] in mammary gland tissue in mice and found that it plays an important role in tumour suppression.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

A specific gene in mouse brain thought to be involved in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]] which codes for the enzyme [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (Cdk5) was knocked out. Such mice were found to be 'smarter' than normal mice and were able to handle complex tasks more intelligently compared to 'normal' mice bred in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/Increased-intelligence-through-genetic-engineering |title=Increased intelligence through genetic engineering |accessdate=2015-05-30 |date=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP)==
Conditional gene knockouts in mice are often used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells for each of the 20,000 protein coding genes in mice.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; The genes are knocked out because this is the best way to study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the conditional gene knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. Conditional gene knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guan|first1=Chunmei|last2=Ye|first2=Chao|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomei|last4=Gao|first4=Jiangang|title=A Review of Current Large-Scale Mouse Knockout Efforts|journal=Genesis|date=2010|volume=48|issue=2|pages=73–85|doi=10.1002/dvg.20594|pmid=20095055}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gondo|first1=Y|title=Trends in large-scale mouse mutagenesis: from genetics to functional genomics.|journal=Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Constitutive rhetoric''' is a theory of [[discourse]] devised by [[James Boyd White]] about the capacity of [[language]] or [[symbols]] to create a collective [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] for an [[audience]], especially by means of [[condensation symbols]], [[literature]], and [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Thomas, ed. “Constitutive Rhetoric” Encyclopedia of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''Heracles’ Bow'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Constitutive Rhetorical Theory==

The constitutive model of [[rhetoric]] dates back to the ancient Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge.  [[Kenneth Burke]] contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;Charland, Maurice. “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.” (The Quarterly Journal of Speech 73.2 1987), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black's]] theory of the [[second persona]] also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through [[textual analysis]]. Audience must adopt a particular [[ethos]] prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, [[James Boyd White]] was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described [[rhetoric]] that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within [[culture]], and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through [[material culture|material]] [[identification (psychology)|identification]].

According to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is ''peithõ'', persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or ''dolos''. Using ''peithõ'', speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. ''Dolos'' creates belonging through deceit.&lt;ref&gt;White, Heracles’ Bow, 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the [[narrative]] and [[Marxist theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 616.&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, James. “Narrative” Sourcebook on Rhetoric (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2001), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser explained [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], or "hailing," as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an [[ideology]]. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis. “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” The Anthropology of the State (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” &lt;ref&gt;Charland, “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.”,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;  A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellate]] a smaller sub-group of the [[audience]]. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.

In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.&lt;ref&gt;Halstrøm, P. L. &amp; P. Galle. “Design as co-evolution of problem, solution, and audience.” Artifact 3(4), (2015): 3.1-3.13. {{DOI|10.14434/artifact.v3i4.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Constitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as [[New Criticism]] or [[Neo-Aristotelianism]]) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cotyledon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|t|ᵻ|ˈ|l|iː|d|ən}}; "seed leaf" from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cotyledon'',{{sfn|Short|George|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFcKLxqEAj4C&amp;pg=PA15 p.&amp;nbsp;15]}} from [[Greek language|Greek]]: κοτυληδών ''kotylēdōn'', gen.: κοτυληδόνος ''kotylēdonos'', from κοτύλη [[Cotyla|''kotýlē'']] "cup, bowl") is a significant part of the [[embryo]] within the [[seed]] of a [[plant]], and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "The primary leaf in the embryo of the higher plants (Phanerogams); the seed-leaf."{{sfn|OED|2015}} Upon [[germination]], the cotyledon may become the embryonic first [[leaf|leaves]] of a seedling. The number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to classify the [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms). Species with one cotyledon are called [[monocotyledonous]] ("monocots"). Plants with two embryonic leaves are termed [[dicotyledonous]] ("dicots").

In the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons are formed during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, are formed post-embryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant.

The cotyledon of [[Poaceae|grasses]] and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a ''[[Scutellum (botany)|scutellum]]'' and a ''[[coleoptile]]''. The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent [[endosperm]]. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the ''plumule'' (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant).

[[Gymnosperm]] seedlings also have cotyledons, and these are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with from 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the [[hypocotyl]] (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule. Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. [[Monterey Pine|Monterey pine]] (''Pinus radiata'') seedlings have 5–9, and [[Jeffrey Pine|Jeffrey pine]] (''Pinus jeffreyi'') 7–13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean cypress]] always having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for [[big-cone pinyon]] (''Pinus maximartinezii''), with 24 (Farjon &amp; Styles 1997).

The cotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the [[seed]]. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin [[photosynthesis]], or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling.&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"/&gt;

==Epigeal versus hypogeal development==
{{Main|Epigeal germination|Hypogeal germination}}
Cotyledons may be either [[epigeal germination|epigeal]], expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]], not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic. The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[acorn]]s.

Hypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones. They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as [[meristem]] buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed). The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive.&lt;ref name="tischler"&gt;{{citation | title = Response of Seedlings of Two Hypogeal Brush Species to CO2 Enrichment |author1=Charles R.

Related plants show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family.  Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the [[Araucariaceae]] family of Southern Hemisphere conifers,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Phyloghuhenetic relationships within Araucariaceae based on rbcL gene sequences | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/85/11/1507 |author1=Hiroaki Setoguchi |author2=Takeshi Asakawa Osawa |author3=Jean-Christophe Pintaud |author4=Tanguy Jaffré |author5=Jean-Marie Veillon | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 1998 | volume = 85 | pages = 1507–1516 | doi = 10.2307/2446478 | jstor = 2446478 | issue = 11 | pmid = 21680310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fabaceae]] (pea family),&lt;ref name="tischler" /&gt; and the genus ''[[Lilium]]'' (see [[Lily seed germination types]]).  The frequently garden grown [[common bean]] - Phaseolus vulgaris - is epigeal while the closely related [[runner bean]] - Phaseolus coccineus - is hypogeal.

==History==
The term ''cotyledon'' was coined by [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).{{efn|The Oxford English Dictionary attributes it [[Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) "1751 Linnaeus ''Philos. Bot.'' 54. ''Cotyledon, corpus laterale seminis, bibulum, caducum''" {{sfn|Linnaeus|1751|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/philosophiabotan00linn#page/54/mode/2up p.&amp;nbsp;54]}} and 89, {{sfn|Linnaeus|1751|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/philosophiabotan00linn#page/89/mode/1up p.&amp;nbsp;89]}} by analogy with a similar structure of the same name in the [[Cotyledon (placenta)|placenta]].{{sfn|OED|2015}}}} [[John Ray]] was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to [[systematics]], in ''Methodus plantarum'' (1682).&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Sydney Howard Vines|Vines, Sydney Howard]] | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620—1683 and John Ray 1627—1705 | pages = 8–43 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] | title = Makers of British botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.

[[Theophrastus]] (3rd or 4th century BC) and [[Albertus Magnus]] (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioetymology.blogspot.com.br/2011/06/cotyledon-monocotyledon-plural-usually.html|title=BIOETYMOLOGY : ORIGIN IN BIOMEDICAL TERMS: cotyledon, monocotyledon (plural usually monocots), dicotyledons(plural usually dicots)|author=|date=|website=bioetymology.blogspot.com.br|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
''Death by a Thousand Cuts'' investigates the use of [[slow slicing]] or ''lingchi'', a form of torture and capital punishment practised in mid- and late-Imperial China from the tenth century until its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="HarvardBlurb"/&gt; ''Lingchi'' involved repeatedly slicing the [[convict]]'s flesh beyond the point of death.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"&gt;{{cite web

By the time of the final imperial dynasty, the punishment could be meted out for an offence as simple as striking a teacher.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

The authors argue that this was more than a physical punishment, as the victim was [[Sedative|sedated]] with [[opium]] and killed early in the process, but about denying the victim "somatic integrity"&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SomaticIntegrity"&gt;Somatic integrity: the vital capacity to be whole as an organism, which would be denied if the body were cut into pieces.&lt;/ref&gt; and denying them any hope of a [[Afterlife|life after death]] which, the authors argue, caused them to feel [[shame]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

==Reception==
A staff reviewer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' describes the book as a "fascinating study".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

A staff reviewer at ''[[The Times]]'' states that "the authors present a nuanced picture of state-imposed execution and, without at any time condoning, succeed in their goal of contextualising ''lingchi'' in relation to Western forms of punishment" and that "this challenging and important work will appeal not solely to [[Sinology|Sinologists]],&lt;ref name="Sinology"&gt;Sinology: the study of China  and things related to China.&lt;/ref&gt; but to [[Legal history|legal historians]] and students of visual representation."&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

Jonathan Mirsky in ''[[Literary Review]]'' writes that "[the authors] write coolly and formally, but this is a book primarily about torment."&lt;ref name="LiteraryReview"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|Personification of Episteme in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
"'''Episteme'''" is a philosophical term derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:ἐπιστήμη|ἐπιστήμη]] ''epistēmē'', which can refer to [[knowledge]], [[science]] or [[understanding]], and which comes from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐπίστασθαι}}, meaning "to know, to understand, or to be acquainted with".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)pisth/mh|ἐπιστήμη}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/stamai|ἐπίστασθαι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Plato contrasts episteme with "[[doxa]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|do/ca^|δόξα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; common belief or opinion. Episteme is also distinguished from "[[techne]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|te/xnh|τέχνη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a craft or applied practice. The word "[[epistemology]]"  is derived from episteme.

== Western philosophy ==
=== Michel Foucault ===&lt;!-- 'Episteme (Foucault)' redirects here --&gt;
The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term ''épistémè'' in a specialized sense in his work ''[[The Order of Things]]'' to mean the historical, but non-temporal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' which grounds knowledge and its [[discourse]]s and thus represents the [[condition of possibility| condition of their possibility]] within a particular epoch. 

In subsequent writings, he made it clear that several ''épistémè'' may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. But he did not discard the concept:
{{Quote | I would define the episteme retrospectively as the strategic apparatus which permits of separating out from among all the statements which are possible those that will be acceptable within, I won’t say a scientific theory, but a field of scientificity, and which it is possible to say are true or false. The episteme is the ‘apparatus’ which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterised as scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Power/Knowledge | year = 1980 | page = 197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet in Foucault's ''The Order of Things'' he describes ''épistémè'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. (Foucault, 168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation of the Foucaultian épistémè to Kuhn's ''paradigm'' ====
Foucault's use of ''épistémè'' has been asserted as being similar to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of a ''[[paradigm]]'', as for example by [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jean | last = Piaget | title = Structuralism | origyear = 1968 | year = 1970 | page = 132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are decisive differences. 

Whereas Kuhn's ''paradigm'' is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's ''episteme'' is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the ''episteme'' of the epoch). 

Kuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions. Foucault's ''episteme'' is something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the resultant configuration of knowledge of a particular ''episteme'' is, to Foucault, based on a set of primordial, fundamental assumptions that are so basic to the ''episteme'' that they're experientially "invisible" to the constituents (such as people, organizations, or systems) operating within the ''episteme.''

Moreover, Kuhn's concept corresponds to what Foucault calls ''theme'' or theory of a science, but Foucault analyzed how ''opposing'' theories and themes could ''co-exist'' within a science.{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. II.IV}}  Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that ''one'' paradigm always ''is'' pervading, except under paradigmatic transition).  

Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though [[ideology]] may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how [[ideology]] actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of [[ideology]].{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. IV.VI.c}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its "general politics” of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true." &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (1980): ‘Truth and Power’. In C. Gordon (ed.): ''Power/Knowledge. Selected Interviews &amp; Other Writings 1972-1977'' by Michel Foucault, Brighton: Havester, pp. 109-
133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, Paul (editor) ''The Foucault Reader: An introduction to Foucault’s thought''. (1991)  London, Penguin. 400 pages, {{ISBN|0140124861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are possibly influenced by the French philosopher of science [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s notion of an "[[epistemological rupture]]", as indeed was Althusser.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

=== Judith Butler ===
In 1997, [[Judith Butler]] used the concept of episteme in her book ''[[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative (1997)|Excitable Speech]]'', examining the use of [[speech-act|speech-act theory]] for political purposes.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Equity theory''' focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships, 4th Edition|author1=Guerrero, Laura K |author2=Peter A. Andersen |author3=Walid A. Afifi. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Sage Publications Inc|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-1710-9|location = Los Angeles, CA|pages = 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacy Adams, a [[Workplace psychology|workplace]] and [[Behavioral psychology|behavioral psychologist]], who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others (Adams, 1963). The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the [[Justice|fairness]] maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization.

==Background==
Equity theory focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. It proposes that individuals who perceive themselves as either under-rewarded or over-rewarded will experience distress, and that this distress leads to efforts to restore equity within the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]].  It focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners.  Equity is measured by comparing the [[ratio]]s of contributions and benefits of each person within the relationship.  Partners do not have to receive equal benefits (such as receiving the same amount of love, care, and financial security) or make equal contributions (such as investing the same amount of effort, time, and financial resources), as long as the ratio between these benefits and contributions is similar. Much like other prevalent theories of motivation, such as [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs]], equity theory acknowledges that subtle and variable individual factors affect each person’s assessment and perception of their relationship with their relational partners (Guerrero et al., 2005). According to Adams (1965), anger is induced by underpayment inequity and guilt is induced with overpayment equity (Spector 2008). Payment whether hourly wage or salary, is the main concern and therefore the cause of equity or inequity in most cases.

In any position, an employee wants to feel that their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay. If an employee feels underpaid then it will result in the employee feeling hostile towards the organization and perhaps their co-workers, which may result in the employee not performing well at work anymore. It is the subtle variables that also play an important role in the feeling of equity. Just the idea of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes.

===Definition of equity===
Individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any perceived inequities.
Referent Comparisons:

===Inputs and outcomes===

====Inputs====
Inputs are defined as each participant’s contributions to the relational exchange and are viewed as entitling him/her to rewards or costs. The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets – entitling him/her to rewards – or liabilities - entitling him/her to costs. The entitlement to rewards or costs ascribed to each input vary depending on the relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as "relevant inputs" – inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor to rewards. In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor to social rewards. Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs (Walster, Traupmann &amp; Walster, 1978). Inputs typically include any of the following:

* [[Time]]
*education 
*experience
*Effort
* [[Loyalty]]
*Hard Work
*Commitment
*Ability
*Adaptability
* [[Flexibility]]
* [[Toleration|Tolerance]]
*Determination
* [[Enthusiasm]]
*Personal [[sacrifice]]
*Trust in superiors
*Support from co-workers and colleagues
*Skill

====Outcomes====
Outcomes are defined as the positive and negative consequences that an individual perceives a participant has incurred as a consequence of his/her relationship with another.  When the ratio of inputs to outcomes is close, then the employee should have much satisfaction with their job. Outputs can be both tangible and intangible.&lt;ref name="Love and attraction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=ed. by Mark|title=Love and attraction : an internat. conference|year=1979|publisher=Pergamon Pr.|location=Oxford [u. a.]|isbn=008022234X|pages=309–323|url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/49.pdf|edition=1.|author2=Wilson, Glenn|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical outcomes include any of the following:

* [[Job security]]
* [[Salary]]
* [[Employee benefit]]
*Expenses
*Recognition
* [[Reputation]]
* [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
*Sense of achievement
*Praise
*Thanks
*Stimuli

===Propositions===
Equity theory consists of four propositions:

; self-inside: Individuals seek to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes are defined as rewards minus costs).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[ultimatum game]]s show, that the maximation of outcomes is only one of several objectives for an individual. In order to foster rules desired by an individual, the individual may be willing to sacrifice maximum outcomes. (Bala)&lt;/ref&gt;
; self-outside: Groups can maximize collective rewards by developing accepted systems for equitably apportioning rewards and costs among members.  Systems of equity will evolve within groups, and members will attempt to induce other members to accept and adhere to these systems.  The only way groups can induce members to equitably behave is by making it more profitable to behave equitably than inequitably.  Thus, groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish (increase the cost for) members who treat others inequitably.
; others-inside: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed.  The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person who gets "too much" and the person who gets "too little" feel distressed.  The person who gets too much may feel guilt or shame.  The person who gets too little may feel angry or humiliated.
; other-outside: Individuals who perceive that they are in an inequitable relationship attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity.  The greater the inequity, the more distress people feel and the more they try to restore equity. (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978)

==In business==
Equity theory has been widely applied to [[business]] settings by industrial psychologists to describe the relationship between an employee's motivation and his or her perception of equitable or inequitable treatment.  In a business setting, the relevant [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] relationship is that between employee and employer.  As in marriage and other contractual dyadic relationships, equity theory assumes that employees seek to maintain an equitable ratio between the inputs they bring to the relationship and the outcomes they receive from it (Adams, 1965).  Equity theory in business, however, introduces the concept of social comparison, whereby employees evaluate their own input/output ratios based on their comparison with the input/outcome ratios of other employees (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).  Inputs in this context include the employee’s time, expertise, qualifications, experience, intangible personal qualities such as drive and ambition, and interpersonal skills.  Outcomes include monetary compensation, perquisites ("perks"), benefits, and flexible work arrangements.  Employees who perceive inequity will seek to reduce it, either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds ("cognitive distortion"), directly altering inputs and/or outcomes, or leaving the organization (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).  These perceptions of inequity are perceptions of [[organizational justice]], or more specifically, injustice. Subsequently, the theory has wide-reaching implications for employee [[morale]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], [[productivity]], and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].

===Assumptions of equity theory applied to business===
The three primary assumptions applied to most business applications of equity theory can be summarized as follows:

# Employees expect a fair return for what they contribute to their jobs, a concept referred to as the "equity norm".
# Employees determine what their equitable return should be after comparing their inputs and outcomes with those of their coworkers. This concept is referred to as "social comparison".
# Employees who perceive themselves as being in an inequitable situation will seek to reduce the inequity either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds ("cognitive distortion"), by directly altering inputs and/or outputs, or by leaving the organization. (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978)''

===Implications for managers===
Equity theory has several implications for business managers:

*People measure the totals of their inputs and outcomes. This means a working mother may accept lower monetary compensation in return for more flexible working hours.
*Different employees ascribe personal values to inputs and outcomes. Thus, two employees of equal experience and qualification performing the same work for the same pay may have [[Double Demotivation|quite different perceptions of the fairness of the deal]].
*Employees are able to adjust for purchasing power and local market conditions. Thus a teacher from Alberta may accept lower compensation than his colleague in Toronto if his cost of living is different, while a teacher in a remote African village may accept a totally different pay structure.
*Although it may be acceptable for more senior staff to receive higher compensation, there are limits to the balance of the scales of equity and employees can find excessive executive pay demotivating.
*Staff perceptions of inputs and outcomes of themselves and others may be incorrect, and perceptions need to be managed effectively.
*An employee who believes he is overcompensated may increase his effort. However he may also adjust the values that he ascribes to his own personal inputs. It may be that he or she internalizes a sense of superiority and actually decrease his efforts.

==Criticisms and related theories==
Criticism has been directed toward both the assumptions and practical application of equity theory.  Scholars have questioned the simplicity of the model, arguing that a number of demographic and psychological variables affect people's perceptions of fairness and interactions with others.  Furthermore, much of the research supporting the basic propositions of equity theory has been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus has questionable applicability to real-world situations (Huseman, Hatfield &amp; Miles, 1987).  Critics have also argued that people might perceive equity/inequity not only in terms of the specific inputs and outcomes of a relationship, but also in terms of the overarching system that determines those inputs and outputs.  Thus, in a business setting, one might feel that his or her compensation is equitable to other employees', but one might view the entire compensation ''system'' as unfair (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). 
 
Researchers have offered numerous magnifying and competing perspectives:

===Equity sensitivity construct===
The Equity Sensitivity Construct proposes that individuals have different preferences for equity and thus react in different ways to perceived equity and inequity.  Preferences can be expressed on a continuum from preferences for extreme under-benefit to preferences for extreme over-benefit.  Three archetypal classes are as follows:

*Benevolents, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be less than those of their relational partner.  In other words, the benevolent prefers to be under-benefitted.
*Equity Sensitives, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be equal to those of their relational partner.
*Entitleds, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to exceed those of their relational partner.  In other words, the entitled prefers to be over-benefitted. (Huseman, Hatfield &amp; Miles, 1987)

===Fairness model===
The Fairness Model proposes an alternative measure of equity/inequity to the relational partner or "comparison person" of standard equity theory.  According to the Fairness Model, an individual judges the overall "fairness" of a relationship by comparing their inputs and outcomes with an internally derived standard.  The Fairness Model thus allows for the perceived equity/inequity of the overarching system to be incorporated into individuals' evaluations of their relationships (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978).

===Game theory===
Behavioral economics has recently started to apply [[game theory]] to the study of equity theory. For instance, Gill and Stone (2010) analyze how considerations of equity influence behavior in strategic settings in which people compete and develop the implications for optimal labor contracts.

The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical''' has been awarded since 1959. The award had several minor name changes:
* In 1959 the award was known as '''Best Engineered Record – Non-Classical'''
* In 1960 it was awarded as '''Best Engineering Contribution – Other Than Classical or Novelty'''
* From 1961 to 1962 it was awarded as '''Best Engineering Contribution – Popular Recording'''
* In 1963 it was awarded as '''Best Engineering Contribution – Other Than Novelty and Other Than Classical'''
* In 1964 it was awarded as '''Best Engineered Recording – Other Than Classical '''
* From 1965 to 1991 it returned to the title '''Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical'''
* Since 1992 it has been awarded as '''Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical'''

This award is presented alongside the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical]]. From 1960 to 1965 a further award was presented for [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording – Special or Novel Effects|Best Engineered Recording – Special or Novel Effects]].

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year. The award is presented to the [[audio engineer]](s) on the winning work, not to the artist or performer, except if the artist is also a credited engineer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">'''Hybrid-core''' computing is the technique of extending a commodity [[instruction set architecture]] (e.g. [[x86]]) with application-specific instructions to accelerate application performance. It is a form of [[heterogeneous computing]]&lt;ref&gt;Heterogeneous Processing: a Strategy for Augmenting Moore's Law". Linux Journal 1/2/2006. http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8368&lt;/ref&gt; wherein asymmetric computational units coexist with a "commodity" processor.

Hybrid-core processing differs from general heterogeneous computing in that the computational units share a common logical address space, and an executable is composed of a single instruction stream—in essence a contemporary [[coprocessor]]. The instruction set of a hybrid-core computing system contains instructions that can be dispatched either to the host instruction set or to the application-specific hardware.

Typically, hybrid-core computing is best deployed where the predominance of computational cycles are spent in a few identifiable kernels, as is often seen in [[high-performance computing]] applications. Acceleration is especially pronounced when the kernel’s logic maps poorly to a sequence of commodity processor instructions, and/or maps well to the application-specific hardware.

Hybrid-core computing is used to accelerate applications beyond what is currently physically possible with off-the-shelf processors, or to lower power &amp; cooling costs in a data center by reducing computational footprint. (i.e., to circumvent obstacles such as the power/density challenges faced with today's commodity processors).&lt;ref&gt;"New Microarchitecture Challenges in the Coming Generations of CMOS Process Technologies," Fred Pollack, Director of Microprocessor Research Labs http://research.ac.upc.edu/HPCseminar/SEM9900/Pollack1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''IZA - Institute of Labor Economics''' ({{lang-de|Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit}}), until 2016 referred to as the Institute of the Study of Labor (IZA), is a private, independent economic research institute and academic network focused on the analysis of global labor markets and headquartered in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IZA - Institute for the Study of Labor|url=http://www.socialcapitalgateway.org/content/website/iza-institute-study-labor|publisher=socialcapitalgateway.org|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1998, IZA is a non-profit limited-liability organization supported by the Deutsche Post Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deutsche-post-stiftung.org/ |title=History |work=Deutsche Post Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other national and international sources.&lt;ref name=Goethe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/for/en1196638.htm |title=German Think Tanks - Research and Science in Germany - Research Centres from A to Z |publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Restructuring ===

On March 1, 2016, the Institute for the Study of Labor was restructured by [[Klaus Zumwinkel]], CEO of the Deutsche Post Stiftung and President of IZA. A new institute on behavior and inequality research was founded while IZA will put more emphasis on policy-relevant research. Founding Director [[Klaus Zimmermann (economist)|Klaus F. Zimmermann]], who did not accept these developments, left IZA on the 1st of March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iza.org/files/IZAPress20151215_EN.pdf |title= Strategic Restructuring of the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) |publisher=Institute for the Study of Labor|date= 15 December 2015|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:IZA Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|IZA headquarters in 2008.]]
IZA runs the world's largest research network in economic science, comprising over 1,300 international Research Fellows and Affiliates, as well as Policy Fellows from business, politics, society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/01/26/germ-j26.html|title=German corporations call for new forms of workplace extension |author=Dietmar Henning |date= 26 January 2015| publisher=[[World Socialist Website]]|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|December 2014}}, the [[RePEc]] ranks IZA second of the top worldwide economic institutions in the field of labour economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.lab.html |title=Field Rankings at IDEAS: Labour Economics |work=repec.org|publisher=[[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS]]|date=December 2014|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as second of the top worldwide think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ttanks.html |title=Rankings at IDEAS: Think Tanks |work=repec.org|publisher=[[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS]]|date=December 2014|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany it is the number one top economic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.germany.html |title=Within Country and State Rankings at IDEAS: Germany |work=repec.org|publisher=[[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS]]|date=December 2014|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conducting labor market research, IZA cooperates closely with the Economics Department at the [[University of Bonn]] and the department's graduate education program at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/people/faculty-profiles/professors/klaus-f.-zimmermann |title=Klaus F. Zimmermann |work=uni-bonn.de|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IZA's main focus is the economic analysis of national and international labor markets within a broad range of research areas. Furthermore IZA provides policy advice on crucial [[labor market]] issues for national and international policy institutions.&lt;ref name=Goethe/&gt;

=== Research ===
IZA's research activities currently concentrate on eleven program areas providing high-standard labor market research on a wide array of topics:
{{columns-list |colwidth=30em |
* Evaluation of Labor Market Programs

'''Idea networking''' is a qualitative method of doing a [[cluster analysis]] of any collection of statements, developed by Mike Metcalfe at the [[University of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=2014 |chapter=Idea networking |title=How concepts solve management problems |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |pages=62–74 |isbn=9781783471072 |oclc=868380268 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories. The statements might be source from interviews, text, web sites, [[focus group]]s, [[SWOT analysis]] or community consultation. Idea networking is [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements. Rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked (paired). These links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters. When named, these clusters provide emergent categories, meta themes, frames or concepts which represent, structure or sense-make the collection of statements.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

==Method==
An idea network can be constructed in the following way:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;
* 60 to 200 statements are listed and assigned reference numbers. 
* A table is constructed showing which statements (by reference number) are linked (paired) and why. For example, statement 1 maybe linked to statements 4, 23, 45, 67, 89 and 107 because they all are about the weather (see table). 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Statement !! Is Linked To !! Because They Are About
|-
| 1 || 4, 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Weather
|-
| 2 || 16, 29, 46, 81 || Light
|-
| 3 || 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Interaction
|-
| 4 || 13, 16, 34, 78, 81 || Weather
|-
| Etc. || Etc. || Etc.

The number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7; many more will result in a congested network diagram. This means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak, or by sub sets. For example, statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather, wet weather or bad weather, etc.). This linking is sometimes called 'coding' in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons (source, context, time, etc.). There maybe many tens of reasons why statements are linked. The same statements may be linked for different reasons. The number of reasons should not be restricted to low number as so anticipate the resultant clustering. 
*The reference numbers are inputed to a network diagramming software, usually in the form of a matrix with the reference numbers along the top and side of the matrix. Each cell will then have a 1 or 0 to indicate whether its row and column reference number are linked. 
*The software is instructed to draw network diagram using maximum node repulsion. This encourages cluster formation.  Around 5 clusters are identified in the network diagram, both visually and using the cluster identification algorithms supplied with the software (e.g. Newnan Girvan sub-groups) 
[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Network]]
*A descriptive collective adjective name is determined for each cluster of statements (a meta narrative, classification name or label). 
*The list of statements is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your analysis of the statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, safety, light and inspiration in their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=Problem conceptualisation using idea networks |journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=141–150 |doi=10.1007/s11213-006-9056-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying philosophy ==
In his book ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'', the pragmatist [[Christopher Alexander]] suggested networking the ideas of clients as means to identifying the major facets of an architectural design.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; This is still used modern design work usually using [[cluster analysis]]. Modern [[social network analysis software]] provides a useful tool for how these ideas can be networked. 
This simply adds ideas to the list of computers, power stations, people and events that can be networked (see [[Network theory]]).&lt;ref name="socialcapitalnetknowtransfer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inkpen |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Tsang |first2=Eric W. K. |date=January 2005 |title=Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer |journal=[[Academy of Management Review]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=146–165 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.15281445 |jstor=20159100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between ideas can be represented in a matrix or network. Modern network diagramming software, with node repulsion algorithms, allows useful visual representation of these networks revealing clusters of nodes.

When networking peoples' statements or ideas, these become the nodes and the links are provided by an analyst linking those statements thought to be similar. Keywords, synonyms, experience or context might be used to provide this linking. For example, the statements: (1) "That war is economics progressed by other means, might be considered linked to the statement"; (2) "That progress unfortunately needs the innovation which is a consequence of human conflict". 
 
Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues we use our conceptions to interpret our perceptions (sensory inputs).&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|18}} These conceptions might be represented by words as conceptual ideas or concepts. For example, if we use the conceptual idea or concepts of justice to interpret the actions of people, we get a different interpretation (or meaning) compared to using the conceptual idea of personal power. Using the conceptual idea of justice makes certain action ideas seem reasonable. These may include due process, legal representation, hearing both sides, have norms or regulations for comparison. Therefore, there is a relationship between conceptual ideas and related apparently rational action ideas.

If the statements gathered at a consultative meeting are considered action ideas, then clusters of these similar actions ideas might be considered to examples of a meta idea or conceptual idea. These are also called themes, and frames. Modern research extending Miller's Magic number 7 plus or minus 2, to idea handling, suggests a five-part classification is appropriate for humans.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

==Notable applications and uses==

Using networking to cluster statements is considered useful because:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

*It provides a multi-dimensional alternative to [[post-it note]]s in clusters.
*It offers a convenient graphic which can be presented in reports and analysed using network metrics (See [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software]]). 
*It is an auditable process where each step taken can be explained in supporting documentation.
*It is a qualitative alternative, and thus more subtle and transparent, than [[NVivo]], [[thematic analysis]], [[cluster analysis]], [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] or [[principal component analysis]]. This subtleness includes enabling the analyst to deal with metaphor, synonyms, pronouns and alternative terminology generally. No variables (variation in numerical data) are necessary.

'''Ischiopagi''' comes from the Greek word ''ischio-'' meaning hip (ilium) and ''-pagus'' meaning fixed or united. It is the [[medical]] term used for [[conjoined twins]] (Class V) who are united at the [[pelvis]]. The twins are classically joined with the vertebral [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]] at 180°. However, the most frequent cases usually structures the ischiopagus twins with two separate spines forming a lateral angle smaller than 90°.  The conjoined twins usually have four arms; two, three or four legs; and typically one external genitalia and anus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=1494 Duplicata incompleta, dicephalus dipus dibrachius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819191053/http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=1494 |date=2009-08-19 }}, 2008-06-20&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mostly confused with [[pygopagus]] where the twins are joined ventrally at the buttocks facing away from each other, whereas ischiopagus twins are joined dorsally at the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]]. Parapagus is also similar to ischiopagus; however, parapagus twins are joined side-by-side whereas ischiopagus twins typically have spines connected at a 180° angle, facing away from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phreeque.tripod.com/conjoined_twins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223060241/http://phreeque.tripod.com/conjoined_twins.html |archivedate=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conjoined Twins: Developmental Malformations and Clinical Implications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spencer|first=Rowena|title=Conjoined Twins: Developmental Malformations and Clinical Implications|year=2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801870705|pages=184–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
'''Ischiopagus Dipus''': This is the rarest variety with the twins sharing two legs with no lower extremities on one side.

'''Ischiopagus Tripus''': This is the most common variety. These twins share three legs, the third leg is often two fused legs, or is non-functioning. The twins also usually share only one set of external [[genitalia]].

'''Ischiopagus Tetrapus/Quadripus''': This variety has the twins at a symmetrical continuous longitudinal axis with their area of union not broken [[anteriorly]]. The axes extends in a straight line but in opposite directions. The lower extremities are oriented at right angles to the axes of the [[thorax]] and the adjacent limbs near the union of the [[ischium]] belong to the opposite twin.&lt;ref name="Successful Separation of Ischiopagus Tetrapus Twins" /&gt;

==Embryology==
During embryonic development, twins can form from the splitting of a single embryo ([[monozygotic]]) which forms [[identical twins]] or the twins can arise from separate [[oocytes]] in the same [[menstrual cycle]] ([[dizygotic]]) which forms [[fraternal twins]]. Although the latter is more frequent, monozygotic is the reason conjoined twins can develop. In [[monozygotic twinning]] for conjoined twins such as ischiopagi, the twins form by the splitting of a bi-laminar embryonic disc after the formation of the inner cell masses. Thus, making the twins occupy the same [[amnion]] which can lead to a conjoining of the twins as a result of the twins not separating properly during the twinning process. Separation occurring between the seventh and thirteenth days should result in a [[monochorionic]], [[monoamniotic]] identical twins sharing a [[yolk sac]]. If separation of the twins occur in the later stages of development prior to the appearance of the [[primitive streak]] and axial orientation, then it can be predicted that [[conjoined twins]] will develop. The origin of exactly what goes wrong to produce ischiopagus or any conjoined twin is a result by either incomplete [[Fission (biology)|fission]] or double overlapping inducing centers on the same germ disc. Various studies suggest that mechanical disturbances such as shaking of the [[blastomeres]], exposure of the embryo to cold or insufficient oxygen during the early process of [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], [[grafting]] [[Organizers, embryonic|organizer]] onto [[gastrula]] or half a [[gastrula]] together, or constricting the [[blastula]] or early [[gastrula]] can cause the incomplete separation of [[monozygotic twins]]. However, studies have shown that these disturbances must happen at critical times in the pregnancy for the conjoined twins to develop.&lt;ref name="Successful Separation of Ischiopagus Tetrapus Twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eades|first=Joseph|author2=Colin Thomas|title=Successful Separation of Ischiopagus Tetrapus Conjoined Twins|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=17 March 1966|volume=164|issue=6|pages=1059–1072|pmc=1477223|pmid=5926243|doi=10.1097/00000658-196612000-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conjoined Twins: Theoretical Embryologic Basis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Rowena|title=Conjoined Twins: Theoretical Embryologic Basis|journal=Teratology|date=3 January 1992|issue=6|pages=591–602|pmid=1412053|doi=10.1002/tera.1420450604|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen's Human Embryology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenwolf|first=Gary|title=Larsen's Human Embryology|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443068119|pages=179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==

Conjoined twins are at high risk to being [[stillborn]] or dying shortly after birth. In some cases, a healthy twin and a [[parasitic twin]] are born. The parasitic twin has no hope for survival and dies and is then surgically separated from its twin. Depending upon how the twins are attached and what is shared among them, complications can arise from surgically separating the live twin from the dead twin. In Ischiopagus cases, the children share a pelvic region along with the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[genital]] region. Most Ischiopagus twins will need reconstruction surgery of the genitals and the gastrointestinal tract so that the twin will be able to perform normal bodily functions.

For the Ischiopagus twins that both survive from birth, complications and risks also arise. Usually if both twins survive labor, one twin will be healthy and strong, while the other is malnourished and weak. Thus, surgery would have to be planned in advance to understand the best option and how to keep both children alive during surgery as well as afterwards.&lt;ref name="Conjoined Twins: Developmental Malformations and Clinical Implications"/&gt;

==Treatment==

Separation is the only treatment for Ischiopagus. The rarity of the condition as well as the challenge it presents in separating the twins has been difficult to understand. In recent years, with advancing medical technology, physicians have been able to successfully separate Ischiopagus twins. However, it depends on the organs shared, how closely joined the twins are, and what risks could rise from separating the twins during surgery. Since Ischiopagus twins usually share a [[gastrointestinal tract]] and other organs in the pelvic region, it takes months of planning to decide whether or not separation of the twins outweighs the complications and risks associated with surgery and reconstruction of organs. Surgery to separate conjoined twins has allowed surgeons to be able to study the mechanisms of [[embryogenesis]] as well as the physiological consequences of [[parabiosis]].&lt;ref name="Successful Separation of Ischiopagus Tetrapus Twins"/&gt;

==Prognosis==

Depending upon what organs are shared among the twins and if they are surgically separable, usually only one of the twins makes it through the surgery or they both die due to complications either before or during the surgery. Now that successful surgery has been reported and more findings are becoming available due to research and pre-surgery evaluation, better surgery techniques and procedures will be available in the future to help increase the survival rate of ischiopagus twins as well as other conjoined twins.

==Epidemiology==

Ischiopagus is a rare [[Congenital anomaly|anomaly]] occurring in about 1 in every 100,000 live births and occurring in 1 out of 10 conjoined twin births. Most Ischiopagus cases are common in the areas of India and Africa. Of the varieties of Ischiopagus twins, Ischiopagus Tetrapus is more prevalent, happening in 68.75% of all Ischiopagus cases. Ischiopagus Tripus occurs in 31.25% of cases while Ischiopagus Dipus occurs in only 6.25% of all Ischiopagus cases.&lt;ref name="Ischiopagus Tripus Conjoined Twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Yousuf|title=Ischiopagus Tripus Conjoined Twins|journal=APSP Journal of Case Reports|date=10 March 2011|volume=2|issue=1|page=5|pmc=3418005|pmid=22953272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Business School HU.jpg|thumb|The Jerusalem School of Business Administration Logo]]
'''The Jerusalem School of Business Administration''', founded by Daniel and [[Raphael Recanati]] is an autonomy school, which is a part of The Hebrew University and based in Mt. Scopus.

== History ==
The Jerusalem School of Business Administration was founded in 1952, as a department in the Social Science Faculty. The School was the first academic institute in Israel to provide academic and professional training for managers.
 
During the first years, the school offered graduate-level courses of Business Administration. Over time, the fields of expertise broaden which allowed for the expansion of faculty members.

Today, the school consists of 29 faculty members who represent the diverse fields of research: finance and banking, organizational behavior, human resource management, marketing, internet research, strategy and managerial entrepreneurship and operational research.

The school was established as an autonomic entity due to the consistent work of Avraham Meshulach. In the history of Israel Academics, the Jerusalem School of Business Administration was the first to appoint a woman as a Professor in Finance, Professor [[Orly Sade]].

== Research and Teaching == 

The School aims to educate Israel's next generation of business leaders. As part of this cause, the school offers a variety of academic programs: B.A. in Business Administration, B.A. in Accounting, complementary year for Accounting students, special programs for excellent students, MBA, Executive MBA and Ph.D.

The School of Business Administration maintains numerous mutual relationships with leading academic and business institutions all over the world. The study programs offer student-exchange frameworks, international conferences in Israel and abroad and direct exposure to the modern business environment.

At the Jerusalem School of Business Administration, study more than 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, 50 Executive MBA Program attendees and 30 Ph.D. students.

== Ranking ==
The School has won broad international recognition and is the top Israeli institution in international rankings of academic business schools. The school was ranked No. 44 in the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities by Subject Fields, coming ahead of all the leading European universities other than those in England.

According to Shanghai Academic Ranking for the year of 2015, the Hebrew University was ranked number 67 in the world and according to the TIMES Magazine was ranked number 186 in the world and first in Israel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39899">'''[[Netflix]]''' is an American global provider of streaming films and television series. Since its launch in 1998, it has been at the centre of numerous legal issues and controversies.

== Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize" ==
{{Main|Netflix Prize}}
In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize,&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation /&gt; "We thought we built the best darn thing ever."&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/31leonhardt.html|title=You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize|date=January 31, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by June 2007, Hastings said the competition is "three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/technology/04netflix.html|title=Netflix Prize Still Awaits a Movie Seer|date=June 4, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three teams – an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory – combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used [[machine learning]] techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&amp;T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throttling of DVDs by mail ==
Netflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as "[[DVD-by-mail#"Throttling"|throttling]]" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215072830/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2006 |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |title='Throttling' angers Netflix heavy renters |agency=Associated Press (Internet Archive) |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix claims that "the large majority of our subscribers are able to receive their movies in about one business day following our shipment of the requested movie from their local distribution center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#how|title=Terms of Use|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all shipments come from the subscriber's local distribution center, and shipments from distant centers are often delayed, as well.

In September 2004, a consumer [[class action lawsuit]], ''Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 Class action suit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205730/http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against Netflix in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The suit alleged [[false advertising]] in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its [[terms of use]] to acknowledge "throttling" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with [[negative option billing|customers being charged accordingly]] unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Netflix|title=Netflix Claim Form Process|url=http://www.netflix.com/Settlement?mqso=60178549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535 California Appellate Courts] Chavez v.

Netflix, Inc. |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Kralowec |first=Kimberly A. |date=April 28, 2008 |work=The UCL Practitioner }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130003/solutions_for_digital_annoyances.html |title=Solutions for Digital Annoyance |author=Spring, Tom |date=March 27, 2007 |work=PC World |accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Releasing this week ===
The Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, "Releasing This Week" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week.&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netflix.com/AllNewReleases?lnkctr=NavAllNewReleases| title=All DVDs Releasing This Week| publisher=Netflix| accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called "Popular New Releases", does not list newly released DVDs for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2007/12/netflix-removes.html| title=Netflix Removes New Releases Page – Customers Complain |publisher=Hacking Netflix |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of new releases is still active,&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week" /&gt; although there is no menu option that links to the page.

On January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Happy New Year |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/01/happy-new-year.html |publisher=Netflix Community Blog |accessdate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods ==
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit in which it demanded a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], alleging that Blockbuster's [[online DVD rental]] subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first [[cause of action]] alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B.

The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2007/06/25/daily54.html Blockbuster to close 282 stores this year – San Francisco Business Times]. Bizjournals.com (June 29, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |title=Blockbuster, Weinsteins sign exclusive deal |work= Video Business |publisher= Reed Business Information |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103065726/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |archivedate= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |title=How The Weinstein Company ruined Home Entertainment |author=Sciretta, Peter |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161945/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Annual Report |url=http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-07-42689 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|6}}, Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including ''[[Unknown (2006 film)|Unknown]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School For Scoundrels]]'' and ''[[Harsh Times]]'', among others. The [[first-sale doctrine]] allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.

=== Removal of social networking feature ===
Beginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of [[social networking]]. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign |title= 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash |first= Cliff |last= Kuang |date= March 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 |title= Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity |first= Tim |last= Conneally |date= March 18, 2010 |publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html |title= New Movie Details Page Rolled Out |date= March 4, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of [[Product Management]], Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.&lt;ref name="fastcompany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html |title= Friends Update |date= March 17, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html |title= Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal |date= March 14, 2010 |publisher=Hacking Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux support ==
Netflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully [[open-source software|open source]] versions of [[Linux]] and similar operating systems.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Google's partially proprietary Android and [[Chrome OS]] platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], although this changed in October 2014.

On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&amp;hc=hp&amp;hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/html5-video-in-ie-11-on-windows-81.html|title=The Netflix Tech Blog: HTML5 Video in IE 11 on Windows 8.1|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com" /&gt; It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.

As of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/ |title=Watch Netflix in Ubuntu today |publisher=Ubuntu |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pclinuxos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/netflix-streaming-comes-to-chrome-for-pclinuxos/|title=Netflix streaming comes to PCLinuxOS » PCLinuxOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of [[Linux Mint]] have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2824623/ubuntu-linux-gets-netflix-without-weird-workarounds.html|title=Netflix comes to Linux via Ubuntu and Chrome|author=Jared Newman|date=October 10, 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party solutions ===
{{As of|2011|5|9|df=US}}, Google had initially released plans for a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechromesource.com/netflix-plug-in-for-chrome-and-chrome-os-is-on-the-way/|title= Netflix Plug-in for Chrome and Chrome OS is on the way |author=West, Jullian|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2012, patches to the Wine compatibility layer to make viewing of Netflix on Linux and similar systems were made available.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuannounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |title=Netflix on Ubuntu Is Here |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308111726/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2012, a [[Personal Package Archive|PPA]] and installation files were made publicly available making the installation and use of Netflix much easier for users of Ubuntu 12.04 and possibly other distributions.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuppa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |title=PPA for Netflix Desktop App |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308112323/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix, 600 Fed. Appx. 508 (Ct. App. Ninth Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the [[game console]]s, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.&lt;ref name=amara1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[GigaOM]]|last=Roettgers|first=Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are [[derivative work]]s which [[copyright infringement|infringe copyright]] if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.&lt;ref name=amara2&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara operates under [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement [[lawsuit]]s over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.&lt;ref name=amara1 /&gt;

In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' to customers in [[Finland]] with unauthorized subtitles from the [[fansub]] scene.&lt;ref name=tfOct19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in [[cease and desist]] notices, [[notice and take down|takedowns]], and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=tfOct19 /&gt;

On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in ''The Week'', titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Week|title=How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions| date=January 20, 2014| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255618/how-netflix-alienated-and-insulted-its-deaf-subscribers |author=Christian, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with [[described video|audio descriptions]] of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it "terribly laughable PR" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|character]] who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.&lt;ref name=wp-blindsuperhero&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes a blind superhero accessible to blind audiences|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/04/14/netflix-makes-a-blind-superhero-accessible-to-blind-viewers/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-descriptions&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Adding Audio Description Tracks for Visually Impaired, Starting with 'Marvel's Daredevil'|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-adding-audio-description-tracks-for-visually-impaired-starting-with-marvels-daredevil-1201472372/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumvention of geoblocking ==
More than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a [[proxy server]] or [[virtual private network]] (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix [[Geo-blocking|cannot offer in their region]], due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor.&lt;ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock&gt;{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode /&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-riftcourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/09/why-netflix-wont-block-vpn-users |title=Why Netflix won't block VPN users – it has too many of them, Part II |last=Hern |first=Alex |publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn /&gt; As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/13/netflix-canada-vs-us_n_4435459.html|title=Netflix Canada vs. Netflix USA: Why Do We Get The Shaft?|first=Michael|last=Bolen|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked e-mail revealed by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] in 2014, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.&lt;ref name=verge-netflixproxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
=== Price increase lawsuit ===
A lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have "grandfathered" subscription plans with price guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=I can tell you my client is upset because Netflix has acknowledged he had a guaranteed or grandfathered account but nevertheless insisted on raising his price|sign=Tom Shapiro who is representing Keritsis|source=Variety}}

=== Lawsuit over Fox contracts ===
[[20th Century Fox]] filed a lawsuit in 2016, after Marco Waltenberg and Tara Flynn left the company for Netflix. Its claim argued that Netflix was enticing executives to break their employment contracts with Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/netflix-fox-lawsuit-poaching-employees-1201821170/|title=Netflix hit by Fox with lawsuit over poaching executives|first=Dominic|last=Pattern|publisher=Deadline|date=2016-09-16|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firing of Jonathan Friedland ===
On June 2018, Netflix [[Chief Communications Officer|CCO]] Jonathan Friedland was fired for saying the word [[nigger]] during a company meeting about offensive words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17495364/netflix-pr-chief-jonathan-friedland-fired-n-word-racial-slur|title=Netflix PR chief fired for repeatedly using the n-word|first=Nick|last=Statt|publisher=The Verge|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memo released by Reed Hastings, which stated that he should have used a [[euphemism]], mentioned that Friedland said the word again during a follow-up meeting with [[human resources]]. Hastings described the second utterance as "confirm[ing] a deep lack of understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jonathan-friedland-exits-netflix-1122675|title=Netflix fires PR chief over use of N-word in meeting|first1=Bryn Elise|last1=Sandberg|first2=Lesley|last2=Goldberg|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, an advertising campaign for Netflix launched, which emphasized its black talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russespinoza/2018/06/25/netflix-runs-strong-black-lead-spot-days-after-n-word-crisis/#6728451d7efa|title=Netflix runs 'Strong Black Lead' spot days after N-word crisis|first=Russ|last=Espinoza|publisher=Forbes|date=2018-06-25|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''multiple histories''' is closely related to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. In the same way that the many-worlds interpretation regards possible futures as having a real existence of their own, the theory of multiple histories reverses this in time to regard the many possible past histories of a given event as having real existence. 

This concept was introduced by [[Richard Feynman]], whose [[Feynman path integral]] is [[integral|integrated]] over the set of all possible histories.

The idea of multiple histories has also been applied to [[cosmology]], in a theoretical interpretation in which the [[universe]] has multiple possible cosmologies, and in which reasoning ''backwards'' from the current state of the universe to a quantum superposition of possible cosmic histories makes sense.

A history of Native American rhetorics.

==Timeline==
'''1823 - [[Johnson v. McIntosh]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:Precedent-setting case between two white parties about property rights to land in America--no Native speaks, though Native interests are affected by the ruling.
'''1830s - [[William Apess|William Appess]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who delivers “An Indian’s Looking-Glass for the White Man” and Eulogy on King Philip&lt;br/&gt; in which he states, “And while you ask yourself, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’ you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say, ‘They want what I want.’”
'''1827 and 1839 - Cherokee constitutions'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1879 - [[Thomas Tibbles]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who arranges an East coast lecture tour for the Ponca leader, Standing Bear.
'''1879 - [[Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who lectures to criticize Agency mistreatment of Paiutes.
'''1881 - Constitution of the [[Osage Nation]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:The Osage constitutional democratic government is not recognized after 1898 by the U.S.; the cause is taken up again (with mixed results) throughout the twentieth century until it is finally ended in 1997. See Warrior, The People and the Word.
'''1881 – [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], A Century of Dishonor'''&lt;br/&gt;
:“The first pro-Indian book to make a significant impact on the American reading public” ( Frederick W. Turner, “The Century after ‘A Century of Dishonor:’”)
:An appeal to the heart and conscience of the American people for repairing broken treaties, theft, and institutional termination.
'''1928 – [[Meriam Report]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Institute for Government Research report that denounces the Dawes Act, and criticizes the BIA.
'''1946 - [[Indian Claims Commission]] created'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1953 – [[Thomas Banyacya]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who writes a letter on behalf of the Hopi to President Dwight D. Eisenhower to request recognition for their claims for being conscientious objectors. Mr. Banyacya helped win an understanding with local Selective Service officials that any Hopi who requested classification as a conscientious objector would receive it.
'''1955 - [[Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1961 - The American Indian Chicago Conference''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Ninety separate communities meet at the U Chicago to critique US termination policies, and draft the Declaration of Indian Purpose.
'''1966-1995 - Blackbird Bend litigation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:In a long and bitter series of legal battles, the Omaha nation seek to regain land along the edge of their reservation. They regain a small amount. See Scherer, Imperfect Victories.
'''1969 - Alcatraz Occupation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Mobilized by ethnic studies programs at San Francisco State and UC Berkeley, Bay Area Indians allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) occupy Alcatraz island, invoking the Fort Laramie treaty of 1868 for surplus federal land to claim it for a cultural center.
'''1970 - [[N. Scott Momaday]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who gives “Man Made of Words” keynote at the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars. See Warrior, The People and the Word.
'''1973 - [[Maria Campbell]]''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:who publishes Halfbreed, the first book by a Native Canadian women since the death of Pauline Johnson in 1913.
'''1977 - Charles Aubid''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who testifies before US District Court Judge Miles Lord. Aubid appeals to use the memory of the deceased Old John Squirrel in a case about Anishinaabeg control of the annual wild rice harvest. (Vizenor, “Aesthetics of Survivance,” Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence).
'''1980 - [[Russell Means]] “Fighting Words on the Future of the Earth,” ''Mother Jones''''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:Means critiques Marxism and calls for Lakota tradition. Importantly, he does so through the writing of someone who has recorded his speech.
'''1994 - [[Gerald Vizenor]] ''Manifest Manners'''''&lt;br/&gt;
:Vizenor formulates the concept of cultural [[survivance]]--survival and resistance--to describe Native signification.

'''1997 - [[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:The Supreme Court of Canada gave greater weight to oral history as a form of legal evidence.
'''1997 - Robin Ridington and Dennis Hastings, ''Blessing for a Long Time'''''&lt;br/&gt;
:Ridington and Hastings write an ethnography of Umon’hon’ti, which involves them in the story of the subject they document. They work with the Omaha to return their sacred pole from the Harvard Peabody Museum.
'''1998 - “Statement of Reconciliation”''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:which Canada makes to its Native peoples, collected within Gathering Strength, Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan.

:{{jstor|25595817}}
'''2007 - [[Ward Churchill]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who is fired from Colorado University for allegations of plagiarism after publishing “"Some People Push Back": On the Justice of Roosting Chickens” (2001){{dubious|date=January 2013}}
'''2008 - Malea Powell, “Dreaming Charles Eastman: Cultural Memory, Autobiography, and Geography in Indigenous Rhetorical Histories”''' &lt;br/&gt;
:A short mixed-genre (narrative, theory, poetry) essay in which Powell grapples with being “an Indian talking about what it means to be an Indian engaged in the archive, what it means to be the object looking back, the objectified engaged in the process of making knowledge about the processes that led to my objectification” (117).

The '''Pasture beech''' ({{lang-de|Weidbuche}}) is a particular species or growth habit of the [[fagus sylvatica|beech]] which developed in the [[Black Forest]], because the young trees growing on [[pasture]]s or in [[wood pasture|pastoral forests]] were nibbled by the grazing animals, above all cows and goats, i.e. their leaves and branches were eaten and, as a consequence, they have no main trunk and grow bushy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/36652 Weidbuchen im Schwarzwald und ihre Entstehung durch Verbiß des Wälderviehs] (Pasture beeches in the Black Forest and their formation due to nibbling animals grazing in the pastoral forests), {{ISBN|3-88251-121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southern Black Forest]] 1600 places were found where pasture beeches are growing.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Black Forest Nature Park: [http://www.naturpark-suedschwarzwald.de/mensch/kulturlandschaft/weidbuchen Weidbuchen]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phum Snay''' ({{lang-km| ភូមិ ស្នាយ}}) is an [[Iron Age]] archaeological site discovered in May 2000 in Preah Neat Prey District, [[Banteay Meanchey Province]], Northwest [[Cambodia]], around {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the temple ruins of [[Angkor]]. The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O’Reilly of the [[Australian National University]], Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/phum-snay-ruined-other-sites-danger | title = Phum Snay ruined, other sites in danger | publisher =  The Phnom Penh Post | date=April 25, 2003 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/460955/Excavations_at_Phum_Snay_Cambodia | title = A Preliminary Report on the Excavation of a Late Prehistoric Cemetery in NorthwestCambodia | publisher =  Academia | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/17251/1/AP-v45n2-189-211.pdf | title = Archaeology and Archaeozoology of Phum Snay: A late Prehistoric cemetery in Northwestern Cambodia | publisher = ScholarSpace | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/talk22.htm | title = Prehistoric Culture of Cambodia and Its Relationship towards South China - all the findings can be placed in frame of VII century BC - V century AD, though I think, that the majority of the finds belong to the beginning of AD era | publisher = The Chinese University of Hong Kong | date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were not obtained from [[stratigraphy]] as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham, M., &amp; Tayles, N. (Eds.). (2006). Bioarchaeology of Southeast Asia (Vol. 43). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.

== Human remains ==
A general analysis was done of the 134 individuals identified through the [[Minimum number of individuals|minimum number of individuals method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/269337416_fig7_Figure-7-Archaeological-evidence-of-warfare-and-weaponry-at-Phum-Snay-a-adult-male | title = Figure 7. Archaeological evidence of warfare and weaponry at Phum Snay - The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was 134: 124 adults and 10 sub-adults | publisher = research gate | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by [[blunt force trauma]] (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.

== Results ==

===Traumatic lesions===

Out of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="domett"&gt;Domett, K. M., O'Reilly, D. J. W., &amp; Buckley, H. R. (2011). Bioarchaeological evidence for conflict in Iron Age north-west Cambodia. Antiquity, 85(328).&lt;/ref&gt;  Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium.  Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen.  These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Burials===

Within the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found.  These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles.&lt;ref name="lapteff"&gt;Lapteff, S. V. (2013). Early Iron Age Burial Practices of the Ancient Khmer People: The Phum Snay Necropolis, Northwestern Cambodia. Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, 41(2), 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, D. J., von den Driesch, A., &amp; Voeun, V. (2006). Archaeology and archaeozoology of Phum Snay: a late prehistoric cemetery in northwestern Cambodia. Asian Perspectives, 45(2), 188-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, I., &amp; Bellwood, P. S. (Eds.). (2004). Southeast Asia: from prehistory to history. New York: RoutledgeCurzon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials.  Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the [[Óc Eo]] culture of the [[Mekong Delta]].&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;

===Weapons===

Another major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons.  The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia.  The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments.&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;  This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, B. A. (2007). Dictionary of artifacts. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were [[epaulette|ornamental shoulder decorations]], which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Health===

The health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials.  Rates of [[attrition (dental)|attrition]], caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits.  The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community.  Rates of [[dental caries]] in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Domett, K. M., &amp; O'Reilly, D. J. W. (2009). Health in Pre-Angkorian Cambodia: a bioarchaeological analysis of the skeletal remains from Phum Snay. Asian Perspectives, 48(1), 56-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by [[starches]] and [[carbohydrates]].

===Morphological comparisons===

Measurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="mats"&gt;Matsumura, H., Domett, K. M., &amp; O'REILLY, D. J. (2011). [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/119/1/119_100511/_article On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia]. Anthropological Science, 119(1), 67-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;  The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared.  Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/pre-angkor-warrior-women-found-expert-says-61781/ | title = Pre-Angkor Warrior Women Found, Expert Says | publisher = The Cambodia Daily | date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological significance ==

The high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors.  Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital.  Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;
The differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis.  The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial [[gene flow]] received by other areas of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;

Quantities measured in rem are designed to represent the [[stochastic]] biological risk of ionizing radiation; primarily [[radiation-induced cancer]]. These quantities are derived from [[absorbed dose]], which in the CGS system has the unit [[rad (unit)|rad]] which is also an older unit. There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem; the conversion depends on [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE).

The rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01&amp;nbsp;[[sievert]], which is the more commonly used [[SI unit]] outside the United States. A number of earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the [[roentgen unit]], which was named after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], a German scientist who discovered [[X-ray]]s. The acronym is now a misleading historical artifact, since 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity. Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem.

One rem carries with it a 0.05% chance of eventually developing cancer.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause [[acute radiation syndrome]] (ARS), possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated. Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms. The [[absorbed dose]], measured in [[rad (unit)|rad]], is the best indicator of ARS.&lt;ref name="remdef"&gt;''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Revised ed., US DOD 1962&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|592–593}}

A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the '''millirem''' ('''mrem'''), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and [[background radiation|background]] sources.

==Usage==
The rem and millirem are [[CGS units]] in widest use among the American public, industry, and government.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation: Risks and Realities|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=000003JH.txt|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 May 2012|author1=Office of Air and Radiation |author2=Office of Radiation and Indoor Air|page=2|format=PDF|date=May 2007|quote=In the United States, we measure radiation doses in units called rem. Under the metric system, dose is measured in units called sieverts. One sievert is equal to 100 rem.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International System of Units|SI]] units are the norm outside of the United States, and they are increasingly encountered within the US in academic, scientific, and engineering environments.

The conventional units for dose rate is mrem/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mrem/yr or rem/yr, where they are understood to represent the total amount of radiation allowed (or received) over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual total exposure limits. There is no exact conversion from hours to years because of leap years, but approximate conversions are:
:1 mrem/h = 8766 mrem/yr
:0.1141 mrem/h = 1000 mrem/yr 
The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units|year=1950|publisher=US Department of Commerce|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:8 h = 1 day
:40 h = 1 week
:50 week = 1 yr
Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,

The US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) strongly discourages Americans from expressing doses in rem, in favor of recommending the SI unit.&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)|year=2008|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|location=Gaithersburg, MD|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/sp811/index.cfm|edition=2008|accessdate=28 November 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YWY1pd2K?url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html|id=SP811|page=10|archivedate=12 June 2008|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIST recommends defining the rem in relation to the SI in every document where this unit is used.&lt;ref name="fedreg63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hebner|first=Robert E.|title=Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States|journal=Federal Register|date=1998-07-28|volume=63|issue=144|page=40339|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-07-28/pdf/98-16965.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For US industries and US firms that do not require the sole use of SI, however, the unit rem is often preferred.

== Health effects ==
Ionizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. The deterministic effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of high doses (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~10&amp;nbsp;rad or &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~10&amp;nbsp;rad/h or &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h). A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose. To avoid confusion, deterministic effects are normally compared to absorbed dose in units of rad, not rem.

Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] at a rate of 0.055% per rem (5.5%/Sv).&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2–4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2|last1=Icrp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peck |first1=Donald J.|title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk |url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx|publisher=Image Wisely |accessdate=18 May 2012 |author2=Samei, Ehsan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book|first=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|title=Effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes|year=2008|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-142263-4|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much less data, and much more controversy, regarding the possibility of [[cardiac]] and [[teratogenic]] effects, and the modelling of [[internal dose]].&lt;ref name="ECRR2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=European Committee on Radiation Risk|title=2010 recommendations of the ECRR : the health effects of exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation|year=2010|publisher=Green Audit|location=Aberystwyth|isbn=978-1-897761-16-8|url=http://www.euradcom.org/2011/ecrr2010.pdf|edition=Regulators'|editor=Busby, Chris|accessdate=18 May 2012|display-editors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721220541/http://www.euradcom.org/2011/ecrr2010.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 100 mrem (1 mSv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt;  For comparison, radiation levels inside the US [[United States Capitol]] are 85 mrem/yr (0.85 mSv/yr), close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP" &gt;{{cite web|last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program|title=Radiation in the Environment|url=http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/projmain.html|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20&amp;nbsp;yr&amp;nbsp;× 85&amp;nbsp;mrem/yr&amp;nbsp;× 0.001&amp;nbsp;rem/mrem&amp;nbsp;× 0.055%/rem =&amp;nbsp;~0.1%) That "existing risk" is much higher; an average person would have a one in ten chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation.

==History==
The concept of the rem first appeared in the literature in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cantrill|first1=S.T|author2=H.M. Parker|title=The Tolerance Dose|date=1945-01-05|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA322447|accessdate=14 May 2012|publisher=US Atomic Energy Commission|location=Argonne National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given its first definition in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nucleonics|year=1947|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition was refined in 1950 as "that dose of any ionizing radiation which produces a relevant biological effect equal to that produced by one [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] of high-voltage x-radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=H.M.|title=Tentative Dose Units for Mixed Radiations|journal=Radiology|year=1950|volume=54|issue=2|pages=257–262|doi=10.1148/54.2.257|pmid=15403708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using data available at the time, the rem was variously evaluated as 83, 93, or 95 erg/gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elda E.|title=Units of Radiation and Radioactivity|journal=Public Health Reports|date=March 1952|volume=67|issue=3|pages=293–297|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2030726/pdf/pubhealthreporig01075-0073.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2012|doi=10.2307/4588064|pmc=2030726|pmid=14900367|jstor=4588064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the introduction of the [[rad (unit)|rad]] in 1953, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) decided to "continue" the use of the rem. The US [[National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] noted in 1954 that this effectively implied an increase in the magnitude of the rem to match the rad (100 erg/gram).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Permissible Doses from External Sources of Radiation|publisher=US Department of Commerce|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2059%20Addendum.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|page=31|date=24 September 1954|series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook|volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRP officially adopted the rem as the unit of [[equivalent dose]] in 1962 to measure the way different types of radiation distribute energy in tissue, and began recommending values of [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) for various types of radiation.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In practice, the unit of rem was used to denote that an RBE factor had been applied to a number which was originally in units of rad or roentgen. In 1977 the rem was redefined by the ICRP as 0.01 [[sievert]] or 0.01 J/kg, with the intention that the sievert would come to replace the rem.

The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) adopted the sievert in 1980, but never accepted the use of the rem. The US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) recognizes that this unit is outside the SI, but temporarily accepts its use in the US with the SI.&lt;ref name="fedreg63" /&gt; The rem remains in widespread use as an industry standard in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Radiation Effects'', 2nd edition, 2002, Andrew Holmes-Siedle and Len Adams&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission still permits the use of the units [[curie]], rad and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sense of agency''' ('''SA'''), or '''sense of control''', is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own [[volition (psychology)|volition]]al actions in the world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2003). The mechanism of self-recognition in human. Behavioural Brain Research, 142, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's "[[sense of ownership]]" (SO), which is the [[pre-reflective awareness]] or [[implicit sense]] that one is the owner of an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00&gt;Gallagher, S. (2000). Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally SA and SO are tightly integrated, such that while typing one has an enduring, embodied, and tacit sense that "my own fingers are doing the moving" (SO) ''and'' that "the typing movements are controlled (or volitionally directed) by me" (SA). In patients suffering from certain forms of pathological experience (i.e., [[schizophrenia]]) the integration of SA and SO may become disrupted in some manner. In this case, movements may be executed or thoughts made manifest, for which the schizophrenic patient has a sense of ownership, but not a sense of agency.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2014}}

Regarding SA for both motor movements and thoughts, further distinctions may be found in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience&lt;ref&gt;Tsakiris M, Schütz-Bosbach S, Gallagher S (2007) On agency and body-ownership: phenomenological and neurocognitive reflections. Conscious Cogn 16:645–660&lt;/ref&gt; and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00&gt;Stephens, G. L., &amp; Graham, G. (2000). ''When self-consciousness breaks: Alien voices and inserted thoughts''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; this is an example of SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions ''themselves''. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements ''per se'' but rather, I am involved with the task at hand.  If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious "attribution" of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, ''pre''-reflective "sense" of agency.

==Definition==
The concept of [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. (1990). Intention, consciousness, desires and development. Psychological Inquiry, 1, 278–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of agency plays a pivotal role in cognitive development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds [[theory of mind]] capacities.&lt;ref name=Rochat99&gt;Rochat, P. (1999). Early Social Cognition: Understanding Others in the First Months of Life. Mahawah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} Indeed, the ability to recognize oneself as the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03/&gt; The sense of agency and its scientific study has important implications in [[social cognition]], [[moral reasoning]], and [[psychopathology]]. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist [[Shaun Gallagher]].&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00/&gt; Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (1999): "Schizophrenia, the Space of Reasons, and Thinking as a Motor Process." Monist 82 (4), 609–625.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

==Neuroscience==
A number of experiments in normal individuals has been undertaken in order to determine the functional anatomy of the sense of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior [[parietal cortex]] as a critical link within the simulation network for self-recognition. Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Georgieff, N., Frith, C. D., Decety, J., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2003). Modulating the experience of agency: a positron emission tomography study. NeuroImage 18, 324–333.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, P., &amp; Decety, J. (2001). Effect of subjective perspective taking during simulation of action: A PET investigation of agency. Nature Neuroscience 4, 546–550.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.&lt;ref&gt;Daprati, E., et al. (2000). Recognition of self produced movement in a case of severe neglect. Neurocase, 6, 477–486{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Accumulating evidence from [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as lesion studies in neurological patients indicates that the right inferior [[parietal cortex]], at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays a critical role in the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, P.L., &amp; Decety, J. (2004). Motor cognition: A new paradigm to study self other interactions. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14, 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as [[anosognosia]], [[asomatognosia]], or [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlucchi, G., &amp; Aglioti, S. (1997). The body in the brain: neural bases of corporeal awareness. Trends in Neurosciences, 20, 560–564.&lt;/ref&gt;  A primary source has reported that electrical stimulation of the TPJ can elicit out-of-body experiences (i.e., the experience of dissociation of self from the body).&lt;ref&gt;Blanke, O., &amp; Arzy, S. (2005). The out-of-body experience: Disturbed self-processing at the temporo-parietal junction. Neuroscientist, 11, 16–24.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

The investigation of the neural correlates of reciprocal [[imitation]] is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) to address the issue of the sense of agency.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Sommerville, J.A. (2003). Shared representations between self and others: A social cognitive neuroscience view. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 527–533.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.&lt;ref name=Rochat99/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

A primary source has reported a [[functional neuroimaging]] experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects and while the experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) as well as the visual and [[somatosensory]] inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., Chaminade, T., Grèzes, J. and Meltzoff, A.N. (2002). A PET exploration of the neural mechanisms involved in reciprocal imitation. Neuroimage 15, 265–272.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Another approach to understanding the neuroscientific underpinnings of the sense of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs ''without'' an associated sense of agency.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is [[alien hand syndrome]]. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.

==Agency and psychopathology==
[[Marc Jeannerod]] proposed that the process of self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2008). The sense of agency and its disturbances in schizophrenia: a reappraisal. Experimental Brain Research{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.

Investigation of the sense of agency is important to explain positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]], like thought insertion and delusions of control.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium.&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Frith, C.D., Decety, J., Damato, T., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2004). Neural correlates of action attribution in schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, 131, 31–44.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}} One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, S.A., et al. (1997). A PET study of voluntary movement in schizophrenic patients experiencing passivity phenomena. Brain, 120, 1997–2011.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

==Other aspects of agency==
While the conception of human agency is often confined to its exercise by individuals, [[Albert Bandura]] has argued that individuals often do not have direct control over social conditions or institutional practices that affect their lives; in these circumstances, well-being and security are sought through exercise of proxy agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). Self-efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For instance, individuals in such circumstances may attempt to persuade others who have expertise, influence, or power to act on their behalf to achieve the outcomes they desire.

Sense of agency has been argued as a prerequisite for human [[morality|moral responsibility]] insofar as self agency underlies the expectation that individuals can be held responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Kahn, P.H. (1992). Obligatory and discretionary moral judgments. Child Development, 63, 416–430.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

== Historical Context ==
The advent of modern K-pop arguably started in 1992, gained significant foothold by 1996 during the industrialization of K-pop, matured through the mid 2000s,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and flourished in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Albeit beauty is an ever-present ideal for Korean popular culture, these time periods represent shifts in beauty norms and K-pop ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The early 1990s brought a young, individualistic cuteness to the scene with stocky builds and chubby faces, following from the Korean beauty norms of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the 1980s Japanese idol system, idol groups were generated in the late 1990s, often mimicking western boy bands with innocence and sunny dispositions, a product directed domestically. During this time a review committee censored all Korean music and music videos for sexual and other explicit content.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The committee was disbanded in June 1996.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After an economic crisis in 1997 and success of this domestic product outside South Korea, the innocence morphed into a more romantic and hipper image in the early 2000s, which presented the first major signs of sexualization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This transformation was aided by the increased use of music videos.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 2004 a new generation of K-pop was born, sex became prevalent in K-pop and idol-worshiping adolescents came into being.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within a decade, maturation of K-pop, driven by hyper-popularized music videos, propelled idols into a visual medium, thus transforming K-pop into the modern beauty standard of low body fat, well-toned muscles, and perfected body features.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
The late 2000s brought K-pop into its modern era and introduced it to the international stage with the [[Korean Wave|Korean wave]] in Asia; the early 2010s bolstered K-pop to an international powerhouse with the global Korean wave. K-pop has always been influenced by western musical styles; however, many link its international success to the globalization caused by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout period (during the 1997 South Korean economic crash) in South Korea's neoliberalization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post-IMF South Korea has incorporated more Westernized (specifically, Americanized) culture into their products (i.e. exports) in order to prosper in international sales, thus pressing the popular music industry to become more westernized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Integration of westernization brought the western male gaze&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the hypersexualization of products, especially in the popular music scene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only was the music itself altered to enhance exportability, but given the modern age of the music video, the performer was also altered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Combining this with Korea's male dominated society, one that currently ranks the near the bottom of the Global Gender Gap list for modernized societies (presenting the largest gender wage and working condition gaps), produces an overtly sexualized popular music market.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Additionally, proliferation of K-pop allows for South Korea to enter into and even dominate the global “cultural war,” a concept tied to a battle for attention between the globalized cultures in the modern era. Thus, the government of South Korea encourages the use of K-pop to promote global recognition; however, because of the turbulence of popular culture, largely due to sexualization and exploitation, the government maintains no official backing of K-pop but restrains limiting what are allowable K-pop activities.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saeji|first=CedarBough T.|date=December 2013|title=Juvenile Protection and Sexual Objectification: Analysis of the Performance Frame in Korean Music Television Broadcasts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2013.16.2.003|journal=Acta Koreana|volume=16|issue=2|pages=329–365|doi=10.18399/acta.2013.16.2.003|issn=1520-7412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergo, without official sponsorship of K-pop, the government unofficially helps it by reducing governmental constraints on it, especially for exported products.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This allows the idols to become an unofficial representation of the South Korean culture, promoting cultural pride and building the nation into an “idol republic,” meaning that their image (i.e. bodies) belong to the state and represent the state's people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Critical Issues ==
Sexualization in K-pop is mainly driven by economic reasoning and forces females into a globalized normative femininity and males into a globalized normative masculinity.

=== Economic Reasoning ===
Entering the world market to help globalize marketable Korean culture was only a byproduct of the economic conditions behind K-pop's evolution. Early K-pop was not well received critically, but its catchiness and localization enamored the masses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The success was noticed by a few business-oriented musicians that soon capitalized on the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Industrialization of K-pop occurred around the mid 1990s and its popularity grew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Maintaining localization while hybridizing (not assimilating) with Japan's idol methodology and American popular music stylings helped bolster success internally and as an export, albeit initially limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The promising external success in conjunction with the diverse extant musical acts drove the music industry to facilitate portfolio diversification of their performing groups to maximize success and thus, profits. This meant optimized pandering to the most consumers. Such optimization lead to increasing numbers of performers per group, each individualized to suit different consumers’ tastes, perfecting the performances, and increasing attractiveness of the group to the different consuming cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, in the group itself there could be a proverbial “good,” “bad,” cute, or sexy member, while the whole group increased in attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, combining the desires of American culture for blatant sexiness,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unger|first=Michael A.|date=March 2015|title=The Aporia of Presentation: Deconstructing the Genre of K-pop Girl Group Music Videos in South Korea|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpms.12109|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=27|issue=1|pages=25–47|doi=10.1111/jpms.12109|issn=1524-2226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean culture for [[aegyo]] (a compound of cute and lovable),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and Japanese proclivity for [[kawaii]] and patriarchal Lolita ideas made a complex interplay of diverse satisfaction of fantastical desires.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following this logic, the music companies substantially invested monetarily and temporally in each performer in an effort to tailor them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A base level of attractiveness and skill is required to be considered as a performer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Years of subsequent training and discipline mold performers into what the public wants to see.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are disallowed from dating to maintain innocence,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; have a directed public life and persona (often sexualized or cute), shamed for gaining (or in some cases not losing) weight or not keeping their appearance up, may be required to go through plastic surgery for beautification,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and are required to interact with fans in a desirable manner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All-in-all, K-pop is an industry driven by profit; subsequently, it treats its performers like well-molded commodities in order to adhere to consumer desires, often sexual in nature as in the westernized (male) gaze, and Lolita ideals.

=== Femininity ===
As the flagship cultural commodities of South Korea, female K-pop singers are expected to be sexy, strong, and independent, in conjunction with being a product for the patriarchal South Korean capitalist society, which wants them to be submissive, innocent, cute, and loveable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; To maximize profit and success, the female stars must have the guise of ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ultimately, the ambiguity results as a clash between virgin and whore, which nearly all groups have; however, some of them may be more biased to one side than the other.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazzan|first=Dave|date=|title=K-pop Chords of Sexism|url=http://www.davehazzan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Herizons-v30n2-Fall16.pdf|journal=herizons|volume=30(2)|pages=44-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean ideals nominally press an aegyo image, or one that is “attractive and desirable beyond limits of intimate relations,” providing vulnerability to the idols but keeping them whimsical.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To conform to the westernized male gaze, females take the part of an exotic sexual object,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; often under the dollified Asian motif, leading to thoughts of “convenient Asians.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dollification is a construct of placing sexual desire upon a submissive and uncorrupted object of beauty, something common to Asia due to traditional gender roles and patriarchal structure, and applies exceptionally well to the surgically beautified K-pop females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, dolls are often associated with prostitution or sexual favors, something that idol singers can face when exploited by their employers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dollification also plays into the Japanese desire for submissive kawaii: dolls are inherently cute and can be controlled at will, something that quenches the yearning for totally submissive females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, the concept of middle-aged Korean males seeing themselves as Samchon-fans (uncle-fans), or enduring uncles to the idols, has been argued as a facade to deny sexual desire when there is actually an underlying sexual gratification from the female bodies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This makes the female idol fill a Lolita role, one which fulfills a market need by supplying a male pedophilic fantasy of a young female with unconscious sexuality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Consequently, girl (female) bodies have become a commodity and given implicit subjugation in the patriarchal structure, the consumption of such is acceptable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The females may present “girl power” given their high popularity status, but their pawn-like nature under the might of their parent companies keeps this a novelty, not a reality, via pacification.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The justified objectification of girl bodies in such an idol republic, where it is promoted economically and governmentally, makes it a Lolita republic, as argued by Yeran Kim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More simply, their bodies’ beauty can belong to a national collective.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This beauty and femininity in image is prominently described as that of long legs with “honey thighs” and a perfect face and body, while showing ample skin; breasts are often sexualized but have only recently been presented as cleavage in K-pop due to the lack of cleavage shown in the general Korean culture.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Masculinity ===
Paralleling female idols, male idols are also commodities to be sexualized in an effort to maximize profit and success. Given the rigorous patriarchal gender rolls existing in Korea, the males are normally subjected to the requirement of Korean masculinity, but to optimize for diverse target audiences, they often present vulnerabilities, forming a non-Korean masculinity.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/840865016|title=Korean masculinities and transcultural consumption Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop idols|last=Sun.|first=Jung,|date=2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|oclc=840865016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean (hegemonic) masculinity can consist of patriarchal authority, traditional Confucian masculinity, and violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/46240370|title=Under construction : the gendering of modernity, class, and consumption in the Republic of Korea|last=Laurel.|first=Kendall,|date=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824824075|oclc=46240370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradictorily, non-Korean masculinity contains a range of metrosexuality from charming to chic.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This dichotomy forces bands to be muscular, potent, and appearing sexually virile, while injecting cuteness and innocence into their presentation, creating a transnational “soft masculinity” and “global metrosexual masculinity.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both a soft masculinity called “flower boys,” and a harder masculinity, called “beast idols,” appear in K-pop groups, but even the hardest K-pop masculinity maintains a globalized cuteness.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/column/k-pop-generation/article/2013/10/22/Kpop_Men_Gender_Roles_Soy/|title=Men in K-Pop: From “Flower Boys” to “Beast-dols”|last=Soyoung|first=Kim|date=October 22, 2013|website=The Harvard Crimson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192647/https://www.thecrimson.com/column/k-pop-generation/article/2013/10/22/Kpop_Men_Gender_Roles_Soy/|archive-date=March 25, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key features of K-pop masculinity are muscular (often nude) torsos and cute actions/personalities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Well-defined muscles, albeit a falsity, can be considered a sign of both individual phallic power in response to feministic movements and nationalistic female desires.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is exemplified by a “body price” (momgap) notion that equates the sexiness of a male body to its (and his) worth,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with “chocolate abs” being the most desirable trait.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Emasculated actions/personalities are often subtly employed to diversify the K-pop masculine act,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; as previously stated, but have occasionally been stressed by some to help break gender norms.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soompi.com/article/1079057wpp/8-k-pop-idols-challenging-gender-norms-korea|title=8 K-Pop Idols Who Are Challenging Gender Norms In Korea|last=heytoto|first=|date=November 28, 2017|website=soompi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, removing masculinity as a whole is ineffective, as noted by a Korean studies professor Oh Ingyu of Korea University, Seoul, “[a] male star without well-defined muscles, six-pack abs and a handsome smile won’t go far.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As stated by Sarah Leung “[the K-pop industry’s] ultimate goal? To sell an image to the screaming girls in the crowd.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Manifestation ==
Sexualization of the popular Korean music market takes place in many forms: pushing sexy and attractive performers, conforming the performers to fan fantasies, and presenting sexualized songs or music videos.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Dollification ===
Dollification can be observed in a Japanese quote on the introduction to a performance by [[Girls' Generation|Girls’ Generation]] “I was shocked by their amazingly beautiful legs. The dance was as if dolls were dancing and it was wondrous.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Likewise, employers utilized doll images for advertisement. The idol [[G.NA]]’s body measurements were a hot topic with fans, so her employer promoted her by juxtaposing her with mannequins during photoshoots while calling her body “the mannequin body” because of her small face, large breasts, and small waist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This representation of a dollified human parallels Girl's Generation's “Gee” music video, in which the members are acting as mannequins in a shop's window that soon come alive or [[Girl's Day|Girl's Day]]’s music video for “Tilt my Head,” in which the members act like doll factory automata producing self-similar dolls that magically come alive (both also following the “coming alive” narrative).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Countering the description of a perfect doll image is the group Piggy Dolls, consisting of three heavier set females, engendering diversity in body image.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Female idol bodies ===
In general, K-pop idol bodies are heavily regulated by their employers; in fact, female bodies are not considered their own, as presented by a snarky statement by a member of [[Super Junior]], "[Girls’ Generation] can't get hurt without permission. Their bodies aren't their own. They're treasures of the nation."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Consequently, female idols need to conform to image norms. A normative male gaze desires long legs, something Girls’ Generation has in multitudes, as exemplified by a Japanese nickname “The Beautiful Legs Group,” and has even spawned a Japanese pornographic film based on their legs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Similarly, bodily perfection is a requirement of the profit-driven entertainment kingpins.

=== Male idol bodies ===
Males are likewise subjected to rigorous body standards, with a requirement to keep up their “body price”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; while balancing their soft masculinity.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The singer Rain is the embodiment of effeminate hyper-masculinity.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/900162636|title=The Korean wave : Korean media go global|last=compilation|first=Kim, Youna, editor of|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415712781|oclc=900162636}}&lt;/ref&gt; His well-defined abs and upper muscular body, often seen naked and oiled (or wet), is contrasted to his cute and young face.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; He is described as having “an angelic face and a killer body” or “a man’s body with a boy’s face.”&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Hyunjoon|date=December 2009|title=Have you ever seen theRain?

To keep this image, rigorous training is required, normally employing trainers and intense daily workout routines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As with their female counterparts, there is sometimes a need for plastic surgery. Similarly, conjecture exists for who has undergone surgery, but again, some idols have explicitly stated their surgical augmentations. For example, Kwanghee of [[ZE:A]] had eyelid, nose, and forehead alterations, Kim Heechul from Super Junior had eyelid alterations and fixed remnants of a past broken nose with surgery, and his co-star Kyuhyun (of Super Junior) had a double eyelid surgery following his parents example.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; It is important to note some of the gender norm challengers. Kim Heechul of Super Junior hosts a show “Lipstick Prince” to cover makeup for both genders, Ren from [[NU'EST|NU’EST]] modeled dresses, skirts, and other similar clothing, Lee Hong Ki of [[F.T. Island|FTISLAND]] both wears and promotes his nail art, Jo Kwon is a queer culture advocate and crossdresser, and Hansol enjoys makeup and has admitted to being non-heterosexual.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Sexualization in YouTube music videos ===
{{See also|List of banned K-pop videos}}
Given the popularization of K-pop through visual social media such as YouTube,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; many fans would most recognize sexualization in music videos or recorded performances. The advent of music videos to help brand recognition brought a survival-of-the-fittest attitude to the images of the artists; that is, the sexier artists survived.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, sex was commercialized to capitalize on human reproductive nature, allowing sexualization to flourish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Given the liberalization of sex, sexual content has increased in K-pop music videos; therefore, a video content analysis was performed by Bohye Song by taking MelOn Hot 100 chart listings of the most popular Korean music videos of 2004, 2005, 2014, and 2015 to analyze their sexual content and increases over time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Content observed were sexual innuendos, sexual acts, and provocative clothing while the results were broken down into four parts of changes in physical affection, provocative dress, suggestiveness, and gender variance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was found that displayed physical affections did not change on average, but implicit sex increased, sexual suggestiveness increased, provocative clothing increased, and female lead singers showed a significant increase in provocative display.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This means that there is a significant increase in the display, mainly through clothing, of sexualized females and some males, but there is not much of an increase in sexual acts (two people in contact) depicted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This can be exemplified with modern music videos. Examples of K-pop music videos with revealing clothing on a female singer include “Marionette” by Stellar, “Roll Deep” by Hyuna, “Ring My Bell” by Girl's Day, “Wild” by [[Nine Muses (band)|Nine Muses]], “Wiggle Wiggle” by [[Hello Venus]], “Like a Cat” by [[AOA (band)|AOA]], “Butt” by I-Ren, and “Dr. Feel Good” by [[Rania (band)|BP RaNia]], among many others.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/K-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-female-edition|title=K-Pop idols' most revealing outfits [Female Edition]|last=|first=|date=May 22, 2017|website=allkpop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114013918/https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/k-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-female-edition|archive-date=January 14, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female singers sported short skirts, short shorts, cleavage, tight clothing, et cetera.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Correspondingly, male singers have worn see-through shirts and pants, extremely short shorts, and even corsets or skimpy dresses (in drag).&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/K-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-male-edition|title=K-Pop idols' most revealing outfits [Male Edition]|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2017|website=allkpop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115014357/https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/k-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-male-edition|archive-date=January 15, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to these are banned-from-broadcast videos, which include, but are not limited to, “MOMMAE” by [[Jay Park]], due to overtly sexualized females; “Abracadabra” by Brown Eyed Girls, for being sexually suggestive; “Mirotic” by [[TVXQ]], for body exposure and explicit language; “One More” by [[Fiestar|FIESTAR]], due to sexual imagery; both “Vibrato” and “Marionette” by [[Stellar (South Korean band)|Stellar]], for sexually suggestive dancing and clothing; “Touch Me” by Ivy, for sexual imagery and suggestive lyrics; “Joker” by [[Dal Shabet]], for sexual choreography; “Shower Later” by Gary, due to sexual innuendos and mature themes; and “Bae Bae” by [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|BIGBANG]], for sexual innuendos.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/10-K-pop-mvs-that-were-deemed-too-sexy-for-tv/|title=10 K-Pop MVs that have been banned for being “Too Sexual”|last=|first=|date=January 6, 2017|website=Koreaboo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107074515/https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/10-K-pop-mvs-that-were-deemed-too-sexy-for-tv/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the transition from innocent to sexualized can be shown by Girls’ Generation music videos.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Their video for “[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]” in 2009 maintained schoolgirl innocence, then their video for “[[Oh! (Girls' Generation song)|Oh!]]” in 2010 kept their innocence but added on a prelude to their dark side at the end when it pitted the innocent schoolgirl cheerleaders against sexier, shadowy versions of themselves.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, their 2011 video for “[[The Boys (Girls' Generation song)|The Boys]]” replaced innocence with mature sexiness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
Sexualization has a multitude of implications, causing controversies. One key controversy involves the disproportionate sexualization and objectification of females in comparison to males, perpetuating the patriarchal ideal of South Korea.

=== Gender inequalities ===
Both male and female K-pop idols are taken advantage of and objectified; however, females appear to have a disproportionate amount of sexism pitted against them.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Females are subjected to the western male gaze, dollification, and being considered exotic and submissive for their masculine fans in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Femininity is desired to coincide with the neo-Confucian patriarchal social structure so as to maximize profit; idols are normally forced into this definition in conjunction with Korea's inherently well-defined roll for women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Additionally, being below Japan's Global Gender Gap Index and aligned with Muslim-majority countries’, South Korea's Global Gender Gap Index represents the general poor state of gender equality in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Xi Lin and Rober Rudolf conducted a survey of 6,317 K-pop fans from 100 countries to determine the egalitarianism of the K-pop consumers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Their study found that more K-pop indulgence correlated to less egalitarianism, with this being most notable in already gender stratified countries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Similarly, the stratification of genders in Korea is actually aided by the government and its patriarchal capitalism, and vice-versa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; That is, sexism and sexualization in K-pop support the success of South Korea's patriarchal capitalism, forcing norms of gender inequalities and the sexual objectification of female K-pop idols.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5457">The '''Society for Pentecostal Studies''' (SPS) is an American [[Learned society|scholarly association]] of biblical scholars, theologians, and others who are members of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]] or are involved in the [[Charismatic Renewal]]. It was founded in 1970.  The members of the Society consider themselves responsible for recording the history and developing the theology of these grassroots movements that have influenced Christianity worldwide.

== Overview ==
SPS was first envisioned by three classical Pentecostals, Dr. [[William W. Menzies]] of the [[Assemblies of God]], Dr. [[H. Vinson Synan]] of the [[International Pentecostal Holiness Church]], and Dr. [[Horace Ward]] of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]]. The original requirement for membership was adherence to the statement of faith of the [[Pentecostal Fellowship of North America]]. However, because [[nontrinitarian]]s and others were unable to sign the statement for doctrinal reasons, this requirement was eventually eliminated.

The purpose of the Society, as defined on its website, is to provide a scholarly forum in which to interpret the [[Pentecostal]] movement as well as "to stimulate, encourage, recognize, and publicize the work of Pentecostal and Charismatic scholars and scholars of Pentecostalism; to study the implications of Pentecostal theology in relation to other academic disciplines, seeking a Pentecostal world-and-life view; and to support fully, to the extent appropriate for an academic society, the following statement of purposes:

-To encourage fellowship and facilitate co-ordination of effort among Pentecostal believers throughout the world.

-To demonstrate to the world the essential unity of Spirit-baptized believers, fulfilling the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ, “That they all may be one” (John 17:21).

-To cooperate in an endeavor to respond to the unchanging commission of the Lord Jesus, to carry His message to all people of all nations.

-To promote courtesy and mutual understanding, “endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, until we all come in the unity of the faith” (Ephesians 4:3, 13).

-To afford prayerful and practical assistance to any Pentecostal body in need of such.

-To promote and maintain the scriptural purity of the Society by Bible study and prayer.

-To uphold and maintain those Pentecostal truths, “most surely believed among us” (Luke 1:1)."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sps-usa.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society holds annual conferences. The organization, which began as a scholarly branch of classical Pentecostalism, is now [[ecumenical]], with over 500 members from all major [[Christian denomination]]s. For many years, the Society has hosted the meetings of the Roman Catholic/Pentecostal dialogue (see [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]]).

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
{{other uses2|Steady state}}

A '''steady-state economy''' is an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time. The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].

Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xi-xvi}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|55f}}

The world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or population overshoot. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken — and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|148–155}}

A steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]].

An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].

== Definition and vision ==
Herman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy — something desirable by itself — maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

In the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|84}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|83}}

== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ==
{{See also |Planetary boundaries |Anthropocene |List of environmental issues |Societal collapse }}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright| Like any other planet, earth is finite]]

The world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt; According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] — that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.&lt;ref name=gfn01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw01/&gt; In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.&lt;ref name=welanth/&gt; The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Overpopulation
World population is [[Human overpopulation #Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population #Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Pollution and global warming
Air pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many — if not all — parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost #Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, a so-called [[Climate state #Hothouse|'Hothouse climate state']] may be the end result in the future.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Depletion of non-renewable minerals
Non-renewable [[Mineral resource classification|mineral reserves]] are currently extracted at high and [[Sustainable development#Insubstantial stretching of the term|unsustainable rates]] from [[Structure of the Earth#Crust|earth's crust]]. Remaining reserves are likely to [[Peak minerals#Future production|become ever more costly to extract in the near future]], and will reach depletion at some point. The era of relatively peaceful economic expansion that has prevailed globally since World War II may be interrupted by unexpected [[supply shock]]s or simply be succeeded by the [[Hubbert peak theory#Hubbert peaks|peaking depletion paths]] of [[Peak oil|oil]] and [[Critical mineral raw materials|other valuable minerals]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Net depletion of renewable resources
Use of [[Natural resource#Classification|renewable]] resources in excess of their replenishment rates is undermining [[ecological stability]] worldwide. Between 2000 and 2012, [[deforestation]] resulted in some 14 percent of the equivalent of earth's original forest cover to be cut down. Tropical rainforests have been subject to [[Rainforest#Deforestation|deforestation]] at a rapid pace for decades — especially in [[Deforestation by region#Africa|west and central Africa]] and in [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|Brazil]] — mostly due to [[Deforestation#Causes|subsistence farming, population pressure, and urbanization]]. Population pressures also strain the [[Soil retrogression and degradation#Consequences of soil regression and degradation|world's soil systems]], leading to land degradation, mostly in developing countries. Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries. By 2025, [[Water security#Fresh water|water scarcity]] could impact the living conditions of two-thirds of the world's population.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Loss of biodiversity
The destructive impact of human activity on [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] worldwide is accelerating the [[Anthropocene#Biodiversity|extinction of rare species]], thereby substantially reducing [[Biodiversity#Species loss rates|earth's biodiversity]]. The [[Nitrogen cycle|natural nitrogen cycle]] is heavily overloaded by [[Nitrogen fixation#Industrial nitrogen fixation|industrial nitrogen fixation and use]], thereby [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle#Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle|disrupting most known types of ecosystems]]. The [[Marine pollution#Plastic debris|accumulating plastic debris]] in the oceans decimates aquatic life. [[Ocean acidification]] due to the excess concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere is resulting in [[coral bleaching]] and [[Ocean acidification#Impacts on oceanic calcifying organisms|impedes shell-bearing organisms]]. [[Arctic sea ice decline]] caused by global warming is [[Polar bear#Climate change|endangering the polar bear]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These mounting concerns have prompted an increasing number of academics and other writers to point to limits to [[economic growth]], and to question — and even oppose — the prevailing ideology of infinite economic growth.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=rh01/&gt;&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pe01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ub02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ek01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=av01/&gt;&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=wr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=do03/&gt;

== Historical background ==
For centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].

=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}
From [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295}}

==== Adam Smith's concept ====
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
{{See also|Invisible hand}}
{{Further|The Wealth of Nations}}
[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the enlightened self-interest of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|349f, 533f}}

Smith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|59–68}}

Smith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:

{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}}}

According to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, "... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}

==== David Ricardo's concept ====
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}
{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}
[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]
In the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade #Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}

In Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}

According to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers – Ricardo himself died in 1823 – directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|202f}}

The Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|88f}}

Ricardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).

==== John Stuart Mill's concept ====
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}
{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]
John Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|179}}

A champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.&lt;ref name=jsm02/&gt; Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:

{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...&lt;ref name=jsm03/&gt;{{rp|19}}}}

Mill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|16}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:

{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592}}}}

Contrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not "... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about "... a very considerable improvement on our present condition."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by — instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592–596}}

Hence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14f}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|79}}

=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===
{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}
When the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:

[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]
{{anchor|Karl Marx}}
* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of "from each according to ability, to each according to need" — that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|57–65}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|218–225}} &lt;ref name=pb01/&gt;{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that "Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]]."&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|52}}
* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295–299}} &lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|55–57}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|156–160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|121–123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;{{rp|145–148}}

Taken together, it has been argued that "... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics."&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has 
reintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).

=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}
{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}
{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]
[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.

In his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing "bad attack of economic pessimism" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' — avarice, exaction of interest, love of money — that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live "wisely and agreeably and well." Mankind would finally have solved "the economic problem," that is, the struggle for existence.&lt;ref name=jmk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|2, 11}}

The similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

In his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and — if population was not increasing rapidly — society would finally "... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ..."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. "I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|237}}

=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===
The economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.

==== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ====
{{See also|Environmentalism #Post-war expansion}}
After the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion — known today as the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]] — was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded — or later joined — [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973–75 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].

Throughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] — dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] — developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|46f}} &lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics — namely [[general equilibrium theory]] — was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.&lt;ref name=cs01/&gt;{{rp|416–422}}

In the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed — indeed, ''challenged'' — in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|296–298}}

==== Emerging ecological concerns ====
During the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:

* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution — like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.&lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|104}}
* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ag01/&gt;{{rp|13}} &lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|164f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–171}}
* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.&lt;ref name=ho01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|68–71}} &lt;ref name=cc01/&gt;{{rp|14f}}

{{anchor|LtG}}
* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection — ''not'' prediction — that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].&lt;ref name=dm02/&gt; Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|244f}} &lt;ref name=jn01/&gt;{{rp|60f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|50–62}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.&lt;ref name=ch01/&gt;{{rp|230}} &lt;ref name=aj01/&gt;{{rp|8f}} &lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;{{rp|152–155}} &lt;ref name=gt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj02/&gt;{{rp|8}}
Taken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|301–305}}

==== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ====
{{Main article| Ecological economics}}
Although most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martínez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|308–310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].

When the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.&lt;ref name=ir02/&gt;{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.&lt;ref name=ba01/&gt;&lt;ref name=cs02/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp01/&gt;

== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ==

Since the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|117–124}} &lt;ref name=hd05/&gt; He has also helped founding a center for the advancement of the steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=casse/&gt; He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.&lt;ref name=cr01/&gt;

According to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] — or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] — top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|146–148}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]
The premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Daly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may — within some practical limits — extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock — and not the Sun — that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|21f}}

[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]
Daly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily — though not exclusively — on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.

Daly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:

{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point — the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Following the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:

{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|36}}}}

This view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that "... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants".&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.

{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}
[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]
Consequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:

* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.
* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.
* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).

The purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls "a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity" and providing "the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|69}}

Among the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} 
&lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|165–167}}

{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}
Responding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: "A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy".&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...

{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end — that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|370}}}}

Later, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.&lt;ref name=mr01/&gt;{{rp|90f}} &lt;ref name=mf01/&gt;{{rp|105–107}} &lt;ref name=mb03/&gt;{{rp|270}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=av01/&gt;{{rp|37}}

== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==
{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental and physical constraints}}
Several conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space. Herman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.

=== Role of technology ===
{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}
[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding 
the role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:

* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref name=cm01/&gt;{{rp|508f}} &lt;ref name=rc02/&gt;{{rp|813–816}} &lt;ref name=tt02/&gt;{{rp|409f}}

[[File:2012 09 03 Brückenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]
* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology — useful though it is — works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] — or disorder — of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|18–25}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

From the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|80f}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|116–118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.&lt;ref name=hd06/&gt;{{rp|134f}}

=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===
{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}

Resource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural resource consumption to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption — that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|67f}}

[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]
In the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income–consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–163}} &lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;{{rp|40f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|64f}}

In 2009, two separate studies were published that — among other things — addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt; British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt; Consider each in turn:
* Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment — based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology — will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|11–18}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizsäcker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizsäcker notes that "... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption."&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizsäcker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|309f}}
* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' — that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP—decreased by 33 percent;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that "resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction," mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] — notably China — building up their [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that "simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt."&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Herman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|61–64}}

* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.
* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).
* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both — and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.

For all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|77–80}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|118}}

=== Declining-state economy ===
{{Distinguish|Recession}}
{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}
{{Further|Degrowth}}

A declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.

Proponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].

paradigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth — that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|374–379}} &lt;ref name=jg02/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

American political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner — who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work — have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:

* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is uncapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy — or what he terms an 'entropic society' — based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|205–224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}}
* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that "the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life."&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|103}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|134–138}} 
* In his article on ''Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy'', Christian Kerschner has integrated the strategy of declining-state, or degrowth, with Herman Daly's concept of the steady-state economy to the effect that degrowth should be considered a path taken by the rich industrialized countries leading towards a globally equitable steady-state economy. This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time — although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=do02/&gt;{{rp|229}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

Herman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:

{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}}}}

Daly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

=== Capitalism without growth ===
{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}
Several [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.&lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;{{rp|97–100}} &lt;ref name=mm01/&gt;{{rp|45–51}} &lt;ref name=bb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pa01/&gt; Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:

[[File:Wall Street Bull - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]
* In capitalism, economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige — or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.
* In capitalism, [[employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].
* In capitalism, the [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.
* In capitalism, [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.
* In capitalism, private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.
* In capitalism, governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.
* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.
— In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.

Fully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):

{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}}}

Daly concludes by inviting all (most) people — both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism — to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}

=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===
{{Main| Asteroid mining}}
{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}
{{Further|Space advocacy}}

Ever since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).

[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]
In the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could — and indeed ''should'' — expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth — and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline — than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: "The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies."&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

By the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation has long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.&lt;ref name=wc01/&gt; &lt;ref name=as02/&gt; &lt;ref name=pm01/&gt;

[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]
However, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space — and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.&lt;ref name=hd07/&gt;{{rp|24}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|81–83}} &lt;ref name=te01/&gt; &lt;ref name=ws01/&gt; &lt;ref name=kz01/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29881">'''Systems philosophy''' is a discipline aimed at constructing a new philosophy (in the sense of [[worldview]]) by using systems concepts. The discipline was first described by [[Ervin László|Ervin Laszlo]] in his 1972 book ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers. {{ISBN|0-677-03850-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the "reorientation of thought and world view ensuing from the introduction of "systems" as a new scientific paradigm".&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Soon after Laszlo founded systems philosophy it was placed in context by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], one of the founders of general [[system theory]], when he categorized three domains within [[systemics]] namely:
# "[[Systems science]]", which is concerned with "scientific exploration and theory of "systems" in the various sciences...and general system theory as doctrine of principles applying to all systems";&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xix&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Systems technology", which is concerned with "the problems arising in modern technology and society, comprising both the "hardware" of computers, automation self-regulating machinery etc., and the "software" of new theoretical developments and disciplines";&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xx&lt;/ref&gt; and
# "Systems philosophy", which is concerned with "the new philosophy of nature" which regards the world as a great organization" that is "organismic" rather than "mechanistic" in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems philosophy consists of four main areas:
# "Systems ontology", which is concerned "with what is meant by "system" and how systems are realized at various levels of the world of observation";&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Systems paradigms", which is concerned with developing worldviews which "takes [humankind] as one species of concrete and actual system, embedded in encompassing natural hierarchies of likewise concrete and actual physical, biological, and social systems";&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is called "systems epistemology" in Von Bertalanffy, L., (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These are called "systems philosophies" in Bahm, A. J. (1981). Five Types of Systems Philosophy. ''International Journal of General Systems'', 6(4), 233–237.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Systems axiology", which is concerned with developing models of systems that involve "humanistic concerns", and views "symbols, values, social entities and cultures" as "something very "real"" and having an "embeddedness in a cosmic order of hierarchies";&lt;ref&gt;in Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxii-xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; and
# "Applied systems philosophy", which is concerned with using the insights from the other branches of systems philosophy to solve practical problems, especially social and philosophical ones.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers, p. 12: "[Systems philosophy's] data come from the empirical sciences; its problems come from the history of philosophy; and its concepts come from modern systems research."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "systems philosophy" is often used as a convenient shorthand to refer to "the philosophy of systems",&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.pdx.edu/sysc/courses-sysc-521621-systems-philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; but this usage can be misleading. The philosophy of systems is in fact merely the element of systems philosophy called "systems ontology" by von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). General System Theory. Revised Edition. New York: George Braziller, pp. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; and "systems metaphysics" by Laszlo.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems ontology provides important grounding for [[systems thinking]] but does not encompass the essential focus of systems philosophy, which is about articulating a worldview grounded in systems perspectives and humanistic concerns.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Origin and development of systems philosophy ==

===The founding of systems philosophy===

Systems philosophy was founded by [[Ervin László|Ervin Laszlo]] in 1972 with his book ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Foreword'' was written by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]].

"Systems philosophy", in Ervin Laszlo's sense of the term, means using the systems perspective to model the nature of reality, and to use this to solve important human problems (Laszlo, 1972). Laszlo developed the idea behind systems philosophy independently of von Bertalanffy's work on ''General System Theory'' (published in 1968), but they met before ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy'' was published and the decision to call the new discipline "systems philosophy" was their joint one.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (2004). ''Science and the Akashic field: an integral theory of everything.'' Rochester Vt.: Inner Traditions. p.163&lt;/ref&gt; Writing ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy'' took five years, and in his autobiography Laszlo calls it "my major work".&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (2011) ''Simply Genius! And Other Tales From My Life.'' London: Hay House&lt;/ref&gt;

Laszlo's "great idea", that made systems philosophy possible, was that the existence of a general system theory that captures the "patterns" that recur across the Systemics, who themselves capture "patterns" that recur across the specialized disciplines, entails that the world is organised as a whole, and thus has an underlying unity.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach. pp. 8-10, 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In this light, nature's special domains (as characterized by the specialized sciences) are contingent expressions or arrangements or projections of an underlying intelligibly ordered reality.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; If the nature of this underlying unity and the way it conditions phenomenal reality could be understood, it would provide a powerful aid to solving pressing sociological problems and answering deep philosophical questions.

In the subsequent years, systems philosophy has been developed in four important ways, discussed below.

===Laszlo and evolutionary futures===

The first development was due to Ervin Laszlo himself, and is grounded in the concern that the way in which global resources are exploited does not take global systemic effects into account, and appears likely to have catastrophic global consequences. Work in this area is focused on developing models and interventions that can bring about human thriving in a sustainable way on a global scale. Laszlo promotes work in this area through the Club of Budapest International Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;http://clubofbudapest.org/&lt;/ref&gt; of which he is the founder and President, and the journal ''World Futures: The Journal of General Evolution'', of which he is the editor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=gwof20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozbekhan and the global problematique===

A contemporary of Laszlo, Hasan Ozbekhan&lt;ref&gt;Ozbekhan, H. (1969). Toward a General Theory of Planning. In E.. Jantsch (ed.), Perspectives of Planning. Paris: OECD Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; in the original proposal to the Club of Rome&lt;ref&gt;Ozbekhan, H. (1970). The Predicament of Mankind: A Quest for Structured Responses to Growing World-Wide Complexities and Uncertainties. www.redesignresearch.com/docs/ThePredicamentofMankind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; identified 49 ''Continuous Critical Problems'' (CCPs) that intertwine to generate the Global Problematique. This work was shoved aside by the Club as too humanistic and it adopted the system dynamics approach of [[Jay Forrester]]. This decision resulted in the volume ''The Limits to Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., Meadows, D., and Randers, J. (1972). The Limits to Growth. New York: Universe Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozbekhan sat down with Alexander Christakis and revisited the 49 CCPs in 1995 using the methodology of ''Structured Dialogic Design'' (SDD) which was not available in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, T. and Bausch, K. (2011). A Democratic Approach to Sustainable Futures: A Workbook for Addressing the Global Problematique. Riverdale, GA: Ongoing Emergence Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They generated an influence map that identified leverage points for alleviating the global problematique. Subsequently, an online class at [[Flinders University]] generated an influence map that bore remarkable similarities to that produce by Ozbekhan and Christakis.&lt;ref&gt;Bausch, K.C. et al. (2012) Sustainable Global Democracy through a Group Decision-Making Process. Journal of Globalization Studies, vol.3, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan T. et al. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 2013, Reynaldo Trevino and Bethania Arango aligned the ''15 Global Challenges of the Millennium Project'' with the 49 CCPs and generated actions that that shows the influence among the challenges and identifies actions for addressing the leverage points.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, R. and Arango, B. (2013) Strategic Articulation of Actions to Cope with the Huge Challenges of Our World Today, vol.1 of the monograph series A Social Systems Approach to Global Problems. Cincinnati: Ongoing Emergence Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostel and worldview integration===

The second strand was inspired by [[Leo Apostel]], and is grounded in the concern that disciplinary worldviews are becoming increasingly fragmented, thus undermining the potential for the inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary work required to address the world's pressing social, cultural and economic problems. This effort was initiated via the publication in 1994 by Apostel et al. of the book ''Worldviews: from fragmentation to integration.''&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Apostel, L., De Moor, B., Hellemans, S., Maex, E., Van Belle, H., &amp; Van der Veken, J. (1994). ''Worldviews: from fragmentation to integration.'' Brussels: VUB Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Apostel promoted this agenda by forming the Worldviews Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/dissemination/groups-archive/vzw_worldviews/&lt;/ref&gt; and founding what is now the [[Center Leo Apostel|Leo Apostel Center for Interdisciplinary Studies]] in the Free University of Brussels. The work of these units is focused on developing systematic models of the structure and nature of worldviews and using this to promote work towards a unified perspective on the world.&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., D'Hooghe, B., Pinxten, R., &amp; Wallerstein, I. (Eds.). (2011). ''Worldviews, Science And Us: Interdisciplinary Perspectives On Worlds, Cultures And Society'' - Proceedings Of The Workshop On Worlds, Cultures And Society. World Scientific Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Apostel, L., De Moor, B., Hellemans, S., Maex, E., Van Belle, H., &amp; Van der Veken, J. (1995). ''Perspectives on the World: An Interdisciplinary Reflection.'' VUB Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, C. (2008). ''Wat is een wereldbeeld?'' [What is a worldview?]. In H. Van Belle &amp; J. Van der Veken (Eds.), Nieuwheid denken. De wetenschappen en het creatieve aspect van de werkelijkheid [Novel thoughts: Science and the Creative Aspect of Reality]. Acco Uitgeverij.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midgley and systemic intervention===
The third initiative was led by [[Gerald Midgley]], and reflects concerns that developments in philosophy of language, philosophy of science and philosophy of sociology suggested that objectivity in modelling reality is an unattainable ideal, because human values condition what is included or excluded in any investigation ("content selection"), and condition how subjects of interest are delineated ("[[boundary critique]]"). The implication that it may be impossible ''in practice'' to obtain objective agreement about the nature of reality and about the "rightness" of theories inspired Midgley to develop practices for systemic interventions that could bypass these debates by focusing on the ''processes'' involved in making boundary judgements in practical situations. This supports systematic intervention practices that exploit, rather than trying to unify, the plurality of theories and methods that reflect different value-conditioned perspectives. This perspective is grounded in the recognition that values have to be overtly taken into account in a realistic systems paradigm, contrary to the mechanism that is still widely used in modelling the behavior of natural systems. The central text of this approach is Midgley's 2000 book ''Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, G. (2000) ''Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is now called [[critical systems thinking]] ("critical" in the sense of "reflective"), and is a major focus of the [[University of Hull]]'s Centre for Systems Studies, of which Midgley is the Director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.hull.ac.uk/hubs/research/centres/systems-studies.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rousseau and value realism===

The fourth development was initiated by David Rousseau, and is grounded in the concern that the value relativism dominating academic discourse is problematic for social and individual welfare, is contrary to the holistic implications of systems philosophy, and is inconsistent with universalist aspects of moral intuitions and spiritual experiences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He is promoting research towards elucidating the ontological foundations of values and normative intuitions, so as to incorporate values into Laszlo's model of the natural systems in a way that is holistic (as Apostel advocated), non-reductive (as Midgley advocates), and empirically supported (as [[William James]] advocated).&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, D. (2013) Systems Philosophy and the Unity of Knowledge, forthcoming in ''Systems Research and Behavioral Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, D. (2012). ''Could Spiritual Intuitions Map a Scientifically Plausible Ontology?'' Conference paper presented to the joint conference of the Scientific and Medical Network and the Society for Scientific Exploration, on "Mapping Time, Mind and Space", 18–21 October 2012, An Grianan Adult Education College, Termonfechin, Drogheda, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, D. (2013). ''Minds, Souls and Nature: a systems-philosophical perspective.'' Invited address to the conference of the Scientific and Medical Network on "Connecting Mind, Spirit and Nature", 19–23 February 2013, Frenchman's Cove, Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau promotes this work through the Center for Systems Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemsphilosophy.org/&lt;/ref&gt; of which he is the founder and Director, and collaborative projects with the University of Hull, where he is a Visiting Fellow in the Centre for Systems Studies and a full member of the Centre for Spirituality Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/css/css-membership/member-profiles/david-rousseau.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies in systems philosophy ==

===The relationship of systems philosophy to general system theory===

The relationship of general system theory (GST) to systems philosophy (SP) has been the subject of a technical debate within the field of systems studies.

GST was presented in 1969 by Von Bertalanffy as a theory that encapsulates "models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relationships or "forces" between them. ... It [is] a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles applying to systems in general", so that the subject matter of GST is "the derivation of those principles which are valid for "systems" in general".&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1968). ''General System Theory.'' George Braziller, pp. 32&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1970s he was seeking to broaden the term to stand for the general subject of ''systems inquiry'', arguing that ''systems science'' (which includes the Systemics and the 'classical' version of GST), ''systems technology'' and ''systems philosophy'' are "aspects" of GST that "are not separable in content but distinguishable in intention".&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy, L. von, (1976). ''General System Theory.'' Revised Edition. George Braziller, pp. xix&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is supported by modern von Bertalanffy scholars such as David Pouvreau.&lt;ref&gt;Pouvreau, D. (2013)Une histoire de la "systémologie générale" de Ludwig von Bertalanffy - Généalogie, genèse, actualisation et postérité d'un projet herméneutique. PhD thesis École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative perspective defends the original intent behind GST, and considers systems philosophy to be an endeavor that has a distinct objective from that of GST. This perspective follows the implications Ervin Laszlo laid out in his ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy'', and regards systems philosophy as following up on an implication of GST, namely that there is an organized reality underlying the phenomenal world, and that GST can guide us to towards an understanding of it which systems philosophy seeks to elucidate. From this perspective GST "is the foundation upon which we can build ... systems philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was taken up by other systems scientists such as [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], who regarded systems philosophy as one of four distinct "conceptual domains" of ''systems inquiry'' alongside ''theory'', ''methodology'' and ''application'',&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.isss.org/4domains.htm and http://isss.org/projects/systems_inquiry&lt;/ref&gt; and the systems philosopher David Rousseau, who following Laszlo reiterated that GST provides a formal model of the nature of Nature, but that an ''understanding'' of the nature of Nature requires an interpretation of GST involving concrete commitments that systems philosophy aims to provide.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, D. (2013) Systems Philosophy and the Unity of Knowledge, forthcoming in ''Systems Research and Behavioral Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pouvreau has suggested that this quandary can be resolved by the coinage of the new term "general systemology", to replace the usage of GST in the sense of the encompassing conception that the later Von Bertalanffy envisaged.&lt;ref&gt;Pouvreau, D., &amp; Drack, M. (2007). On the history of Ludwig von Bertalanffy's "General Systemology", and on its relationship to cybernetics. International Journal of General Systems, 36(3), 281–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspectivism vs. realism in systems philosophy===
An important debate in systems philosophy reflects on the nature of natural systems, and asks whether reality is really composed of objectively real systems, or whether the concept of "natural systems" merely reflects a way in which humans might regard the world in terms relative to their own concerns.

Ervin Laszlo's original conception of systems philosophy was as "a philosophy of natural systems",&lt;ref&gt;Skyttner, L. (2006). ''General Systems Theory: Problems, Perspectives, Practice'' (2nd ed.). Hackensack, NJ: World Scientific Publishing Co., p.165&lt;/ref&gt; and as such to use the systems paradigm to show how nature is organized, and how that organization gives rise to the functional properties that we find exercised in the processes in Nature. However, this was immediately problematic, because it clearly is the case that natural systems are ''open systems'', and continuously exchange matter and energy with their environment. This might make it look as if the boundary between a system and its environment is a function of the interests of the observer, and not something inherent in an actually existing system. This was taken by some to mean that system boundaries are subjective constructions, e.g., [[C. West Churchman]] argued that "boundaries are social or [[personal construct]]s that define the limits of the knowledge that is taken as pertinent in an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, G. (2000) ''Systemic Intervention: Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice''. Springer, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Ervin Laszlo acknowledged the problem without conceding to an ultimate relativism, saying "we can conceive of no radical separation between forming and being formed, and between substance and space and time…the universe is conceived as a continuum [in which] spatio-temporal events disclose themselves as "stresses" or "tensions" within the constitutive matrix…the cosmic matrix evolves in patterned flows…some flows hit upon configurations of intrinsic stability and thus survive, despite changes in their evolving environment…these we call ''systems''."&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, E. (1972). Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''. Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers, p. 292-293.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Ervin Laszlo accommodated the intrinsic continuity of the cosmos understood as a plenum while insisting that it contained real systems whose properties emerge from the inherent dynamics of the universe.

Although solving social problems means taking social norms and perspectives into account, systems philosophy proposes that these problems have a "proper" solution because they are about real systems: as [[Alexander Laszlo (scientist)|Alexander Laszlo]] pointed out, natural systems are "a complex of interacting parts that are interrelated in such a way that the interactions between them sustain a boundary-maintaining entity".&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, A., &amp; Krippner, S. (1998). Systems Theories: Their origins, foundations, and development. In J. C. Jordan (Ed.), Systems Theories and A Priori Aspects of Perception (Vol. 126, pp. 47–74). Amsterdam: North-Holland/Elsevier, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the identity of a system is maintained over time despite continuing interactions with a changing environment. Systems can be destroyed or transformed, but absent radical interactions (e.g. the fission of an atom or the death of an organism) their identity is dynamically maintained by internal ([[autopoietic]]) processes. Although we can draw the boundaries around ''conceptual'' systems in ways that serve our needs or purposes, nature has (according to systems philosophy) intrinsic ways of drawing boundaries, and if we mismatch these in our models our 'solutions' might not work very well in practice.

In this way the answer to the ''ontological'' question about natural systems (do they exist?) is made conditional on epistemological virtue considerations: systems can be argued to exist if systems practice produces positive results in the real world. This debate in systems philosophy thus parallels the wider discussion in academia about the existence of a real world and the possibility of having objective knowledge about it (see e.g. the "[[science wars]]"), in which the technological success of science is often used as an argument favoring realism over relativism or constructivism. The systemic debate is far from resolved, as indeed is the case with the wider debate about constructivism, because natural systems include ones that exhibit values, purposes, and intentionality, and it is unclear how to explain such properties given what is known about the foundational nature of natural systems. This debate is therefore connected with the ones in ''[[philosophy of mind]]'' about the grounding of consciousnesses, and in ''[[axiology]]'' about the grounding of values.

==Tantra massage==
The massage includes various techniques from different schools of [[massage]] with elements from [[yoga]], [[bioenergetics]], and  [[sexual therapy]].&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; According to the [[Tantric Massage Association]], it was developed in the 1980s by Andro Andreas Rothe, founder of Diamond Lotus Tantra Lounge, the first [[Tantra]] institute in Germany (1977).&lt;ref name=tma&gt;[http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/tantramassage.html Tantric Massage Association: The Massage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121144125/http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/tantramassage.html |date=2006-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The client or the receiver of a tantra massage is not a giver. Their duty is to receive the massage and surrender to the rediscovery of senses feelings and emotions.  The process combines the feeling of well-being associated with deep relaxation  therapeutic as people come to resolve issues related to relationship issues, self esteem issues including sexual issues.&lt;ref name=tma/&gt;&lt;ref name="vice_Ichw"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ich war bei einer Tantra-Massage und habe Sexualität abseits von Klischees kennengelernt| author = von Nadja Brenneisen| work = Vice| date = 2015-09-09| accessdate = 2015-11-20| url = https://www.vice.com/de/read/in-zuerich-bei-der-tantra-massage-184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to the Tantric Massage Association Berlin, tantra massage is based on ideas taken from the work of [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Alexander Lowen]]. Other sources of inspiration included the work of [[Mantak Chia]], Joseph Kramer &amp;ndash; who developed the "[[lingam]] massage" &amp;ndash; and [[Annie Sprinkle]], who developed the "[[yoni]] massage".&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; Andro Rothé developed Tantra Massage, Tantra Erotic Massage and the less known Yin Yang Massage.   According to the published information on their website, tantric massage does allow any kind of sexual exchange between the massagist and the recipient of the massage.

The Tantric Massage Association represents members in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name=tmaa&gt;[http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/massage-institute.html Tantric Massage Association: Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215044237/http://www.tantramassage-verband.de/en/massage-institute.html |date=2006-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German courts have made tantra massage teaching taxable. Germany has recently outlawed the term "erotic massage" for tantric massage as the term has been allocated to [[sex workers]] only.&lt;ref name="thel_Cour"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Court mulls sex tax for tantra massage| work = thelocal.de| date = 2014-07-03| accessdate = 2015-11-20| url = http://www.thelocal.de/20140703/german-court-tantra-massage-sex-tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the alleged poisoning|the [[Tito &amp; Tarantula]] album|Tarantism (album)}}
[[File:Lycosa Tarantula.jpg|thumb|''[[Lycosa tarantula]] carrying her offspring'']]
'''Tarantism''' is a form of [[hysteria|hysteric]] behaviour, popularly believed to result from the bite of the [[wolf spider]] ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' (distinct from the broad class of spiders also called [[tarantula]]s).
A better candidate cause is ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', commonly known as the Mediterranean black widow or steppe spider, although no link between such bites and the behaviour of tarantism has ever been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term historically is used to refer to a [[dancing mania]] - characteristic of southern Italy - which likely had little to do with spider bites. The  [[tarantella]] dance supposedly evolved from this [[therapy]].

==History==
It was originally described in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The condition was common in southern [[Italy]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. There were strong suggestions that there is no organic cause for the heightened excitability and [[anxiety|restlessness]] that gripped the victims. The stated belief of the time was that victims needed to engage in frenzied [[dancing]] to prevent [[death]] from tarantism. Supposedly a particular kind of dance, called the [[tarantella]], evolved from this [[therapy]]. A prime location for such outbursts was the church at [[Galatina]], particularly at the time of the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), pp. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dancing is placed under the sign of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], whose chapel serves as a "theatre" for the tarantulees' public meetings. The spider seems constantly interchangeable with Saint Paul; the female tarantulees dress as "brides of Saint Paul".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna (2006) p. 29. See Anon (1968), ''passim'', for a more detailed description of this custom.&lt;/ref&gt; As a climax, "the tarantulees, after having danced for a long time, meet together in the chapel of Saint Paul and communally attain the paroxysm of their trance, ... the general and desperate agitation was dominated by the stylised cry of the tarantulees, the 'crisis cry', an ''ahiii'' uttered with various modulations".&lt;ref&gt;Rouget (1985) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antidotum tarantulae.jpg|thumb|''Antidotum tarantulae'', a curative musical score from Athanasius Kircher (c. 1660)]]
[[Francesco Cancellieri]], in his exhaustive treatise on Tarantism, takes note of semi-scientific, literary, and popular observations, both recent and ancient, giving each similar weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cancellieri|first=Francesco|authorlink=Francesco Cancellieri|title=Lettera sopra il Tarantismo, l'aria di Roma, e della sua campagna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaVdAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes a report that in August 1693, a doctor in Naples had himself bitten by two tarantulas with six witnesses and a notary, but did not suffer the dancing illness. Cancellieri in part attributes this illness not only to the spiders but to the locale, since Tarantism was mainly seen in [[Abruzzo]], [[Apulia]], and [[Calabria]]. He states:
{{quote|Quando uno è punto da questa mal augurata bestia, si fanno cento diverse mosse in un momento. Si piange, si balla, si vomita, si trema, si ride, s'impallidisce, si grida, si sviene, si soffre gran dolore, e finalmente dopo qualche giorno si muore, se uno non è soccorso. Il sudore, e gli antidoti sollevano l'ammalato; ma il sovrano, ed unico rimedio è la Musica
When one is in the hold of this ill-wished beast, one has a hundred different feelings at a time. One cries, dances, vomits, trembles, laughs, pales, cries, faints, and one will suffer great pain, and finally after a few days, if unaided, you die. Sweat and antidotes relieve the sick, but the sovereign and the only remedy is Music.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=6}}}}

He goes on to describe some specific observations of the malady, typically afflicting peasants, alone or in groups. The malady typically affected peasants on hot summer days, causing indolence. Then he describes how only treatment through dancing music could restore them to vitality; for example:
{{quote|[...] e trovammo il misero contadino oppresso da difficile respirazione, ed osservammo inoltre, che la faccia, e le mani erano incominciate a divenir nere. E perchè il suo male era a tutti noto, si portò la Chitarra, la cui armonìa subito, che da lui fu intesa, cominciò a mover prima li piedi, poco dipoi le gambe. Si reggeva appresso sulle ginocchia. Indi a poco intervallo s'alzò passenggiando. Finalmente fra lo spazio di un quarto d'ora saltava si, che si sollevava ben tre palmi da terra. Sospirava, ma con empito sì grande, che portava terrore a' circostanti; e prima d'un'ora se gli tolse il nero dalle mani, e dal viso, riacquistando il suo natio colore.
[...] and we found the poor peasant oppressed with difficult breathing, and we observed also that the face and hands had started to be become black. And 'cause his illness was known to all, a guitar was brought, whose harmony immediately that he was understood, began first moving the feet, legs shortly afterwards. He stood on his knees. Soon after an interval he arose swaying. Finally, in the space of a quarter of an hour he was leaping, nearly three palms from the ground. Sighed, but with such great impetus, that it terrorised bystanders, and before an hour, the black was gone from his hands and face, and he regained his native colour.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=11}}}}

==Interpretation and controversy==
John Crompton proposed that ancient [[Bacchanalia|Bacchanalian rites]] that had been suppressed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton (1954), p. 56f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of tarantism is consistent with [[mass psychogenic illness]].

Although the popular belief persists that tarantism results from a spider bite, it remains scientifically unsubstantiated. Donaldson, Cavanagh, and Rankin (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the actual cause or causes of tarantism remain unknown.

==Cultural references==
Many historical and cultural references are associated with this disease and the ensuing "cure" - the [[tarantella]]. It is, for example, a key image in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and the spell "Tarantallegra" from the [[Harry Potter]] series.{{fact|date=May 2014}} It was also mentioned in the novel 39 Clues: Superspecial Outbreak.

'''''The Myth of God Incarnate''''' is a book edited by [[John Hick]] and published by [[SCM Press]] in 1977. [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], in a 1980 [[literature review]] of academic work on the [[incarnation]], noted the "...well-publicized symposium entitled ''The Myth of God Incarnate'', including contributions on the [[New Testament|NT]] from M. Goulder and F. Young, which provoked several responses."&lt;ref&gt;Dunn (1980): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in another literature review, [[R. T. France]] commented that "theology dropped out of the headlines again, until in 1977 the title, if not the contents, of ''The Myth of God Incarnate'' revived public interest".&lt;ref&gt;France (1981): 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 2005 obituary for contributor [[Maurice Wiles]] (father of [[Andrew Wiles]]) described the book as "a highly controversial volume of essays."&lt;ref&gt;
"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1491502/The-Rev-Professor-Maurice-Wiles.html The Rev Professor Maurice Wiles]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
The controversy prompted a sequel, ''Incarnation and Myth: the Debate Continued'' (1979), edited by [[Michael Goulder]], another contributor to the original volume.

In the preface to the book, the contributors start by describing their "clear" perception that Christianity has always been a changing and diverse "movement"&lt;ref name=Hick-ix&gt;Hick (1977): ix.&lt;/ref&gt; quoting [[T. S. Eliot]]—"Christianity is always adapting itself into something which can be believed." They also explain that they are "convinced" that growing knowledge of Christian origins leads to accepting that Jesus was ... 'a man approved by God' for a special role within the divine purpose," but that later Christian conceptions of him "as God incarnate, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity" were a "mythological or poetic way of expressing his significance for us."&lt;ref name=Hick-ix/&gt; The contributors also mention that: "we have met together for discussion five times during the last three years, and we now offer the results in the hope that they will stimulate a wider discussion both inside and outside the churches."&lt;ref name="Hick-xi"/&gt;

== Overview ==

The contributors to Hick's collection of essays divided their work into two sections: the first examining "Christian sources"; and the second examining "the development of doctrine."&lt;ref name=Hick-xi&gt;Hick (1977): xi.&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface, however, they note that this division is not absolute, since sources and contemporary issues are related, and discussion of either references the other.&lt;ref name=Hick-xi/&gt;

== Christianity without Incarnation? ==

Maurice Wiles' 10-page introductory chapter to the volume questions whether "the incarnation of God in the particular individual Jesus of Nazareth" is actually essential to Christianity,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1&gt;Wiles (1977): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether there can be "a Christianity without (in this sense) incarnation?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt; He structures his essay in three numbered parts, each of which is a subquestion. Wiles' subquestions explore whether his main question "is (1) a proper, (2) a necessary and (3) a constructive question to ask."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt;

=== A proper question? ===

Regarding his first subquestion, Wiles addresses the "many ears" he expects might find ''Christianity'' and ''incarnation'' "so nearly synonymous that the suggestion of a possible 'Christianity without incarnation' will sound to them equally paradoxical and unintelligible."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt; He explains that ''incarnation'', in the sense in which he is using the term, is just one "interpretation of the significance of Jesus."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2&gt;Wiles (1977): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles provides three analogies from other Christian thinking to illustrate his meaning: the [[eucharist]], the relationship between the authority and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy of the Bible]], and the relationship between incarnation and the [[virgin birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; In each case, abstract doctrines have been so associated with concrete applications, that denials of the concrete applications have historically been seen as denials of the abstract doctrines, hence heresies.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; However, with the eucharist in particular, [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians affirmed a meaningful understanding of the eucharist, despite denying the concrete application of [[transubstantiation]]—that bread and wine physically become the body and blood of Jesus in the Roman Catholic [[mass (liturgy)|mass]].&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; Wiles concludes that his main question (regarding Christianity without incarnation) is not a contradiction but a proper question, just like the Reformation question regarding a eucharist without transubstantiation.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3&gt;Wiles (1977): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A necessary question? ===

Wiles offers, under three subheadings, three lines of argument in support of his position that "separating 'Christianity' and 'incarnation' is not merely ... admissible ... but ... inescapable."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3/&gt; According to Wiles, the question of separation is a necessary question arising from: (a) the origins, (b) the history, and (c) contemporary affirmation of incarnational doctrine.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3/&gt; Regarding (a) origins, Wiles contends that, "Incarnation, in its proper sense, is not something directly presented in scripture. It is a construction ..." He acknowledges that New Testament (NT) writers "talk of [Jesus] as God's pre-existent Son come down to earth."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4&gt;Wiles (1997): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wiles' views this as a [[figure of speech|manner of speech]] ("one of a number of ways in which Christians thought and spoke of Jesus.").&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; He proposes that it is no longer reasonable, to "the main body even of convinced believers",&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; to speak in such terms as the NT writers, which presume what moderns do not, namely "supernatural divine intervention ... as a natural category of thought and faith."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt;

Wiles offers an additional argument for the necessity of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, by expressing dissatisfaction with the intelligibility of (b) historical formulations of incarnational doctrine: "Are we sure that the concept of an incarnate being, one who is both fully God and fully man, is after all an intelligible concept?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-5&gt;Wiles (1997): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he concedes that "negative generalizations are notoriously dangerous claims to make,"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; he ventures that "the church has never succeeded in offering a consistent or convincing picture" of how Jesus could actually be both God and man.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; In particular he suggests a tendency to err in favour of Jesus as divine,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; citing the seventh century [[Monothelitism|Monothelite]] controversy and [[Eric Lionel Mascall|E. L. Mascall]] as a distinguished exemplar of the traditional view writing at the time Wiles' essay was published.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-5/&gt; Wiles concludes his grounds for the necessity of his main question by further appeal to (c) the writing of his own contemporaries. He notes that ''incarnation'', as understood in the work of [[John Austin Baker|John Baker]], for example, is so far removed from the original NT usage, that "it is not genuinely the same idea that is being expressed." Wiles quotes Baker: "Jesus did not see himself ... as a divine pre-existent being from heaven."&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Baker (1970): 242; quoted in Wiles (1997): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A constructive question? ===

To conclude his analysis of the value of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, Wiles anticipates that "some people" might "feel" that were such questioning to "lead to the abandonment of traditional incarnational doctrine, that could only be regarded as an entirely negative and destructive outcome."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-6&gt;Wiles (1997): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; To help allay such fears, Wiles offers three ideas, historically highly valued in Christian traditions and associated with the incarnation but, he argues, are "not necessarily bound to the incarnation and would not therefore be eliminated from a 'Christianity without incarnation'.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7&gt;Wiles (1997): 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The first idea, listed as (a), is "the conviction that the physical world can be the carrier of spiritual value." Wiles notes that this [[Dualistic cosmology|anti-dualist]] position within Christianity, denying strict separation between the spiritual and the physical, is shared with [[Judaism]], which clearly has no doctrine of Jesus as God incarnate.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; Wiles clarifies that he is proposing a Christianity that retains a genuine broad sense of incarnation of spirituality, especially in its doctrine of creation,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; just without applying this too strictly to the person of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt;

The second idea, listed as (b), is "the significance of Jesus as a model for human life."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8&gt;Wiles (1997): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles observes that there has been considerable diversity in what people have considered to be lives patterned on Jesus as the standard;&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; and that even the NT does not provide a comprehensive picture of just precisely how Jesus lived his entire life. He quotes [[Robert Lightfoot (priest)|R. H. Lightfoot]], who famously declared, "the form of the earthly no less than of the heavenly Christ is for the most part hidden from us."&lt;ref name=Lightfoot&gt;Lightfoot (1935): 225; quoted in Wiles (1997): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Even given these limitations, Wiles reflects that "on any showing to which the name of Christian could conceivably be given [Jesus'] life would remain of substantial importance to us."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; So, Wiles suggests, Jesus' significance as a role-model "is not directly affected by the way in which his relationship to God is understood."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt;

Before concluding his essay, Wiles considers what he believes to be the most important traditional incarnation-related idea, transformed but retained under his new understanding. Listed as (c), it is the view that in Jesus, "God has acted decisively for the salvation of the world."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; He anticipates the objection that his transformation would "imply that the worship of Christ, traditional throughout the whole of Christian history, was idolatrous in character."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; He acknowledges that "It is at this point that the greatest difficulties are likely to be felt. Can they be met?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; Although he provides no conclusive answer, Wiles stresses that his new understanding of incarnation could still provide for Jesus to "remain a personal focus of the transforming power of God in the world."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-9&gt;Wiles (1997): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''transition town''', '''transition initiative''' and '''transition model''' refer to [[grassroots|grassroot]] [[community project]]s that aim to increase  self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of [[peak oil]],{{r|WithoutOil}} [[climate destruction]], and economic instability.{{r|guardian13}} The '''Transition Network''', founded in 2006, inspired the creation of many of the projects. A number of the groups are officially registered with the Transition Network.{{r|what}} The first initiative to use the name was Transition Town Totnes, located in the United Kingdom. Transition initiatives have been started in locations around the world, with many located in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Australia.&lt;ref name=guardian13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives/map|title=Transition Initiatives Map - Transition Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term, "transition town" was coined by Louise Rooney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localplanet.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=49|title=The Local Planet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catherine Dunne.

The transition model can be applied to different types of places where people live, such as villages, regions, islands and towns. The generic term is "transition initiative", which includes transition neighborhoods, communities, and cities, although "transition town" is in common usage.&lt;ref name="12Ingredients" /&gt;

== History ==

===From Kinsale to Totnes===
[[Image:Totnes High Street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Totnes]], [[Devon]], England: a transition town]]
In 2004, [[permaculture]] designer [[Rob Hopkins]] set his students at [[Kinsale]] Further Education College the task of applying permaculture principles to the concept of [[peak oil]]. The output of this student project was the ‘Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan'.&lt;ref name=KinsaleEDAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinsale 2021 An Energy Descent Action Plan – Version.1. 2005|url=http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/KinsaleEnergyDescentActionPlan.pdf|publisher=Kinsale Further Education College|accessdate=16 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316182454/http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/KinsaleEnergyDescentActionPlan.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This looked at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of energy production, health, education, economy and agriculture as a "road map" to a sustainable future for the town. Two of his students, Louise Rooney and Catherine Dunne, developed the ''Transition towns'' concept.  They then presented their ideas to Kinsale Town Council. The councilors decided to adopt the plan and work towards energy independence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Hopkins moved to his hometown of [[Totnes]], [[England]], where he and Naresh Giangrande developed these concepts into the transition model.  In 2006 Transition Town Totnes become the first Transition initiative.&lt;ref name=TodayTotnes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transition movement: Today Totnes... tomorrow the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/the-transition-movement-today-totnes-tomorrow-the-world-2364355.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition Network founded===
[[File:Rob Hopkins, Transition Network.webm|thumb|[[Permaculture]] designer [[Rob Hopkins]] in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]] about Transition Towns.]]
Between late 2006 and early 2007 the Transition Network UK charity was co-founded by [[permaculture]] educator Rob Hopkins, Peter Lipman and Ben Brangwyn. Totnes based, it was initiated to support the Transition initiatives emerging around the world. It trains and supports people involved with the initiatives. It also disseminates the concepts of transition towns.&lt;ref name=AboutTN /&gt;

===2008 to present day===
In 2008, the number of communities involved in the project had increased with many localities in the process of becoming "official" Transition towns.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_358524"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/358524 |title=Money for climate project |date=10 April 2008 |work=[[The Nelson Mail]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative spread and by May 2010 there were over 400 community initiatives recognized as official Transition towns in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], [[Italy]] and [[Chile]]. The term ''transition initiatives'' became common to reflect the range and type of communities involved - e.g. villages ([[Kinsale#Transition towns|Kinsale]]), neighbourhoods of cities ([[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]], Edinburgh), through council districts ([[Penwith]]) to cities and city boroughs ([[Brixton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Portobello&gt;{{cite web|title=About PEDAL|url=http://www.pedal-porty.org.uk/what-is-pedal/|publisher=Portobello Transition Town|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 2013, there were 1130 initiatives registered (462 Official, 654 Muller) in 43 countries.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Influences include [[permaculture]] concepts as described in [[Bill Mollison]]’s ''Permaculture, a Designers Manual (1988)'' and [[David Holmgren]]’s ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability (2003),''&lt;ref name=Permaculture&gt;{{cite web|title=Permaculture |url=http://www.transitiontownashland.org/Permaculture.html |publisher=Transition Town Ashland |accessdate=16 March 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204110334/http://www.transitiontownashland.org/Permaculture.html |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[David Fleming (writer)|David Fleming]]'s work on community, culture and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/700941/dr_david_fleming_a_tribute.html David Fleming obituary in ''The Ecologist'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Each transition town or initiative has a high level of [[autonomy]]. However, to be called an official initiative certain criteria must be met. Additionally, there is nothing to stop an 'unofficial' initiative using ideas inspired by Transition towns. Further, there are various 'hubs' to co-ordinate work at a regional level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Transition Network===
The Transition Network (TN) is a UK charity set up to support Transition initiatives. It has published books and films, trained people and facilitated [[social network|networking]].&lt;ref name=AboutTN /&gt; The TN's website contains a listing of the initiatives that have registered, some of which are officially recognised.&lt;ref name=dir /&gt;

Some of the material has been translated and adapted to other languages/cultures, including [[:pt:Cidades em Transição|Portuguese]], Danish, [[:de:Transition Towns|German]], Dutch, Spanish, [[:fr:Ville en transition|French]], Hungarian, [[:it:Città di transizione|Italian]], Japanese and Irish.&lt;ref name=trans /&gt;

TN has run seven conferences: Nailsworth (2007), Royal Agriculture College, Cirencester (2008), Battersea Arts Centre (2009), Dame Hannah's at Seale Hayne (2010), Hope University, Liverpool (2011), Battersea Arts Centre (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transitionnetwork.org/blogs/rob-hopkins/2012-09-19/write-2012-transition-network-conference-best-yet|title=A write-up of the 2012 Transition Network conference.

===Transition US===
In the United States, transition initiatives have been started in many communities. Transition US is the national hub. Its stated vision ''"that every community in the United States will have engaged its collective creativity to unleash an extraordinary and historic transition to a future beyond fossil fuels; a future that is more vibrant, abundant and resilient; one that is ultimately preferable to the present"''.&lt;ref name=OurStory&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://transitionus.org/our-story|publisher=Transition US|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transition US is a resource and catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy, climate, or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process. They are accomplishing this mission by inspiring, encouraging, supporting, networking and training individuals and their communities as they consider, adopt, adapt, and implement the transition approach to community empowerment and change.&lt;ref name=TransitionUS&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://transitionus.org/about-us|publisher=Transition US|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of state sites have also been set up using the [[Ning (website)|Ning social networking platform]]. These state sites, under the umbrella of a national Ning site, were set up to help facilitate, network, inform, monitor, and house regional and organizational transition initiatives.  Thus, furthering the spread of the transition movement while networking related organizations, projects, ideas and activities. In addition, many transition initiatives can be found on the [[WiserEarth]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/group/search?phrase=transition|title=Transition Initiative Groups on WiserEarth.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance for new groups===
Some projects use the TN's guide the '12 ingredients', or the 'revised ingredients', when setting up their group.&lt;ref name=12Ingredients&gt;{{cite web|title=12 Ingredients|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/support/12-ingredients|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingredients&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingredients|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/ingredients|publisher=Transition Network|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Transition Network (TN) promotes awareness of sustainable living and building local [[Resilience (ecology)|ecological resilience]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Peak oil and local resilience===
''The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resiliency'' by Rob Hopkins provides much of the framework behind the Transition Initiative and outlines ways for local Transition Towns to get involved.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;

===Transportation===
Communities are encouraged to seek out methods for reducing energy usage as well as reducing their reliance on long supply chains that are totally dependent on fossil fuels for essential items (see [[Sustainable transport#Environmental calculator of the French environment and energy agency|environmental calculator]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Food production===
Food is a key area for transition, sometimes the slogan "Food feet, not [[food miles]]" is used. Initiatives so far have included creating [[community garden]]s or replacing ornamental tree plantings with fruit or nut trees, to grow food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Pamela|last2=Dobson|first2=Joanna|title=Plant Veg, Grow a Revolution!|date=May 26, 2014|publisher=Matador Publishing|isbn=1783064870|pages=200|url=https://www.amazon.com/Incredible-Plant-Veg-Grow-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00KLL9DUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467768036&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=plant+veg%2C+dobson#nav-subnav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste and recycling===
Business waste exchange seeks to match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material, sometimes referred to as [[industrial symbiosis]]. This process can help companies increase profitability by reducing raw material and waste disposal cost, reducing carbon emission,  making their byproducts a source of revenue to be bought by other business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/industrial-waste-account-to-boost-industrial-symbiosis#gsc.tab=0|title=Industrial waste account to boost industrial symbiosis {{!}} Yale Environment Review|website=environment.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/what-industrial-symbiosis|title=What is industrial symbiosis? {{!}} WRAP UK|date=2013-03-15|website=www.wrap.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=Requires reference to link industrial symbiosis to Transition towns}}  Repairing old items rather than throwing them away is looked at.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Psychology===
The Transition Network proposes an alternative from business as usual, or from 'shocked/doomladen' reactions to [[peak oil]] and an end to unlimited economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104427/http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/who_we_are_high.pdf Who we are and what we do] by Rob Hopkins and Peter Lipman. Transition Network. February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Southend-on-Sea in Transition, ''"...by shifting our mind-set we can actually recognise the coming post-cheap oil era as an opportunity rather than a threat, and design the future low carbon age to be thriving, resilient and abundant — somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed, war and the myth of perpetual growth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitionwestcliff.org.uk/ |title=LIFE BEYOND OIL – THREAT OR OPPORTUNITY? |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818022056/http://www.transitionwestcliff.org.uk/ |archivedate=August 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of the Transition Network is acknowledging the emotional impact of changing to a low energy world. Some Transition Network groups have 'Heart and Soul' groups to look at this aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/groups/inner-transition/|title=Inner Transition|publisher=Transition Town Totnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedirt.org/node/3702 |title=Heart and Soul Transition PDX Working Group Meeting #3 - The Dirt! |date=14 November 2010 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114044157/http://www.thedirt.org/node/3702 |archivedate=November 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy descent action plans (EDAP)===
An important aim for Transition towns is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. One way to further this goal is for the community to develop an EDAP. The term "community" in this context includes local people, local institutions, local agencies and the local council.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The first comprehensive plan was created for Totnes in 2010, entitled ''Transition in Action: Totnes &amp; District 2030''.&lt;ref name=edap /&gt;

In [[France]], where the movement is called ''Villes et Territoires en Transition'', the [[association négaWatt]] provides a theoretical support to the transition movement.&lt;ref name=watt /&gt;

===Economics===
As of 2010, the Transition Network (TN) includes the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 global financial crisis]] as further threat to local communities, alongside peak oil and climate change. To counter economic instability, the TN promotes [[fiscal localism]].&lt;ref name="LocalFood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LocalMoney" /&gt; To help further these aims TN setup up the REconomy Project circa 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reconomy.org/finally-its-here-the-reconomy-website-goes-live/|title=Finally! It’s here! The REconomy website goes live! - REconomy|author=|date=29 May 2012|website=reconomy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods===
While the focus and aims remain the same, the methods used to achieve these vary. For example, Totnes has introduced its own [[local currency]], the [[Totnes pound]], which is redeemable in local shops and businesses, helping to reduce "food miles" while also supporting local firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/6692755.stm |title=Town poised for its own currency |author=Morris, Jonathan |date=4 June 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is also planned{{who|date=May 2014}} to be introduced in three [[Wales|Welsh]] transition towns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7326212.stm |title=Towns banking their own currency |date=2 April 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Maleny]] [[Australia]], the Baroon Dollar as a part of a regional transition towns project.&lt;ref name="ABC_AU_1709534"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-06-10/money-worries-town-prints-its-own/1709534 |title=Money worries: town prints its own |date=10 June 2009 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Transition towns have been featured in the plot line of the long-running [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[The Archers]]''. This is an example of mainstream media attention the movement received a few years after being founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/transition.shtml |title=BBC - Radio 4 - Archers - The Archers - Transition Ambridge |date=30 December 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230203017/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/transition.shtml |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===

The word '''Type''' followed by a number is a common way to name a weapon or product in a production series, similar in meaning to "[[Mark (designation)|Mark]]". "Type" was used extensively by the Japanese and Chinese militaries beginning in the 1920s, and is still in current use by the militaries of both nations. The United Kingdom uses a '''type number system''' for much of their military equipment. Many other nations use the word "Type" to designate products in a series.

==Japan==
The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) began using the Type-Number System in 1921 to designate aircraft accepted for production. The numbers used after the word "Type" were based on the number of years that the [[Emperor Taishō]] had reigned. Since his reign began in 1912, an aircraft ordered into production in 1921 would have been called "Type 10", the tenth year of the emperor's reign. At the end of 1926, the emperor died, leaving his son [[Hirohito]] as the Emperor Shōwa, and the numbering system was reset to mark the new emperor's reign.&lt;ref name=Peattie&gt;{{cite book

In 1929, the government of Japan adopted a new system based on the [[Japanese_era_name#Imperial_year|imperial year]].&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt; Aircraft ordered for production from 1929 onward were assigned the last two digits of the year marking the continuity of Japanese emperors. 1929 was the 2589th imperial year, so aircraft ordered that year were designated "Type 89". 1940 was the 2600th year, and the IJN numbering system was reset to single digits. New aircraft were designated [[0 (number)|0 (zero)]]. The well-known Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the IJN "Type 0 Carrier Fighter" (''Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki'', 零式艦上戦闘機), and was popularly called the "Zero" because of its type.&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt;

In 1943, the designation system was abandoned by the IJN as it was considered too revealing about the nature of the aircraft. In its place, the aircraft were named with popular terms such as ''Kyōfū'' (強風 "Strong Wind") for the [[Kawanishi N1K]] introduced in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred T. Jane|Jane, Frederick Thomas]]. ''Jane's all the world's aircraft, Volume 34'', p. 155c, Jane's Information Group, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) began using the Type designation system in 1927, for all weapons, vehicles, military equipment, subassemblies and subsystems such as engines and gunmounts. In 1940, instead of resetting to zero, the IJA assigned "Type 100" to equipment put into production that year. In 1941, the IJA reset to "Type 1". Unlike the IJN, the IJA continued to use the system through 1945 with the production of the [[Kawasaki Ki-100]] Army Type 5 Fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, J. (2008) History of War. [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_japanese_army_aircraft_designations.html ''Japanese Army Air Force Designations of the Second World War''.] Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, Japan's military changed to a numbering system based on the Japanese fiscal year which begins on April 1 in the same manner as the British fiscal year. As an example, "Type 63" was the designation for equipment such as the [[Type 63 AT mine]] accepted in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xl, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kanji]] character ''shiki'' (式) is what the Japanese use to designate products in a series. The [[English language]] translation of ''shiki'' has been variously given as "model" or "type".&lt;ref name=Easterly&gt;Easterly, William M. P. (June 2009) [http://www.dragonsoffire.com/ARTICLE:--MODEL---TYPE.php ''Dragons of Fire'', "Model/Type"]. Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some manuals and texts have translated ''shiki'' as both "model" and "type" within the same publication, confusing the matter. [[World War II]]-era military dictionaries do not give ''shiki'' as the Japanese word for "model"—instead, the kanji character ''kata'' is given. In turn, ''kata'' (型 or 形) is translated as "form", "type", "pattern", "mark", or "model". The only [[Japanese language]] translation given for the English word "type" is ''shiki''.&lt;ref name=Easterly/&gt;

==China==
Chinese weapons and military vehicles are often, but not always, designated according to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the one used by most nations. Two digits are used to designate the year. The two digits appear first, followed by the character ''shi'', meaning "type".&lt;ref&gt;Blasko, Dennis J. ''The Chinese Army today: tradition and transformation for the 21st century'', p. 122. Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|0-415-77003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, in 1956, the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] was put into production, and the [[Type 64 pistol]] was designed and approved in 1964.

==United Kingdom==
The [[Royal Navy]] uses a type number system where blocks of numbers are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, the block 900–999 was given to naval radar sets beginning in 1945 and continuing for roughly 20 years. Numbers are not always sequential, as the Type 992 target indication radar was developed long before the Type 967 target designation radar. When a reserved block has been fully utilized, another is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xli, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">'''Vaginal photoplethysmography''' ('''VPG''', '''VPP''') is a [[photoplethysmogram|technique using light]] to measure the [[vasocongestion|amount of blood]] in the walls of the [[vagina]].  The device that is used is called a vaginal [[photometer]].

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman's [[sexual arousal]]. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women's self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010| title = Agreement of Self-Reported and Genital Measures of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 5–56 | pmc=2811244 | pmid=20049519 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9556-9 |vauthors=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Lalumière ML, Laan E, Grimbos T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal [[photometer]]. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a [[photocell]], which senses reflected light.  The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt; 

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The [[direct current]] signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the [[vagina|vaginal tissues]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;Hatch, J. P. [“Vaginal photoplethysmography: Methodological considerations”],”Archives of Sexual Behavior, 8, 357–374”, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=February 2018}} The [[alternating current]] signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the [[blood vessel]]s of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Hatch" /&gt; While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Laan, E., Everaerd, W., &amp; Evers, A. [http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/21166/21166.PDF?sequence=1 “Assessment of female sexual arousal: Response specificity and construct validity”], “Psychophysiology, 32, 476–485”, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} 
 
VPA is defined as the [[amplitude|peak-to-trough amplitude]] of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Berovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a [[speculum (medical)|gynecological speculum]] and recorded vaginal pulse waves.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jannsen|first1=Erick|last2=Prause|first2=Nicole|last3=Geer|first3=James H.|editor1-last=Cacioppo|editor1-first=John T.|editor2-last=Tassinary|editor2-first=Louis G.|editor3-last=Berntson|editor3-first=Gary|title=Handbook of Psychophysiology|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139461931|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Psychophysiology.html?id=E7hRKwVBXb4C|language=en|chapter=Chapter 11: The Sexual Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molenkamp|first1=Bert|title=SexLab - Equipment &amp; Instruments - Vaginal Photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/ei-vp-uvaprobe.html|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palti, Y. &amp; Bercovici, B.

'''Vaginal rugae''' are structures of the vagina that are transverse ridges formed out of the supporting tissues and [[vaginal epithelium]] in females.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rugae+of+vagina|title=Rugae of vagina|last=|first=|date=|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some conditions can cause the disappearance of vaginal rugae and are usually associated with childbirth and prolapse of pelvic structures. The rugae contribute to the resiliency and elasticity of the vagina and its ability to distend and return to its (nearly) previous state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blausen.com/en/video/stratified-squamous-epithelium-vaginal-lining-and-rugae/|title=Stratified Squamous Epithelium: Vaginal Lining and Rugae|website=blausen.com|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5s7jDVQkCfoC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Anatomy: An Illustrated Review with Questions and Explanations|last=Snell|first=Richard S.|date=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781743167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQZhs4PwrYC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas|last=Heger|first=Astrid M.|last2=Emans|first2=S.

The shape and structure of the rugae are supported maintained by the [[lamina propria]] of the vagina and the anterior and posterior rugae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~anatomy/Histo/lab_6/female/DMS184/popup.html|title=Vaginal epithelium|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dartmouth.edu|publisher=Dartmouth College|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior and posterior columnae rugae are transverse vaginal support structures between which the transverse rugae exist. The cross section of the vagina normally forms a shape that resembles the letter 'H' due to these structures.&lt;ref name="Hafez"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8DxCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Atlas of Human Reproduction: By Scanning Electron Microscopy|last=Hafez|first=E.

== Development ==
The appearance and presence of vaginal rugae change over the life span of females and are associated with hormonal cycles, [[estrogens]], childbirth, puberty and menopause. During gynecological examination of [[prepubescent]] girls, rugae can be visualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugar|first=Naomi|last2=Graham|first2=Elinor|date=2006|title=Common Gynecologic Problems in Prepubertal Girls|url=https://depts.washington.edu/hcsats/cd/march2008/Articles/Sugar%20Graham%20Common%20Problems%20in%20Prepubertal%20Gyn.pdf|journal=Pediatrics in Review|volume=27|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vaginal rugae change after [[menopause]]. In some older women the rugae are present but become flattened and difficult to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6q94qWGkRoC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Ostergard's Urogynecology and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction|last=Bent|first=Alfred E.|last2=Cundiff|first2=Geoffrey W.|last3=Swift|first3=Steven E.|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781770958|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, the rugae tend to disappear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Clinical considerations ==
Other structures can be present on the vaginal wall though most of the time these can be differentiated from rugae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Vaginal cysts]] can be small protrusions into the vagina that can be felt or palpated by a clinician.

== Childbirth ==
Vaginal rugae can disappear during the second stage of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KknXFtQr5O4C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Multidisciplinary Management of Female Pelvic Floor Disorders|last=Chapple|first=Christopher R.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0443072728|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a vaginal birth the rugae are not visible and the walls of the vagina are smooth. By the third week postpartum the vagina has become much smaller and the rugae begin to reform on the vaginal walls. Six weeks after birth, the rugae have returned to approximately the same size as they were before the birth. The number of rugae after childbirth decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmTJ5Qbql6UC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women's Health|last=O'Connor|first=Vivienne|last2=Kovacs|first2=Gabor|date=2003-10-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521818933|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those women who have not given birth, the rugae are more prominent than in those who have given birth multiple times.&lt;ref name="Hafez"/&gt;

'''Women in music education''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women musicians, conductors, teachers and educational administrators]] in [[music education]] at the [[elementary school]] and [[secondary education]] levels. While [[music critic]]s argued in the 1880s that "...women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

The '''Zimmerwald Observatory''' ({{lang-de|'''Observatorium Zimmerwald'''}}) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] owned and operated by the AIUB, the Astronomical Institute of the [[University of Bern]]. Built in 1956, it is located at [[Zimmerwald]], 10 kilometers south of [[Bern]], Switzerland.

Numerous [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s have been discovered by [[Paul Wild (Swiss astronomer)|Paul Wild]] (1925–2014) at Zimmerwald Observatory, most notably comet [[81P/Wild]], which was visited by NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust space probe]] in 2004. The [[main belt]] asteroid [[1775 Zimmerwald]] has been named after the location of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=1775 Zimmerwald (1969 JA) |work=[[JPL]] – Small-Body Database Browser |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1-meter aperture ZIMLAT telescope was inaugurated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ZIMLAT Telescope |url=http://cmslive3.unibe.ch/unibe/philnat/aiub/content/zimmerwald/the_zimlat_telescope/index_eng.html |work=Universität Bern, Astronomisches Institut, Zimmerwald Observatory |date=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
