[[Image:Galleria borbonica - War refuge (Naples).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The tunnel.]]
The '''Bourbon Tunnel''', '''Tunnel Borbonico''' or '''Bourbon Gallery''' is an ancient underground passage, constructed for military purposes to connect the [[Royal Palace of Naples|Royal Palace]] to military barracks in [[Naples]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The monarchy in the era of King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II of Bourbon]] was fearful of the revolution-prone populace of Naples. Errico Alvino was commissioned to construct a military passage for troops connecting the [[Royal Palace of Naples]] to Via Morelli, boring underneath the hill of Pizzofalcone and reaching the quartiere San Ferdinando, but also connecting to other underground tunnels and aqueducts, including the old Carmignano aqueduct (1627–1629). The monarchy would also not have been ignorant that the [[Rodrigo Ponce de León, 4th Duke of Arcos|Viceroy of Naples]] in 1647 had nearly been trapped in this urban Royal Palace, and only by luck was able to flee to a nearby Convent to escape angry crowds during the Revolt of [[Masaniello]], thus the tunnel could also serve as an escape route for its royal inhabitants.

Two years after it was begun, the fall of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon dynasty]] led construction to halt. During the [[Second World War]], the tunnel was used as a shelter during bombardments. Presently the tunnels are open for tours, and share with [[Catacombs of San Gennaro|Catacombs of Naples]] the urge to go underground, and with much of Neapolitan constructions, a kinship with decay and fruitless architecture in Naples. The tunnel contains decades of debris, including vintage cars and a discarded fascist monument that had been made for [[Aurelio Padovani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoliunplugged.com/the-bourbon-tunnel.html |title=The Bourbon Tunnel |last=Ewles-Bergeron |first=Penny  |date=February 13, 2012 |website=Napoli Unplugged |publisher= |accessdate=December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilmattino.it/articolo.php?id=94641&amp;sez=NAPOLI |title=Napoli, le statue fasciste ritrovate Ecco com'era il "Colosso di Chiaia" |last= |first=  |date=March 14, 2010 |website=[[Il Mattino]] |publisher= |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2353">The '''''Broderzinger''''' or '''Broder singers''', from [[Brody]] in [[Ukraine]], were [[Jew]]ish itinerant performers in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Romania]], and [[Russia]], professional or semiprofessional songwriters and performers,&lt;ref name=yivo&gt;http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=2195 YIVO encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; who from at least the early 19th century sang and danced, often in comic disguises, and who performed short one-act plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19780.html Jewish virtual library&lt;/ref&gt; They were often ''[[badchen|badchonim]]'' (traditional wedding entertainers) and meshorerim (singers in cantors' choirs).&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; They were among the first to publicly perform [[Yiddish]]-language songs outside of [[Purim]] plays and wedding parties, and were an important precursor to [[Yiddish theatre]]. They erected miniature stages and entertained customers in taverns, wine cellars, and restaurant gardens.&lt;ref name=zalmen&gt;Zalmen Zylbercweig, ''Leksikon fun Yidishn teater'', Book one, pp. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written records of the Broder singers are the remarks of Jews passing through Brody, which was a trading center on a major route of travel ("a stopping point on the travels of Russian Jewish merchants to and from the Leipzig fair."&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;). These records are generally disapproving of the singing of songs when no religious occasion called for music.

Later the term Broder Singer was applied to performers who had no connection with Brody.

Among the most famous Broder singers were Berl Margulis - better known as [[Berl Broder]] (1815&amp;ndash;1868) - and Moyshe Prizament and his son [[Shloyme Prizament]]. Some of Berl Broder's original songs, along with the works of his son and grandson who continued the tradition of secular Yiddish writing, can be found in his grandson Ber Margulies' book [https://archive.org/details/nybc207372 Dray doyres̀ lider fun Berl Broder (Margulies), feliṭonen fun Yom Hatsyoni (Yitsḥaḳ Margulies), poemen un lider fun Ber Margulies (1957)] (free online download from the Yiddish Book Center).

'''Cape Verde–People's Republic of China relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The two states established [[bilateral relations]] in April 1976, shortly after Cape Verde gained independence from the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Cape Verde is an adherent to PR China's [[One China Policy]]. China maintained relations with Cape Verde throughout from 1970s to mid-1990s mainly to prevent the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) from gaining Cape Verde's international recognition through [[checkbook diplomacy]]. However, in the mid-1990s, a number of Chinese capitalists began investing in the island nation and relations grew during the 2000s as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/blog/china-cape-verde-dragon%E2%80%99s-african-paradise China in Cape Verde: the Dragon’s African Paradise] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209172038/http://csis.org/blog/china-cape-verde-dragon%E2%80%99s-african-paradise |date=February 9, 2010 }} CSIS by Loro Horta&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">Founded in 1964, '''Chari Jazz''' was the first modern [[Chad]] musical group.  

Chari Jazz was preceded by 1962 creation in [[N'Djamena]] (then Fort-Lamy) of [[Tchad succès]], a band composed mainly of [[Cameroon]]ian and Congolese musicians, though including [[Bar Kossi]].  Musician [[Naimou Mbaitoloum]] was joined by his friends from [[Sarh]] (then Fort-Archambault), forming the band '''Star Jazz''' in 1964.  The poorly equipped Star Jazz was sponsored by President [[François Tombalbaye]], who further changed its name to Chari Jazz. (Sarh was located in the [[Moyen-Chari Prefecture]].)  Tombalbaye sent Chari Jazz to [[Zaire]] to learn from [[Francois Luambo Makiadi]] and [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://maziki.free.fr/necrologie.htm Décès du Chanteur Centrafricain Malao Hénécy le lundi 22 mai 2006 à Libreville suite à une longue maladie."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013024459/http://maziki.free.fr/necrologie.htm |date=October 13, 2005 }}, maziki.free.fr {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; under whom it gathered members Kossi, [[Kemtchang Daniel]], [[Adoum Fremouss]]&lt;ref name=identity&gt;[http://www.cefod.org/Tchad%20et%20Culture/Tc214/art%20tchadien%201.htm "La musique recherche son identité"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030518154037/http://www.cefod.org/Tchad+et+Culture/Tc214/art+tchadien+1.htm |date=2003-05-18 }}, cefod.org {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alladoumbaye Béyamra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cefod.org/Revue%202003.2004/revuepresse10.htm "Revue de presse chaddiene"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, week of 1-8 December 2003, cefod.org {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon return, Chari Jazz set up in Fort-Lamy.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;  [[Malao Hennecy]] from the [[Central African Republic]] also became associated with the band in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maziki.free.fr/histoire%20de%20la%20musique%20en%20dates.htm "Histoire de la Musique Centrafricaine en quelques dates"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, maziki.free.fr {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before it could be established, in 1965 musician Kader left the group to form [[Logone Band]] based out of [[Moundou]], followed by the departure of guitarist [[Ramadingué]], who formed [[African Mélody]].&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;

==History==

Throughout history, Nepalis traded with the Tibetans via the many border crossings. One of the most important goods traded was salt from the Tibetan areas.&lt;ref name="murton_crosscurrent"&gt;{{Cite magazine

The border between Nepal and China is one of the most natural boundaries of the earth, due to the barrier [[Himalayas]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[People's Republic of China]] and [[Kingdom of Nepal]] had a brief border dispute shortly before 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Cotterwood''' is a town in [[Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica|Saint Elizabeth Parish]], [[Jamaica]]. It is at [[latitude]] 18° 4' 60" N, [[Longitude]] 77° 54' 0" W and at an [[altitude]] of 107 metres.

The community here was founded by [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]] who originally came from [[Cattawood Springs]] in [[Portland Parish, Jamaica|Portland Parish]], joining forces with [[Cudjoe]] in 1730. The community has retained much of [[Africa]]n culture in consequence., with the names Yulie and Oli being used often. The local dialect includes several African words such as ''bafan'' which refers to someone who is clumsy, ''bubu'', for someone who behaves stupid, ''buffa-buffa'' meaning fat, ''chacka-chaka'' for someone who is untidy and ''fenke fenke'' for feeble. The name of Cotterwood (like Cattawood) probably derives from the [[Twi]] word ''katá'' which means to cover conceal or protect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_lmFzFgsTZYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124&amp;lpg=RA1-PA124&amp;dq=cottawood&amp;source=web&amp;ots=N5NrwgVvo8&amp;sig=wykCGjHk13kQ84yM2apsaQ4r0cE''A Dictionary of Jamaican English''] edited by F.G. Cassidy, R.B.Le Page accessed 18thFebruary 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Barrett, the author of several books  including ''The Sun and The Drum'' comes from Cotterwood and has researched the African roots in Jamaican [[Folklore|Folk]] [[Tradition]].

The '''national emblem of [[Djibouti]]''' was introduced after attaining independence from [[France]] on 27 June 1977. It was made by Hassan Robleh. It is bordered on the sides with [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branches.  Within this perimeter there is a vertical [[spear]], in front of which is a [[shield]].   Underneath the shield, two hands rise away from the spear, both of which carry a large machete.  These two hands symbolize the main two ethnic groups of the nation: the [[Afar people|Afar]] and the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]]. The spear is topped by a red star. The star symbolizes the unity between the Issa and the Afar peoples. A Djibouti law established the seal and states its significance, and has been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/dj.html#coa&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Alliance for Peace and Prosperity''' (GAPP ) is a [[nonprofit]] and [[nonpartisan]] membership organization founded on May 15, 2007 and based at [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

==Mission==
The organization's mission is promoting understanding of [[globalization]] and informing the public about important global issues. A central aim of the organization, it states, is to “push decision makers towards reforms that create the conditions for a global [[society]] and global [[governance]].“&lt;ref name="Global Alliance for Peace and Prosperity"&gt;Global Alliance for Peace and Prosperity. ''[http://www.globalapp.org/Global_Alliance_for_Peace_and_Prosperity_Support_Us.html About US.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's first initiative is called ''Become a Global Citizen''. The initiative has its own website and it promotes global [[citizenship]]. The [[New York Times]] described the initiative “ a groundbreaking movement that empowers all citizens to participate in meaningful ways in the life of the community and the planet“.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, ''Article Interconnected World of Today,October 6th 2007/International Part/Section A) Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the organization==
From its inception the organization is nonpartisan, welcoming members from any political attitude and religious beliefs. However, its proceedings are almost universally private and confidential.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wright, ''The Elite Government'' (Appleton,II: Eastern Island Publishers, 2008) 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 the organization was first mentioned by the British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] when he called for a new international effort to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. He said that the “pace has been too slow and uncertain“ in meeting the promise made by world leaders seven years ago and that “we need more organizations like the Global Alliance for Peace and Prosperity that push us for faster global reforms.“&lt;ref&gt;Speech of ''British Prime Minister Gordon Brown'' at the UN General Assembly at New York on July 31st 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was officially introduced at the international level at the [[Fabian Society]] New Year Conference in London in January 2008. 

The current [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) is Christian Walz.

==Influence on foreign policy==
In March 2008 the organization became the youngest [[non-governmental organization]] to join the [[United Nations Global Compact]] ( UNGC ) Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unglobalcompact.org/ParticipantsAndStakeholders/search_participant.html? ''Global Compact'', Local Non-Governmental Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709180203/http://www.unglobalcompact.org/ParticipantsAndStakeholders/search_participant.html |date=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization regularly attends conferences at [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]]. Global Alliance for Peace and Prosperity is a “breeding ground for important global policies“and it pushes “politicians, delegates of international organizations, public officials, the press, teachers, educaters and citizens towards having their part to play in the construction of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]].“&lt;ref&gt;Die neue globale Bewegung ( Article in the German Frankfurter Rundschau Paper/February 7th, 2008/Politics Section/Page 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
"Going Underground" was written in 1980. The frontman of The Jam, [[Paul Weller]] had hoped that he could adapt his music to fit a football song to support the England national football team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/fra-jam-undergrunn-til-fotball-vm-1.856393 |title=Fra Jam-undergrunn til fotball-VM |publisher=NRK |language=Norwegian |date=22 April 2002 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weller gave permission to Daryl Denham to write new lyrics to adapt "''Going Underground''" into a football song in April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Sweeting |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/apr/26/shopping.artsfeatures |title=That was the modern world |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Go England" was created as a result and was performed by the England Boys, a band which comprised a number of Virgin Radio staff and presenters which was fronted by Denham.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chart-watch.uk/index.php/archives/2002/week-ending-june-8th-2002 |title=Week ending June 8th 2002 |publisher=Chart Watch |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Graham |last=Betts |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ewk5AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22go+england%22+denham&amp;dq=%22go+england%22+denham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPgYju64zcAhWDV8AKHTUmBGEQ6AEIMzAC |title=Collins Complete UK Hit Singles 1952–2004|publisher=Collins |via=Google Books |date= |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was intended to be used as the official fan's anthem for England at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intro.de/popmusik/gehoren-fussball-und-musik-zusammen |title=Gehören Fußball und Musik zusammen? |publisher=Intro.de |language=German |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However that commission from [[The Football Association]] went to "[[We're on the Ball]]" by [[Ant &amp; Dec]].&lt;ref name=ch /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">{{Politics of Guinea}}
A '''presidential election''' was held in [[Guinea]] on 21 December 2003. Incumbent [[Lansana Conté]] won over 95.6% of the vote after most opposition parties [[election boycott|boycotted the election]].

Conté ran for another seven-year term despite serious health problems, including diabetes, which caused some to doubt his ability to continue as President.&lt;ref name=Seven&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=48173 "GUINEA: Ailing Conte is sworn in for another seven term"], IRIN, 20 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unanimously nominated as the candidate of the ruling [[Unity and Progress Party]] (PUP) in September 2003, but he said that he would not participate in campaigning. Demands from the [[Republican Front for Democratic Change]] (FRAD) opposition coalition concerning the creation of an independent electoral commission and access to state media were unfulfilled by the government, and consequently all the major opposition leaders chose to boycott the election.&lt;ref name=No&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=47195 "GUINEA: Conte faces virtually no opposition in presidential election"], IRIN, 12 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main opposition politicians chose to boycott, six others tried to run but saw their candidacies rejected due to technicalities. Aside from Conté, only one candidate was permitted to run: [[Mamadou Bhoye Barry]] of the [[Union for National Progress (Guinea)|Union for National Progress]]. Barry was known as a supporter and friend of Conté; as a veterinarian, he also cared for Conté's livestock.&lt;ref name=No/&gt; Despite his failing health, Conté was officially certified as being medically fit to stand as a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=47242 "GUINEA: Opposition leader arrested following radio interview"], IRIN, 13 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

With no serious opposition, Conté was re-elected by an overwhelming margin. Turnout was officially placed at 86%, despite the opposition boycott and lack of competition; however, FRAD claimed that turnout was actually less than 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=48824 "GUINEA: Conte sacks economic team in reshuffle"], IRIN, 2 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Conté was sworn in for his new seven-year term on 19 January 2004 and vowed to fight corruption in a television broadcast on the occasion.&lt;ref name=Seven/&gt;

According to [[Byzantine]] Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenetos]] in ''[[De administrando imperio]]'', the horka had judicial authority. However, in other sources the term horka was applied to a military leader (such as [[Bulcsú]], who led the Magyar forces at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]]). Certainly at some point in the 10th century the roles of horka and [[Gyula (title)|gyula]] (the chief warlord) had become similar, with the horka having authority in Western Transdanubia and the gyula in [[Transylvania]] in the east. In later sources the word appears only as a personal name.

'''Mahalapye''' is a town located in the [[Central District, Botswana|Central District]] of [[Botswana]].
The town has about 41,000 inhabitants and is situated along the main road between the capital [[Gaborone]] and the second largest city [[Francistown]].
Mahalapye has a bus station, a railway station, a couple of hotels and a market area with many shops and fast food restaurants, Water Shed mall is the latest attraction to those travelling from Gaborone to Francistown, great place for refreshments. It also has several petrol stations, some open 24 hours per day. Being situated on the edge of the [[Kalahari]] desert it is quite dry, and the local waterways are dry except during the rainy season. In recent times, it has become a convenient stop-over town for travelers travelling to and from Gaborone.

This town is located on the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Thus at approximately 13:11 hours on 21 December, or at solar noon on Summer Solstice, the sun will be directly overhead at this site. To mark this geographic feature there is a small monument just outside town on the 23rd parallel, or 23 degrees South of the equator. At this time the sun will be directly above this monument where the sun reaches its furthest point South. At this point there will be no shadow on the monument.

The [[Botswana Prison Service]] (BPS) operates the Mahalapye Prison.&lt;ref name=Prisons&gt;"[http://www.gov.bw/Global/Prisons%20and%20rehabilitation%5B1%5D.pdf Prisons and Rehabilitation]."

[[File:Dmitrevsky nikita.jpg|thumb|A [[wood engraving]] of the legend of Nikita]]

'''Nikita the Tanner''', '''Nikita Kozhemyaka''' ({{lang-ru|Никита Кожемяка}}) or '''Mykyta Kozhumyaka''' ({{lang-ua|Мики́та Кожум'я́ка}}), is an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[folk hero]] ([[bogatyr]]), a character from a legend. In some sources  he is called ''Kyrylo the Tanner'' ({{lang-ua|Кирило Кожум'я́ка}}) ({{lang-ru|Кирилл Кожемяка}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/skazki/texts/af0/af1/af1-432-.htm?cmd=0&amp;hash=148 Народные русские сказки А. Н. Афанасьева]. Moscow:  Nauka, Vol. 1 (1984). Notes&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Elijah the Tailor'' ({{lang-ru|Илья Швец}}, {{lang-ua|Ілля Швець}}). The oldest prototype on it could be found in [[Laurentian Codex|Laurentian Chronicle]].

==The legend==

The [[fairy tale]] of Nikita tells that a dragon, [[Slavic dragon|Zmey Gorynych]], used to attack the lands of Rus and take beautiful girls as prisoners. One day he even kidnapped the daughter of the Kievan [[kniaz|prince]]. To find out the dragon's weakness, the woman pretended to fall in love him. Gorynych revealed her there's only one person in the world that can defeat him: a tanner from Kiev, Nikita. The princess told these news to her pigeon, who alerted her father, the prince. The prince went to the tanner's house to ask for help. It took the prince a while to persuade Nikita into fighting, and the bogatyr refused the wealth and power that the prince offered him. Eventually, the prince gathered hundreds of children in front of Nikita's house, and they begged the bogatyr to save them from Gorynych's attacks. Only then Nikita agreed to fight.

Nikita then went to Gorynych's lair, and, after a long earth-shattering fight, had the dragon heavily beaten with his heavy wooden club. Frightened, the dragon offered Nikita to become allies and rule the world together. Nikita demanded that they plow the border of their halves of the world, then used the dragon instead of a plowing horse. After they plowed the furrow across the whole world, Nikita demanded that they plow further to divide the sea as well. The foolish Gorynych obeyed and drowned in the ocean.

==In media==
*''[[Kashchey the Immortal (film)|Kashchey the Immortal]]'' (1945), [[Sergei Stolyarov]] as Nikita. The film is loosely inspired by the legend and combines characters from various Russian folk tales.
* ''Nikita Kozhemyaka'' (animated short film, 1965) - replaces the dragon with a nomadic horde.
* ''Nikita Kozhemyaka'' (animated short, 2008) - an episode in the Mountain of Gems series of shorts, a relatively faithful, albeit comical, adaptation of the legend.
* ''Nikita Kozhemyaka'' (animated feature film, 2016) - very loosely inspired by the legend; the main protagonist is Nikita's baby son.

'''Relazioni''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for reports or accounts; ''singular'' '''relazione''')  were the final reports presented by [[Venice|Venetian]] ambassadors of their service in foreign states.  Relazioni contained descriptions of the current political, military, economic, and social conditions of the country visited.  Relazioni are important to [[historians]] for recording the development of diplomacy in [[early modern Europe]].

== Background ==

"During the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, Italian states cultivated commercial, diplomatic, and political relations with first the Turkoman emirates of western Anatolia, and then the [[Ottomans]] (as well as other eastern Mediterranean states) as part of their multifaceted to maintain long - established trading empires and to keep the Ottoman armies out of the Italian peninsula."&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. 2007. "Negotiating with the Renaissance State: The Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy." In The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2007 p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the Italian states, the Venetians and the state of Venice faced these threats the most directly because the Ottoman armies and navies began to push up and into the Adriatic seas. The military threat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] loomed large within Italian consciousness, but the government of the [[Republic of Venice]] knew that its [[commerce]] depended less and less on its own natives and armies and more and more on its good relations with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As a result, this forced Venice to feel the need to an Ottoman world in the making because the [[Ottoman Empire]] had been expanding so rapidly at the time.

There were very many Venetian merchants that lived within the Ottoman Empire which made the state of Venice feel a need to protect their merchants in the "foreign" and "fearful" places under Ottoman rule. The Venetians sought to do so by appointing permanent representatives known as [[consuls]], better known as ambassadors, whose job was to shield their subjects in the "foreign" state and describe in frequent letters the happenings within the Ottoman state. This system is thought to have been the beginning of the development of modern [[diplomacy]] in Europe. Upon their return to the Venetian state, these permanent representatives would present the happenings that they witnessed within the Ottoman Empire to the Republic in a document known as relazione. Beginning in 1454, an appointed permanent representative always resided in the Ottoman State (usually in the Ottoman capital).

== Contents and the Significance Relazioni ==

"The Relazione provided a broad and comprehensive synthesis, periodically brought up to date by successive ambassadors, of the political military, economic, and social conditions of the country visited." &lt;ref&gt;Queller, Donald E. 1973. "The Development of Ambassadorial Relazioni." In Renaissance Venice. Ed. J. R. Hale. London: Faber and Faber p.175&lt;/ref&gt; A fully developed Venetian relazione from the sixteenth century and later on in time was quite different from a final report on the procedures and outcome of a mission.

"The Ottoman precedent for such activities is nowhere better demonstrated than in the relazioni that Venetian consuls routinly delivered before the Senate upon recall from postings in the Ottoman capital. The goal of these reports was to contain the Turkish advance and to defend Venetian positions." &lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Daniel. 2007. "Negotiating with the Renaissance State: The Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy." In The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Relazioni gave Venetians the knowledge they needed to know about the enemy (the Ottomans). Relazioni were very significant to Venetians because they contained stress points and fault lines where the Ottoman Empire might weaken of its own account or where Venice might intervene. In simple terms they were significant to Venetians as they were like a "Strategy Guide" that the Venetians could turn to if they had to.

== The Popularity of Relazioni ==

"In the course of the sixteenth century the fame of the Venetian relazioni spread far and wide and copies were sold abroad at good prices, not only to governments, but also to erudite collectors." &lt;ref&gt;Queller, Donald E. 1973. "The Development of Ambassadorial Relazioni." In Renaissance Venice. Ed. J. R. Hale. London: Faber and Faber p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Venetian noble families kept their own copies of relazioni, especially those families by which a member of the family had brought honour upon the house. From these sources came the copies that are now in various libraries and archives. In the sixteenth century gained international popularity and concern for the security of the relazioni grew. Unless there became a control over the distribution of relazioni, the Venetians feared, "the ill effect of either sealing their envoys' lips or divulging to the public what ought to be kept a secret."&lt;ref&gt;Queller, Donald E. 1973. "The Development of Ambassadorial Relazioni." In Renaissance Venice. Ed. J. R. Hale. London: Faber and Faber p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Venetian government, the efforts to achieve security of the relazioni were never successful however, "it is the great good fortune of the modern historian, for to the scattered copies we owe many of the extant relazioni, especially the earliest."&lt;ref&gt;Queller, Donald E. 1973. "The Development of Ambassadorial Relazioni." In Renaissance Venice. Ed. J. R. Hale. London: Faber and Faber p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Walt Disney Company]] announced in December 2017 that it would, in turn, [[Proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire 21st Century Fox]], including the Sky stake. However, Comcast ultimately won a bidding war over the stake for £17.28 per-share. Fox and the company's remaining shareholders agreed to sell their shares in Sky to Comcast.

The Times, Saturday, 3 November 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies had begun to struggle financially and were both suffering financial losses as both competed against each other for viewers.  ''The Guardian'' later characterised the merger as "effectively a takeover by News Corporation".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/feb/04/sky-tv-early-years  ''Sky TV's launch: 'a wing and a prayer' '', media editor Maggie Brown, Guardian ''Organgrinder'' blog, 5 February 2009] Retrieved 24 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was investigated by Office of Fair Trading&lt;ref&gt;Fair trading office to study merger of Sky and BSB. Melinda Wittstock, Media Correspondent.

The Times, Wednesday, 19 December 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] was not consulted about the deal; after approval, the IBA demanded precise details about the merger, stated they were considering the repercussions of the deal to ultimately determine whether BSB contracts were null and void.&lt;ref&gt;IBA to rule this week on satellite merger.

By September 1991, the weekly losses had been reduced to £1.5M a week, [[Rupert Murdoch]] said "there were strong financial marketing and political reason[s] for making the compromise merger instead of letting BSB die. Many of the lessons had been learnt with more than half the running cost of the combined company". Further cuts in losses were a direct result of 313,000 new customers joining during the first half of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Sky TV 'in sight of breaking even'. Graham Searjeant, Financial Editor. The Times, Thursday, 19 September 1991&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1992, BSkyB posted its first operating profits, of £100,000 per week, with £3.8&amp;nbsp;million weekly from subscriptions and £1&amp;nbsp;million from advertising, but continued to be burdened with £1.28&amp;nbsp;billion of debt.

In February 2003 BSkyB wished to renegotiate its deal with MTV to reduce its payment from £20m. Chief executive Tony Ball said "We're definitely prepared to stare them down if we can't get a sensible deal, MTV, and other channels, have done particularly well out of the growth of Sky but the opportunity for savings is now there and Sky will be taking it," he added.

In June 2010, News Corporation made a bid for complete ownership of BSkyB. However, following the [[News International]] [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]], critics and politicians began to question the appropriateness of the proposed takeover.

[[Ofcom]] expressed concern that this purchase would give the Murdoch family "material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms" and "increased influence over the UK news agenda and the political process". However, the regulator did deem that a Fox-owned Sky would be "fit and proper" to hold broadcast licences, despite the recent sexual harassment controversies that had emerged at the U.S. [[Fox News Channel]], as there was no evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox News Scandals, Political Influence Concerns Cast Long Shadow Over Sky Review|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fox-news-sexual-harassment-sky-21st-century-fox-1202482623/|website=Variety|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-bradley"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murdoch's Sky bid likely to be referred to competition authorities|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/29/rupert-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-referred-to-competition-authorites|work=The Guardian|date=29 June 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-foxreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Setback for Murdoch in $15 Billion Sky Takeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/business/media/sky-21st-century-fox.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avaaz]] opposed Ofcom's opinion, stating that the regulator "made mistake after mistake in deciding to give the Murdochs a clean bill of health to take over more of our media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/foxs-sky-deal-faces-new-challenge-fit-proper-decision-1034562|title=Fox's Sky Deal Faces Challenge to "Fit and Proper" Decision|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Walt Disney Company]] announced on 14 December 2017, that it would acquire 21st Century Fox, including its stake in Sky plc but barring specific U.S. assets. Fox stated that this purchase would "not alter [its] full commitment and obligation to conclude our proposed transaction." Analysts suggested that Disney's proposed transaction could ease regulatory concerns over Fox's purchase of Sky, as the company will eventually lose its ties to the Murdoch family. Disney has a narrower scope of media ownership in the country than the Murdoch family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/disney-fox-deal-sky-deal-still-on-the-table-expected-to-close-june-2018-1202226861/|title=Disney-Fox Deal: Sky Deal Still On The Table, Expected To Close By June 2018|last=White|first=Peter|date=14 December 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky already has a relationship with Disney for its [[Sky Cinema]] service, holding pay television rights to its films in the United Kingdom and operating a dedicated Sky Cinema channel devoted to Disney content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/21/sky-movies-disney-new-channel-uk|title=Sky Movies Disney: new channel to show UK TV film premieres|last=Deans|first=Jason|date=21 February 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary report by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] issued January 2018 called for the insulation or outright divestment of [[Sky News]] as a condition of the purchase, so that it is editorially independent from the Murdoch family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-blocked-21st-century-fox-cma|title=Rupert Murdoch's Sky bid is not in public interest, says regulator|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=23 January 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky had threatened to reevaluate the channel's continued operations if they "unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business."

A [[bidding war]] began 25 April 2018, when the competing U.S. media and telecoms conglomerate [[Comcast]] (owner of [[NBCUniversal]]), announced a counter-offer for Sky at £12.50 per-share, or approximately £22.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43209100|title=Murdoch bid for Sky challenged by US giant|date=27 February 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/comcast-mulls-renewed-21st-century-fox-pursuit-1202285921/|title=Comcast Mulls Renewing Its 21st Century Fox Assets Pursuit – Report|last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=12 February 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/comcast-fox-bid-disney-merger-1202694858/|title=Comcast May Make Another Bid for 21st Century Fox (Report)|date=12 February 2018|work=Variety|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43891132|title=Comcast starts £22bn bidding war for Sky|last=Wilson|first=Bill|date=25 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=25 April 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBCUniversal CEO [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]] stated that purchasing Sky would roughly double its presence in English-speaking markets, and allow for synergies between the respective networks and studios of NBCUniversal and Sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/nbcus-steve-burke-claims-comcasts-31b-sky-deal-will-boost-scripted-tv-film-fortunes-1202304579/|title=NBCU's Steve Burke Claims Comcast's $31B Sky Deal Will Boost Scripted TV &amp; Film Fortunes, Fox Notes No "Firm Offer" Was Made; 21st Century Fox Reacts – Update|last=White|first=Peter|date=27 February 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2018, [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Matt Hancock]] cleared both 21st Century Fox and Comcast's respective offers to acquire Sky plc.

On 20 September 2018, the [[Panel on Takeovers and Mergers]] ordered that a blind auction be held "in order to provide an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation". In this process, Fox, followed by Comcast, made new cash-only bids for Sky. After these first two rounds of bidding, there would be a third round where both companies could make new offers. However, the third round of bidding would only be binding if both companies make a bid. The results were to be revealed on 22 September, and be confirmed by the start of trading on 24 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/20/sky-takeover-battle-fox-comcast-auction-regulator|title=Sky takeover battle must go to auction, orders regulator|last=Waterson|first=Jim|date=20 September 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast won the auction with a bid of £17.28 per-share, beating Fox's bid of £15.67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/22/comcast-outbids-fox-in-40b-battle-for-sky/|title=Comcast outbids Fox in $40B battle for Sky|last=Clark|first=Kate|date=22 September 2018|work=TechCrunch|access-date=22 September 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45615441|title=Sky: Comcast outbids Fox with £30bn bid for broadcaster|date=22 September 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=22 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky plc had until 11 October to formally accept this offer.&lt;ref name="variety-openmarket"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/global/comcast-buys-sky-shares-open-market-1202956344/|title=Comcast Buys Over 30% of Sky on Open Market, Seeks More Before Takeover Deadline|last=Clarke|first=Stewart|date=25 September 2018|work=Variety|access-date=27 September 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The first CEO of BSkyB was [[Sam Chisholm]], who was CEO of Sky TV before the merger. Chisholm served in this position until 1997. He was followed by Mark Booth who was credited with leading the company through the introduction of Sky. [[Tony Ball]] was appointed in 1999 and completed the company's analogue to digital conversion. He is also credited with returning the company to profit and bringing subscriber numbers to new heights. In 2003, Ball announced his resignation and [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James Murdoch]], son of Rupert Murdoch was announced as his successor. This appointment caused allegations of [[nepotism]] from shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bell|first=Emily|title=Rupert and the joys of nepotism|work=The Guardian|date=5 November 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,1078016,00.html|accessdate=6 March 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2007, it was announced that [[Rupert Murdoch]] would be stepping down as BSkyB's non-executive chairman and would be replaced by his son, [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James]]. In turn, James stepped down as CEO of BSkyB, to be replaced by [[Jeremy Darroch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=104016&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1085142 |title=BSkyB – Investor Relations – Press Release |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current 11 company directors include Nicholas Ferguson (chief executive), David Darroch (chief executive officer), Matthieu Pigasse (managing director), Tracy Clarke (bank executive), David Lewis (chief executive officer), Andrew Sukawaty (manager), Adine Axen (director), John Nallen (company director) and Charles Carey (chief executive officer and president).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sky PLC {{!}} DueDil|url = https://www.duedil.com/company/02247735/sky-plc/people|website = www.duedil.com|accessdate = 1 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208081851/https://www.duedil.com/company/02247735/sky-plc/people|archive-date = 8 December 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Tata Sky is an equity strategic alliance in the nature of a joint venture between the [[Tata Group]] and [[21st Century Fox]], which own 70% and 20% stake respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tata.com/company/profile/Tata-Sky |title=Tata Sky - Tata companies - Tata group |publisher=Tata.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Singapore-based Temasek Holdings picked up 10% stake in Tata Sky from the Tata Group. Tata Sky was incorporated in 2001, but launched services on 8 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telecomtalk.info/tatasky-free-channels/155869/ |title=TataSky to offer all channels and services free to all active users for 2 weeks on account of 10th Anniversary celebrations |publisher=Telecomtalk.info |date=2016-08-05 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STAR’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, formally ownd an international group of DTH businesses that include [[Sky Italia]] in Italy and [[Sky UK]] in United Kingdom. The company uses the Sky brand under a license from [[Sky Limited]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatasky.com/wps/portal/tatasky/home/footerpages/corporateinfo |title=About Tata Sky DTH (India), its DTH services, DTH channels &amp; DTH packages on offer |publisher=Tatasky.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Tata Sky has partnered with Ericsson to launch the first [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) Services ever in India in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/cases/2012/tata-sky-india-more-content--more-choice|title=Video On Demand|last=|first=|date=2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2015, Tata Sky became the first Indian DTH operator to offer 4K set-top-boxes to its consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tatasky-launches-countrys-first-4k-settop-box/article6775606.ece |title=TataSky launches country’s first 4K set-top box |publisher=The Hindu |date=2015-01-10 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sun, 11 Jan 2015-08:47pm , Mumbai , PTI |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-tatasky-launches-country-s-first-4k-set-top-box-2051459 |title=Tata Sky launches India's first 4K set-top box with UHD capability &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2015-01-11 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tata-sky-launches-4k-uhd-set-top-in-india-will-cost-rs-6400-for-new-users-249271.html |title=Tata Sky launches 4K UHD set-top in India, will cost Rs 6400 for new users – Tech2 |publisher=Tech.firstpost.com |date=2015-01-12 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Tata Sky was the second operator to launch DTH or direct-to-home services in 2006. At that time, the company decided to use an [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] satellite. In 2005, Tata Sky signed a contract with ISRO for provision of satellite space on the [[INSAT-4A]] satellite. In 2007, one year after the launch of the DTH player, Tata Sky asked for more space to increase the number of channels they telecast. The extra space was promised in 2009 on the [[GSAT-10]] satellite, a then to be launched satellite inducted into the [[INSAT]] system.

==Addition of a new digit in current landlines numbers==
In 2012 and 2013, land lines were renumbered, with an additional digit 2 prepended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subtel.gob.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3120%3Aregion-metropolitana-se-prepara-para-cambio-de-numeracion-en-telefonia-fija&amp;catid=149%3Aampliacion-de-numeracion&amp;lang=en|publisher=Subsecretario de Telecomunicaciones|title=Región Metropolitana se prepara para Cambio de Numeración en Telefonía Fija}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The change was rolled out gradually by area code; first in Santiago (Region Metropolitana) and Arica in late 2012, then throughout all remaining regions between March and July 2013. 

Now when calling a landline, area code and an extra 2 are always added at the beginning of the number, or between the area code and number.  E.g. a formerly seven digit Santiago number (02)&amp;nbsp;XXX&amp;nbsp;XXXX is now 22XXX&amp;nbsp;XXXX, and a formerly six digit Punta Arenas number (061)&amp;nbsp;YYY&amp;nbsp;YYY is now 612YYY&amp;nbsp;YYY.

==Geographical Zones==

===Special Services===
There are a number of special numbers for public services, and they are in the format 1XY. The most important ones are:

* 130 Forest fires (''Incendios forestales'')
* 131 Ambulance (''SAMU'')
* 132 Firefighters (''Bomberos'')
* 133 Police Emergency (''Emergencias Policiales'')
* 134 Investigaciones
* 135 Drugs hot line (''Fono drogas'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=135 - FONO DROGAS |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.carabineros.cl/sitioweb/web/verSeccion.do?cod=56 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2009-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430101540/http://www.carabineros.cl/sitioweb/web/verSeccion.do?cod=56 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 136 Mountain Rescue (''Cuerpo de Socorro Andino'')

* 139 Police Information  (''Informaciones Policiales'')
* 147 Child abuse (''Fono niños'')
* 149 Family Violence (''Fono familia'')

==Long Distance Carriers==
In Chile it is necessary to choose the carrier for international long distance calls every time and therefore to obtain the best rate for any destination. Long distance carriers have a prefix that must be dialed when calling long distance:
 XXX + 0 + country code + area + phone

The current carrier codes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Lista de carriers en Chile  | work =   | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://www.turismochile.com/datos/carrier.php   | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 111 [[VTR Chile]]
* 112 Convergia Chile
* 113 Transam

* 176 NetChile
* 177 Empresa de Transporte de Señales
* 180 [[Hogar de Cristo]]
* 181 [[Movistar]]
* 188 Telefónica CTC

==Mobile phone numbers==
Mobile network: 9 digits, starting with a 9 plus 8 digits starting with 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 or 3.

Calls from any phone to mobile phones have to use the full nine digits number:
e.g.: 99X-XXX-XXX, 98X-XXX-XXX, 97X-XXX-XXX, 96X-XXX-XXX, 95X-XXX-XXX or 94X-XXX-XXX, 93X-XXX-XXX

==IP Telephony==
The [[Undersecretariat of Telecommunications (Chile)|Undersecretariat of Telecommunications]] (Subtel) created the possibility of telephone service using Internet as a connection technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=SUBTEL PUBLICA ESPERADO REGLAMENTO DE VOZ SOBRE INTERNET |work= |publisher=Subtel |date=2008-06-16 |url=http://www.subtel.cl/prontus_subtel/site/artic/20080616/pags/20080616120010.html |doi= |accessdate=2009-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707012201/http://www.subtel.cl/prontus_subtel/site/artic/20080616/pags/20080616120010.html |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialing plan was modified to have a zone and uses the prefix 44, resulting in numbers such as 044XXXXXXXX for members using IP Telephony.

'''USA-79''', also known as '''GPS IIA-3''', '''GPS II-12''' and '''GPS SVN-25''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the third of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-79 was launched at 22:29:00 UTC on 23 February 1992, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D207, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-79 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1992, USA-79 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20018|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20343|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.9 minutes, and 54.7 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had PRN 25, and operated in slot 2 of plane A of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; and ceased operations on 18 December 2009.

'''XHRIO-TDT''', [[virtual channel]] 15 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 26), is a [[television station]] located in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]] which mainly operates as an [[English language]] station serving as [[The CW]] [[network affiliate|affiliate]] for the [[Rio Grande Valley|Rio Grande Valley area]] in [[southern Texas|southern]] [[Texas]], [[United States]]. Owned by Mexican company TVNorte, the station is operated by [[Entravision Communications]]; this makes it a [[sister station]] to [[Univision]] affiliate [[KNVO (TV)|KNVO]] (channel 48), [[UniMás]] affiliate [[KTFV-CD]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]/[[MyNetworkTV]] affiliates [[KFXV-LD]] and [[KXFX-CD]], and [[KCWT-CD]] (also a CW Plus affiliate). XHRIO maintains its basic license-compliant studios in Matamoros, with a second facility across the border (shared with Entravision's other stations) on North Jackson Road in [[McAllen, Texas]] serving as the main facility for the station. Previously, XHRIO had served as a primary Fox affiliate from 2005 to 2012 and of [[MundoMax|MundoFox/MundoMax]] between 2012 and 2016.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The concession for channel 2 was awarded in 1964, receiving the callsign of '''XHCR-TV''' and owned by Cadena Radiotelevisora del Norte, [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A. de C.V.]], a company owned by respected broadcaster Clemente Serna Alvear of [[Mexico City]]. In 1973, the name of the concessionaire was changed to Televisoras del Bajo Bravo, S.A.

In 1977, a joint venture was formed between the owners of [[KRIO (AM)|KRIO]] (910 AM) in McAllen and KRIX (99.5 FM; now [[KKPS]]) in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and Serna Alvear. The venture brought channel 2 to the air on January 12, 1979 as '''XHRIO-TV''' (with callsign authorized on March 16 of that year), an English language [[independent station (North America)|independent station]]. It branded as '''XRIO-TV-2''', running primarily reruns of older US shows and recent feature films. The studios were co-located in McAllen with KRIO. The transmitter was {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} south of the Rio Grande and the Harlingen antenna farm. Since XHRIO-TV was perceived by its American competitors ([[KRGV-TV]] and [[KGBT-TV]]) as a "[[border blaster]]" or pirate station, both being unfounded, they set about to block live delivery of programming across the U.S. border.

=== First stint as XHRIO-TV ===
Although XHRIO-TV had a broadcast signal superior to its U.S. counterparts, it suffered from serious underfunding and mismanagement by the ownership of the studio facility. During its first year, the technical staff which had created the facility against incredible odds slowly departed. Power to the transmitter site was sporadic and replacement technical people were not up to the task. Thus, XHRIO-TV was never able to establish an advertising base in the English market, despite extremely successful initial ratings. In 1981, the owners of the Mexican concession ended the delivery of programming tapes across the border to the channel 2 transmitter and converted XHRIO to a [[Spanish language]] independent station aimed at Matamoros viewers.

In November 1988, the station became the Lower Rio Grande Valley's [[Telemundo]] affiliate.&lt;ref name=b-xhriotelemundo&gt;{{cite news|title=Bottom Line|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1988/BC-1988-11-07.pdf|accessdate=January 1, 2016|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting]]|date=November 7, 1988|page=47|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concessionaire became known as Telegrande, S.A. XHRIO's Telemundo affiliation ended on May 1, 1999 due to low ratings (in part because [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] had dropped the station from its lineup in 1997); as a result, the station reverted to English language programming by becoming a [[UPN]] affiliate.&lt;ref name=bh-xhriotmdtoupn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maldonado|first1=Vilma|title=Telemundo changes stations, UPN joins Valley lineup|url=http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_1c1c55e0-a4ab-5365-a28b-f13b9c771b76.html|accessdate=January 1, 2016|work=[[Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to XHRIO joining UPN, the network's programming was seen in the area through secondary affiliations with KRGV-TV (channel 5) and [[KVEO-TV|KVEO]] (channel 23). Telemundo programming returned to the market that June, when [[KTLM]] (channel 40) went on the air.&lt;ref name=bh-xhriotmdtoupn/&gt; To reflect its affiliation, the station changed its callsign to '''XHHUPN-TV''' in 2001.&lt;ref name=vud-xhriotoxhhupn&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Doug|title=TV News|url=http://www.wtfda.org/vud100s/2001/07-2001VUD.pdf|accessdate=January 1, 2016|newspaper=VHF-UHF Digest|date=July 2001|page=11|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the station reverted to the '''XHRIO-TV''' calls and dropped UPN for Fox.

=== As a Fox affiliate ===
[[File:FoxXRIO2.png|185px|thumb|left|XHRIO station logo during its time as a Fox affiliate; used until early 2012.]]
Fox programming had previously been seen on XHFOX-TV (channel 17) from 1994 until 2002, when station owner [[Televisa]] dumped the Fox affiliation and flipped that channel to a [[XEW-TV]] repeater as [[XHTAM-TV]]. Prior to XHFOX's arrival and before XHRIO took Fox, Lower Rio Grande viewers on the American side received the network from the nationwide [[Foxnet]] channel.

In 2007, XHRIO began broadcasting digitally on sister station KNVO's subchannel 48.3, but three years later, after KNVO began airing Univision in HD, XHRIO moved to its own digital channel 2.1.

In 2011, low-powered sister station KSFE-LD began airing a simulcast of XHRIO on its main channel 67.1, with KSFE's previous [[The CW|CW]] programming being moved to 67.2. In early 2012, KSFE's calls were changed to [[KFXV-LD]] and on-air identification heavily emphasized the new call letters as well as channel 67.1. This could potentially lead to confusion as the station was branding itself as channel 2 while identifying itself as channel 67. Although the station was available on both channels, the XHRIO calls were reduced to small print beneath the KFXV calls on [[station identification]]s.

=== Since 2012 ===
In 2012, it was announced a full power Entravision-owned station in the Rio Grande Valley would become a charter affiliate of the new Spanish language [[MundoFox]] station. This caused speculation that the Fox network would be removed from XHRIO in favor of MundoFox, although there was no confirmation. On August 7, 2012, Fox programming was interrupted so that XHRIO could air what they labeled a "señal de prueba" or "test signal" feed of MundoFox on 2.1. After numerous unconfirmed rumors that MundoFox would be on 2.1, Valley residents were finally given confirmation on August 8, 2012, when the station's official Twitter feed announced that XHRIO would join MundoFox and Fox would remain on KFXV-LD, effectively splitting them off into two separate and distinctive channels. On August 13, 2012, MundoFox was launched on XHRIO, effectively ending their affiliation with the Fox network. Less than a week after dropping the Fox affiliation from channel 2 altogether, KFXV's standard definition feed was re-added to XHRIO on channel 2.2.

On October 1, 2016, XHRIO switched from MundoMax to [[The CW]], an affiliation held by Entravision and already aired on [[KCWT-CD]]. MundoMax shut down entirely on November 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="multi-mundomaxdead"&gt;{{cite web|title=MundoMax Shuts Down, Gets Sued|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/marketing/mundomax-shuts-down-gets-sued/409452|website=Multichannel News|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is licensed in Mexico, XHRIO was not subject to the United States' discontinuation of analog television and instead shut off its analog signal on January 14, 2015, along with other television stations in the Matamoros-Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo markets. In June 2010, KNVO began broadcasting Univision in HD, and XHRIO began broadcasting on digital channel 26, initially using virtual channel 2 by way of [[PSIP]].

The October 2016 shuffle of Mexican virtual channels required XHRIO to vacate channel 2 for national use by the [[Las Estrellas]] network and [[XHTAM-TDT]]. The IFT assigned virtual channel 54, formerly in use by [[XHVTV-TDT]], as its replacement. Instead, XHRIO moved to virtual channel 15 and did so ahead of the Mexican switch of virtual channels, coinciding with its CW affiliation switch. Also around this time, despite obtaining IFT authorization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpc.ift.org.mx/rpc/pdfs/32799_160908165906_3984.pdf RPC: Multiprogramming Authorization #013520 - XHRIO-TDT - Fox]&lt;/ref&gt; the Fox feed was removed.

==Carriage issues==
Because XHRIO is licensed and broadcasting from Mexico, it is not covered under U.S. "[[must-carry]]" regulations from the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] (though it is required carriage for Mexican cable systems in its broadcast area). This means that, apart from low-powered affiliates in the U.S., XHRIO was the only Fox affiliate that local cable systems were not required to carry. However, U.S. cable systems were effectively required to carry XHRIO anyway, since it is operated by Entravision, which owns stations on the American side of the border. The same must-carry rules give full-powered American stations the option of "retransmission consent", or requesting compensation from cable systems to carry their station. In this case, Entravision has the right to require cable systems to offer XHRIO as part of the compensation for carrying KNVO.

On September 27, 2006, [[DirecTV]] added XHRIO to its lineup in the Rio Grande Valley market on channel 2; prior to that date, DirecTV viewers in that market received Fox programming from [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]'s [[K22JA-D|K47DF]]. On November 6, 2008, [[DirecTV]] added XHRIO's HD channel to its local HD line-up in the Valley.

On September 14, 2007, [[Time Warner Cable]] added XHRIO-TDT to its [[high-definition television|HD]] service on digital cable channel 870, and can also be seen on ATSC/QAM channel 100.870 on basic cable.

In spring 2009, [[Dish Network]] added XHRIO's HD feed to its local channel line-up in the Valley on channel 2.

After XHRIO and KFXV were split into 2 separate channels, all 3 feeds mentioned above remained KFXV feeds and will continue to air FOX programming. It is unclear if and when XHRIO in its current form will be added to these systems.

==News operation==
When XHRIO debuted in 1979, the station produced hourly bilingual news briefs with KRIO newscasters Fred Cantu and Rod Santa Ana during evening programming.

A full local newscast would not air on the station until March 12, 2007, when XHRIO debuted ''Fox 2 News at Nine''. The 30-minute newscast airs Monday through Friday at 9 p.m.  It was not the first 9 p.m. newscast in the area, as XHFOX produced one while it was a Fox affiliate. Like many other Fox affiliates, XHRIO takes advantage of the network's shorter primetime schedule by scheduling their newscasts an hour before the other local affiliates in the region. In addition to local/national news, weather and sports, ''Fox 2 News'' also included "Around the World in 80 Seconds", an 80-second segment dedicated to international, health, and entertainment news. XHRIO's newscast line-up is somewhat similar to that of sister station [[KNVO (TV)|KNVO]]'s [[Spanish language]] newscasts since both stations share the same facility.

On September 27, 2010, XHRIO began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

XHRIO's newscast migrated to KFXV in 2012. XHRIO has not had local news since.

The '''Xarolla Windmill''' at [[Żurrieq]], [[Malta]] is [[List of windmills in Malta|one of the windmills]] constructed by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] in the villages and towns of Malta. It was built in the 18th-century and is presently one of the most preserved [[List of windmills in Malta|windmills in Malta]]. The windmill is an agri-tourism attraction and is found in a complex of agricultural buildings such as a farmhouse, a chapel, catacombs&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;DOI (24 February 2005).

In 1674 [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Nicolas Cotoner]] built five windmills around Malta, one of which was tax-Xarolla. Tax-Xarolla Windmill was built by Grand Master [[Antonio Manoel de Vilhena]] in 1724. Sometimes after 1998, this was restored to its original working order. It is now the only functioning windmill on the islands of Malta.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This is a valuable witness of local culture and heritage; it still has parts of the original mechanisms and can still grain the wheat. In the year 2000, this building was passed over to be administered by the Żurrieq Local Council and is intended to serve also as a cultural centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillsofmalta.nl/db.cgi?p=detail;r=12#details|title=Windmills of malta - Xarolla Windmill|website=www.windmillsofmalta.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zurrieqparish.org/node/441|title=Account Suspended|website=www.zurrieqparish.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130630/arts-entertainment/Xarolla-Windmill-to-serve-as-base-for-artistic-project.476216|title=Xarolla Windmill to serve as base for artistic project|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090305/local/xarolla-windmill-extensively-damaged.247537|title=Xarolla windmill extensively damaged|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/art/48942/art_off_the_mainstream_grid__ryan_falzon|title=Art off the mainstream grid - Ryan Falzon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
