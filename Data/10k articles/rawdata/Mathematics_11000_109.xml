'''12''' ('''twelve''') is the [[natural number]] following [[11 (number)|11]] and preceding [[13 (number)|13]]. The [[superfactorial|product of the first three factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]]. It is central to many systems of counting, including the [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] and [[time|units of time]], and frequently appears in the [[Abrahamic religions]].

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
Twelve is the largest number with a [[monosyllable|single-syllable]] name in [[English language|English]]. Early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] numbers have been theorized to have been non-[[decimal]]: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of [[11 (number)|eleven]] and twelve, the [[long hundred|former use of "hundred"]] to refer to groups of [[120 (number)|120]], and the presence of glosses such as "tentywise" or "ten-count" in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=E V|title=Introduction to Old Norse|year=1957|publisher=Claredon Press|location=Oxford|pages=292–293|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49127454/Introduction-to-Old-Norse-by-E-V-Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=W. H.|title=The Long Hundred and its Use in England|journal=Archaeological Review|date=December 1899|volume= 4|issue= 5|pages=313–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodare|first=Julian|title=The Long Hundred in medieval and early modern Scotland|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|year=1993|volume=123|pages=395–418|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_123/123_395_418.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such uses gradually disappeared with the introduction of [[Arabic numerals]] during the [[12th-century Renaissance]].

It derives from the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|twelf}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|tuelf}}'', first attested in the 10th-century [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]' [[Book of John]].{{refn|group=n|Specially, a passage referring to [[Judas Iscariot]] as "one of the [[Twelve Apostles|twelve]]" (''{{lang|ang|an of ðæm tuelfum}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|John|6:71|KJV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It has cognates in every [[Germanic language]] (e.g. German ''zwölf''), whose [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ancestor has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twaliƀi...}}'', from ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twa}}'' ("[[2 (number)|two]]") and suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-liƀ-}}'' of uncertain meaning.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It is sometimes compared with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{lang|lt|dvýlika}}'', although ''{{lang|lt|-lika}}'' is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to "-teen").&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Every other [[Indo-European language]] instead uses a form of "[[2 (number)|two]]"+"[[10 (number)|ten]]", such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|duōdecim}}''.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The usual [[ordinal number|ordinal form]] is "twelfth" but "dozenth" or "duodecimal" (from the Latin word) is also used in some contexts, particularly [[base-12]] numeration. Similarly, a group of twelve things is usually a "[[dozen]]" but may also be referred to as a "duodecad". The adjective referring to a group of twelve is "duodecuple".

As with [[11 (number)|eleven]],&lt;ref name=oedgoesto&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "eleven, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest forms of twelve are often considered to be connected with Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' ("to leave"), with the implicit meaning that "two is left" after having already counted to ten.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "twelve, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lithuanian suffix is also considered to share a similar development.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' has also been connected with reconstructions of the Proto-Germanic for ten.&lt;ref name=oedgoesto/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dantzig |first=Tobias |date=1930 |title=Number: The Language of Science }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While, as mentioned above, 12 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, and Swedish. It is a compound number in many other languages, e.g. Italian ''dodici'' (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, 
and in French, 17 is the first compound number),{{dubious|date=May 2018}} Japanese 十二 ''jūni''.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

===Written representation===
In prose writing, ''twelve'', being the last single-syllable numeral, is sometimes taken as the last number to be written as a word, and [[13 (number)|13]] the first to be written using digits.
This is not a binding rule, and in English language tradition, it is sometimes recommended to spell out numbers up to and including either ''nine'', ''ten'' or ''twelve'', or even  ''ninety-nine'' or ''one hundred''. Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
In [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zwölf''). The [[Duden]]{{year needed|date=May 2018}} (the German standard dictionary) mentions this rule as outdated.

==Mathematical properties==
Twelve is a [[composite number]], the smallest number with exactly six [[divisor]]s, its divisors being [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]] and 12. Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005835|title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.

A twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.

Twelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant Δ(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&amp;tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at −1 i.e. ζ(−1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.

There are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.

There are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 × 3.

The [[duodecimal]] system (12&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; [twelve] =&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].

In [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C. In [[base 10]], the number 12 is a [[Harshad number]].

==Religion==
The number twelve carries religious, mythological and magical  [[symbol]]ism, generally representing perfection, entirety, or cosmic order in traditions since antiquity.{{sfnp|Drews|1972|loc=p. 43, n. 10}} Notably, twelve is the number of full [[lunation]]s in a [[solar year]], and hence the number of months in a [[solar calendar]], as well as the number of signs in the [[Western astrology|Western]] and the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]] [[zodiac]]. 

====Ancient Greek Religion====
*The [[Twelve Olympians]] are the principal gods of the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], and [[Hercules]] carries out [[labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Weinreich |first=Th. |contribution=Zwölfgötter |editor-last=Roscher |editor-first=W.H. |display-editors=0 |title=Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie |volume=Vol. VI |at=col. 764-848 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Several sets of twelve cities are identified in history as a [[dodecapolis (disambiguation)|dodecapolis]], the most familiar being the [[Etruscan League]]. In ancient Rome, the twelve [[lictor]]s carried [[fasces]] of twelve rods. 

====Christianity====
*The significance is especially pronounced in the [[Hebrew Bible]].
[[Ishmael]] - the first-born son of [[Abraham]] - has 12 sons/princes ([[Genesis 25]]:16), and [[Jacob]] also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;"And it is thought that there is a special significance in the number twelve. It was typified, we know, by many things in the Old Testament ; by the twelve sons of Jacob, by the twelve princes of the children of Israel, by the twelve fountains in Elim, by the twelve stones in Aaron's breast-plate, by the twelve loaves of the shew-bread, by the twelve spies sent by Moses, by the twelve stones of which the altar was made, by the twelve stones taken out of Jordan, by the twelve oxen which bare"
P. Young, ''Daily readings for a year'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZgEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA150  p. 150].
&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in Christian tradition, notably  in the [[twelve Apostles]]. When [[Judas Iscariot]] is disgraced, a meeting is held ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]) to add [[Saint Matthias]] to complete the number twelve once more.
The [[Book of Revelation]] contains much numerical symbolism, and many of the numbers mentioned have 12 as a divisor. {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|12:1|31}} mentions a woman&amp;mdash;interpreted as the [[Israelites|people of Israel]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]&amp;mdash;wearing a crown of twelve stars (representing each of the twelve tribes of Israel). Furthermore, there are 12,000 people sealed from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, making a total of [[144000 (number)|144,000]] (which is the square of 12 multiplied by a thousand).

*The "[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelve Days of Christmas]]" count the interval between [[Christmas]] and  [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]]. Eastern Orthodoxy observes twelve [[Great Feasts]].

*The number of twelve jurors in [[jury trial]]s is depicted by [[Aeschylus]] in the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]''. In the play, the innovation is brought about by the goddess [[Athena]], who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury.
In English Common Law, the tradition of twelve jurors harks back to the 10th-century law code introduced by [[Aethelred the Unready]].

====Hinduism====
*There are twelve [[Jyotirlinga]](''Self-formed Lingas'') of Lord [[Shiva]] in Hindu temples across [[India]] according to the Shaiva tradition.
*The Sun god [[Surya]] has 12 names.
*There are 12 Petals in [[Anahata]] or "heart chakra".
*There are frequently said to be 12 [[Âdityas]].

====Others====
*The chief [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god, [[Odin]], has twelve sons.  
In the King Arthur Legend, Arthur is said to subdue 12 rebel princes and to win 12 great battles against Saxon invaders&lt;ref&gt;Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia, 3d ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]], there are twelve [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]], legitimate successors of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. These twelve early leaders of Islam are&amp;mdash;[[Ali Ben Abu Talib|Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], and nine of Husayn's descendants.
[[Sura 12]] in the [[Quran]] is sura [[Yusuf]], narrating the story of the [[sons of Jacob]].

==Timekeeping==
*The [[lunar year]] is 12 [[lunar months]]. Adding 11 or 12 days completes the [[solar year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunar versus solar calendar|url=http://www.ghazali.net/calander/Linar_v_Solar/linar_v_solar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Most [[Calendar|calendar systems]] - solar or lunar - have twelve months in a [[year]].
*The Chinese use a 12-year cycle for time-reckoning called [[Earthly Branches]].
*There are twelve [[hour]]s in a half day, numbered one to twelve for both the ''ante meridiem'' (a.m.) and the ''post meridiem'' (p.m.). 12:00 p.m. is midday or [[noon]], and 12:00 a.m. is [[midnight]]. 
*The basic units of time (60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours) are evenly divisible by twelve into smaller units.

==In science==
*The [[atomic number]] of [[magnesium]] in the [[periodic table]].
*The [[Standard Model]] identifies twelve types of elementary [[fermion]]s.
*The human body has twelve [[cranial nerves]].
*The [[duodenum]] (from Latin ''duodecim,'' "twelve") is the first part of the [[small intestine]], that is about twelve inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) long. More precisely, this section of the intestine was measured not in inches but in [[finger]]widths. In fact, in [[German language|German]] the name of the duodenum is ''Zwölffingerdarm'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the name is ''twaalfvingerige darm'', both meaning "twelve-finger bowel".
*Force 12 on the [[beaufort scale|Beaufort wind force scale]] corresponds to the maximum wind speed of a hurricane.

==In sports==

* In both [[soccer]] and [[American football]], the number 12 can be a symbolic reference to the [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s because of the support they give to the 11 players on the field. [[Texas A&amp;M University]] reserves the number 12 [[number (sports)|jersey]] for a walk-on player who represents the original [[12th Man (football)|"12th Man"]], a fan who was asked to play when the team's reserves were low in a college [[American football]] game in 1922. Similarly, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]], [[Clube de Regatas Flamengo|Flamengo]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Cork City FC|Cork City]] do not allow field players to wear the number 12 on their jersey because it is reserved for their supporters.
* In [[Canadian football]], 12 is the maximum number of players that can be on the field of play for each team at any time.
* In [[cricket]], another sport with eleven players per team, teams may select a "12th man", who may replace an injured player for the purpose of fielding (but not batting, bowling or keeping wicket).
* In [[women's lacrosse]], each team has 12 players on the field at any given time, except in penalty situations.
* In [[rugby league]], one of the starting second-row forwards wears the number 12 jersey in most competitions. An exception is in the European [[Super League]], which uses static squad numbering.
* In [[rugby union]], one of the starting centres, most often but not always the inside centre, wears the 12 shirt.

==In technology==
*[[ASCII]] and [[Unicode]] code point for [[form feed]].
* The number of [[function key]]s on most PC keyboards (F1 through F12)
* The number of keys in any standard digital telephone (1 through 9, 0, * and #)
* Microsoft's [[Rich Text Format]] specification assigns numbers congruent to 12 mod 256 to variants of the [[French language]].

===Music===
====Music Theory====
*Twelve is the number of [[pitch class]]es in an [[octave]], not counting the duplicated (octave) pitch. Also, the total number of [[major key]]s, (not counting [[enharmonic]] equivalents) and the total number of [[minor key]]s (also not counting equivalents). This applies only to twelve tone [[equal temperament]], the most common tuning used today in western influenced music.
*The twelfth is the [[Interval (music)|interval]] of an octave and a fifth. Instruments such as the [[clarinet]] which behave as a stopped cylindrical pipe [[overblowing|overblow]] at the twelfth.
*The [[twelve-tone technique]] (also dodecaphony) is a method of [[musical composition]] devised by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Music using the technique is called twelve-tone music.
*The [[Twelve-bar blues]] is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">In [[automata theory]], an '''alternating finite automaton''' ('''AFA''') is a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] whose transitions are divided into ''[[existential quantification|existential]]'' and ''[[universal quantification|universal]]'' transitions. For example, let ''A'' be an alternating [[automaton]].
* For an existential transition &lt;math&gt;(q, a, q_1 \vee q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' nondeterministically chooses to switch the state to either &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, reading ''a''. Thus, behaving like a regular [[nondeterministic finite automaton]].
* For a universal transition &lt;math&gt;(q, a, q_1 \wedge q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' moves to &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; '''and''' &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, reading ''a'', simulating the behavior of a parallel machine.

Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run ''tree''. ''A'' accepts a word ''w'', if there ''exists'' a run tree on ''w'' such that ''every'' path ends in an accepting state.

A basic theorem states that any AFA is equivalent to a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA), hence AFAs accept exactly the [[regular language]]s.

An alternative model which is frequently used is the one where Boolean combinations are represented as ''clauses''. For instance, one could assume the combinations to be in [[disjunctive normal form]] so that &lt;math&gt;\{\{q_1\},\{q_2,q_3\}\}&lt;/math&gt; would represent &lt;math&gt;q_1 \vee (q_2 \wedge q_3)&lt;/math&gt;. The state '''tt''' (''true'') is represented by &lt;math&gt;\{\{\}\}&lt;/math&gt; in this case and '''ff''' (''false'') by &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.
This clause representation is usually more efficient.

==Formal definition==
An alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a [[n-tuple|6-tuple]],
&lt;math&gt;(S(\exists), S(\forall), \Sigma, \delta, P_0, F)&lt;/math&gt;, where

*&lt;math&gt;S(\exists)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of existential states. Also commonly represented as &lt;math&gt;S(\vee)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;S(\forall)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of universal states. Also commonly represented as &lt;math&gt;S(\wedge)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\ \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of input symbols.
*&lt;math&gt;\ \delta&lt;/math&gt; is a set of transition relations to next state &lt;math&gt;(S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)) \times (\Sigma \cup \{ \varepsilon \} ) \to 2^{S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\ P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial (start) state, such that &lt;math&gt;P_0 \in S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\ F&lt;/math&gt; is a set of accepting (final) states such that &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)&lt;/math&gt;.

The model was introduced by [[Ashok K. Chandra|Chandra]], [[Dexter Kozen|Kozen]] and [[Larry Stockmeyer|Stockmeyer]].&lt;ref name="ChandraKozen1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandra|first1=Ashok K.|last2=Kozen|first2=Dexter C.|last3=Stockmeyer|first3=Larry J.|title=Alternation|journal=Journal of the ACM|volume=28|issue=1|year=1981|pages=114–133|issn=0004-5411|doi=10.1145/322234.322243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State complexity==
{{main article|State complexity}}

Even though AFA can accept exactly the [[regular language]]s, they are different from other types of finite automata in the succinctness of description, measured by the number of their states.

Chandra et al.&lt;ref name="ChandraKozen1981" /&gt; proved that converting an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-state AFA to an equivalent DFA
requires &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; states in the worst case. Another construction by Fellah, Jürgensen and Yu.&lt;ref name="FellahJürgensen1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fellah|first1=A.|last2=Jürgensen|first2=H.|last3=Yu|first3=S.|title=Constructions for alternating finite automata∗|journal=International Journal of Computer Mathematics|volume=35|issue=1-4|year=1990|pages=117–132|issn=0020-7160|doi=10.1080/00207169008803893}}&lt;/ref&gt; converts an AFA with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; states to a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) with up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; states by performing a similar kind of powerset construction as used for the transformation of an NFA to a DFA.

==Computational complexity==

The membership problem asks, given an AFA &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a [[word (formal languages)|word]] &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, whether &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; accepts &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. This problem is [[P-complete]]&lt;ref name="holzer2010descriptional"&gt;Theorem 19 of {{Cite journal|date=2011-03-01|title=Descriptional and computational complexity of finite automata—A survey|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540110001999|journal=Information and Computation|language=en|volume=209|issue=3|pages=456–470|doi=10.1016/j.ic.2010.11.013|issn=0890-5401}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is true even on a singleton alphabet, i.e., when the automaton accepts a [[unary language]].

The non-emptiness problem (is the language of an input AFA non-empty?), the universality problem (is the complement of the language of an input AFA empty?), and the equivalence problem (do two input AFAs recognize the same language) are [[PSPACE-complete]] for AFAs{{r|holzer2010descriptional|pages=Theorems 23, 24, 25}}.

In [[numerical mathematics]], '''artificial precision''' is a source of error that occurs when a numerical value or semantic is expressed with more [[Significant figures|precision]] than was initially provided from measurement or user input.
For example, a person enters their birthday as the date 1984-01-01 but it is stored in a database as 1984-01-01T00:00:00Z which introduces the artificial precision of the hour, minute, and second they were born, and may even affect the date, depending on the user's actual place of birth. This is also an example of [[false precision]], which is artificial precision specifically of numerical quantities or measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12142">In [[number theory]], an '''aurifeuillean factorization''', or '''aurifeuillian factorization''', named after [[Léon-François-Antoine Aurifeuille]], is a special type of [[Algebraic expression|algebraic]] [[factorization]] that comes from non-trivial factorizations of [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s over the [[integer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2006-75-253/S0025-5718-05-01766-7/S0025-5718-05-01766-7.pdf |title=Aurifeuillian factorization |author=A. Granville, P. Pleasants |journal=Math. Comp. |volume=75 |year=2006 |pages=497–508 |doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01766-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cyclotomic polynomials themselves are [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the integers, when restricted to particular integer values they may have an algebraic factorization, as in the examples below.

== Examples ==

* Numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;2^{4k+2}+1&lt;/math&gt; have the following aurifeuillean factorization:&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Aurifeuillean Factorization|urlname=AurifeuilleanFactorization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;2^{4k+2}+1 = (2^{2k+1}-2^{k+1}+1)\cdot (2^{2k+1}+2^{k+1}+1)&lt;/math&gt;

* Numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;b^n - 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(b)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b = s^2 \cdot t&lt;/math&gt; with [[Square-free integer|square-free]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, have aurifeuillean factorization if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
** &lt;math&gt;t\equiv 1 \pmod 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\equiv t \pmod{2t}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;t\equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\equiv 2t \pmod{4t}&lt;/math&gt;

: Thus, when &lt;math&gt;b = s^2\cdot t&lt;/math&gt; with [[Square-free integer|square-free]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;2t&lt;/math&gt;, then if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 1 mod 4, &lt;math&gt;b^n-1&lt;/math&gt; have aurifeuillean factorization, otherwise, &lt;math&gt;b^n+1&lt;/math&gt; have aurifeuillean factorization.

: When the number is of a particular form (the exact expression varies with the base), Aurifeuillian factorization may be used, which gives a product of two or three numbers.

== History ==

In 1871, Aurifeuille discovered the factorization of &lt;math&gt;2^{4k+2}+1&lt;/math&gt; for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14 as the following:&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="numericana"&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#aurifeuille Integer Arithmetic, Number Theory – Aurifeuillian Factorizations], Numericana&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2^{58}+1 = 536838145 \cdot 536903681.&lt;/math&gt;

The second factor is prime, and the factorization of the first factor is &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot 107367629&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="numericana" /&gt; The general form of the factorization was later discovered by [[Édouard Lucas|Lucas]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''bull graph''' is a [[planar graph|planar]] [[undirected graph]] with 5 vertices and 5 edges, in the form of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=BullGraph|title=Bull Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has [[chromatic number]] 3, [[chromatic index]] 3, radius 2, diameter 3 and [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] 3. It is also a [[block graph]], a [[split graph]], an [[interval graph]], a [[claw-free graph]], a 1-[[k-vertex-connected graph|vertex-connected graph]] and a 1-[[k-edge-connected graph|edge-connected graph]].

==Bull-free graphs==
A graph is bull-free if it has no bull as an [[induced subgraph]]. The [[triangle-free graph]]s are bull-free graphs, since every bull contains a triangle. The [[strong perfect graph theorem]] was proven for bull-free graphs long before its proof for general graphs,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Chvátal|first1=V.|author1-link=Václav Chvátal|last2=Sbihi|first2=N.|title=Bull-free Berge graphs are perfect|journal=[[Graphs and Combinatorics]]|volume=3|year=1987|pages=127–139|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF01788536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[polynomial time]] recognition algorithm for Bull-free perfect graphs is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Reed|first1=B.|author1-link=Bruce Reed (mathematician)|last2=Sbihi|first2=N.|title=Recognizing bull-free perfect graphs|journal=[[Graphs and Combinatorics]]|volume=11|year=1995|pages=171–178|issue=2|doi=10.1007/BF01929485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Chudnovsky]] and Shmuel Safra have studied bull-free graphs more generally, showing that any such graph must have either a large [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] or a large [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] (that is, the [[Erdős–Hajnal conjecture]] holds for the bull graph),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Chudnovsky|first1=M.|author1-link=Maria Chudnovsky|last2=Safra|first2=S.|title=The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture for bull-free graphs|journal=[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]|series=Series B|volume=98|issue=6|year=2008|pages=1301–1310|doi=10.1016/j.jctb.2008.02.005|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~mc2775/EHbullfree.ps|access-date=2009-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625213302/http://www.columbia.edu/~mc2775/EHbullfree.ps#|archive-date=2010-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and developing a general structure theory for these graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chudnovsky|first=M.|authorlink=Maria Chudnovsky|year=2008|title=The structure of bull-free graphs.

==Chromatic and characteristic polynomial==

The [[chromatic polynomial]] of the bull graph is &lt;math&gt;(x-2)(x-1)^3x&lt;/math&gt;. Two other graphs are chromatically equivalent to the bull graph.

Its [[characteristic polynomial]] is &lt;math&gt;-x(x^2-x-3)(x^2+x-1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Its [[Tutte polynomial]] is &lt;math&gt;x^4+x^3+x^2y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Cameron Gordon''' (born 1945) is a [[Professor]] and Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ma.utexas.edu/people/faculty/#G Mathematics Faculty], Department of Mathematics, [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Accessed January 22, 2010. &lt;/ref&gt; in the Department of mathematics at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], known for his work in [[knot theory]].  Among his notable results is his work with [[Marc Culler]], [[John Luecke (mathematician)|John Luecke]], and [[Peter Shalen]] on the [[cyclic surgery theorem]].  This was an important ingredient in his work with Luecke showing that [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s were determined by their [[knot complement|complement]]. Gordon was also involved in the resolution of the [[Smith conjecture]].

[[Andrew Casson]]  and Gordon defined and proved basic theorems regarding strongly irreducible [[Heegaard splitting]]s, an important concept in the modernization of Heegaard splitting theory. They also worked on the [[slice knot|slice]]-[[ribbon knot|ribbon]] conjecture, inventing the Casson-Gordon invariants in the process.

Gordon was a 1999 [[Guggenheim Fellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/199906/people.pdf  Guggenheim Fellowships Awarded.] [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 46 (1999), no. 6, p. 685  &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17303">In [[quantum mechanics]] ([[physics]]), the '''canonical commutation relation''' is the fundamental relation between [[canonical conjugate]] quantities (quantities which are related by definition such that one is the [[Fourier transform]] of another). For example,

:&lt;math&gt;[\hat x,\hat p_x] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

between the position operator {{mvar|x}} and momentum operator {{mvar|p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the  {{mvar|x}}  direction of a point particle in one dimension, where {{math| [''x'' , ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;] {{=}} ''x'' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''}}  is the [[commutator]] of {{mvar|x}} and  {{mvar|p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; }}, {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], and {{math|ℏ}} is the reduced [[Planck's constant]] {{math|''h''/2&amp;pi;}}  . In general, position and momentum are vectors of operators and their commutation relation between different components of position and momentum can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;[\hat r_i,\hat p_j] = i\hbar \delta_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

This relation is attributed to [[Max Born]] (1925),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = M. | last2 = Jordan | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1007/BF01328531 | title = Zur Quantenmechanik | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 34 | pages = 858 | year = 1925 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1925ZPhy...34..858B }}&lt;/ref&gt; who called it a "quantum condition" serving as a postulate of the theory;  it was noted by [[Earle Hesse Kennard|E. Kennard]] (1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kennard | first1 = E. H. | title = Zur Quantenmechanik einfacher Bewegungstypen | doi = 10.1007/BF01391200 | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 44 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 326–352 | year = 1927 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...44..326K }}&lt;/ref&gt; to imply the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]]. The [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] gives a uniqueness result for operators satisfying (an exponentiated form of) the canonical commutation relation.

== Relation to classical mechanics ==
By contrast, in [[classical physics]], all observables commute and the [[commutator]] would be zero. However, an analogous relation exists, which is obtained by replacing the commutator with the [[Poisson bracket]] multiplied by {{math|''i''ℏ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x,p\} = 1 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This observation led [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] to propose that the quantum counterparts   {{mvar|f&amp;#770;}},  {{mvar|g&amp;#770;}} of classical observables {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|g}} satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;[\hat f,\hat g]= i\hbar\widehat{\{f,g\}} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In 1946, [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold|Hip Groenewold]] demonstrated that a ''general systematic correspondence''  between  quantum commutators and Poisson brackets could not hold consistently.&lt;ref name="groenewold"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Groenewold | first1 = H. J. | title = On the principles of elementary quantum mechanics | doi = 10.1016/S0031-8914(46)80059-4 | journal = Physica | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 405–460 | year = 1946 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1946Phy....12..405G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 13.13&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did appreciate that such a systematic correspondence does, in fact, exist between the quantum commutator and a ''deformation'' of the Poisson bracket, the [[Moyal bracket]], and, in general, quantum operators and  classical observables and distributions in [[phase space]]. He thus finally elucidated the correspondence mechanism, the [[Wigner–Weyl transform]], that underlies an alternate equivalent mathematical representation of quantum mechanics known as [[phase space formulation|deformation quantization]].&lt;ref name="groenewold"/&gt;

==The Weyl relations ==
The [[Lie group|group]] &lt;math&gt;H_3(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; generated by [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponentiation]] of the 3-dimensional  [[Lie algebra]] determined by the commutation relation &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Heisenberg group]]. This group can be realized as the group of &lt;math&gt;3\times 3&lt;/math&gt; upper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.2.6 and Proposition 3.26&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the standard [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], quantum observables such as &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; should be represented as [[self-adjoint operator]]s on some [[Hilbert space]].  It is relatively easy to see that two [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s satisfying the above canonical commutation relations cannot both be [[bounded operator|bounded]]. Certainly, if &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; were [[trace class]] operators, the relation &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(AB)=\operatorname{Tr}(BA)&lt;/math&gt; gives a nonzero number on the right and zero on the left.

Alternately, if &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; were bounded operators, note that &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}^n,\hat{p}]=i\hbar n \hat{x}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, hence the operator norms would satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt;2 \left\|\hat{p}\right\| \left\|\hat{x}\right\|^n \geq n \hbar \left\|\hat{x}\right\|^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;,  &amp;nbsp; so that,  for any ''n'', 
:&lt;math&gt;2 \left\|\hat{p}\right\| \left\|\hat{x}\right\| \geq n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;
However, {{mvar|n}}  can be arbitrarily large, so at least one operator cannot be bounded, and the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space cannot be finite. If the operators satisfy the Weyl relations (an exponentiated version of the canonical commutation relations, described below) then as a consequence of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]],  ''both'' operators must be unbounded.

Still, these canonical commutation relations can be rendered somewhat "tamer" by writing them in terms of the (bounded) [[unitary operator]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp}(it\hat{x})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp}(is\hat{p})&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting braiding relations for these operators are the so-called [[Stone–von Neumann theorem|Weyl relations]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp}(it\hat{x})\mathrm{exp}(is\hat{p})=\mathrm{exp}(-ist\hbar)\mathrm{exp}(is\hat{p})\mathrm{exp}(it\hat{x})&lt;/math&gt;.  
These relations may be thought of as an exponentiated version of the canonical commutation relations; they reflect that translations in position and translations in momentum do not commute. One can easily reformulate the Weyl relations in terms of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem#The Heisenberg group|representations of the Heisenberg group]].

The uniqueness of the canonical commutation relations—in the form of the Weyl relations—is then guaranteed by the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]].

It is important to note that for technical reasons, the Weyl relations are not strictly equivalent to the canonical commutation relation &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; were bounded operators, then a special case of the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]] would allow one to "exponentiate" the canonical commutation relations to the Weyl relations.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 5.2 of {{harvnb|Hall|2015}} for an elementary derivation&lt;/ref&gt; Since, as we have noted, any operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations must be unbounded, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula does not apply without additional domain assumptions. Indeed, counterexamples exist satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the Weyl relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Example 14.5&lt;/ref&gt; (These same operators give a [[Uncertainty principle#A counterexample|counterexample]] to the naive form of the uncertainty principle.) These technical issues are the reason that the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] is formulated in terms of the Weyl relations.

A discrete version of the Weyl relations, in which the parameters ''s'' and ''t'' range over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n&lt;/math&gt;, can be realized on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space by means of the [[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices|clock and shift matrices]].

== Generalizations ==
The simple formula

:&lt;math&gt;[x,p] = i\hbar, \, &lt;/math&gt;

valid for the [[Canonical quantization|quantization]] of the simplest classical system, can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="town"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. S. |last=Townsend |title=A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, CA |year=2000 |isbn=1-891389-13-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We identify '''canonical coordinates''' (such as {{mvar|x}} in the example above, or a field {{math|Φ(''x'')}} in the case of [[quantum field theory]]) and '''canonical momenta''' {{math|&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  (in the example above it is {{mvar|p}}, or more generally, some functions involving the [[derivative]]s of the canonical coordinates with respect to time):

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\partial {\mathcal L}}{\partial(\partial x_i / \partial t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition of the canonical momentum ensures that one of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \pi_i = \frac{\partial {\mathcal L}}{\partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The canonical commutation relations then amount to

:&lt;math&gt;[x_i,\pi_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''&amp;delta;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

Further, it can be easily shown that

:&lt;math&gt;[F(\vec{x}),p_i] = i\hbar\frac{\partial F(\vec{x})}{\partial x_i}; \qquad [x_i, F(\vec{p})] = i\hbar\frac{\partial F(\vec{p})}{\partial p_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;C_{n+1}^{k}=C_{n}^{k}+C_{n}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, it can be easily shown that by mathematical induction[[Mathematical induction|'' '']]
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{x}^n,\hat{p}^m\right]=\sum_{k=1}^{min\left(m,n\right)}{ \frac{-\left(-i \hbar\right)^k n!m!}{k!\left(n-k\right)!\left(m-k\right)!} \hat{x}^{n-k}\hat{p}^{m-k}} =\sum_{k=1}^{min\left(m,n\right)}{ \frac{\left(i \hbar\right)^k n!m!}{k!\left(n-k\right)!\left(m-k\right)!} \hat{p}^{m-k}\hat{x}^{n-k}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Gauge invariance==
Canonical quantization is applied, by definition, on [[canonical coordinates]].  However, in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], the canonical momentum {{mvar|p}} is not [[gauge invariant]].  The correct gauge-invariant momentum (or "kinetic momentum") is

:&lt;math&gt;p_\text{kin} = p - qA  \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; ([[SI units]]) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;p_\text{kin} = p - \frac{qA}{c} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; ([[Gaussian units|cgs units]]),

where {{mvar|q}} is the particle's [[electric charge]], {{mvar|A}} is the [[magnetic potential|vector potential]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Although the quantity {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the "physical momentum", in that it is the quantity to be identified with momentum in laboratory experiments, it ''does not'' satisfy the canonical commutation relations; only the canonical momentum does that. This can be seen as follows.

The non-relativistic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a quantized charged particle of mass {{mvar|m}} in a classical electromagnetic field is (in cgs units)

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{1}{2m} \left(p-\frac{qA}{c}\right)^2 +q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} is the three-vector potential and  {{mvar|φ}} is the [[scalar potential]]. This form of the Hamiltonian, as well as the [[Schrödinger equation]]  {{math|''Hψ'' {{=}} ''iħ∂ψ/∂t''}}, the [[Maxwell equation]]s and the [[Lorentz force law]] are invariant under the gauge transformation
:&lt;math&gt;A\to A^\prime=A+\nabla \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\to \phi^\prime=\phi-\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\to\psi^\prime=U\psi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H\to H^\prime= U HU^\dagger,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;U=\exp \left( \frac{iq\Lambda}{\hbar c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and ''Λ=Λ(x,t)'' is the gauge function.

The [[angular momentum operator]] is
:&lt;math&gt;L=r \times p \,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
and obeys the canonical quantization relations 
:&lt;math&gt;[L_i, L_j]= i\hbar {\epsilon_{ijk}} L_k&lt;/math&gt;
defining the [[Lie algebra]] for [[so(3)]], where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].  Under gauge transformations, the angular momentum transforms as
:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi \vert L \vert \psi \rangle \to 
\langle \psi^\prime \vert L^\prime \vert \psi^\prime \rangle = 
\langle \psi \vert L \vert \psi \rangle + 
\frac {q}{\hbar c}  \langle \psi \vert r \times \nabla \Lambda \vert \psi \rangle \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

The gauge-invariant angular momentum (or "kinetic angular momentum") is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K=r \times \left(p-\frac{qA}{c}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which has the commutation relations
:&lt;math&gt;[K_i,K_j]=i\hbar {\epsilon_{ij}}^{\,k}
\left(K_k+\frac{q\hbar}{c} x_k 
\left(x \cdot B\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;B=\nabla \times A&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[magnetic field]]. The inequivalence of these two formulations shows up in the [[Zeeman effect]] and the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]].

==Uncertainty relation and commutators ==

All such nontrivial commutation relations for pairs of operators lead to corresponding [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty relations]],&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. P. |last=Robertson |title=The Uncertainty Principle |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=1929 |pages=163–164 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 |bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R }}&lt;/ref&gt; involving positive semi-definite expectation contributions by their respective commutators and anticommutators.  In general, for two [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, consider expectation values in a system in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, the variances around the corresponding expectation values being {{math|1=(Δ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; {{langle}}(''A'' − {{langle}}''A''{{rangle}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{rangle}}}}, etc.

Then 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta  A \, \Delta  B \geq  \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left|\left\langle\left[{A},{B}\right]\right\rangle \right|^2 + \left|\left\langle\left\{ A-\langle A\rangle ,B-\langle B\rangle  \right\} \right\rangle \right|^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1=[''A'', ''B''] &amp;equiv; ''A B'' &amp;minus; ''B A''}} is the [[Commutator#Ring theory|commutator]] of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, and {{math|1={''A'', ''B''} &amp;equiv; ''A B'' + ''B A''}} is the [[anticommutator]].

This follows through use of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], since
{{math|{{!}}{{langle}}''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{rangle}}{{!}} {{!}}{{langle}}''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{rangle}}{{!}} &amp;ge; {{!}}{{langle}}''A B''{{rangle}}{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|1=''A B'' = ([''A'', ''B''] + {''A'', ''B''})/2 }}; and similarly for the shifted operators {{math|''A'' − {{langle}}''A''{{rangle}}}} and  {{math|''B'' − {{langle}}''B''{{rangle}}}}. (Cf. [[uncertainty principle derivations]].)

Substituting for {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} (and taking care with the analysis) yield Heisenberg's familiar uncertainty relation for {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}}, as usual.

==Uncertainty relation for angular momentum operators==

For the angular momentum operators {{math|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''z p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, etc., one has that 
:&lt;math&gt; [{L_x}, {L_y}] = i \hbar \epsilon_{xyz} {L_z}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{xyz}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] and simply reverses the sign of the answer under pairwise interchange of the indices. An analogous relation holds for the [[spin (physics)|spin]] operators.

Here, for {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; }},&lt;ref name="robertson" /&gt; in angular momentum multiplets {{math|1=''ψ'' = {{!}}''{{ell}}'',''m''{{rangle}}}}, one has, for the transverse components of the   [[Casimir invariant]]   {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ ''L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the {{mvar|z}}-symmetric relations 
:{{math|1={{langle}}''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{rangle}} = {{langle}}''L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{rangle}} = (''{{ell}}'' (''{{ell}}'' + 1) − ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ℏ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 }}, 
as well as  {{math|1={{langle}}''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''{{rangle}} = {{langle}}''L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''{{rangle}} = 0 }}.

Consequently, the above inequality applied to this commutation relation specifies
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta L_x \Delta L_y \geq \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\hbar^2|\langle L_z \rangle|^2}~, &lt;/math&gt; 
hence 
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt {|\langle L_x^2\rangle  \langle L_y^2\rangle |} \geq \frac{\hbar^2}{2} m&lt;/math&gt; 
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\ell(\ell+1)-m^2\geq m ~,&lt;/math&gt;
so, then, it yields useful constraints such as a lower bound on the [[Casimir invariant]]: {{math|''{{ell}}'' (''{{ell}}'' + 1) &amp;ge; ''m'' (''m'' + 1)}}, and hence {{math|''{{ell}}'' &amp;ge; ''m''}}, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], the '''category of small categories''', denoted by '''Cat''', is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are all [[small category|small categories]] and whose [[morphism]]s are [[functor]]s between categories. '''Cat''' may actually be regarded as a [[2-category]] with [[natural transformation]]s serving as [[2-morphism]]s.

The [[Initial and terminal objects|initial object]] of '''Cat''' is the ''empty category'' '''0''', which is the category of no objects and no morphisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/empty+category empty category] at nLab&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] is the ''terminal category'' or ''trivial category'' '''1''' with a single object and morphism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/terminal+category terminal category] at nLab&lt;/ref&gt;

The category '''Cat''' is itself a [[large category]], and therefore not an object of itself. In order to avoid problems analogous to [[Russell's paradox]] one cannot form the “category of all categories”. But it is possible to form a [[Glossary of category theory|quasicategory]]&lt;!-- Note the article [[quasicategory]] is about different notion. --&gt; (meaning objects and morphisms merely form a [[conglomerate (set theory)|conglomerate]]) of all categories.

==Free category==
{{Main|Free category}}
The category '''Cat''' has a [[forgetful functor]] ''U'' into the [[quiver category]] '''Quiv''':

:''U'' : '''Cat''' → '''Quiv'''

This functor forgets the identity morphisms of a given category, and it forgets morphism compositions.  The [[left adjoint]] of this functor is a [[functor]] ''F'' taking '''Quiv''' to the corresponding [[free category|free categories]]:

:''F'' : '''Quiv''' → '''Cat'''

==1-Categorical properties==

* '''Cat''' has [[Complete category|all small limits and colimits]].
* '''Cat''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]], with [[Exponential object|exponential]] &lt;math&gt;D^C&lt;/math&gt; given by the [[functor category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fun}(C, D)&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Cat''' is ''not'' locally Cartesian closed.
* '''Cat''' is [[locally presentable category|locally finitely presentable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">In algebra, the '''center of a ring''' ''R'' is the subring consisting of the elements ''x'' such that ''xy = yx'' for all elements ''y'' in ''R''. It is a [[commutative ring]] and is denoted as &lt;math&gt;Z(R)&lt;/math&gt;; "Z" stands for the German word ''Zentrum'', meaning "center".

If ''R'' is a ring, then ''R'' is an [[associative algebra]] over its center. Conversely, if ''R'' is an associative algebra over a commutative subring ''S'', then ''S'' is a subring of the center of ''R'', and if ''S'' happens to be the center of ''R'', then the algebra ''R'' is called a '''central algebra'''.

==Examples==
*The center of a commutative ring ''R'' is ''R'' itself.
*The center of a [[skew-field]] is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].
*The center of the (full) [[matrix ring]] with entries in a commutative ring ''R'' consists of ''R''-scalar multiples of the identity matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/27808/a-linear-operator-commuting-with-all-such-operators-is-a-scalar-multiple-of-the |title=vector spaces - A linear operator commuting with all such operators is a scalar multiple of the identity. - Mathematics Stack Exchange |website=Math.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Let ''F'' be a field extension of a field ''k'' and ''R'' an algebra over ''k''. Then &lt;math&gt;Z(R \otimes_k F) = Z(R) \otimes_k F.&lt;/math&gt;
*The center of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra plays an important role in the [[representation theory of Lie algebras]].

'''Circumscription''' is a [[non-monotonic logic]] created by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] to formalize the [[common sense]] assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (February 1986). "Applications of circumscription to formalizing common-sense knowledge". Artificial Intelligence. 28 (1): 89–116. doi:10.1016/0004-3702(86)90032-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (April 1980). "Circumscription – A form of non-monotonic reasoning". Artificial Intelligence. 13: 27–39. doi:10.1016/0004-3702(80)90011-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the [[frame problem]]. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented [[first-order logic]]  to allow the minimization of the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the [[closed-world assumption]] that what is not known to be true is false.&lt;ref&gt;Eiter, T.; Gottlob, G. (June 1993). "Propositional circumscription and extended closed world reasoning are \Pi^p_2-complete". Theoretical Computer Science. 114 (2): 231–245. doi:10.1016/0304-3975(93)90073-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original problem considered by McCarthy was that of [[missionaries and cannibals problem|missionaries and cannibals]]: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the [[missionaries and cannibals problem]] contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution &amp;ldquo;go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge&amp;rdquo; is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist is
a consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc.)

Circumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of [[inertia]]: things do not change unless otherwise specified.  Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the [[frame problem]]. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the [[Yale shooting problem]] scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.

==The propositional case==

While circumscription was initially defined in the first-order logic case, the particularization to the propositional case is easier to define.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoli, M.; Lenzerini, M. (April 1994). "The complexity of propositional closed world reasoning and circumscription". Journal of Computer and System Sciences. 48 (2): 255–310. doi:10.1016/S0022-0000(05)80004-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a [[propositional formula]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, its circumscription is the formula having only the [[Structure (mathematical logic)|models]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; that do not assign a variable to true unless necessary.

Formally, propositional models can be represented by sets of [[propositional variable]]s; namely, each model is represented by the set of propositional variables it assigns to true. For example, the model assigning true to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, false to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and true to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the set &lt;math&gt;\{a, c\}&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are exactly the variables that are assigned to true by this model.

Given two models &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; represented this way, the condition &lt;math&gt;N \subseteq M&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; setting to true every variable that &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; sets to true. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; models the relation of &amp;ldquo;setting to true less variables&amp;rdquo;. &lt;math&gt;N \subset M&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;N \subseteq M&lt;/math&gt; but these two models do not coincide.

This lets us define models that do not assign variables to true unless necessary.
A model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of a [[Theory (logic)|theory]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called '''minimal''', if and only if there is no model
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;N \subset M&lt;/math&gt;.

Circumscription is expressed by selecting only the minimal models. It is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;CIRC(T) = \{ M ~|~ M \mbox{ is a minimal model of } T \}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, one can define &lt;math&gt;CIRC(T)&lt;/math&gt; as a formula having exactly the above set of models; furthermore, one can also avoid giving a definition of &lt;math&gt;CIRC&lt;/math&gt; and only define minimal inference as &lt;math&gt;T \models_M Q&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every minimal model  of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is also a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, the formula &lt;math&gt;T=a \land (b \lor c)&lt;/math&gt; has three models:

# &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are true, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are true, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is false, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are true, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is false, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\{a,c\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The first model is not minimal in the set of variables it assigns to true. Indeed, the second model makes the same assignments except for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, which is assigned to false and not to true. Therefore, the first model is not minimal. The second and third models are incomparable: while the second assigns true to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the third assigns true to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; instead. Therefore, the models circumscribing &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are the second and third models of the list. A propositional formula having exactly these two models is the following one:

:&lt;math&gt;a \land \neg (b \leftrightarrow c)&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, in circumscription a variable is assigned to true only if this is necessary. Dually, if a variable '''can''' be false, it '''must''' be false. For example, at least one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; must be assigned to true according to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;; in the circumscription exactly one of the two variables must be true. The variable &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; cannot be false in any model of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and neither of the circumscription.

==Fixed and varying predicates==

The extension of circumscription with fixed and varying predicates is due to [[Vladimir Lifschitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Lifschitz, V. (November 1985). "Closed-world databases and circumscription". Artificial Intelligence. 27: 229–235. doi:10.1016/0004-3702(85)90055-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that some conditions are not to be minimized. In propositional logic terms, some variables are not to be falsified if possible. In particular, two kind of variables can be considered:

; varying : these are variables that are not to be taken into account at all in the course of minimization;

; fixed : these are variables considered fixed while doing a minimization; in other words, minimization can be done only by comparing models with the same values of these variables.

The difference is that the value of the varying conditions are simply assumed not to matter. The fixed conditions instead characterize a possible situation, so that comparing two situations where these conditions have different value makes no sense.

Formally, the extension of circumscription that incorporate varying and fixed variables is as follows, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the set of variables to minimize, &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; the fixed variables, and the varying variables are those not in &lt;math&gt;P \cup Z&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{CIRC}(T;P,Z) = \{ M ~|~ M \models T \text{ and }
\not\exists N \text{ such that } N \models T ,~  N \cap P  \subset M \cap P \text{ and } N \cap Z = M \cap Z \}&lt;/math&gt;

In words, minimization of the variables assigned to true is only done for the variables in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; moreover, models are only compared if they assign the same values to the variables of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. All other variables are not taken into account while comparing models.

The solution to the frame problem proposed by McCarthy is based on circumscription with no fixed conditions. In the propositional case, this solution can be described as follows: in addition to the formulae directly encoding what is known, one also define new variables representing changes in the values of the conditions; these new variables are then minimized.

For example, of the domain in which there is a door that is closed at time 0 and in which the action of opening the door is executed at time 2, what is explicitly known is represented by the two formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \text{open}_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{true} \rightarrow \text{open}_2&lt;/math&gt;

The frame problem shows in this example as the problem that &lt;math&gt;\neg open_1&lt;/math&gt; is not a consequence of the above formulae, while the door is supposed to stay closed until the action of opening it is performed. Circumscription can be used to this aim by defining new variables &lt;math&gt;change\_open_t&lt;/math&gt; to model changes and then minimizing them:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{change open}_0 \equiv (\text{open}_0 \not\equiv \text{open}_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{change open}_1 \equiv (\text{open}_1 \not\equiv \text{open}_2)&lt;/math&gt;
: ...

As shown by the [[Yale shooting problem]], this kind of solution does not work. For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg \text{open}_1&lt;/math&gt; is not yet entailed by the circumscription of the formulae above: the model in which &lt;math&gt;\text{change open}_0&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;\text{change open}_1&lt;/math&gt; is false is incomparable with the model with the opposite values. Therefore, the situation in which the door becomes open at time 1 and then remains open as a consequence of the action is not excluded by circumscription.

Several other formalizations of dynamical domains not suffering from such problems have been developed (see [[frame problem]] for an overview). Many use circumscription but in a different way.

==Predicate circumscription==

The original definition of circumscription proposed by McCarthy is about first-order logic. The role of variables in propositional logic (something that can be true or false) is played in first-order logic by predicates. Namely, a propositional formula can be expressed in first-order logic by replacing each propositional variable with a predicate of zero arity (i.e., a predicate with no arguments). Therefore, minimization is done on predicates in the first-order logic version of circumscription: the circumscription of a formula is obtained forcing predicates to be false whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lifschitz, V. (1994). "Circumscription". In Gabbay, D.M.; Hogger, C.J.; Robinson, J.A. Nonmonotonic Reasoning and Uncertain Reasoning. Handbooks of Logic in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming. 3. Oxford University Press. pp. 297–352. {{ISBN|0198537476}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a first-order logic formula &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; containing a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, circumscribing this predicate amounts to selecting only the models of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to true on a minimal set of tuples of values.

Formally, the ''extension'' of a predicate in a first-order model is the set of tuples of values this predicate assign to true in the model. First-order models indeed includes the evaluation of each predicate symbol; such an evaluation tells whether the predicate is true or false for any possible value of its arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoli, M. (November 1992). "The complexity of model checking for circumscriptive formulae". Information Processing Letters. 44 (3): 113–8. doi:10.1016/0020-0190(92)90049-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Since each argument of a predicate must be a term, and each term evaluates to a value, the models tells whether &lt;math&gt;P(v_1,\ldots,v_n)&lt;/math&gt; is true for any possible tuple of values &lt;math&gt;\langle v_1,\ldots,v_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The extension of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in a model is the set of tuples of terms such that &lt;math&gt;P(v_1,\ldots,v_n)&lt;/math&gt; is true in the model.

The circumscription of a predicate &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in a formula &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by selecting only the models of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with a minimal extension of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if a formula has only two models, differing only because &lt;math&gt;P(v_1,\ldots,v_n)&lt;/math&gt; is true in one and false in the second, then only the second model is selected. This is because &lt;math&gt;\langle v_1,\ldots,v_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in the extension of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the first model but not in the second.

The original definition by McCarthy was syntactical rather than semantical. Given a formula &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and a predicate &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, circumscribing &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the following second-order formula:

:&lt;math&gt;T(P) \wedge \forall p \neg (T(p) \wedge p&lt;P)&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a predicate of the same arity as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. This is a second-order formula because it contains a quantification over a predicate. The subformula &lt;math&gt;p&lt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a shorthand for:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (p(x) \rightarrow P(x)) \wedge 
\neg \forall x (P(x) \rightarrow p(x))&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a n-tuple of terms, where n is the arity of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. This formula states that extension minimization has to be done: in order for a truth evaluation on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of a model being considered, it must be the case that no other predicate &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can assign to false every tuple that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; assigns to false and yet being different from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition only allows circumscribing a single predicate. While the extension to more than one predicate is trivial, minimizing the extension of a single predicate has an important application: capturing the idea that things are usually as expected. This idea can be formalized by minimizing a single predicate expressing the abnormality of situations. In particular, every known fact is expressed in logic with the addition of a literal &lt;math&gt;\neg Abnormal(...)&lt;/math&gt; stating that the fact holds only in normal situations.  Minimizing the extension of this predicate allows for reasoning under the implicit assumption that things are as expected (that is, they are not abnormal), and that this assumption is made only if possible (abnormality can be assumed false only if this is consistent with the facts.)

==Pointwise circumscription==

'''Pointwise circumscription''' is a variant of first-order circumscription that has been introduced by [[Vladimir Lifschitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Lifschitz, V. (1986). "Pointwise circumscription". Proceedings AAAI-86 Fifth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, August 11-15, 1986, Philadelphia, PA. pp. 406–410. {{ISBN|0934613133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the propositional case, pointwise and predicate circumscription coincide. The rationale of pointwise circumscription is that it minimizes the value of a predicate for each tuple of values separately, rather than minimizing the extension of the predicate. For example, there are two models of &lt;math&gt;P(a) \equiv P(b)&lt;/math&gt; with domain &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, one setting &lt;math&gt;P(a)=P(b)=false&lt;/math&gt; and the other setting &lt;math&gt;P(a)=P(b)=true&lt;/math&gt;. Since the extension of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the first model is &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; while the extension for the second is &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, circumscription only selects the first model.

In pointwise circumscription, each tuple of values is considered separately. For example, in the formula &lt;math&gt;P(a) \equiv P(b)&lt;/math&gt; one would consider the value of &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; separately from &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;. A model is minimal only if it is not possible to turn any such value from true to false while still satisfying the formula. As a result, the model in which &lt;math&gt;P(a)=P(b)=true&lt;/math&gt; is selected by pointwise circumscription because turning only &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; into false does not satisfy the formula, and the same happens for &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Domain and formula circumscription==

An earlier formulation of circumscription by McCarthy is based on minimizing the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] of first-order models, rather than the extension of predicates.  Namely, a model is considered less than another if it has a smaller domain and the two models coincide on the evaluation of the common tuples of values. This version of circumscription can be reduced to predicate circumscription.

Formula circumscription was a later formalism introduced by McCarthy. This is a generalization of circumscription in which the extension of a formula is minimized, rather than the extension of a predicate. In other words, a formula can be specified so that the set of tuples of values of the domain that satisfy the formula is made as small as possible.

==Theory curbing==

Circumscription does not always correctly handle disjunctive information. [[Raymond Reiter|Ray Reiter]] provided the following example: a coin is tossed over a checkboard, and the result is that the coin is either on a black area, or on a white area, or both. However, there are a large number of other possible places where the coin is not supposed to be on; for example, it is implicit that the coin is not on the floor, or on the refrigerator, or on the surface of the moon. Circumscription can therefore be used to minimize the extension of &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt; predicate, so that &lt;math&gt;On(\text{coin},\text{moon})&lt;/math&gt; is false even if this is not explicitly stated.

On the other hand, the minimization of the &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt; predicate leads
to the wrong result that the coin is either on a black area or on a white area, ''but not both''. This is because the models in which &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt; is true only on &lt;math&gt;(\text{coin},\text{white area})&lt;/math&gt; and only on &lt;math&gt;(\text{coin},\text{black area})&lt;/math&gt; have a minimal extension of &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt;, while the model in which the extension of &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt; is composed of both pairs is not minimal.

Theory curbing is a solution proposed by [[Thomas Eiter]], [[Georg Gottlob]], and [[Yuri Gurevich]].&lt;ref&gt;Eiter, T.; Gottlob, G.; Gurevich, Y. (1993). "CURB your theory!". In Bajcsy, Ruzena. IJCAI-93: proceedings of the Thirteenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Chambéry, France, August 28–September 3, 1993. IJCAII. pp. 634–9. {{ISBN|155860300X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that the model that circumscription fails to select, the one in which both &lt;math&gt;On(\text{coin},\text{white area})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;On(\text{coin},\text{black area})&lt;/math&gt; are true, is a model of the formula that is greater (w.r.t. the extension of &lt;math&gt;On&lt;/math&gt;) than both the two models that are selected. More specifically, among the models of the formula, the excluded model is the least upper bound of the two selected models. Theory curbing selects such least upper bounds models in addition to the ones selected by circumscription. This inclusion is done until the set of models is closed, in the sense that it includes all least upper bounds of all sets of models it contains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17484">In [[geometry]], the notion of a '''connection''' makes precise the idea of transporting data along a curve or family of curves in a ''parallel'' and consistent manner. There are various kinds of connections in modern geometry, depending on what sort of data one wants to transport. For instance, an [[affine connection]], the most elementary type of connection, gives a means for transporting [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] to a [[manifold]] from one point to another along a curve.  An affine connection is typically given in the form of a [[covariant derivative]], which gives a means for taking [[directional derivative]]s of vector fields: the infinitesimal transport of a [[vector field]] in a given direction.

Connections are of central importance in modern geometry in large part because they allow a comparison between the local geometry at one point and the local geometry at another point.  [[Differential geometry]] embraces several variations on the connection theme, which fall into two major groups: the infinitesimal and the local theory.  The local theory concerns itself primarily with notions of [[parallel transport]] and [[holonomy]].  The infinitesimal theory concerns itself with the differentiation of geometric data.  Thus a covariant derivative is a way of specifying a [[derivative]] of a vector field along another vector field on a manifold.  A [[Cartan connection]] is a way of formulating some aspects of connection theory using [[differential forms]] and [[Lie group]]s.  An [[Ehresmann connection]] is a connection in a [[fibre bundle]] or a [[principal bundle]] by specifying the allowed directions of motion of the field.  A [[Koszul connection]] is a connection generalizing the derivative in a [[vector bundle]].

Connections also lead to convenient formulations of ''geometric invariants'', such as the [[curvature]] (see also [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] and [[curvature form]]), and [[torsion tensor]].

==Motivation: the unsuitability of coordinates==
[[File:Connection-on-sphere.png|frame|Parallel transport (of black arrow) on a sphere. Blue and red arrows represent parallel transports in different directions but ending at the same lower right point. The fact that they end up not pointing in the same direction is a result of the curvature of the sphere.]]
Consider the following problem.  Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere ''S'' is given at the north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for ''parallel transport''.  Naïvely, this could be done using a particular [[coordinate system]].  However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one system of coordinates will not agree with that of another coordinate system.  A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation.  Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere in such a way that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling.  This latter means of parallel transport is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on the sphere.  If two different curves are given with the same initial and terminal point, and a vector ''v'' is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the terminal point will be ''different from'' the vector resulting from rigidly moving ''v'' along the second curve.  This phenomenon reflects the [[curvature]] of the sphere. A simple mechanical device that can be used to visualize parallel transport is the [[south-pointing chariot]].

For instance, suppose that ''S'' is given coordinates by the [[stereographic projection]].  Regard ''S'' as consisting of unit vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then ''S'' carries a pair of coordinate patches: one covering a neighborhood of the north pole, and the other of the south pole.  The mappings
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varphi_0(x,y) &amp; =\left(\frac{2x}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{2y}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{1-x^2-y^2}{1+x^2+y^2}\right)\\[8pt]
\varphi_1(x,y) &amp; =\left(\frac{2x}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{2y}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{x^2+y^2-1}{1+x^2+y^2}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
cover a neighborhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the north pole and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the south pole, respectively.  Let ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' be the ambient coordinates in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; have inverses
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varphi_0^{-1}(X,Y,Z)&amp;=\left(\frac{X}{Z+1}, \frac{Y}{Z+1}\right), \\[8pt]
\varphi_1^{-1}(X,Y,Z)&amp;=\left(\frac{-X}{Z-1}, \frac{-Y}{Z-1}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
so that the coordinate transition function is [[inversion in a circle|inversion in the circle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{01}(x,y) = \varphi_0^{-1}\circ\varphi_1(x,y)=\left(\frac{x}{x^2+y^2},\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Let us now represent a vector field in terms of its components relative to the coordinate derivatives.  If ''P'' is a point of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''S'', then a vector field may be represented by the pushforward

:&lt;math&gt;v(P) = J_{\varphi_0}(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\cdot {\mathbf v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\qquad(1) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_{\varphi_0}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is a vector field on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; uniquely determined by ''v''.  Furthermore, on the overlap between the coordinate charts ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it is possible to represent the same vector field with respect to the φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;v(P) = J_{\varphi_1}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P))\cdot {\mathbf v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

To relate the components '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, apply the [[chain rule]] to the identity φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; o φ&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{\varphi_1}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)) = J_{\varphi_0}(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\cdot J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \, &lt;/math&gt;

Applying both sides of this matrix equation to the component vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''P'')) and invoking (1) and (2) yields
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P)) = J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P))\cdot {\mathbf v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

We come now to the main question of defining how to transport a vector field parallelly along a curve.  Suppose that ''P''(''t'') is a curve in ''S''.  Naïvely, one may consider a vector field parallel if the coordinate components of the vector field are constant along the curve.  However, an immediate ambiguity arises: in ''which'' coordinate system should these components be constant?

For instance, suppose that ''v''(''P''(''t'')) has constant components in the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordinate system.  That is, the functions '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''P''(''t''))) are constant.  However, applying the [[product rule]] to (3) and using the fact that ''d'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'' = 0 gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}{\mathbf v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P(t)))=\left(\frac{d}{dt}J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t)))\right)\cdot {\mathbf v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t))).&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{dt}J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t)))\right)&lt;/math&gt; is always a non-singular matrix (provided that the curve ''P''(''t'') is not stationary), so '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''cannot ever be'' simultaneously constant along the curve.

===Resolution===
The problem observed above is that the usual [[directional derivative]] of [[vector calculus]] does not behave well under changes in the coordinate system when applied to the components of vector fields.  This makes it quite difficult to describe how to translate vector fields in a parallel manner, if indeed such a notion makes any sense at all.  There are two fundamentally different ways of resolving this problem.

The first approach is to examine what is required for a generalization of the directional derivative to "behave well" under coordinate transitions.  This is the tactic taken by the [[covariant derivative]] approach to connections: good behavior is equated with [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance]].  Here one considers a modification of the directional derivative by a certain [[linear operator]], whose components are called the [[Christoffel symbols]], which involves no derivatives on the vector field itself.  The directional derivative ''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt;'''v''' of the components of a vector '''v''' in a coordinate system φ in the direction '''u''' are replaced by a ''covariant derivative'':

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf u} {\mathbf v} = D_{\mathbf u} {\mathbf v} + \Gamma(\varphi)\{{\mathbf u},{\mathbf v}\}&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ depends on the coordinate system φ and is [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] in '''u''' and '''v'''.  In particular, Γ does not involve any derivatives on '''u''' or '''v'''.  In this approach, Γ must transform in a prescribed manner when the coordinate system φ is changed to a different coordinate system.  This transformation is not [[tensor]]ial, since it involves not only the ''first derivative'' of the coordinate transition, but also its ''second derivative''.  Specifying the transformation law of Γ is not sufficient to determine Γ  uniquely.  Some other normalization conditions must be imposed, usually depending on the type of geometry under consideration.  In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[Levi-Civita connection]] requires compatibility of the [[Christoffel symbols]] with the [[Riemannian metric|metric]] (as well as a certain symmetry condition).  With these normalizations, the connection is uniquely defined.

The second approach is to use [[Lie group]]s to attempt to capture some vestige of symmetry on the space.  This is the approach of [[Cartan connection]]s.  The example above using rotations to specify the parallel transport of vectors on the sphere is very much in this vein.

==Historical survey of connections==

Historically, connections were studied from an [[infinitesimal]] perspective in [[Riemannian geometry]].  The infinitesimal study of connections began to some extent with [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Elwin Christoffel]].   This was later taken up more thoroughly by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] {{harv|Levi-Civita|Ricci|1900}} who observed in part that a connection in the infinitesimal sense of Christoffel also allowed for a notion of [[parallel transport]].

The work of Levi-Civita focused exclusively on regarding connections as a kind of [[differential operator]] whose parallel displacements were then the solutions of [[differential equation]]s.  As the twentieth century progressed, [[Élie Cartan]] developed a new notion of connection.  He sought to apply the techniques of [[Pfaffian system]]s to the geometries of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]].  In these investigations, he found that a certain infinitesimal notion of connection (a [[Cartan connection]]) could be applied to these geometries and more: his connection concept allowed for the presence of [[curvature]] which would otherwise be absent in a classical Klein geometry.  (See, for example, {{harv|Cartan|1926}} and {{harv|Cartan|1983}}.)  Furthermore, using the dynamics of [[Gaston Darboux]], Cartan was able to generalize the notion of parallel transport for his class of infinitesimal connections.  This established another major thread in the theory of connections: that a connection is a certain kind of [[differential form]].

The two threads in connection theory have persisted through the present day: a connection as a differential operator, and a connection as a differential form.  In 1950, [[Jean-Louis Koszul]] {{harv|Koszul|1950}} gave an algebraic framework for regarding a connection as a differential operator by means of the [[Koszul connection]].  The Koszul connection was both more general than that of Levi-Civita, and was easier to work with because it finally was able to eliminate (or at least to hide) the awkward [[Christoffel symbols]] from the connection formalism.  The attendant parallel displacement operations also had natural algebraic interpretations in terms of the connection.  Koszul's definition was subsequently adopted by most of the differential geometry community, since it effectively converted the ''analytic'' correspondence between covariant differentiation and parallel translation to an ''algebraic'' one.

In that same year, [[Charles Ehresmann]] {{harv|Ehresmann|1950}}, a student of Cartan's, presented a variation on the connection as a differential form view in the context of [[principal bundle]]s and, more generally, [[fibre bundle]]s.  [[Ehresmann connection]]s were, strictly speaking, not a generalization of Cartan connections.  Cartan connections were quite rigidly tied to the underlying [[differential topology]] of the manifold because of their relationship with [[Cartan's equivalence method]].  Ehresmann connections were rather a solid framework for viewing the foundational work of other geometers of the time, such as [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], who had already begun moving away from Cartan connections to study what might be called [[gauge connection]]s.  In Ehresmann's point of view, a connection in a principal bundle consists of a specification of [[vertical bundle|''horizontal'' and ''vertical'' vector fields]] on the total space of the bundle.  A parallel translation is then a lifting of a curve from the base to a curve in the principal bundle which is horizontal.  This viewpoint has proven especially valuable in the study of [[holonomy]].

==Possible approaches==

*A rather direct approach is to specify how a [[covariant derivative]] acts on elements of the [[module (mathematics)|module]] of [[vector field]]s as a [[differential operator]].  More generally, a similar approach applies for [[connection (vector bundle)|connections]] in any [[vector bundle]].
*Traditional index notation specifies the connection by components; see [[Christoffel symbols]].  (''Note'': this has three indices, but is '''''not''''' a [[tensor]]).
*In [[pseudo-Riemannian]] and [[Riemannian geometry]] the [[Levi-Civita connection]] is a special connection associated to the [[metric tensor]].
*These are examples of [[affine connection]]s. There is also a concept of [[projective connection]], of which the [[Schwarzian derivative]] in [[complex analysis]] is an instance.  More generally, both affine and projective connections are types of [[Cartan connection]]s.
*Using [[principal bundle]]s, a connection can be realized as a [[Lie algebra]]-valued [[differential form]].  See [[connection (principal bundle)]].
*An approach to connections which makes direct use of the notion of transport of "data" (whatever that may be) is the [[Ehresmann connection]].
*The most abstract approach may be that suggested by [[Alexander Grothendieck]], where a [[Grothendieck connection]] is seen as [[descent (category theory)|descent]] data from infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the [[diagonal]]; see {{harv|Osserman|2004}}.

In [[formal language]] theory, a '''context-free grammar''' ('''CFG''') is a certain type of [[formal grammar]]:  a set of [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] that describe all possible strings in a given formal language. Production rules are simple replacements. For example, the rule

&lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

replaces &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. There can be multiple replacement rules for any given value. For example,

&lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \beta&lt;/math&gt;

means that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with either &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

In context-free grammars, all rules are one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none. These rules can be applied regardless of context. The left-hand side of the production rule is always a [[nonterminal]] symbol. This means that the symbol does not appear in the resulting formal language. So in our case, our language contains the letters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Scheinberg, ''Note on the Boolean Properties of Context-Free Languages'', Information and Control, '''3''', 372–375 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules can also be applied in reverse to check if a string is grammatically correct according to the grammar.

Here is an example context-free grammar that describes all two-letter strings containing the letters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;S\ \to\ AA&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \beta&lt;/math&gt;

If we start with the nonterminal symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; then we can use the rule
&lt;math&gt;S\ \to\ AA&lt;/math&gt; to turn &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;AA&lt;/math&gt;. We can then apply one of the two later rules. For example, if we apply &lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \beta&lt;/math&gt; to the first &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;\beta A&lt;/math&gt;. If we then apply &lt;math&gt;A\ \to\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the second &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;\beta\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are terminal symbols, and in context-free grammars terminal symbols never appear on the left hand side of a production rule, there are no more rules that can be applied. This same process can be used, applying the last two rules in different orders in order to get all possible strings within our simple context-free grammar.

[[formal language|Language]]s generated by context-free grammars are known as [[context-free language]]s (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The [[#Language equality|language equality]] question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]].

Context-free grammars arise in [[linguistics]] where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a [[natural language]], and they were in fact invented by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] for this purpose, but have not really lived up to their original expectation. By contrast, in [[computer science]], as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of [[programming language]]s. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) called the ''[[Document Type Definition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'', John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Addison Wesley, 2001, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], some authors use the term '''[[phrase structure grammar]]''' to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from [[dependency grammar]]s. In [[computer science]], a popular notation for context-free grammars is [[Backus–Naur form]], or ''BNF''.

== Background ==

Since the time of [[Pāṇini]], at least, linguists have described the [[grammar]]s of languages in terms of their block structure, and described how sentences are [[recursion|recursively]] built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements. An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:
: John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the grocery store.
can be logically parenthesized as follows:
: (John, ((whose blue car) (was (in the garage))), (walked (to (the grocery store)))).
A context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the "block structure" of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]] are not part of the context-free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.

Context-free grammars are a special form of [[Semi-Thue system]]s that in their general form date back to the work of [[Axel Thue]].

The formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref name="hu106"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; and also their [[Chomsky hierarchy|classification as a special type]] of [[formal grammar]] (which he called [[phrase-structure grammar]]s).&lt;ref name="chomsky1956"&gt;{{citation

In Chomsky's [[generative grammar]] framework, the syntax of natural language was described by context-free rules combined with transformation rules.

Block structure was introduced into computer [[programming language]]s by the [[Algol (programming language)|Algol]] project (1957–1960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as [[Backus–Naur form]], after two members of the Algol language design committee.&lt;ref name="hu106"/&gt; The "block structure" aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the "semantics" of the language.

Context-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient [[list of algorithms#Parsing|parsing algorithm]]s that, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An [[Earley parser]] is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used [[LR parser|LR]] and [[LL parser]]s are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.

== Formal definitions ==
A context-free grammar {{mvar|G}} is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:&lt;ref&gt;The notation here is that of {{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, p.&amp;nbsp;94. {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} (p.&amp;nbsp;79) define context-free grammars as 4-tuples in the same way, but with different variable names.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)&lt;/math&gt;
where
# {{mvar|V}} is a finite set; each element &lt;math&gt; v\in V&lt;/math&gt; is called ''a nonterminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by {{mvar|G}}.
# {{math|Σ}} is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from {{mvar|V}}, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar {{mvar|G}}.
# {{mvar|R}} is a finite relation from {{mvar|V}} to &lt;math&gt;(V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where the asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation. The members of {{mvar|R}} are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a {{mvar|P}})
# {{mvar|S}} is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of {{mvar|V}}.

=== Production rule notation ===
A [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rule]] in {{mvar|R}} is formalized mathematically as a pair &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)\in R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in V&lt;/math&gt; is a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\beta \in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of variables and/or terminals; rather than using [[ordered pair]] notation, production rules are usually written using an arrow operator with {{mvar|α}} as its left hand side and {{mvar|β}} as its right hand side:
&lt;math&gt;\alpha\rightarrow\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

It is allowed for {{mvar|β}} to be the [[empty string]], and in this case it is customary to denote it by ε. The form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\rightarrow\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is called an {{mvar|ε}}-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | (the [[pipe symbol]]) to separate them. Rules &lt;math&gt;\alpha\rightarrow \beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\rightarrow\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; can hence be written as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\rightarrow\beta_1\mid\beta_2&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; is called the first and second alternative, respectively.

=== Rule application ===
For any strings &lt;math&gt;u, v\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, we say {{mvar|u}} directly yields {{mvar|v}}, written as &lt;math&gt;u\Rightarrow v\,&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists (\alpha, \beta)\in R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_{1}, u_{2}\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u\,=u_{1}\alpha u_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\,=u_{1}\beta u_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, {{mvar|v}} is a result of applying the rule &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; to {{mvar|u}}.

=== Repetitive rule application ===
For any strings &lt;math&gt;u, v\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}, &lt;/math&gt; we say {{mvar|u}} '''yields''' {{mvar|v}}, written as &lt;math&gt;u\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} v&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;u\Rightarrow\Rightarrow v\,&lt;/math&gt; in some textbooks), if &lt;math&gt;\exists k\geq 1\, \exists \, u_{1}, \cdots, u_{k}\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u = \, u_{1} \Rightarrow u_{2} \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow u_{k} \, = v&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, if &lt;math&gt;k\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;u \neq v&lt;/math&gt;), the relation &lt;math&gt;u\stackrel{+}{\Rightarrow} v&lt;/math&gt; holds. In other words, &lt;math&gt;(\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\stackrel{+}{\Rightarrow})&lt;/math&gt; are the [[reflexive transitive closure]] (allowing a word to yield itself) and the [[transitive closure]] (requiring at least one step) of &lt;math&gt;(\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

=== Context-free language ===
The language of a grammar &lt;math&gt;G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)&lt;/math&gt; is the set
:&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ w\in\Sigma^{*} : S\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} w\}&lt;/math&gt;

A language {{mvar|L}} is said to be a context-free language (CFL), if there exists a CFG {{mvar|G}}, such that &lt;math&gt;L\,=\,L(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Pushdown_automaton#PDA_and_context-free_languages|Non-deterministic pushdown automata]] recognize exactly the context-free languages.

=== Proper CFGs ===
A context-free grammar is said to be ''proper'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Examples ==

{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

=== Words concatenated with their reverse ===

The grammar &lt;math&gt;G = (\{S\}, \{a, b\}, P, S)&lt;/math&gt;, with productions

:{{math|''S'' → ''aSa''}},
:{{math|''S'' → ''bSb''}},
:{{math|''S'' → ''ε''}},

is context-free. It is not proper since it includes an ε-production. A typical derivation in this grammar is
:{{math|''S'' → ''aSa'' → ''aaSaa'' → ''aabSbaa'' → ''aabbaa''}}.
This makes it clear that 
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ww^R:w\in\{a,b\}^*\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The language is context-free, however, it can be proved that it is not [[Regular language|regular]].

=== Well-formed parentheses ===
The canonical example of a context-free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols "(" and ")" and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are

:S → SS
:S → (S)
:S → ()

The first rule allows the S symbol to multiply; the second rule allows the S symbol to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.

=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===

A second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:

:S → SS
:S → ()
:S → (S)
:S → []
:S → [S]

with terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.

The following sequence can be derived in that grammar:
: ([ [ [ ()() [ ][ ] ] ]([ ]) ])


=== Matching pairs ===
In a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with [[bracket]]s. The simplest example:

:S → aSb
:S → ab

This grammar generates the language &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n : n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;, which is not [[regular language|regular]] (according to the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]]).

The special character ε stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to
:S → aSb | ε
we obtain a grammar generating the language &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n : n \ge 0 \} &lt;/math&gt; instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.


=== Distinct number of a's and b's ===

A context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a's and b's:
:S → U | V
:U → TaU | TaT | UaT
:V → TbV | TbT | VbT
:T → aTbT | bTaT | ε 
Here, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with the same number of a's as b's, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more a's than b's and the nonterminal V generates all strings with fewer a's than b's. Omitting the third alternative in the rule for U and V doesn't restrict the grammar's language.

=== Second block of b's of double size ===

Another example of a non-regular language is &lt;math&gt; \{ b^n a^m b^{2n} : n \ge 0, m \ge 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:
:S → bSbb | A
:A → aA | ε

=== First-order logic formulas ===

The [[First-order logic#Formation rules|formation rules]] for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.


== Examples of languages that are not context free ==

In contrast to well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets in the previous section, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced ''disregarding the other'', where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:

: [ ( ] )

or

: [ [ [ [(((( ] ] ] ]))))(([ ))(([ ))([ )( ])( ])( ])

The fact that this language is not context free can be proven using [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]] and a proof by contradiction, observing that all words of the form 
&lt;math&gt;
{(}^n {[}^n {)}^n {]}^n
&lt;/math&gt;
should belong to the language. This language belongs instead to a more general class and can be described by a [[conjunctive grammar]], which in turn also includes other non-context-free languages, such as the language of all words of the form
&lt;math&gt;
a^n b^n c^n
&lt;/math&gt;.

== Regular grammars ==

Every [[regular grammar]] is context-free, but not all context-free grammars are regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred Vaino |last2=Lam |first2=Monica S. |last3=Sethi |first3=Ravi |last4=Ullman |first4=Jeffrey David |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |authorlink2=Monica S.

:S → a
:S → aS
:S → bS

The terminals here are ''a'' and ''b'', while the only nonterminal is S.
The language described is all nonempty strings of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;s and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;s that end in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

This grammar is [[regular grammar|regular]]: no rule has more than one nonterminal in its right-hand side, and each of these nonterminals is at the same end of the right-hand side.

Every regular grammar corresponds directly to a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]], so we know that this is a [[regular language]].

Using pipe symbols, the grammar above can be described more tersely as follows:

:S → a | aS | bS

== Derivations and syntax trees == 
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[LR parser]] --&gt;

A ''derivation'' of a string for a grammar is a sequence of grammar rule applications that transform the start symbol into the string.
A derivation proves that the string belongs to the grammar's language.

A derivation is fully determined by giving, for each step:
* the rule applied in that step
* the occurrence of its left-hand side to which it is applied
For clarity, the intermediate string is usually given as well.

For instance, with the grammar:

  (1)  S → S + S
  (2)  S → 1
  (3)  S → a

the string

 1 + 1 + a

can be derived with the derivation:

 S
     → (rule 1 on the first S)
  S+S
     → (rule 1 on the second S)
  S+S+S
     → (rule 2 on the second S)
  S+1+S
     → (rule 3 on the third S)
  S+1+a
     → (rule 2 on the first S)
  1+1+a

Often, a strategy is followed that deterministically determines the next nonterminal to rewrite:
* in a ''leftmost derivation'', it is always the leftmost nonterminal;
* in a ''rightmost derivation'', it is always the rightmost nonterminal.
Given such a strategy, a derivation is completely determined by the sequence of rules applied.  For instance, the leftmost derivation

 S
     → (rule 1 on the first S)
  S+S
     → (rule 2 on the first S)
  1+S
     → (rule 1 on the first S)
  1+S+S
     → (rule 2 on the first S)
  1+1+S
     → (rule 3 on the first S)
  1+1+a

can be summarized as

 rule 1, rule 2, rule 1, rule 2, rule 3

The distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most [[parsing|parser]]s the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s.

A derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string "1 + 1 + a" is derived according to the leftmost derivation:

:S → S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + 1 + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + 1 + a (3)

the structure of the string would be:

: { { 1 }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + { { 1 }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + { a }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
where { ... }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a substring recognized as belonging to S. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:

[[File:Simple Parse Tree 1.svg|x260px|Rightmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]

This tree is called a ''[[parse tree]]'' or "concrete syntax tree" of the string, by contrast with the [[abstract syntax tree]]. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same parse tree; however, there is another (rightmost) derivation of the same string

:S → S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → S + a (3)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → S + S + a (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → S + 1 + a (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + 1 + a (2)

and this defines the following parse tree:

[[File:Simple Parse Tree 2.svg|x260px|Leftmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]

Note however that both parse trees can be obtained by both leftmost and rightmost derivations.  For example, the last tree can be obtained with the leftmost derivation as follows:

:S → S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → S + S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + S + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + 1 + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; → 1 + 1 + a (3)

If a string in the language of the grammar has more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an ''[[ambiguous grammar]]''. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called ''[[inherently ambiguous language]]s''.

=== Example: Algebraic expressions ===
Here is a context-free grammar for syntactically correct [[Infix notation|infix]] algebraic expressions in the variables x, y and z:
# S → x
# S → y
# S → z
# S → S + S
# S → S - S
# S → S * S
# S → S / S
# S → ( S )

This grammar can, for example, generate the string

:( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )

as follows:

:S (the start symbol)
: → S - S (by rule 5)
: → S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)
: → S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)
: → ( S ) * S - S / S (by rule 8, applied to the leftmost S)
: → ( S ) * S - S / ( S ) (by rule 8, applied to the rightmost S)
: → ( S + S ) * S - S / ( S ) (etc.)
: → ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S )
: → ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: → ( x + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: → ( x + y ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: → ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( S + S )
: → ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( x + S )
: → ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + S )
: → ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )

Note that many choices were made underway as to which rewrite was going to be performed next.
These choices look quite arbitrary. As a matter of fact, they are, in the sense that the string finally generated is always the same.  For example, the second and third rewrites

: → S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)
: → S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)

could be done in the opposite order:

: → S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)
: → S * S - S / S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)

Also, many choices were made on which rule to apply to each selected &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;.
Changing the choices made and not only the order they were made in usually affects which terminal string comes out at the end.

Let's look at this in more detail.  Consider the [[parse tree]] of this derivation:

[[File:Parse Tree 1.svg|An example parse tree]]

Starting at the top, step by step, an S in the tree is expanded, until no more unexpanded &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;es (nonterminals) remain.
Picking a different order of expansion will produce a different derivation, but the same parse tree.
The parse tree will only change if we pick a different rule to apply at some position in the tree.

But can a different parse tree still produce the same terminal string,
which is &lt;code&gt;( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )&lt;/code&gt; in this case?
Yes, for this particular grammar, this is possible.
Grammars with this property are called [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].

For example, &lt;code&gt;x + y * z&lt;/code&gt; can be produced with these two different parse trees:

[[File:Parse Tree Derivations.svg|x260px|Two different parse trees from the same input]]

However, the ''language'' described by this grammar is not inherently ambiguous:
an alternative, unambiguous grammar can be given for the language, for example:

:T → x
:T → y
:T → z
:S → S + T
:S → S - T
:S → S * T
:S → S / T
:T → ( S )
:S → T

(once again picking &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; as the start symbol). This alternative grammar will produce &lt;code&gt;x + y * z&lt;/code&gt; with a parse tree similar to the left one above, i.e. implicitly assuming the association &lt;code&gt;(x + y) * z&lt;/code&gt;, which is not according to standard operator precedence. More elaborate, unambiguous and context-free grammars can be constructed that produce parse trees that obey all desired [[Operator-precedence parser|operator precedence]] and associativity rules.


== Normal forms ==
Every context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be transformed into one in which there is no ε-production (that is, a rule that has the empty string as a product). If a grammar does generate the empty string, it will be necessary to include the rule &lt;math&gt;S \rarr \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but there need be no other ε-rule. Every context-free grammar with no ε-production has an equivalent grammar in [[Chomsky normal form]], and a grammar in [[Greibach normal form]]. "Equivalent" here means that the two grammars generate the same language.

The especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky normal form grammars has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky normal form to construct a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the [[CYK algorithm]]).

==Closure properties==
Context-free languages are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the various operations, that is, if the languages ''K'' and ''L'' are 
context-free, so is the result of the following operations:

* [[set union|union]] ''K'' ∪ ''L''; [[string concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] ''K'' ∘ ''L''; [[Kleene star]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), p.131, Theorem 6.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[string substitution|substitution]] (in particular [[string homomorphism|homomorphism]])&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), pp.131–132, Theorem 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[string homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), pp.132–134, Theorem 6.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[set intersection|intersection]] with a [[regular language]]&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), pp.135–136, Theorem 6.5&lt;/ref&gt;

They are not closed under general intersection (hence neither under [[set complement|complementation]]) and set difference.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), pp.134–135, Theorem 6.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decidable problems ==

The following are some decidable problems about context-free grammars.

=== Parsing ===

The parsing problem, checking whether a given word belongs to the language given by a context-free grammar, is decidable, using one of the general-purpose parsing algorithms:
* [[Chomsky normal form]] and the [[CYK algorithm]]
* [[Earley parser]]
* [[GLR parser]]

=== Reachability, productiveness, nullability ===

It is decidable to check whether a given non-terminal of a context-free grammar is reachable, whether it is productive, and whether it is nullable (that is, it can derive an empty string).

=== Regularity and LL(1) checks ===

It is decidable whether a given grammar is a [[regular grammar]], as well as whether it is an LL(1) grammar (see [[LL parser]]).

=== Emptiness and finiteness ===

There are algorithms to decide whether a language of a given context-free language is empty, as well as whether it is finite.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft &amp; Ullman (1979), pp.137–138, Theorem 6.6&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Undecidable problems ==
Some questions that are undecidable for wider classes of grammars become decidable for context-free grammars; e.g. the [[emptiness problem]] (whether the grammar generates any terminal strings at all), is undecidable for [[context-sensitive grammar]]s, but decidable for context-free grammars.

However, many problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] even for context-free grammars. Examples are:

=== Universality ===
Given a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules?&lt;ref name="sipser"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, Theorem 5.10, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hu281"/&gt;

A reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a [[Turing machine]] accepts a particular input (the [[halting problem]]). The reduction uses the concept of a ''[[computation history]]'', a string describing an entire computation of a [[Turing machine]]. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.

=== Language equality ===
Given two CFGs, do they generate the same language?&lt;ref name="hu281"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eom"/&gt;

The undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: it is impossible to even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.

=== Language inclusion ===
Given two CFGs, can the first one generate all strings that the second one can generate?&lt;ref name="hu281"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eom"/&gt;

If this problem was decidable, then language equality could be decided too: two CFGs G1 and G2 generate the same language if L(G1) is a subset of L(G2) and L(G2) is a subset of L(G1).

=== Being in a lower or higher level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===
Using [[Greibach's theorem]], it can be shown that the two following problems are undecidable:

* Given a [[context-sensitive grammar]], does it describe a context-free language?
* Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a [[regular language]]?&lt;ref name="hu281"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eom"&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia of mathematics: an updated and annotated translation of the Soviet "Mathematical Encyclopaedia"|first=Michiel|last=Hazewinkel|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55608-003-6|at=Vol. IV, p. 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9F71NJxwzoC&amp;pg=PA56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grammar ambiguity ===
Given a CFG, is it [[Ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]]?

The undecidability of this problem follows from the fact that if an algorithm to determine ambiguity existed, the [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, which is known to be undecidable.

=== Language disjointness ===
Given two CFGs, is there any string derivable from both grammars?

If this problem was decidable, the undecidable [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, too: given strings &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_N&lt;/math&gt; over some alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, let the grammar {{tmath|G_1}} consist of the rule
:&lt;math&gt;S \to \alpha_1 S \beta_1^{rev} | \cdots | \alpha_N S \beta_N^{rev} | b&lt;/math&gt;;
where &lt;math&gt;\beta_i^{rev}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reversed]] string &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; doesn't occur among the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;; and let grammar {{tmath|G_2}} consist of  the rule
:&lt;math&gt;T \to a_1 T a_1 | \cdots | a_k T a_k | b&lt;/math&gt;;
Then the Post problem given by &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_N&lt;/math&gt; has a solution if and only if {{tmath|L(G_1)}} and {{tmath|L(G_2)}} share a derivable string.

== Extensions ==
An obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]], and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include [[affix grammar]]s, [[attribute grammar]]s, [[indexed grammar]]s, and Van Wijngaarden [[two-level grammar]]s. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.

An '''extended context-free grammar''' (or '''regular right part grammar''') is one in which the right-hand side of the production rules is allowed to be a [[regular expression]] over the grammar's terminals and nonterminals. Extended context-free grammars describe exactly the context-free languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Courses/fm/pub/context-free.pdf | title=A Short Introduction to Regular Expressions and Context-Free Grammars | accessdate=August 24, 2012 | author=Norvell, Theodore | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left-hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of [[context-sensitive grammar]]s.

== Subclasses ==
There are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:

* [[LR parser|LR(''k'')]] grammars (also known as [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s) allow [[parsing]] (string recognition) with [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]] (PDA), but they can only describe [[deterministic context-free language]]s.
* [[SLR grammar|Simple LR]], [[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]] grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing. SLR and LALR are recognized using the same PDA as LR, but with simpler tables, in most cases.
* [[LL parser|LL(''k'') and LL(''*'')]] grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.
* [[Simple grammar]]s are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.
* [[Bracketed grammar]]s have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.
* [[Linear grammar]]s have no rules with more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.
* [[Regular grammar]]s are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the [[regular language|regular]] languages, i.e. they correspond to [[finite automaton|finite automata]] and [[regular expression]]s.

LR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, [[GLR parser|generalized LR parsing]] extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars.  On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on [[nondeterministic grammar]]s, it is as efficient as can be expected.  Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and [[parser generator]]s continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.

== Linguistic applications ==
[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding [[transformational grammar|transformation rules]].&lt;ref name="chomsky1956"/&gt;

Such rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. [[grammatical voice|passivization]] in English. Much of [[generative grammar]] has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations does not meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being [[Turing complete]] unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).

Chomsky's general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then,&lt;ref name="shieber1985"&gt;{{citation | title=Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language | year=1985 | last=Shieber | first=Stuart | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=333–343 | url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00630917 | issue=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved.&lt;ref name="pullum-gazdar1982"&gt;{{citation | title=Natural languages and context-free languages | year=1982 | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | author2=Gerald Gazdar | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=4 | pages=471–504 | doi=10.1007/BF00360802 | issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gerald Gazdar]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as [[cross-serial dependencies]] in [[Swiss German]]&lt;ref name="shieber1985"/&gt; and [[reduplication]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]&lt;ref name="culy1985"&gt;{{citation | title=The Complexity of the Vocabulary of Bambara | year=1985 | last=Culy | first=Christopher | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=345–351 | doi=10.1007/BF00630918 | issue=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.&lt;ref name="pullum-gazdar1982"/&gt;

'''Convergent validity''', a parameter often used in [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and other [[behavioral sciences]], refers to the degree to which two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related.&lt;ref name="socialresearchmethods.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/convdisc.php|title=Convergent &amp; Discriminant Validity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergent validity, along with [[discriminant validity]], is a subtype of [[construct validity]].  Convergent validity can be established if two similar constructs correspond with one another, while discriminant validity applies to two dissimilar constructs that are easily differentiated.

Campbell and Fiske (1959) developed the [[Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix]] to assess the construct validity of a set of measures in a study.&lt;ref&gt;Campell, D. T., &amp; Fiske, D. W. (1959). Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix. Psychological Bulletin, 56, 81-105&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach stresses the importance of using both discriminant and convergent validation techniques when assessing new tests. In other words, in order to establish construct validity, you have to demonstrate both convergence and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/mtmmmat.php|title=The Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation/application==
Convergent validity can be estimated using correlation coefficients.&lt;ref name="socialresearchmethods.net"/&gt; A successful evaluation of convergent validity shows that a test of a concept is highly correlated with other tests designed to measure theoretically similar concepts.  For instance, to show the convergent validity of a test of mathematics skills, the scores on the test can be correlated with scores on other tests that are also designed to measure basic mathematics ability. High correlations between the test scores would be evidence of convergent validity.

Convergent evidence is best interpreted relative to discriminant evidence. That is, patterns of intercorrelations between two dissimilar measures should be low while correlations with similar measures should be substantially greater. This evidence can be organized as a [[multitrait-multimethod matrix]].  For example, in order to test the convergent validity of a measure of [[self-esteem]], a researcher may want to show that measures of similar constructs, such as self-worth, confidence, social skills, and self-appraisal are also related to self-esteem, whereas non-overlapping factors, such as intelligence, should not relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/convergent-validity.html|title=Convergent and Discriminant Validity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''covering number''' is the number of spherical [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]s of a given size needed to completely cover a given space, with possible overlaps. Two related concepts are the ''packing number'', the number of disjoint balls that fit in a space, and the ''metric entropy'', the number of points that fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.

== Definition ==

Let (''M'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]], let ''K'' be a subset of ''M'', and let ''r'' be a positive [[real number]]. Let ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denote the [[Ball (mathematics)#Balls in general metric spaces|ball]] of radius ''r'' centered at ''x''. A subset ''C'' of ''M'' is an ''r-external covering'' of ''K'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \cup_{x \in C} B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, for every &lt;math&gt;y\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;x\in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq r&lt;/math&gt;.

If furthermore ''C'' is a subset of ''K'', then it is an ''r-internal covering''.

The '''external covering number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any external covering of ''K''. The '''internal covering number''', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum cardinality of any internal covering.

A subset ''P'' of ''K'' is a ''packing'' if &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\{B_r(x)\}_{x \in P}&lt;/math&gt; is [[pairwise disjoint]]. The '''packing number''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{pack}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any packing of ''K''.

A subset ''S'' of ''K'' is ''r''-''separated'' if each pair of points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'' satisfies ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ ''r''. The '''metric entropy''' of ''K'', denoted &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is the maximum cardinality of any ''r''-separated subset of ''K''.

== Examples ==
1. The metric space is the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of real numbers whose absolute value is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an external covering of &lt;math&gt;\lceil 2k/r \rceil&lt;/math&gt; intervals of length &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, covering the interval &lt;math&gt;[k,-k]&lt;/math&gt;. Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k / r)&lt;/math&gt;

2. The metric space is the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Euclidean metric]].
&lt;math&gt;K\subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a set of vectors whose length (norm) is at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; lies in a ''d''-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then:&lt;ref name=book14&gt;{{Cite Shai Shai 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}}
:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq (2 k \sqrt{d}/r)^d&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The metric space is the space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric.
The covering number &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;
is the smallest number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; 
such that, there exist &lt;math&gt;h_1,\ldots,h_k \in K&lt;/math&gt;
such that, for all &lt;math&gt;h\in K&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the supremum distance between &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
The above bound is not relevant since the space is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional.
However, when &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set]], every covering of it has a finite sub-covering, 
so &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{int}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name=book12&gt;{{Cite Mehryar Afshin Ameet 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

== Properties ==

1. The internal and external covering numbers, the packing number, and the metric entropy are all closely related. The following chain of inequalities holds for any subset ''K'' of a metric space and any positive real number ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tao|first1=Terrance|title=Metric entropy analogues of sum set theory|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/metric-entropy-analogues-of-sum-set-theory/|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N^{\text{met}}_{2 r}(K) \leq N^{\text{pack}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{int}}_r(K) \leq N^{\text{met}}_r(K)&lt;/math&gt;

2. Each function except the internal covering number is non-increasing in ''r'' and non-decreasing in ''K''. The internal covering number is monotone in ''r'' but not necessarily in ''K''.

The following properties relate to covering numbers in the standard [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=book14/&gt;{{rp|338}}

3. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are translated by a constant vector &lt;math&gt;k_0\in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then the covering number does not change.

4. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are multiplied by a scalar &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(k\cdot K) = N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

5. If all vectors in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are operated by a [[Lipschitz function]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with [[Lipschitz constant]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:for all &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N^{\text{ext}}_{|k|\cdot r}(\phi\circ K) \leq N^{\text{ext}}_{r}(K)&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to machine learning ==
Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a space of real-valued functions, with the [[l-infinity]] metric (see example 3 above).
Suppose all functions in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are bounded by a real constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, the covering number can be used to bound the [[generalization error]]
of learning functions from &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
relative to the squared loss:&lt;ref name=book12/&gt;{{rp|61}}

::&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Prob}\big[
\sup_{h\in K}|\text{GeneralizationError}(h)-\text{EmpiricalError}(h)|\geq \epsilon
\big]
\leq
N^{\text{int}}_r(K)\cdot 2\exp{-m\epsilon^2 \over 2M^4}
&lt;/math&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;r={\epsilon \over 8M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11891">'''Cox's theorem''', named after the physicist [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]], is a derivation of the laws of [[probability theory]] from a certain set of [[postulates]]. This derivation justifies the so-called "logical" interpretation of probability, as the laws of probability derived by Cox's theorem are applicable to any proposition. Logical (a.k.a. objective Bayesian) probability is a type of [[Bayesian probability]]. Other forms of Bayesianism, such as the subjective interpretation, are given other justifications.

==Cox's assumptions==
Cox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions:

#Divisibility and comparability&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The plausibility of a [[proposition]] is a real number and is dependent on information we have related to the proposition.
#Common sense&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Plausibilities should vary sensibly with the assessment of plausibilities in the model.
#Consistency&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; If the plausibility of a proposition can be derived in many ways, all the results must be equal.

The postulates as stated here are taken from Arnborg and Sjödin.&lt;ref name="AS1999"&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, ''On the foundations of Bayesianism,'' Preprint: Nada, KTH (1999) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/06arnborg.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/06arnborg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS2000a"&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, ''A note on the foundations of Bayesianism,'' Preprint: Nada, KTH (2000a) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobshle.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobshle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS2000b"&gt;Stefan Arnborg and Gunnar Sjödin, "Bayes rules in finite models," in ''European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,'' Berlin, (2000b) &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobc1.ps &amp;mdash; ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/documents/Theory/Stefan-Arnborg/fobc1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[Common sense]]" includes consistency with Aristotelian [[logic]] in the sense that logically equivalent propositions shall have the same plausibility.

The postulates as originally stated by Cox were not mathematically
rigorous (although better than the informal description above), e.g.,
as noted by Halpern.&lt;ref name="H99a"&gt;Joseph Y. Halpern, "A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine," ''Journal of AI research,'' 10, 67&amp;ndash;85 (1999) &amp;mdash; http://www.jair.org/media/536/live-536-2054-jair.ps.Z&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H99b"&gt;Joseph Y. Halpern, "Technical Addendum, Cox's theorem Revisited," ''Journal of AI research,'' 11, 429&amp;ndash;435 (1999) &amp;mdash; http://www.jair.org/media/644/live-644-1840-jair.ps.Z&lt;/ref&gt;  However it appears to be possible
to augment them with various mathematical assumptions made either
implicitly or explicitly by Cox to produce a valid proof.

Cox's notation:
:The plausibility of a proposition &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given some related information &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\mid X&lt;/math&gt;.

Cox's postulates and functional equations are:
*The plausibility of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; of two propositions &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, given some related information &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is determined by the plausibility of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and that of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;AX&lt;/math&gt;.
:In form of a [[functional equation]]
::&lt;math&gt;AB\mid X=g(A\mid X,B\mid AX)&lt;/math&gt;
:Because of the associative nature of the conjunction in propositional logic, the consistency with logic gives a functional equation saying that the function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is an [[associativity|associative]] binary operation.
*Additionally, Cox postulates the function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to be [[monotonic function|monotonic]].
:All strictly increasing associative binary operations on the real numbers are isomorphic to multiplication of numbers in the interval [0, 1], which means that there is a function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; mapping plausibilities to interval [0, 1] such that
::&lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid X)=w(A\mid X)w(B\mid AX)&lt;/math&gt;

*The plausibility of a proposition determines the plausibility of the proposition's [[negation]].
:This postulates the existence of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;w(\text{not } A\mid X)=f(w(A\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:Because "a double negative is an affirmative", consistency with logic gives a functional equation
::&lt;math&gt;f(f(x))=x,&lt;/math&gt;
:saying that the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Involution_(mathematics)#Involutions_in_mathematical_logic|involution]], i.e., it is its own inverse.
*Furthermore, Cox postulates the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be monotonic.

:The above functional equations and consistency with logic imply that
::&lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid X)=w(A\mid X)f(w(\text{not }B\mid AX))=w(A\mid X)f\left( {w(A\text{ not }B\mid X) \over w(A\mid X)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:Since &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt;, we also get
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)f\left( {w(A\text{ not }B\mid X) \over w(A\mid X)} \right)=w(B\mid X)f\left( {w(B\text{ not }A\mid X) \over w(B\mid X)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:If, in particular, &lt;math&gt;B=\text{ not }(AD)&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;A\text{ not } B = \text{not }B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\text{ not }A=\text{ not }A&lt;/math&gt; and we get
::&lt;math&gt;w(A\text{ not }B\mid X)=w(\text{not }B\mid X)=f(w(B\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;w(B\text{ not }A\mid X)=w(\text{not }A\mid X)=f(w(A\mid X))&lt;/math&gt;
:Abbreviating &lt;math&gt;w(A\mid X)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w(B\mid X)=y&lt;/math&gt; we get the functional equation
::&lt;math&gt;x\,f\left({f(y) \over x}\right)=y\,f\left({f(x) \over y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Implications of Cox's postulates==
The laws of probability derivable from these postulates are the following.&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003"&gt;[[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]], ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science,'' Cambridge University Press (2003). &amp;mdash;  preprint version (1996) at {{cite web

}}; Chapters 1 to 3 of published version at http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;A\mid B&lt;/math&gt; be the plausibility of the proposition &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; satisfying Cox's postulates. Then there is a function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; mapping plausibilities to interval [0,1] and a positive number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that

# Certainty is represented by &lt;math&gt;w(A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;w^m(A|B)+w^m(\text{not }A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;w(AB\mid C)=w(A\mid C)w(B\mid AC)=w(B\mid C)w(A\mid BC).&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the postulates imply only these general properties. We may recover the usual laws of probability by setting a new function, conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pr&lt;/math&gt;, equal to &lt;math&gt;w^m&lt;/math&gt;. Then we obtain the laws of probability in a more familiar form:

# Certain truth is represented by &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and certain falsehood by &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B)+\Pr(\text{not }A\mid B)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Pr(AB\mid C)=\Pr(A\mid C)\Pr(B\mid AC)=\Pr(B\mid C)\Pr(A\mid BC).&lt;/math&gt;

Rule 2 is a rule for negation, and rule 3 is a rule for conjunction. Given that any proposition containing conjunction, [[disjunction]], and negation can be equivalently rephrased using conjunction and negation alone (the [[conjunctive normal form]]), we can now handle any compound proposition.

The laws thus derived yield [[Measure (mathematics)|finite additivity]] of probability, but not [[Measure (mathematics)|countable additivity]]. The [[Probability axioms|measure-theoretic formulation of Kolmogorov]] assumes that a probability measure is countably additive. This slightly stronger condition is necessary for the proof of certain theorems{{Citation needed|reason=What theorems?|date=April 2017}}.

==Interpretation and further discussion==
Cox's theorem has come to be used as one of the [[theory of justification|justification]]s for the
use of [[Bayesian probability theory]].  For example, in Jaynes&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003" /&gt; it is
discussed in detail in chapters 1 and 2 and is a cornerstone for the
rest of the book.  Probability is interpreted as a [[formal system]] of
[[logic]], the natural extension of [[Aristotelian logic]] (in which every
statement is either true or false) into the realm of reasoning in the
presence of uncertainty.

It has been debated to what degree the theorem excludes alternative models for reasoning about [[uncertainty]].  For example, if certain "unintuitive" mathematical assumptions were dropped then alternatives could be devised, e.g., an example provided by Halpern.&lt;ref name="H99a" /&gt; However Arnborg and Sjödin&lt;ref name="AS1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AS2000a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AS2000b" /&gt; suggest additional
"common sense" postulates, which would allow the assumptions to be relaxed in some cases while still ruling out the Halpern example. Other approaches were devised by Hardy&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardy, "Scaled Boolean algebras", ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01968858 Advances in Applied Mathematics]'', August 2002, pages 243&amp;ndash;292 (or  [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.PR/0203249 preprint]); Hardy has said, "I assert there that I think Cox's assumptions are too strong, although I don't really say why. I do say what I would replace them with." (The quote is from a Wikipedia discussion page, not from the article.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Dupré and Tipler.&lt;ref name="rbp"&gt;Dupré, Maurice J. &amp; Tipler, Frank J. (2009). [http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340369856 "New Axioms for Rigorous Bayesian Probability"], ''Bayesian Analysis'', '''4'''(3): 599-606.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original formulation of Cox's theorem is in {{Harvtxt|Cox|1946}} which is extended with additional results and more discussion in {{Harvtxt|Cox|1961}}. Jaynes&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003" /&gt; cites Abel&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Henrik Abel]] "Untersuchung der Functionen zweier unabhängig veränderlichen Gröszen ''x'' und ''y'', wie ''f''(''x'', ''y''), welche die Eigenschaft haben, dasz ''f''[''z'', ''f''(''x'',''y'')] eine symmetrische Function von ''z'', ''x'' und ''y'' ist.", ''Jour. Reine u. angew. Math.'' (Crelle's Jour.), 1, 11&amp;ndash;15, (1826).&lt;/ref&gt; for the first known use of the associativity functional equation. Aczél&lt;ref&gt;[[János Aczél (mathematician)|János Aczél]], ''Lectures on Functional Equations and their Applications,'' Academic Press, New York, (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; provides a long proof of the "associativity equation" (pages 256-267). Jaynes&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003" /&gt;{{rp|27}} reproduces the shorter proof by Cox in which differentiability is assumed. A guide to Cox's theorem by Van Horn aims at comprehensively introducing the reader to all these references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Horn | first1 = K.

[[File:CyberneticsBook.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''''' is a book written by [[Norbert Wiener]] and published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.'' Paris, (Hermann &amp; Cie) &amp; Camb. Mass. (MIT Press) {{ISBN|978-0-262-73009-9}}; 1948, 2nd revised ed. 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first public usage of the term "[[cybernetics]]" to refer to self-regulating mechanisms. The book laid the theoretical foundation for [[servomechanism]]s (whether electrical, mechanical or hydraulic), automatic [[navigation]], [[analog computing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuroscience]], and reliable [[communications]].

A second edition with minor changes and two additional chapters was published in 1961.

==Reception==
The book aroused a considerable amount of public discussion and comment at the time of publication, unusual for a predominantly technical subject.
:"[A] beautifully written book, lucid, direct, and, despite its complexity, as readable by the layman as the trained scientist, if the former is willing to forego attempts to understand mathematical formulas."&lt;ref name=thurston&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Saturday Review of Literature: April 23, 1949|last1=Thurston|first1=John B.|title=Review: Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1949apr23-00024|accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"One of the most influential books of the twentieth century, ''Cybernetics'' has been acclaimed as one of the 'seminal works' comparable in ultimate importance to Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | title = Books That Make a Year's Reading and a Lifetime's Enrichment; A Year's Reading | author = John R. Platt
| work = New York Times | date = 1964-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Its scope and implications are breathtaking, and leaves the reviewer with the conviction that it is a major contribution to contemporary thought."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell L. Ackoff]]. Book Review: Cybernetics. Philosophy of Science 22 (1):68- (1955).  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185139  JSTOR link].&lt;/ref&gt;
:"''Cybernetics''... is worthwhile for its historical value alone. But it does much more by inspiring the contemporary roboticist to think broadly and be open to innovative applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpkins|first1=C.A; Simpkins, A.M.|title=On The Shelf|journal=Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine, IEEE|date=June 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=94–95|doi=10.1109/MRA.2012.2192815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public interest aroused by this book inspired Wiener to address the sociological and political issues raised in a book targeted at the non-technical reader, resulting in the publication in 1950 of ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]''.

==Synopsis==

===Introduction===
Wiener recounts that the origin of the ideas in this book is a ten-year-long series of meetings at the Harvard Medical School where medical scientists and physicians discussed scientific method with mathematicians, physicists and engineers.  He details the interdisciplinary nature of his approach and refers to his work with [[Vannevar Bush]] and his [[differential analyzer]] (a primitive [[analog computer]]), as well as his early thoughts on the features and design principles of future digital calculating machines. He traces the origins of cybernetic analysis to the philosophy of [[Leibniz]], citing his work on universal symbolism and a calculus of reasoning.

===Newtonian and Bergsonian Time===
The theme of this chapter is an exploration of the contrast between time-reversible processes governed by Newtonian mechanics and time-irreversible processes in accordance with the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. In the opening section he distinguishes the predictable nature of astronomy from the challenges posed in meteorology, anticipating future developments in [[Chaos theory]]. He points out that in fact, even in the case of astronomy, tidal forces between the planets introduce a degree of decay over cosmological time spans, and so strictly speaking Newtonian mechanics does not precisely apply.

===Groups and Statistical Mechanics===
This chapter opens with a review of the – entirely independent and apparently unrelated – work of two scientists in the early 20th century: [[Willard Gibbs]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]]. Gibbs was a physicist working on a statistical approach to Newtonian dynamics and [[thermodynamics]], and Lebesgue was a pure mathematician working on the theory of [[trigonometric series]]. Wiener suggests that the questions asked by Gibbs find their answer in the work of Lebesque. Weiner claims that the Lebesgue integral had unexpected but important implications in establishing the validity of Gibbs' work on the foundations of statistical mechanics. The notions of ''average'' and ''measure'' in the sense established by Lebesgue were urgently needed to provide a rigorous proof of Gibbs' [[ergodic hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, N., ''The Fourier Integral and Certain of its Applications.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The concept of [[entropy]] in [[statistical mechanics]] is developed, and its relationship to the way the concept is used in [[thermodynamics]]. By an analysis of the thought experiment [[Maxwell's demon]], he relates the concept of entropy to that of [[information theory|information]].

===Time Series, Information, and Communication===
This is one of the more mathematically intensive chapters in the book. It deals with the transmission or recording of a varying [[analog signal]] as a sequence of numerical samples, and lays much of the groundwork for the development of [[digital audio]] and [[telemetry]] over the past six decades. It also examines the relationship between [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]], and [[information theory|information capacity]], as developed by Wiener in collaboration with [[Claude Shannon]]. This chapter and the next one form the core of the foundational principles for the development of automation systems and digital communications and data processing which has taken place over the decades since the book was published.

===Feedback and Oscillation===
This chapter lays down the foundations for the mathematical treatment of [[negative feedback]] in automated control systems. The opening passage illustrates the effect of faulty feedback mechanisms by the example of patients suffering from various forms of [[ataxia]]. He then discusses railway signalling, the operation of a [[thermostat]], and a [[steam engine]] [[centrifugal governor]]. The rest of the chapter is mostly taken up with the development of a mathematical formulation of the operation of the principles underlying all of these processes. More complex systems are then discussed such as automated navigation, and the control of [[non-linear]] situations such as steering on an icy road. He concludes with a reference to the [[homeostatic]] processes in living organisms.

===Computing Machines and the Nervous System===
This chapter opens with a discussion of the relative merits of [[analog computers]] and [[digital computers]] (which Wiener referred to as ''analogy machines'' and ''numerical machines''), and maintains that digital machines will be more accurate, electronic implementations will be superior to mechanical or electro-mechanical ones, and that the [[binary number|binary]] system is preferable to other numerical scales. After discussing the need to store both the data to be processed and the [[algorithms]] which are employed for processing that data, and the challenges involved in implementing a suitable [[computer memory|memory]] system, he goes on to draw the parallels between binary digital computers and the [[nerve]] structures in organisms.

Among the mechanisms that he speculated for implementing a computer memory system was "a large array of small condensers [ie [[capacitor]]s in today's terminology] which could be rapidly charged or discharged", thus prefiguring the essential technology of modern [[dynamic random-access memory]] chips.

Virtually all of the principles which Wiener enumerated as being desirable characteristics of calculating and data processing machines have been adopted in the design of digital computers, from the early mainframes of the 1950s to the latest microchips.

===Gestalt and Universals===
This brief chapter is a philosophical enquiry into the relationship between the physical events in the [[central nervous system]] and the subjective experiences of the individual. It concentrates principally on the processes whereby nervous signals from the [[retina]] are transformed into a representation of the visual field. It also explores the various feedback loops involved in the operation of the eyes: the homeostatic operation of the retina to control light levels, the adjustment of the lens to bring objects into focus, and the complex set of [[reflex]] movements to bring an object of attention into the detailed vision area of the [[fovea centralis|fovea]].
The chapter concludes with an outline of the challenges presented by attempts to implement a reading machine for the blind.

===Cybernetics and Psychopathology===
Wiener opens this chapter with the disclaimers that he is neither a psychopathologist nor a psychiatrist, and that he is not asserting that mental problems are failings of the brain to operate as a computing machine. However, he suggests that there might be fruitful lines of enquiry opened by considering the parallels between the brain and a computer. (He employed the archaic-sounding phrase "computing machine", because at the time of writing the word "computer" referred to a person who is employed to perform routine calculations). He then discussed the concept of 'redundancy' in the sense of having two or three computing mechanisms operating simultaneously on the same problem, so that errors may be recognised and corrected.

===Information, Language, and Society===
Starting with an outline of the hierarchical nature of living organisms, and a discussion of the structure and organisation of colonies of [[symbiotic]] organisms, such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]], this chapter explores the parallels with the structure of human societies, and the challenges faced as the scale and complexity of society increases.

The Chapter closes with speculation about the possibility of constructing a [[Computer chess|chess-playing machine]], and concludes that it would be conceivable to build a machine capable of a standard of play better than most human players but not at expert level.  Such a possibility seemed entirely fanciful to most commentators in the 1940s, bearing in mind the state of computing technology at the time, although events have turned out to vindicate the prediction – and even to exceed it.

===On Learning and Self-Reproducing Machines===
Starting with an examination of the learning process in organisms, Wiener expands the discussion to [[John von Neumann]]'s [[Game theory|theory of games]], and the application to military situations. He then speculates about the manner in which a chess-playing computer could be programmed to analyse its past performances and improve its performance. This proceeds to a discussion of the evolution of conflict, as in the examples of [[matador]] and bull, or mongoose and cobra, or between opponents in a tennis game. He discusses various stories such as [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]], which illustrate the literal-minded nature of "magical" processes, the context being the drawing of attention to the need for caution in delegating to machines the responsibility for warfare strategy in an age of [[Nuclear weapons]]. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the possibility of [[self-replicating machines]] and the work of Professor [[Dennis Gabor]] in this area.

===Brain Waves and Self-Organising Systems===
This chapter opens with a discussion of the mechanism of [[evolution]] by [[Natural Selection]], which he refers to as "''phylogenetic learning''", since it is driven by a feedback mechanism caused by the success or otherwise in surviving and reproducing; and modifications of behaviour over a lifetime in response to experience, which he calls "''ontogenetic learning''". He suggests that both processes involve [[non-linear]] feedback, and speculates that the learning process is correlated with changes in patterns of the rhythms of the waves of electrical activity that can be observed on an electroencephalograph. After a discussion of the technical limitations of earlier designs of such equipment, he suggests that the field will become more fruitful as more sensitive interfaces and higher performance amplifiers are developed and the readings are stored in digital form for numerical analysis, rather than recorded by pen galvanometers in real time - which was the only available technique at the time of writing. He then develops suggestions for a mathematical treatment of the waveforms by [[Fourier analysis]], and draws a parallel with the processing of the results of the [[Michelson-Morley]] experiment which confirmed the constancy of the [[velocity of light]], which in turn led [[Einstein]] to develop the [[Theory of Special Relativity]]. As with much of the other material in this book, these pointers have been both prophetic of future developments and suggestive of fruitful lines of research and enquiry.

==Influence==
The book provided a foundation for research into [[electronic engineering]], [[computing]] (both [[analog computer|analog]] and [[digital computer|digital]]), [[servomechanism]]s, [[automation]], [[telecommunications]] and [[neuroscience]]. It also created widespread public debates on the technical, [[philosophical]] and [[sociological]] issues it discussed. And it inspired a wide range of books on various subjects peripherally related to its content.

The book introduced the word 'cybernetics' itself into public discourse.

[[Maxwell Maltz]] titled his pioneering self-development work "''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]''" in reference to the process of steering oneself towards a pre-defined goal by making corrections to behaviour. Much of the [[personal development]] industry and the [[Human potential movement]] is said to be derived from Maltz's work.

''Cybernetics'' became a surprise bestseller and was widely read beyond the technical audience that Wiener had expected. In response he wrote ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'' in which he further explored the social and psychological implications in a format more suited to the non-technical reader.

In 1954, [[Marie Neurath]] produced a children's book ''Machines which seem to Think'' [http://www.fulltable.com/iso/mw.htm], which introduced the concepts of ''Cybernetics'', [[control systems]] and [[negative feedback]] in an accessible format.

In [[number theory]], the '''diamond operators''' 〈''d''〉 are operators acting on the space of [[modular form]]s for the [[group (mathematics)|group]] Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''), given by the action of a matrix ({{su|p=a b|b=c d}}) in  Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''). The diamond operators form an [[abelian group]] and commute with the [[Hecke operator]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">In [[coding theory]], the '''weight enumerator polynomial''' of a binary [[linear code]] specifies the number of words of each possible  [[Hamming weight]].

Let &lt;math&gt;C \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n&lt;/math&gt; be a binary linear code length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''weight distribution''' is the sequence of numbers

:&lt;math&gt; A_t = \#\{c \in C \mid w(c) = t \} &lt;/math&gt;

giving the number of [[codeword]]s ''c'' in ''C'' having weight ''t'' as ''t'' ranges from 0 to ''n''.  The '''weight enumerator''' is the bivariate [[polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt; W(C;x,y) = \sum_{w=0}^n A_w x^w y^{n-w}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic properties==
#&lt;math&gt; W(C;0,1) = A_{0}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; W(C;1,1) = \sum_{w=0}^{n}A_{w}=|C| &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; W(C;1,0) = A_{n}= 1 \mbox{ if } (1,\ldots,1)\in C\ \mbox{ and } 0 \mbox{ otherwise} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; W(C;1,-1) = \sum_{w=0}^{n}A_{w}(-1)^{n-w} = A_{n}+(-1)^{1}A_{n-1}+\ldots+(-1)^{n-1}A_{1}+(-1)^{n}A_{0} &lt;/math&gt;

==MacWilliams identity==
Denote the [[dual code]] of &lt;math&gt;C \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;C^\perp = \{x \in \mathbb{F}_2^n \,\mid\, \langle x,c\rangle = 0 \mbox{  }\forall c \in C \} &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;\langle\ ,\ \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vector [[dot product]] and which is taken over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;).

The '''MacWilliams identity''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;W(C^\perp;x,y) = \frac{1}{\mid C \mid} W(C;y-x,y+x). &lt;/math&gt;

The identity is named after [[Jessie MacWilliams]].

==Distance enumerator==
The '''distance distribution''' or '''inner distribution''' of a code ''C'' of size ''M'' and length ''n'' is the sequence of numbers

:&lt;math&gt; A_i = \frac{1}{M} \# \left\lbrace (c_1,c_2) \in C \times C \mid d(c_1,c_2) = i \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' ranges from 0 to ''n''.  The '''distance enumerator polynomial''' is

:&lt;math&gt; A(C;x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^n A_i x^i y^{n-i} &lt;/math&gt;

and when ''C'' is linear this is equal to the weight enumerator.

The '''outer distribution''' of ''C'' is the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-by-''n''+1 matrix ''B'' with rows indexed by elements of GF(2)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and columns indexed by integers 0...''n'', and entries

:&lt;math&gt; B_{x,i} = \# \left\lbrace c \in C \mid d(c,x) = i \right\rbrace . &lt;/math&gt;

The sum of the rows of ''B'' is ''M'' times the inner distribution vector (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

A code ''C'' is '''regular''' if the rows of ''B'' corresponding to the codewords of ''C'' are all equal.

A '''European Study Group with Industry (ESGI)''' is usually a week-long meeting where applied mathematicians work on problems presented by industry and research centres. The aim of the meeting is to solve or at least make progress on the problems.

The study group concept originated in Oxford, in 1968 (initiated by [[Leslie Fox]] and [[Alan B Tayler|Alan Tayler]]). Subsequently, the format was adopted in other European countries to form ESGIs. Currently, with a variety of names, they appear in the same or a similar format throughout the world. More specific topics have also formed the subject of focussed meetings, such as the environment, medicine and agriculture.

Problems successfully tackled at study groups are discussed in a number of textbooks as well as a collection of case studies, European Success Stories in Industrial Mathematics. A guide for organising and running study groups is provided by the [[:fr:European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry]].

== European Study Group with Industry ==

A European Study Group with Industry or ESGI is a type of workshop where mathematicians work on problems presented by industry representatives. The meetings typically last five days, from Monday to Friday. On the Monday morning the industry representatives present problems of current interest to an audience of applied mathematicians. Subsequently, the mathematicians split into working groups to investigate the suggested topics. On the Friday solutions and results are presented back to the industry representative. After the meeting a report is prepared for the company, detailing the progress made and usually with suggestions for further work or experiments.

== History ==

The original Study Groups with Industry started in Oxford in 1968. The format provided a method for initiating interaction between universities and private industry which often led to further collaboration, student projects and new fields of research (many advances in the field of free or moving boundary problems are attributed to the industrial case studies of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=C.M.|last2=Ockendon|first2=J.R.|title=Weak and variational methods for free and moving boundary problems|date=1982|publisher=Pitman Publishing|isbn=0-273-08503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Study groups were later adopted in other countries, starting in Europe and then spreading throughout the world. The subject areas have also diversified, for example the Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-medicine.org/|title=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|last=|first=|date=|website=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpib.ac.uk/outreach/mpssg/|title=Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the environment, uncertainty quantification and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-industry.org/past/|title=Mathematics in Industry {{!}} Past Study Groups|last=Bentahar|first=K.|website=www.maths-in-industry.org|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academics work on the problems for free. The following have been given as motivation for this work:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/conferences/misgsa2016/|title=South African Maths in Industry Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Discovering new problems and research areas with practical applications.
# The possibility of further projects and collaboration with industry.
# The opportunity for future funding.

A number of reasons have also been quoted for companies to attend ESGIs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miis.maths.ox.ac.uk/how/|title=Maths in Industry Information Service, How|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The possibility of a quick solution to their problem, or at least guidance on a way forward.
# Mathematicians can help to identify and correctly formulate a problem for further study.
# Access to state-of-the-art techniques.
# Building contacts with top researchers in a given field.

ESGIs are currently an activity of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI|title=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/|website=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ESGI webpage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI ESGI|title=Study Groups|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/study-groups/|website=Study Groups|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains details of European meetings and contact details for prospective industry or academics participants. The current co-ordinator of the ESGIs is Prof. Tim Myers of the [[Centre de Recerca Matemàtica|Centre de Recerca Matemática]], Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre de Recerca Matemática|url=http://www.crm.cat||website=CRM|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2015 and 2019 ESGIs are eligible for funding through the COST network MI-Net (Maths for Industry Network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematics for Industry Network|url=https://mi-network.org/|website=MI-Net|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| footer    = Two [[completion (ring theory)|completions]] of the rational numbers, the [[p-adic numbers|dyadic numbers]] (here, only the dyadic integers are shown) and the [[real numbers]]. The Hasse-Minkowski theorem gives a relationship between [[quadratic form]]s in a [[number field]] and in the completions of the number field.

The '''Hasse–Minkowski theorem''' is a fundamental result in [[number theory]] which states that two [[quadratic form]]s over a [[number field]] are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent ''locally at all places'', i.e. equivalent over every [[completion (ring theory)|completion]] of the field (which may be [[real number|real]], [[complex number|complex]], or [[p-adic number|p-adic]]). A related result is that a [[quadratic space]] over a number field is [[isotropic quadratic form|isotropic]] if and only if it is isotropic locally everywhere, or equivalently, that a quadratic form over a number field nontrivially represents zero if and only if this holds for all completions of the field. The theorem was proved in the case of the field of [[rational number]]s by [[Hermann Minkowski]] and generalized to number fields by [[Helmut Hasse]]. The same statement holds even more generally for all [[global field]]s.

==Importance==

The importance of the Hasse–Minkowski theorem lies in the novel paradigm it presented for answering arithmetical questions: in order to determine whether an equation of a certain type has a solution in rational numbers, it is sufficient to test whether it has solutions over complete fields of real and ''p''-adic numbers, where analytic considerations, such as [[Newton's method]] and its ''p''-adic analogue, [[Hensel's lemma]], apply. This is encapsulated in the idea of a [[local-global principle]], which is one of the most fundamental techniques in [[arithmetic geometry]].

== Application to the classification of quadratic forms ==

The Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of classifying quadratic forms over a number field ''K'' up to equivalence to the set of analogous but much simpler questions over [[local field]]s. Basic invariants of a nonsingular quadratic form are its '''dimension''', which is a positive integer, and its '''discriminant''' modulo the squares in '''K''', which is an element of the multiplicative group  '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/'''K'''&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, for every [[place (mathematics)|place]] ''v'' of ''K'', there is an invariant coming from the completion '''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on the choice of ''v'', this completion may be the [[real number]]s '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', or a [[p-adic number]] field, each of which has different kinds of invariants:
* ''Case of'' '''R'''.  By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the signature (or, alternatively, the negative index of inertia) is a complete invariant.
* ''Case of'' '''C'''.  All nonsingular quadratic forms of the same dimension are equivalent.
* ''Case of'' '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ''and its [[algebraic extension]]s''. Forms of the same dimension are classified up to equivalence by their [[Hasse invariant of a quadratic form|Hasse invariant]].

These invariants must satisfy some compatibility conditions: a parity relation (the sign of the discriminant must match the negative index of inertia) and a product formula (a local–global relation). Conversely, for every set of invariants satisfying these relations, there is a quadratic form over '''K''' with these invariants.

See in particular Section 2.5, "Helly Property", [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Y9NCwlx63IC&amp;pg=PA393 pp.&amp;nbsp;393–394].&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts are named after [[Eduard Helly]] (1884 - 1943); [[Helly's theorem]] on [[convex set]]s, which gave rise to this notion, states that convex sets in [[Euclidean space]] of dimension ''n'' are a Helly family of order ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="b86"/&gt; The number ''k'' is frequently omitted from these names in the case that ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

== Examples ==
* In the family of all subsets of the set {a,b,c,d}, the subfamily {{a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d}} has an empty intersection, but removing any set from this subfamily causes it to have a nonempty intersection. Therefore, it is a minimal subfamily with an empty intersection. It has four sets in it, and is the largest possible minimal subfamily with an empty intersection, so the family of all subsets of the set {a,b,c,d} is a Helly family of order 4.
* Let I be a finite set of closed [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of the [[real line]] with an empty intersection. Let A be the interval whose left endpoint ''a'' is as large as possible, and let B be the interval whose right endpoint ''b'' is as small as possible. Then, if ''a'' were less than or equal to ''b'', all numbers in the range [''a'',''b''] would belong to all intervals of I, violating the assumption that the intersection of I is empty, so it must be the case that ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b''. Thus, the two-interval subfamily {A,B} has an empty intersection, and the family I cannot be minimal unless I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{A,B}. Therefore, all minimal families of intervals with empty intersections have two or fewer intervals in them, showing that the set of all intervals is a Helly family of order 2.&lt;ref&gt;This is the one-dimensional case of Helly's theorem. For essentially this proof, with a colorful phrasing involving sleeping students, see {{citation|title=Mathematical Miniatures|volume=43|series=New Mathematical Library|first1=Svetoslav|last1=Savchev|first2=Titu|last2=Andreescu|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2003|isbn=9780883856451|contribution=27 Helly's Theorem for One Dimension|pages=104–106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnkiAW6VQUAC&amp;pg=PA104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The family of infinite [[arithmetic progression]]s of [[integer]]s also has the 2-Helly property. That is, whenever a finite collection of progressions has the property that no two of them are disjoint, then there exists an integer that belongs to all of them; this is the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].&lt;ref name="d95"/&gt;

== Formal definition ==

More formally, a '''Helly family of order ''k''''' is a [[set system]] (''F'',&amp;nbsp;''E''), with ''F'' a collection of [[subset]]s of ''E'', such that, for every finite ''G'' ⊆ ''F'' with 

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{X\in G} X=\varnothing,&lt;/math&gt;

we can find ''H'' ⊆ ''G'' such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{X\in H} X=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\left|H\right|\le k.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="b86"/&gt;

In some cases, the same definition holds for every subcollection ''G'', regardless of finiteness. However, this is a more restrictive condition. For instance, the [[open interval]]s of the real line satisfy the Helly property for finite subcollections, but not for infinite subcollections: the intervals (0,1/''i'') (for ''i'' = 0, 1, 2, ...) have pairwise nonempty intersections, but have an empty overall intersection.

== Helly dimension ==
If a family of sets is a Helly family of order ''k'', that family is said to have '''Helly number''' ''k''. The '''Helly dimension''' of a [[metric space]] is one less than the Helly number of the family of metric balls in that space; Helly's theorem implies that the Helly dimension of a Euclidean space equals its dimension as a real [[vector space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Excursions Into Combinatorial Geometry|first=Horst|last=Martini|publisher=Springer|year=1997|isbn=9783540613411|pages=92–93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0LHc-DoBHgC&amp;pg=PA92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helly dimension''' of a subset S of a Euclidean space, such as a polyhedron, is one less than the Helly number of the family of [[Translation (geometry)|translates]] of S.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Classical Topics in Discrete Geometry|first=Károly|last=Bezdek|authorlink=Károly Bezdek|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9781441906007|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tov0d9VMOfMC&amp;pg=PA27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Helly dimension of any [[hypercube]] is 1, even though such a shape may belong to a Euclidean space of much higher dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Helly dimension has also been applied to other mathematical objects. For instance {{harvtxt|Domokos|2007}} defines the Helly dimension of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] (an algebraic structure formed by an invertible and associative binary operation) to be one less than the Helly number of the family of [[Coset|left cosets]] of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== The Helly property ==

If a family of nonempty sets has an empty intersection, its Helly number must be at least two, so the smallest ''k'' for which the ''k''-Helly property is nontrivial is ''k'' = 2.
The 2-Helly property is also known as the '''Helly property'''. A 2-Helly family is also known as a '''Helly family'''.&lt;ref name="b86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d95"/&gt;

A [[convex metric|convex]] [[metric space]] in which the closed [[Ball (mathematics)|balls]] have the 2-Helly property (that is, a space with Helly dimension 1, in the stronger variant of Helly dimension for infinite subcollections) is called [[injective metric space|injective]] or hyperconvex.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Distances|first1=Michel Marie|last1=Deza|author1-link=Michel Deza|first2=Elena|last2=Deza|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9783642309588|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxX2CX5OVMsC&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the [[tight span]] allows any metric space to be embedded isometrically into a space with Helly dimension 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">A '''higraph''' is a diagramming object that formalizes relations into a visual structure, it was developed by [[David Harel]] in 1988. Higraphs extend [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|mathematical graphs]] by including notions of [[:wikt:depth|depth]] and [[orthogonality]]. In particular, [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]] in a higraph can contain other nodes inside them, creating a hierarchy. The idea was initially developed for applications to [[databases]], [[knowledge representation]], and the behavioral specification of complex [[concurrent systems]] using the higraph-based language of statecharts.

Higraphs are widely used in industrial applications like [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]. Recently they have been used by [[philosophers]] to formally study the use of [[diagrams]] in [[mathematical proof]]s and reasoning.

{{General geometry}}

[[Geometry]] (from the {{lang-grc|γεωμετρία}}; ''[[wikt:γῆ|geo-]]'' "earth", ''[[wikt:μέτρον|-metron]]'' "measurement") arose as the field of knowledge dealing with spatial relationships. Geometry was one of the two fields of pre-modern [[mathematics]], the other being the study of numbers ([[arithmetic]]).

Classic geometry was focused in [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge constructions]]. Geometry was revolutionized by [[Euclid]], who introduced [[mathematical rigor]] and the [[axiomatic method]] still in use today. His book, ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]'' is widely considered the most influential textbook of all time, and was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders: 1990 ({{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}), p.&amp;nbsp;141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, geometric concepts have been generalized to a high level of abstraction and complexity, and have been subjected to the methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are barely recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. (See [[Areas of mathematics]] and [[Algebraic geometry]].)

==Early geometry==
The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to early peoples, who discovered obtuse triangles in the [[Indus Valley Civilization|ancient Indus Valley]] (see [[Indian mathematics#Harappan Mathematics(3300 BC - 1500 BC)|Harappan Mathematics]]), and ancient [[Babylonia]] (see [[Babylonian mathematics]]) from around 3000 BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in [[surveying]], [[construction]], [[astronomy]], and various crafts. Among these were some surprisingly sophisticated principles, and a modern mathematician might be hard put to derive some of them without the use of [[calculus]]. For example, both the [[Egyptians]] and the [[Babylon]]ians were aware of versions of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] about 1500 years before [[Pythagoras]] and the Indian [[Sulba Sutras]] around 800 B.C. contained the first statements of the theorem; the Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of a [[frustum]] of a square pyramid;

===Egyptian geometry===
{{main|Egyptian geometry}}

The ancient Egyptians knew that they could approximate the area of a circle as follows:&lt;ref name="School Mathematics"&gt;Ray C. Jurgensen, Alfred J. Donnelly, and Mary P. Dolciani. Editorial Advisors Andrew M. Gleason, Albert E. Meder, Jr. ''Modern School Mathematics: Geometry'' (Student's Edition). Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;52. {{ISBN|0-395-13102-2}}. Teachers Edition {{ISBN|0-395-13103-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

::::Area of Circle ≈ [ (Diameter) x 8/9 ]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Problem 30 of the [[Ahmes]] papyrus uses these methods to calculate the area of a circle, according to a rule that the area is equal to the square of 8/9 of the circle's diameter. This assumes that [[pi|{{pi}}]] is 4&amp;times;(8/9)² (or 3.160493...), with an error of slightly over 0.63 percent. This value was slightly less accurate than the calculations of the [[Babylonia]]ns (25/8 = 3.125, within 0.53 percent), but was not otherwise surpassed until [[Archimedes]]' approximation of 211875/67441 = 3.14163, which had an error of just over 1 in 10,000.

Ahmes knew of the modern 22/7 as an approximation for {{pi}}, and used it to split a hekat, hekat x 22/x x 7/22 = hekat;{{cn|date=July 2018}} however, Ahmes continued to use the traditional 256/81 value for {{pi}} for computing his hekat volume found in a cylinder.

Problem 48 involved using a square with side 9 units. This square was cut into a 3x3 grid. The diagonal of the corner squares were used to make an irregular octagon with an area of 63 units. This gave a second value for {{pi}} of 3.111...

The two problems together indicate a range of values for {{pi}} between 3.11 and 3.16.

Problem 14 in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] gives the only ancient example finding the volume of a [[frustum]] of a pyramid, describing the correct formula:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{3} h(x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 +x_2^2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Babylonian geometry===
{{main|Babylonian mathematics}}

The Babylonians may have known the general rules for measuring areas and volumes. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if ''[[π]]'' is estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] was also known to the Babylonians. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used ''π'' as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been recent discoveries showing that ancient Babylonians may have discovered astronomical geometry nearly 1400 years before Europeans did.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/28/clay-tablets-reveal-babylonians-invented-astronomical-geometry-1400-years-before-europeans/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedic India===

[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Rigveda]]'' manuscript in [[Devanagari]].]]
The Indian [[Vedic period]] had a tradition of geometry, mostly expressed in the construction of elaborate altars.
Early Indian texts (1st millennium BC) on this topic include the   ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' and  the ''[[Shulba Sutras|Śulba Sūtras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Seidenberg, 1978. The origin of mathematics. Archive for the history of Exact Sciences, vol 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Staal|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most mathematical problems considered in the ''Śulba Sūtras'' spring from "a single theological requirement,"  that of constructing fire altars which have different shapes but occupy the same area. The altars were required to be constructed of five layers of burnt brick, with the further condition that each layer consist of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers have congruent arrangements of bricks. {{Harv|Hayashi|2003|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to {{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}, the ''Śulba Sūtras'' contain "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians." &lt;blockquote&gt;The diagonal rope (''{{IAST|akṣṇayā-rajju}}'') of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank (''pārśvamāni'') and the horizontal (''{{IAST|tiryaṇmānī}}'') &lt;ropes&gt; produce separately."&lt;ref name=hayashi2005-p363&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
They contain lists of [[Pythagorean triples]],&lt;ref&gt;Pythagorean triples are triples of integers &lt;math&gt; (a,b,c) &lt;/math&gt; with the property: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;3^2+4^2=5^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8^2+15^2=17^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;12^2+35^2=37^2&lt;/math&gt; etc.&lt;/ref&gt; which are particular cases of [[Diophantine equations]].&lt;ref name=cooke198&gt;{{Harv|Cooke|2005|p=198}}: "The arithmetic content of the ''Śulva Sūtras'' consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (12, 35, 37). It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain "Diophantine" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others."&lt;/ref&gt;
They also contain statements (that with hindsight we know to be approximate) about [[squaring the circle]] and "circling the square."&lt;ref name=cooke199-200&gt;{{Harv|Cooke|2005|pp=199–200}}: "The requirement of three altars of equal areas but different shapes would explain the interest in transformation of areas. Among other transformation of area problems the Hindus considered in particular the problem of squaring the circle. The ''Bodhayana Sutra'' states the converse problem of constructing a circle equal to a given square. The following approximate construction is given as the solution.... this result is only approximate. The authors, however, made no distinction between the two results. In terms that we can appreciate, this construction gives a value for π of 18&amp;thinsp;(3&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2{{radic|2}}), which is about 3.088."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baudhayana|''Baudhayana Sulba Sutra'']], the best-known and oldest of the ''Sulba Sutras'' (dated to the 8th or 7th century BC)  contains examples of simple Pythagorean triples, such as: &lt;math&gt;(3, 4, 5)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(5, 12, 13)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(8, 15, 17)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;
(7, 24, 25)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(12, 35, 37)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph229&gt;{{Harv|Joseph|2000|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a statement of the Pythagorean theorem for the sides of a square: "The rope which is stretched across the diagonal of a square produces an area double the size of the original square."&lt;ref name=joseph229/&gt; It also contains the general statement of the Pythagorean theorem (for the sides of a rectangle): "The rope stretched along the length of the diagonal of a rectangle makes an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together."&lt;ref name=joseph229/&gt;

According to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet [[Plimpton 322]] written c. 1850 BC&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics Department, University of British Columbia, [http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m446-03/pl322/pl322.html ''The Babylonian tabled Plimpton 322''].&lt;/ref&gt; "contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple,&lt;ref&gt;Three positive integers &lt;math&gt;(a, b, c) &lt;/math&gt; form a ''primitive'' Pythagorean triple if &lt;math&gt; c^2=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; and if the highest common factor of &lt;math&gt; a, b, c &lt;/math&gt; is 1. In the particular Plimpton322 example, this means that &lt;math&gt; 13500^2+ 12709^2= 18541^2 &lt;/math&gt; and that the three numbers do not have any common factors. However some scholars have disputed the Pythagorean interpretation of this tablet; see Plimpton 322 for details.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic" in Mesopotamia in 1850 BC. "Since these tablets predate the Sulbasutras period by several centuries, taking into account the contextual appearance of some of the triples, it is reasonable to expect that similar understanding would have been there in India."&lt;ref name=dani&gt;{{Harv|Dani|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dani goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "As the main objective of the ''Sulvasutras'' was to describe the constructions of altars and the geometric principles involved in them, the subject of Pythagorean triples, even if it had been well understood may still not have featured in the ''Sulvasutras''. The occurrence of the triples in the ''Sulvasutras'' is comparable to mathematics that one may encounter in an introductory book on architecture or another similar applied area, and
would not correspond directly to the overall knowledge on the topic at that time. Since, unfortunately, no other contemporaneous sources have been found it may never be possible to settle this issue satisfactorily."&lt;ref name=dani/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In all, three ''Sulba Sutras'' were composed. The remaining two, the ''Manava Sulba Sutra'' composed by [[Manava]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 750-650 BC) and the ''Apastamba Sulba Sutra'', composed by [[Apastamba]] (c. 600 BC), contained results similar to the ''Baudhayana Sulba Sutra''.

==Greek geometry==
{{see also|Greek mathematics}}

===Classical Greek geometry===
For the ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[Greek mathematics|mathematicians]], geometry was the crown jewel of their sciences, reaching a completeness and perfection of methodology that no other branch of their knowledge had attained. They expanded the range of geometry to many new kinds of figures, curves, surfaces, and solids; they changed its methodology from trial-and-error to logical deduction; they recognized that geometry studies [[Substantial form|"eternal forms"]], or abstractions, of which physical objects are only approximations; and they developed the idea of the [[axiomatic system|"axiomatic method"]], still in use today.

====Thales and Pythagoras====
[[Image:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|[[Pythagorean theorem]]: ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]
[[Thales]] (635-543 BC) of [[Miletus]] (now in southwestern Turkey), was the first to whom deduction in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote deductive proofs, though his proofs have not survived. [[Pythagoras]] (582-496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and traveled to [[Babylon]] and [[Egypt]]. The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he was probably one of the first to give a deductive proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable lengths]] and [[irrational number]]s.

====Plato====
[[Plato]] (427-347 BC) is a philosopher that is highly esteemed by the Greeks. There is a story that he had inscribed above the entrance to his famous school, "Let none ignorant of geometry enter here." However, the story is considered to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cherowitzo|first1=Bill|title=What precisely was written over the door of Plato's Academy?|url=http://www.math.ucdenver.edu/~jloats/APresentations_2010/PlatosAcademy_Jim's10.ppt.pdf|website=www.math.ucdenver.edu/|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was not a mathematician himself, his views on mathematics had great influence. Mathematicians thus accepted his belief that geometry should use no tools but compass and straightedge – never measuring instruments such as a marked [[ruler]] or a [[protractor]], because these were a workman’s tools, not worthy of a scholar. This dictum led to a deep study of possible [[compass and straightedge]] constructions, and three classic construction problems: how to use these tools to [[trisect an angle]], to construct a cube twice the volume of a given cube, and to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. The proofs of the impossibility of these constructions, finally achieved in the 19th century, led to important principles regarding the deep structure of the real number system. [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC), Plato’s greatest pupil, wrote a treatise on methods of reasoning used in deductive proofs (see [[Logic]]) which was not substantially improved upon until the 19th century.

[[Image:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|''Woman teaching geometry''. Illustration at the beginning of a medieval translation of Euclid's [[Element (mathematics)|Elements]], (c. 1310)]]
&lt;!--[[Image:Title page of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's Elements, 1570 (560x900).jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[frontispiece]] of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's ''Elements'', 1570]]--&gt;
[[Euclid]] (c. 325-265 BC), of [[Alexandria]], probably a student at the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements of Geometry]]'', in which he presented geometry in an ideal [[axiom]]atic form, which came to be known as [[Euclidean geometry]]. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the [[Hellenistic]] mathematicians knew at the time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid’s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, but it was so much superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]], King of Egypt.

''The Elements'' began with definitions of terms, fundamental geometric principles (called ''axioms'' or ''postulates''), and general quantitative principles (called ''common notions'') from which all the rest of geometry could be logically deduced. Following are his five axioms, somewhat paraphrased to make the English easier to read.

# Any two points can be joined by a straight line.
# Any finite straight line can be extended in a straight line.
# A circle can be drawn with any center and any radius.
# All right angles are equal to each other.
# If two straight lines in a plane are crossed by another straight line (called the transversal), and the interior angles between the two lines and the transversal lying on one side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then on that side of the transversal, the two lines extended will intersect (also called the [[parallel postulate]]).

Concepts, that are now understood as [[algebra]], were expressed geometrically by Euclid, a method referred to as [[Greek geometric algebra]].

====Archimedes====

[[Archimedes]] (287-212 BC), of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]], when it was a [[Greek city-state]], is often considered to be the greatest of the Greek mathematicians, and occasionally even named as one of the three greatest of all time (along with [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]). Had he not been a mathematician, he would still be remembered as a great physicist, engineer, and inventor. In his mathematics, he developed methods very similar to the coordinate systems of analytic geometry, and the limiting process of integral calculus. The only element lacking for the creation of these fields was an efficient algebraic notation in which to express his concepts{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

====After Archimedes====
[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Geometry was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]]. The [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].]]
After Archimedes, Hellenistic mathematics began to decline. There were a few minor stars yet to come, but the golden age of geometry was over. [[Proclus]] (410-485), author of ''Commentary on the First Book of Euclid'', was one of the last important players in Hellenistic geometry. He was a competent geometer, but more importantly, he was a superb commentator on the works that preceded him. Much of that work did not survive to modern times, and is known to us only through his commentary. The Roman Republic and Empire that succeeded and absorbed the Greek city-states produced excellent engineers, but no mathematicians of note.

The great [[Library of Alexandria]] was later burned. There is a growing consensus among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's pagan temples in the late 4th century was probably the most severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar's invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000-70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as [[Luciano Canfora]] argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that there is ample evidence that both existed later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Canfora]]; ''The Vanished Library''; University of California Press, 1990. - [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6NsoT1akU4C books.google.com.br]&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil wars, decreasing investments in maintenance and acquisition of new scrolls and generally declining interest in non-religious pursuits likely contributed to a reduction in the body of material available in the Library, especially in the 4th century. The Serapeum was certainly destroyed by Theophilus in 391, and the Museum and Library may have fallen victim to the same campaign.

==Classical Indian geometry==

In the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero."&lt;ref name=hayashi2005-371&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.

[[Brahmagupta]] wrote his astronomical work ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|{{IAST|Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta}}]]'' in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 [[Sanskrit]] verses, was divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain).&lt;ref name=hayashi2003-p121-122&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2003|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]]:&lt;ref name=hayashi2003-p121-122/&gt;

'''Brahmagupta's theorem:''' If a cyclic quadrilateral has diagonals that are [[perpendicular]] to each other, then the perpendicular line drawn from the point of intersection of the diagonals to any side of the quadrilateral always bisects the opposite side.

Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of [[Heron's formula]]), as well as a complete description of [[rational triangle]]s (''i.e.'' triangles with rational sides and rational areas).

'''Brahmagupta's formula:''' The area, ''A'', of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', respectively, is given by

: &lt;math&gt; A = \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'', the [[semiperimeter]], given by: &lt;math&gt; s=\frac{a+b+c+d}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Brahmagupta's Theorem on rational triangles:''' A triangle with rational sides &lt;math&gt;a, b, c &lt;/math&gt; and rational area is of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{u^2}{v}+v, \ \ b=\frac{u^2}{w}+w, \ \ c=\frac{u^2}{v}+\frac{u^2}{w} - (v+w) &lt;/math&gt;
for some rational numbers &lt;math&gt;u, v, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Stillwell|2004|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese geometry==
{{see also|Chinese mathematics}}
[[Image:九章算術.gif|thumb|right|220px|The ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', first compiled in 179 AD, with added commentary in the 3rd century by [[Liu Hui]].]]
[[Image:Sea island survey.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''[[Haidao Suanjing]]'', Liu Hui, 3rd century.]]

The first definitive work (or at least oldest existent) on geometry in China was the ''Mo Jing'', the [[Mohist]] canon of the early philosopher [[Mozi]] (470-390 BC). It was compiled years after his death by his followers around the year 330 BC.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 91"/&gt; Although the ''Mo Jing'' is the oldest existent book on geometry in China, there is the possibility that even older written material existed. However, due to the infamous [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|Burning of the Books]] in a political maneuver by the [[Qin Dynasty]] ruler [[Qin Shihuang]] (r. 221-210 BC), multitudes of written literature created before his time were purged. In addition, the ''Mo Jing'' presents geometrical concepts in mathematics that are perhaps too advanced not to have had a previous geometrical base or mathematic background to work upon.

The ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on mathematics as well. It provided an 'atomic' definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus forms the extreme end of a line is a point.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 91"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Much like [[Euclid]]'s first and third definitions and [[Plato]]'s 'beginning of a line', the ''Mo Jing'' stated that "a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it."&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 92"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[atomist]]s of [[Democritus]], the ''Mo Jing'' stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since 'nothing' cannot be halved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 92"/&gt; It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place,&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 92"/&gt; while providing definitions for the ''comparison of lengths'' and for ''parallels'',&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 92 93"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; along with principles of space and bounded space.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 93"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 93 94"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 94"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD) period of China witnessed a new flourishing of mathematics. One of the oldest Chinese mathematical texts to present [[geometric progression]]s was the ''[[Suàn shù shū]]'' of 186 BC, during the Western Han era. The mathematician, inventor, and astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] (78-139 AD) used geometrical formulas to solve mathematical problems. Although rough estimates for [[pi]] ([[π]]) were given in the ''[[Zhou Li]]'' (compiled in the 2nd century BC),&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 99"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; it was Zhang Heng who was the first to make a concerted effort at creating a more accurate formula for pi. Zhang Heng approximated pi as 730/232 (or approx 3.1466), although he used another formula of pi in finding a spherical volume, using the square root of 10 (or approx 3.162) instead. [[Zu Chongzhi]] (429-500 AD) improved the accuracy of the approximation of pi to between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, with [[Milü|&lt;sup&gt;355&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;113&lt;/sub&gt;]] (密率, Milü, detailed approximation) and [[Proof that 22/7 exceeds π|&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]] (约率, Yuelü, rough approximation) being the other notable approximation.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 101"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to later works, the formula for pi given by the French mathematician [[Franciscus Vieta]] (1540-1603) fell halfway between Zu's approximations.

===''The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art''===
''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', the title of which first appeared by 179 AD on a bronze inscription, was edited and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician [[Liu Hui]] from the Kingdom of [[Cao Wei]]. This book included many problems where geometry was applied, such as finding surface areas for squares and circles, the volumes of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, and included the use of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The book provided illustrated proof for the Pythagorean theorem,&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 22"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a written dialogue between of the earlier [[Duke of Zhou]] and Shang Gao on the properties of the right angle triangle and the Pythagorean theorem, while also referring to the astronomical [[gnomon]], the circle and square, as well as measurements of heights and distances.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 21"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor Liu Hui listed pi as 3.141014 by using a 192 sided [[polygon]], and then calculated pi as 3.14159 using a 3072 sided polygon. This was more accurate than Liu Hui's contemporary [[Wang Fan]], a mathematician and astronomer from [[Eastern Wu]], would render pi as 3.1555 by using &lt;sup&gt;142&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;45&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 100"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Hui also wrote of mathematical [[surveying]] to calculate distance measurements of depth, height, width, and surface area. In terms of solid geometry, he figured out that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a [[tetrahedral]] wedge.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 98 99"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 98&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt; He also figured out that a wedge with [[trapezoid]] base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 98 99"/&gt; Furthermore, Liu Hui described [[Cavalieri's principle]] on volume, as well as [[Gaussian elimination]]. From the ''Nine Chapters'', it listed the following geometrical formulas that were known by the time of the Former Han Dynasty (202 BCE&amp;ndash;9 CE).

Continuing the geometrical legacy of ancient China, there were many later figures to come, including the famed astronomer and mathematician [[Shen Kuo]] (1031-1095 CE), [[Yang Hui]] (1238-1298) who discovered [[Pascal's Triangle]], [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562-1633), and many others.

==Islamic Golden Age==
{{see also|Islamic mathematics}}
[[Image:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|Page from the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah]]'']]
By the beginning of the 9th century, the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]" flourished,  the establishment of the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] marking a separate tradition of [[science in the medieval Islamic world]], building not only Hellenistic but also on [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indian]] sources.

Although the Islamic mathematicians are most famed for their work on [[algebra]], [[number theory]] and [[number system]]s, they also made considerable contributions to geometry, [[trigonometry]] and mathematical [[astronomy]], and were responsible for the development of [[algebraic geometry]].

[[Al-Mahani]] (born 820) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra. [[Al-Karaji]] (born 953) completely freed algebra from geometrical operations and replaced them with the [[arithmetic]]al type of operations which are at the core of algebra today.

[[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (known as Thebit in [[Latin]]) (born 836) contributed to a number of areas in mathematics, where he played an important role in preparing the way for such important mathematical discoveries as the extension of the concept of number to ([[positive number|positive]]) [[real number]]s, [[integral calculus]], theorems in [[spherical trigonometry]], [[analytic geometry]], and [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. In astronomy Thabit was one of the first reformers of the [[Ptolemaic system]], and in mechanics he was a founder of [[statics]]. An important geometrical aspect of Thabit's work was his book on the composition of ratios. In this book, Thabit deals with arithmetical operations applied to ratios of geometrical quantities. The Greeks had dealt with geometric quantities but had not thought of them in the same way as numbers to which the usual rules of arithmetic could be applied. By introducing arithmetical operations on quantities previously regarded as geometric and non-numerical, Thabit started a trend which led eventually to the generalisation of the number concept.

In some respects, Thabit is critical of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, particularly regarding motion. It would seem that here his ideas are based on an acceptance of using arguments concerning motion in his geometrical arguments. Another important contribution Thabit made to [[geometry]] was his generalization of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which he extended from [[special right triangles]] to all [[triangle]]s in general, along with a general [[mathematical proof|proof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sayili | first1 = Aydin | year = 1960 | title = Thabit ibn Qurra's Generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 35–37 | doi=10.1086/348837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibrahim ibn Sinan]] ibn Thabit (born 908), who introduced a method of [[integral|integration]] more general than that of [[Archimedes]], and [[al-Quhi]] (born 940) were leading figures in a revival and continuation of Greek higher geometry in the Islamic world. These mathematicians, and in particular [[Ibn al-Haytham]], studied [[optics]] and investigated the optical properties of mirrors made from [[conic section]]s.

Astronomy, time-keeping and [[geography]] provided other motivations for geometrical and trigonometrical research. For example, Ibrahim ibn Sinan and his grandfather [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] both studied curves required in the construction of sundials. [[Abu'l-Wafa]] and [[Abu Nasr Mansur]] both applied [[spherical geometry]] to astronomy.

The [[transmission of the Greek Classics]] to medieval Europe via the [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Arabic literature]] of the 9th to 10th century "[[Islamic Golden Age]]"  began in the 10th century and culminated in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].
A copy of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' was brought back to Sicily by [[Henry Aristippus]] (d. 1162), as a gift from the Emperor to [[William I of Sicily|King William I]] (r. 1154&amp;ndash;1166). An anonymous student at Salerno travelled to Sicily and translated the ''Almagest''  as well as several works by  Euclid from Greek to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alverny, Marie-Thérèse. "Translations and Translators", in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, eds., ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'',  421–462. Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1982, pp. 433–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Sicilians generally translated directly from the Greek, when Greek texts were not available, they would translate from Arabic. [[Eugenius of Palermo]] (d. 1202) translated Ptolemy's ''[[Ptolemy#Optics|Optics]]'' into Latin, drawing on his knowledge of all three languages in the task.&lt;ref&gt;M.-T. d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators," p.&amp;nbsp;435&lt;/ref&gt;
The rigorous deductive methods of geometry found in Euclid's ''Elements of Geometry'' were relearned, and further development of geometry in the styles of both Euclid ([[Euclidean geometry]]) and Khayyam ([[algebraic geometry]]) continued, resulting in an abundance of new theorems and concepts, many of them very profound and elegant.

Advances in the treatment of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] were made in [[Renaissance art]] of the 14th to 15th century which went beyond what had been achieved in antiquity. 
In [[Renaissance architecture]] of the ''[[Quattrocento]]'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. A prime example of  is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In c. 1413 [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]  demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective, used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various [[Florence|Florentine]] buildings onto a mirror. 
Soon after, nearly every artist in Florence and in Italy used geometrical perspective in their paintings,&lt;ref&gt;"...and these works (of perspective by Brunelleschi) were the means of arousing the minds of the other craftsmen, who afterwords devoted themselves to this with great zeal."&lt;br&gt;Vasari's ''Lives of the Artists'' Chapter on Brunelleschi&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Masolino da Panicale]] and [[Donatello]].  [[Melozzo da Forlì]] first used the technique of upward foreshortening (in Rome, [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]], [[Forlì]] and others), and was celebrated for that. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of [[Composition (visual arts)|composing]] a painting. Paintings began to show a single, unified scene, rather than a combination of several.

As shown by the quick proliferation of accurate perspective paintings in Florence, Brunelleschi likely understood (with help from his friend the mathematician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Messer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, having returned from his studies, invited Filippo with other friends to supper in a garden, and the discourse falling on mathematical subjects, Filippo formed a friendship with him and learned geometry from him."&lt;br&gt;Vasarai's ''Lives of the Artists'', Chapter on Brunelleschi&lt;/ref&gt; but did not publish, the mathematics behind perspective. Decades later, his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435/1436), a treatise on proper methods of showing distance in painting based on Euclidean geometry. Alberti was also trained in the science of optics through the school of Padua and under the influence of [[Biagio Pelacani da Parma]] who studied Alhazen's ''Optics'.

[[Piero della Francesca]] elaborated on Della Pittura in his ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]]'' in the 1470s. Alberti had limited himself to figures on the ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti's. Della Francesca was also the first to accurately draw the [[Platonic solids]] as they would appear in perspective.

Perspective remained, for a while, the domain of Florence. [[Jan van Eyck]], among others, was unable to create a consistent structure for the converging lines in paintings, as in London's [[The Arnolfini Portrait]], because he was unaware of the theoretical breakthrough just then occurring in Italy. However he achieved very subtle effects by manipulations of scale in his interiors. Gradually, and partly through the movement of academies of the arts, the Italian techniques became part of the training of artists across Europe, and later other parts of the world.
The culmination of these Renaissance traditions finds its ultimate synthesis in the research of the architect, geometer, and optician [[Girard Desargues]] on perspective, optics and projective geometry.

The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''  by [[Leonardo da Vinci]](c. 1490)&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Language of the Renaissance - Richard Stemp&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square.  The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal [[Body proportions|human proportions]] with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in Book III of his treatise ''[[De Architectura]]''.

==Modern geometry==

===The 17th century===
[[Image:Descartes Discourse on Method.png|thumb|[[Discourse on Method]] by [[René Descartes]]]]
In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first and most important was the creation of [[analytic geometry]], or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by René Descartes (1596–1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591–1661). Projective geometry is the study of geometry without measurement, just the study of how points align with each other. There had been some early work in this area by Hellenistic geometers, notably [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] (c. 340). The greatest flowering of the field occurred with [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] (1788–1867).

In the late 17th century, calculus was developed independently and almost simultaneously by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716). This was the beginning of a new field of mathematics now called [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Though not itself a branch of geometry, it is applicable to geometry, and it solved two families of problems that had long been almost intractable: finding tangent lines to odd curves, and finding areas enclosed by those curves. The methods of calculus reduced these problems mostly to straightforward matters of computation.

===The 18th and 19th centuries===

====Non-Euclidean geometry====
The very old problem of proving Euclid’s Fifth Postulate, the "[[Parallel Postulate]]", from his first four postulates had never been forgotten. Beginning not long after Euclid, many attempted demonstrations were given, but all were later found to be faulty, through allowing into the reasoning some principle which itself had not been proved from the first four postulates. Though Omar Khayyám was also unsuccessful in proving the parallel postulate, his criticisms of Euclid's theories of parallels and his proof of properties of figures in non-Euclidean geometries contributed to the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. By 1700 a great deal had been discovered about what can be proved from the first four, and what the pitfalls were in attempting to prove the fifth. [[Saccheri]], [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Lambert]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] each did excellent work on the problem in the 18th century, but still fell short of success. In the early 19th century, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Johann Bolyai]], and [[Lobatchewsky]], each independently, took a different approach. Beginning to suspect that it was impossible to prove the Parallel Postulate, they set out to develop a self-consistent geometry in which that postulate was false. In this they were successful, thus creating the first non-Euclidean geometry. By 1854, [[Bernhard Riemann]], a student of Gauss, had applied methods of calculus in a ground-breaking study of the intrinsic (self-contained) geometry of all smooth surfaces, and thereby found a different non-Euclidean geometry. This work of Riemann later became fundamental for [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]].
[[Image:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Blake]]'s "Newton" is a demonstration of his opposition to the 'single-vision' of [[scientific materialism]]; here, [[Isaac Newton]] is shown as 'divine geometer' (1795)]]
It remained to be proved mathematically that the non-Euclidean geometry was just as self-consistent as Euclidean geometry, and this was first accomplished by [[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]] in 1868. With this, non-Euclidean geometry was established on an equal mathematical footing with Euclidean geometry.

While it was now known that different geometric theories were mathematically possible, the question remained, "Which one of these theories is correct for our physical space?" The mathematical work revealed that this question must be answered by physical experimentation, not mathematical reasoning, and uncovered the reason why the experimentation must involve immense (interstellar, not earth-bound) distances. With the development of relativity theory in physics, this question became vastly more complicated.

====Introduction of mathematical rigor====
All the work related to the Parallel Postulate revealed that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, there was a clear need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as [[Hilbert's axioms]], were given by [[David Hilbert]] in 1894 in his dissertation ''Grundlagen der Geometrie'' (''Foundations of Geometry''). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.

====Analysis situs, or topology====
In the mid-18th century, it became apparent that certain progressions of mathematical reasoning recurred when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be done in more generality, and then applied to special cases. This method of studying calculus- and analysis-related concepts came to be known as analysis situs, and later as [[topology]]. The important topics in this field were properties of more general figures, such as connectedness and boundaries, rather than properties like straightness, and precise equality of length and angle measurements, which had been the focus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Topology soon became a separate field of major importance, rather than a sub-field of geometry or analysis.

===The 20th century===
Developments in [[algebraic geometry]] included the study of curves and surfaces over [[finite field]]s as demonstrated by the works of among others [[André Weil]], [[Alexander Grothendieck]], and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] as well as over the real or complex numbers. [[Finite geometry]] itself, the study of spaces with only finitely many points, found applications in [[coding theory]] and [[cryptography]]. With the advent of the computer, new disciplines such as [[computational geometry]] or [[digital geometry]] deal with geometric algorithms, discrete representations of geometric data, and so forth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5580">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''Korn's inequality''' is an inequality concerning the [[gradient]] of a [[vector field]] that generalizes the following classical theorem: if the gradient of a vector field is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] at every point, then the gradient must be equal to a constant skew-symmetric matrix.  Korn's theorem is a quantitative version of this statement, which intuitively says that if the gradient of a vector field is on average not far from the space of skew-symmetric matrices, then the gradient must not be far from a ''particular'' skew-symmetric matrix.  The statement that Korn's inequality generalizes thus arises as a special case of [[rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]].

In (linear) [[elasticity theory]], the symmetric part of the gradient is a measure of the [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]] that an elastic body experiences when it is deformed by a given vector-valued function.  The inequality is therefore an important tool as an [[a priori estimate]] in linear elasticity theory.

==Statement of the inequality==

Let {{math|Ω}} be an [[open set|open]], [[connected space|connected]] domain in {{math|''n''}}-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2}}.  Let {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} be the [[Sobolev space]] of all [[vector field]]s {{math|''v''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;(''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} on {{math|Ω}} that, along with their (first) weak derivatives, lie in the [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.  Denoting the [[partial derivative]] with respect to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component by {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\| v \|_{H^{1} (\Omega)} := \left( \int_{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} | v^{i} (x) |^{2} \, \mathrm{d} x+\int_{\Omega} \sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} | \partial_{j} v^{i} (x) |^{2} \, \mathrm{d} x \right)^{1/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a constant {{math|''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0}}, known as the '''Korn constant''' of {{math|Ω}}, such that, for all {{math|''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}},

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\| v \|_{H^{1} (\Omega)}^{2} \leq C \int_{\Omega} \sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \left( | v^{i} (x) |^{2} + | (e_{ij} v) (x) |^{2} \right) \, \mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where {{math|''e''}} denotes the symmetrized gradient given by

:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij} v = \frac1{2} ( \partial_{i} v^{j} + \partial_{j} v^{i} ).&lt;/math&gt;

Inequality {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} is known as '''Korn's inequality'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14081">In [[probability theory]], the theory of '''large deviations''' concerns the asymptotic behaviour of remote tails of sequences of probability distributions. While some basic ideas of the theory can be traced to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], the formalization started with insurance mathematics, namely [[ruin theory]] with  [[Harald Cramér|Cramér]] and [[Filip Lundberg|Lundberg]]. A unified formalization of large deviation theory was developed in 1966, in a paper by [[S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan|Varadhan]].&lt;ref&gt;S.R.S. Varadhan, ''Asymptotic probability and differential equations'', [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics|Comm. Pure Appl. Math.]] 19 (1966),261-286.&lt;/ref&gt; Large deviations theory formalizes the heuristic ideas of ''concentration of measures'' and widely generalizes the notion of [[Convergence of measures#Weak convergence of random variables|convergence of probability measures]].

Roughly speaking, large deviations theory concerns itself with the exponential decline of the probability measures of certain kinds of extreme or ''tail'' events.

==Introductory examples==

=== An elementary example ===
Consider a sequence of independent tosses of a fair
coin. The possible outcomes could be heads or tails. Let us denote the possible outcome of the i-th trial by
&lt;math&gt; X_i &lt;/math&gt;, where we encode head as 1 and tail as 0. Now let  &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt;   denote the mean value after &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; trials, namely
:&lt;math&gt; M_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i.&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; lies between 0 and 1.  From the [[law of large numbers]] (and also from our experience) we know that as N grows, the distribution of &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt; 0.5 = \operatorname{E}[X] &lt;/math&gt; (the expectation value of a single coin toss) almost surely.

Moreover, by the [[central limit theorem]], we know that &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; is approximately normally distributed for large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The central limit theorem can provide more detailed information about the behavior of &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; than the law of large numbers. For example, we can approximately find a tail probability of &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; P(M_N &gt; x) &lt;/math&gt;, that
&lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, for a fixed value of &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. However, the approximation by the CLT may not be accurate if &lt;math&gt;x &lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[X_i] &lt;/math&gt; unless &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently large. Also, it does not provide information about the convergence of the tail probabilities as &lt;math&gt; N \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;. However, the large deviation theory can provide answers for such problems.

Let us make this statement more precise. For a given value &lt;math&gt; 0.5&lt;x&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, let us compute the tail probability  &lt;math&gt; P(M_N &gt; x) &lt;/math&gt;.  Define
:&lt;math&gt;  I(x) = x \, \ln{x} + (1-x) \, \ln(1-x) + \ln{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the function &lt;math&gt; I(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a convex, nonnegative function that is zero at ''x=1/2'' and increases as you move to ''x=1''. It is the negative of  the [[Bernoulli entropy]] with ''p=1/2''; that it's appropriate for coin tosses follows from the [[asymptotic equipartition property]] applied to a [[Bernoulli trial]]. Then by  [[Chernoff's inequality]], it can be shown that &lt;math&gt; P(M_N &gt; x) &lt; \exp(-NI(x)) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;"Large deviations for performance analysis : queues, communications, and computing", Shwartz, Adam, 1953- TN: 1228486&lt;/ref&gt; This bound is rather sharp, in the  sense  that &lt;math&gt; I(x) &lt;/math&gt; cannot be replaced with a larger number which would yield a strict inequality for all positive &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Varadhan, S.R.S.,The Annals of Probability
2008, Vol. 36, No. 2, 397–419,  [https://math.nyu.edu/faculty/varadhan/wald.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;(However, the exponential bound can still be reduced by a subexponential factor on the order of &lt;math&gt; 1/\sqrt N &lt;/math&gt;; this follows from the [[Stirling approximation]] applied to the [[binomial coefficient]] appearing in the [[Bernoulli distribution]].) Hence, we obtain the following result:
:&lt;math&gt;  P(M_N &gt; x) \approx \exp(-NI(x)) .&lt;/math&gt;
The probability &lt;math&gt; P(M_N &gt; x) &lt;/math&gt; decays exponentially  as &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; grows to infinity, at a rate depending on x. This formula approximates any tail probability of the sample mean of i.i.d. variables and gives its convergence as the number of samples increases.

=== Large deviations for sums of independent random variables ===
{{main article|Cramér's theorem (large deviations)}}
In the above example of coin-tossing we explicitly assumed that each toss is an
independent trial, and the probability of getting head or tail is always the same.

Let &lt;math&gt; X,X_1,X_2,... &lt;/math&gt; be [[i.i.d.|independent and identically distributed]] (i.i.d.) random variables whose common distribution satisfies a certain growth condition. Then the following limit exists:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \ln P(M_N &gt; x) = - I(x) .&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Here &lt;math&gt; M_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i,&lt;/math&gt; as before.

Function &lt;math&gt; I(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is called the "[[rate function]]" or "Cramér function" or sometimes the "entropy function".

The above-mentioned limit means that for large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; P(M_N &gt;x) \approx \exp[-NI(x) ],&lt;/math&gt;

which is the basic result of large deviations theory.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/varadhan/Spring2012/Chapters1-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.R.S. Varadhan, Large Deviations and Applications (SIAM, Philadelphia, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

If we know the probability distribution of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, an explicit expression for the rate function can be obtained. This is given by a [[Legendre–Fenchel transformation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Touchette|first=Hugo|title=The large deviation approach to statistical mechanics|journal=Physics Reports|date=1 July 2009|volume=478|issue=1-3|pages=1–69|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2009.05.002|arxiv=0804.0327|bibcode=2009PhR...478....1T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \sup_{\theta &gt; 0} [\theta x - \lambda(\theta)],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(\theta) = \ln \operatorname{E}[\exp(\theta X)] &lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[cumulant generating function]] (CGF) and &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[mathematical expectation]].

If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; follows a [[normal distribution]], the rate function becomes a parabola with its apex at the mean of the normal distribution.

If &lt;math&gt;\{X_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Markov chain]], the variant of the basic large deviations result stated above may hold.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Brief history ==
The first rigorous results concerning large deviations are due to the Swedish mathematician
[[Harald Cramér]], who applied them to model the insurance business.&lt;ref&gt;Cramér, H. (1944). On a new limit theorem of the theory of probability. Uspekhi Matematicheskikh Nauk, (10), 166-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the point
of view of an insurance company, the earning is at a constant rate per month
(the monthly premium) but the claims come randomly. For the company to be successful
over a certain period of time (preferably many months), the total earning should
exceed the total claim. Thus to estimate the premium you have to ask the following
question : "What should we choose as the premium &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; such that over
&lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; months the total claim &lt;math&gt; C = \Sigma X_i &lt;/math&gt; should
be less than &lt;math&gt; Nq &lt;/math&gt; ? "  This is clearly the same question asked by
the large deviations theory. Cramér gave a solution to this question for i.i.d. [[random variable]]s, where the rate function is expressed as a [[power series]].

A very incomplete list of mathematicians who have made important advances would
include [[Aleksei Zinovyevich Petrov|Petrov]],&lt;ref name="Petrov"&gt;Petrov V.V. (1954) Generalization of Cramér's limit theorem. Uspehi Matem. Nauk, v. 9, No 4(62), 195--202.(Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanov's theorem|Sanov]],&lt;ref name="Sanov"&gt;Sanov I.N. (1957) On the probability of large deviations of random magnitudes. Matem. Sbornik, v. 42 (84), 11--44.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[S.R.S. Varadhan]] (who has won the Abel prize for his contribution to the theory), [[D. Ruelle]], [[Oscar Lanford|O.E. Lanford]], Amir Dembo, and Ofer Zeitouni.&lt;ref&gt;Dembo, A., &amp; Zeitouni, O. (2009). Large deviations techniques and applications (Vol. 38). Springer Science &amp; Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Principles of large deviations may be effectively applied to gather information out of a probabilistic model. Thus, theory of large deviations finds its applications in [[information theory]] and [[risk management]]. In physics, the best known application of large deviations theory arise in [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] (in connection with relating [[entropy]] with rate function).

=== Large deviations and entropy ===
{{main article|asymptotic equipartition property}}
The rate function is related to the [[entropy]] in statistical mechanics. This can be heuristically seen in the following way. In statistical mechanics the entropy of a particular macro-state is related to the number of micro-states which corresponds to this macro-state. In our coin tossing example the mean value &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; could designate a particular macro-state. And the particular sequence of heads and tails which gives rise to a particular value of &lt;math&gt; M_N &lt;/math&gt; constitutes a particular micro-state. Loosely speaking a macro-state having a higher number of micro-states giving rise to it, has higher entropy. And a state with higher entropy has a higher chance of being realised in actual experiments. The macro-state with mean value of 1/2 (as many heads as tails) has the highest number of micro-states giving rise to it and it is indeed the state with the highest entropy. And in most practical situations
we shall indeed obtain this macro-state for large numbers of trials. The "rate function" on the other hand measures the probability of appearance of a particular macro-state. The smaller the rate function the higher is the chance of a macro-state appearing. In our coin-tossing the value of the "rate function" for mean value equal to 1/2 is zero. In this way one can see the "rate function" as the negative of the "entropy".

There is a relation between the "rate function" in large deviations theory and the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] (see Sanov &lt;ref name="Sanov"/&gt; and 
Novak,&lt;ref name="Novak"&gt;Novak S.Y. (2011) Extreme value methods with applications to finance. Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press. {{isbn|978-1-4398-3574-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ch. 14.5).

In a special case, large deviations are closely related to the concept of [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff limits]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotani M., [[Toshikazu Sunada|Sunada T.]] ''Large deviation and the tangent cone at infinity of a crystal lattice'', Math. Z. 254, (2006), 837-870.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In real social networks individuals exhibit a tendency to re-connect with past contacts (ex. family, friends, co-workers, etc.) rather than strangers. In 1970, [[Mark Granovetter]] examined this behaviour in the social networks of a group of workers and identified tie strength, a characteristic of social ties describing the frequency of contact between two individuals. From this comes the idea of strong and weak ties,&lt;ref name=Granovetter&gt;
{{cite journal
|last1=Granovetter
|first1=Mark
|title=The strength of weak ties
|journal=American Journal of Sociology
|date=1973
|volume=78
|pages=1360–1380
|doi=10.1086/225469}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where an individual's strong ties are those she has come into frequent contact with. Link-centric preferential attachment aims to explain the mechanism behind strong and weak ties as a stochastic reinforcement process for old ties in agent-based modeling where nodes have long-term memory.

==Examples==

In a simple model for this mechanism, a node's propensity to establish a new link can be characterized solely by  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of contacts it has had in the past. The probability for a node with n social ties to establish a new social tie could then be simply given by&lt;ref name=MartonKarsai/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P(n) = {c\over n+c} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is an offset constant. The probability for a node to re-connect with old ties is then 
:&lt;math&gt; 1 - P(n) = {n\over n+c}.&lt;/math&gt;
Figure 1. shows an example of this process: in the first step nodes A and C connect to node B, giving B a total of two social ties. With ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, in the next step B has a probability ''P''(2) =&amp;nbsp;1/(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/3 to create a new tie with D, whereas the probability to reconnect with A or C is twice that at&amp;nbsp;2/3.

More complex models may take into account other variables, such as frequency of contact, contact and intercontact duration, as well as short term memory effects.&lt;ref name=Vestergaard/&gt;

'''Effects on the spreading of contagions / weakness of strong ties'''

Understanding the evolution of a network's structure and how it can influence dynamical processes has become an important part of modeling the spreading of contagions.&lt;ref name=Newman2002&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In models of social and biological contagion spreading on time-varying networks link-centric preferential attachment can alter the spread of the contagion to the entire population. Compared to the classic rumour spreading process where nodes are memory-less, link-centric preferential attachment can cause not only a slower spread of the contagion but also one less diffuse. In these models an infected node's chances of connecting to new contacts diminishes as their size of their social circle &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; grows leading to a limiting effect on the growth of n. The result is strong ties with a node's early contacts and consequently the weakening of the diffusion of the contagion.&lt;ref name=Vestergaard/&gt;&lt;ref name=MartonKarsai/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">"'''Lobachevsky'''" is a humorous song by [[Tom Lehrer]], referring to the mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.revisited.html#6 |title=Lobachevsky |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lehrer, the song is "not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character" and the name was chosen "solely for [[prosodic]] reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, "The Tom Lehrer Collection", ''Shout!'' Factory, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt;

In the introduction, Lehrer describes the song as an adaptation of a routine that [[Danny Kaye]] did to honor the Russian actor [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; (The Danny Kaye routine is sung from the perspective of a famous Russian actor who learns and applies Stanislavski's secret to method acting: "Suffer.") &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXI2djKeerQ The Stanislavski routine] performed on the Danny Kaye Radio Show &lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer sings the song from the point of a view of a preeminent Russian mathematician who learns, from Lobachevsky, that [[plagiarism]] is the secret of success in mathematics (though adding "only be sure always to call it please '[[research]]'"). The narrator later uses this strategy to get a paper published ahead of a rival, then to write a book and earn a fortune selling the movie rights.

Lehrer wrote that he did not know [[Russian language|Russian]]. In the song he quotes two book reviews in Russian; the first is a long sentence that he then translates succinctly as "It stinks". The second, a different but equally long sentence, is also translated as "It stinks." The actual text of these sentences bear no relation to academics: the first phrase quotes [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''Song of the Flea'': "Once there was a king who had a pet flea." The second references a Russian joke: "Now I must go where even the Tsar goes on foot" [the bathroom].&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"&gt;{{cite web |title="Lobachevsky" Words and music by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/lobachevsky.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was first performed as part of ''The Physical Revue,'' a 1951–1952 musical [[revue]] by Lehrer and a few other professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Physical Revue, by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/astronomy/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is track 6 on ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'', which was re-released as part of ''[[Songs &amp; More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' and ''[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]]''.

'''Multiple Discriminant Analysis''' (MDA) is a multivariate dimensionality reduction technique. It has been used to predict signals as diverse as neural memory traces and corporate failure.&lt;ref&gt;Duda R, Hart P, Stork D (2001) Pattern Classification, Second Edition. New York, NY, Uand Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MDA''' is not directly used to perform classification.  It merely supports classification by yielding a compressed signal amenable to classification.  The method described in Duda et al. (2001) §3.8.3 projects the multivariate signal down to an ''M''−1 dimensional space where ''M'' is the number of categories.

'''MDA''' is useful because most classifiers are strongly affected by the [[curse of dimensionality]].  In other words, when signals are represented in very-high-dimensional spaces, the classifier's performance is catastrophically impaired by the [[overfitting]] problem.  This problem is reduced by compressing the signal down to a lower-dimensional space as '''MDA''' does.

'''MDA''' has been used to reveal neural codes.&lt;ref&gt;Lin L et al. (2005) Identification of network-level coding units for real-time representation of episodic experiences in the hippocampus. PNAS 102(17):6125-6130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lin L, Osan R, and Tsien JZ (2006) Organizing principles of real-time memory encoding: neural clique assemblies and universal neural codes. Trends in Neurosciences 29(1):48-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">In mathematical [[set theory]], a set ''S'' is said to be '''ordinal definable''' if, informally, it can be defined in terms of a finite number of [[ordinal number|ordinals]] by a first order formula. Ordinal definable sets were introduced by {{harvtxt|Gödel|1965}}.

A drawback to this informal definition is that requires quantification over all first order formulas, which cannot be formalized in the language of set theory. However there is a different way of stating the definition that can be so formalized. In this approach, a set ''S'' is formally defined to be ordinal definable if there is some collection of ordinals ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''α''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S \isin V_{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as an element of &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt; by a first-order formula φ taking α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as parameters. Here &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set indexed by the ordinal ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Von Neumann universe|von Neumann hierarchy of sets]]. In other words, ''S'' is the unique object such that φ(''S'', α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) holds with its quantifiers ranging over &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[proper class|class]] of all ordinal definable sets is denoted OD; it is not necessarily [[transitive set|transitive]], and need not be a model of ZFC because it might not satisfy the [[axiom of extensionality]]. A set is '''hereditarily ordinal definable''' if it is ordinal definable and all elements of its [[transitive set|transitive closure]] are ordinal definable. The class of hereditarily ordinal definable sets is denoted by HOD, and is a transitive model of ZFC, with a definable well ordering. It is consistent with the axioms of set theory that all sets are ordinal definable, and so hereditarily ordinal definable. The assertion that this situation holds is referred to as V = OD or V = HOD. It follows from [[V = L]], and is equivalent to the existence of a (definable) [[well-order]]ing of the universe.  Note however that the formula expressing V = HOD need not hold true within HOD, as it is not [[Absoluteness|absolute]] for models of set theory: within HOD, the interpretation of the formula for HOD may yield an even smaller inner model.

HOD has been found to be useful in that it is an [[inner model]] that can accommodate essentially all known [[large cardinal]]s.  This is in contrast with the situation for [[core model]]s, as core models have not yet been constructed that can accommodate [[supercompact cardinal]]s, for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">In mathematics, an '''orientation''' of a real [[vector bundle]] is a generalization of an [[orientation of a vector space]]; thus, given a real vector bundle π: ''E'' →''B'', an orientation of ''E'' means: for each fiber ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is an orientation of the vector space ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and one demands that each trivialization map (which is a bundle map)
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_U :  \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
is fiberwise orientation-preserving, where '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is given the [[standard orientation]]. In more concise terms, this says that the structure group of the [[frame bundle]] of ''E'', which is the real [[general linear group]] ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), can be reduced to the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant.

If ''E'' is a real vector bundle of rank ''n'', then a choice of metric on ''E'' amounts to a reduction of the structure group to the [[orthogonal group]] ''O''(''n''). In that situation, an orientation of ''E'' amounts to a reduction from ''O''(''n'') to the [[special orthogonal group]] ''SO''(''n'').

A vector bundle together with an orientation is called an '''oriented bundle'''. A vector bundle that can be given an orientation is called an '''orientable vector bundle'''.

The basic invariant of an oriented bundle is the [[Euler class]]. The multiplication (that is, cup product) by the Euler class of an oriented bundle gives rise to a [[Gysin sequence]].

== Examples ==
A [[complex vector bundle]] is oriented in a canonical way.

The notion of an orientation of a vector bundle generalizes an [[orientation of a manifold]]: an orientation of a manifold is an orientation of the tangent bundle of the manifold. In particular, a manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent bundle is orientable as a vector bundle. (note: as a manifold, a tangent bundle is always orientable.)

== Operations ==
To give an orientation to a real vector bundle ''E'' of rank ''n'' is to give an orientation to the (real) [[determinant bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det} E = \wedge^n E&lt;/math&gt; of ''E''. Similarly, to give an orientation to ''E'' is to give an orientation to the [[unit sphere bundle]] of ''E''.

Just as a real vector bundle is classified by the real infinite [[Grassmannian]], oriented bundles are classified by the infinite Grassmannian of oriented real vector spaces.

== Thom space ==
{{main|Thom space}}
From the cohomological point of view, for any ring Λ, a Λ-orientation of a real vector bundle ''E'' of rank ''n'' means a choice (and existence) of a class
:&lt;math&gt;u \in H^n(T(E); \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
in the cohomology ring of the [[Thom space]] ''T''(''E'') such that ''u'' generates &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}^*(T(E); \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt; as a free &lt;math&gt;H^*(E; \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;-module globally and locally: i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(E; \Lambda) \to \tilde{H}^*(T(E); \Lambda), x \mapsto  x \smile u&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism (called the [[Thom isomorphism]]), where "tilde" means [[reduced cohomology]], that restricts to each isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(\pi^{-1}(U); \Lambda) \to \tilde{H}^*(T(E|_U); \Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
induced by the trivialization &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(U) \simeq U \times \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. One can show, with some work,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} that the usual notion of an orientation coincides with a '''Z'''-orientation.

[[Image:Pi Karlsplatz Pi.JPG| thumb | right | 300px | view the [[Pi|π circular number]] in the Vienna Opera House Passage]]
'''''Pi''''' is the name of a multimedia installation in the vicinity of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Karlsplatz]]. ''Pi'' is located in the [[Opernpassage]] between the entrance to the [[Vienna U-Bahn|subway]] and the subway stop in [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] near the [[Naschmarkt]]. The individual behind the project was the [[Canada|Canadian]] artist [[Ken Lum]] from [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name="public-art-vienna"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Lum: Pi|url=http://www.publicartvienna.at/files_e/7.html|website=publicartvienna.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pi'', under construction from January 2005 to November 2006 and opened in December 2006, consists of statistical information and a representation of [[Pi|π]] to 478 decimal places. A more recent project is the calculation of the decimal places of π, indicating the importance of the eponymous media for installation of their number and infinity.

The exhibit is 130 meters long. In addition to the number pi, there is a total of 16 ''factoids'' of reflective display cases that convey a variety of statistical data in real time.&lt;ref name="public-art-vienna" /&gt; Apart from the [[World population]] there are also topics such as the worldwide number of [[malnutrition|malnourished]] children and the growth of [[Sahara]] since the beginning of the year. Even less serious issues such as the number of eaten [[Wiener Schnitzel]]s in Vienna of the given year and the current number of lovers in Vienna are represented.

In the middle of the passage standing there is a glass case with images, texts and books on the subjects of [[population]] and [[Animal migration|migration]].

The scientific data were developed jointly by Ken Lum and the {{ill|SORA Institute for Social Research and Consulting|de|lt=SORA Institute}}. "Pi" is to show that contemporary art is in a position to connect [[art]] to [[science]], [[architecture]] and [[sociology]]. The aim of this project was to transform the Karlsplatz into a "vibrant place to meet, with communicative artistic brilliance."

A '''polyomino''' is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. It is a [[polyform]] whose cells are [[square (geometry)|squares]]. It may be regarded as a finite subset of the regular [[square tiling]] with a [[connected space|connected]] [[Interior (topology)|interior]].

Polyominoes are classified according to how many cells they have:

&lt;!-- Not everything obviously, but brought up to the base 10 system --&gt;

Polyominoes have been used in popular [[puzzle]]s since at least 1907, and the enumeration of pentominoes is dated to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb (''Polyominoes'', Preface to the First Edition) writes "the observation that there are twelve distinctive patterns (the pentominoes) that can be formed by five connected stones on a [[Go (game)|Go]] board &amp;hellip; is attributed to an ancient master of that game".&lt;/ref&gt; Many results with the pieces of 1 to 6 squares were first published in [[Fairy Chess Review]] between the years 1937 to 1957, under the name of "dissection problems." The name ''polyomino'' was invented by [[Solomon W. Golomb]] in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golomb |first=Solomon W. |authorlink=Solomon W. Golomb |title=Polyominoes |year=1994 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=0-691-02444-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was popularized by [[Martin Gardner]] in a November 1960 "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]" column in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=M. |title=More about the shapes that can be made with complex dominoes  (Mathematical Games) |journal=Scientific American |date=November 1960 |volume=203 |issue=5 |pages=186–201 |jstor=24940703 |url=https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v203/n5/pdf/scientificamerican1160-186.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to polyominoes are [[polyiamond]]s, formed from [[equilateral triangle]]s; [[polyhex (mathematics)|polyhexes]], formed from regular [[hexagon]]s; and other plane [[polyform]]s. Polyominoes have been generalized to higher [[dimension]]s by joining [[cube (geometry)|cubes]] to form [[polycube]]s, or [[hypercube]]s to form polyhypercubes.

In [[statistical physics]], the study of polyominoes and their higher-dimensional analogs (which are often referred to as '''lattice animals''' in this literature) is applied to problems in physics and chemistry.  Polyominoes have been used as models of [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branched polymers]] and of [[percolation]] clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whittington |first1=S. G. |last2=Soteros| first2=C.

Like many puzzles in recreational mathematics, polyominoes raise many [[combinatorial]] problems. The most basic is [[enumeration|enumerating]] polyominoes of a given size. No formula has been found except for special classes of polyominoes. A number of estimates are known, and there are [[algorithm]]s for calculating them.

Polyominoes with holes are inconvenient for some purposes, such as tiling problems. In some contexts polyominoes with holes are excluded, allowing only [[simply connected]] polyominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grünbaum |first=Branko |authorlink=Branko Grünbaum |author2=Shephard, G.C. |title=Tilings and Patterns |location=New York |publisher=W.H.

*''free'' polyominoes are distinct when none is a rigid transformation ([[translation (geometry)|translation]], [[rotation]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or [[glide reflection]]) of another (pieces that can be picked up and flipped over). Translating, rotating, reflecting, or glide reflecting a free polyomino does not change its shape.

{{As of|2004}}, Iwan Jensen has enumerated the fixed polyominoes up to {{nowrap begin}}''n'' = 56;{{nowrap end}} the number of fixed polyominoes with 56 cells is approximately 6.915{{e|31}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~iwan/animals/Animals_ser.html |title=Series for lattice animals or polyominoes |accessdate=2007-05-06 |author=Iwan Jensen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612141716/http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~iwan/animals/Animals_ser.html |archive-date=2007-06-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Free polyominoes have been enumerated up to {{nowrap begin}}''n'' = 28{{nowrap end}} by Tomás Oliveira e Silva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeta.pt/%7Etos/animals/a44.html |title=Animal enumerations on the {4,4} Euclidean tiling |accessdate=2007-05-06 |author=Tomás Oliveira e Silva |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423213531/http://www.ieeta.pt/%7Etos/animals/a44.html |archive-date=2007-04-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetries of polyominoes===
The [[dihedral group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[symmetries]] ([[symmetry group]]) of a square. This group contains four rotations and four reflections. It is generated by alternating reflections about the ''x''-axis and about a diagonal. One free polyomino corresponds to at most 8 fixed polyominoes, which are its images under the symmetries of ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. However, those images are not necessarily distinct: the more symmetry a free polyomino has, the fewer distinct fixed counterparts it has. Therefore, a free polyomino that is invariant under some or all non-trivial symmetries of ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may correspond to only 4, 2 or 1 fixed polyominoes. Mathematically, free polyominoes are [[equivalence class]]es of fixed polyominoes under the group ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Polyominoes have the following possible symmetries;&lt;ref name="Redelmeier, section 3"&gt;Redelmeier, section 3&lt;/ref&gt; the least number of squares needed in a polyomino with that symmetry is given in each case:
*8 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**no symmetry (4)
*4 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**mirror symmetry with respect to one of the grid line directions (4)
**mirror symmetry with respect to a diagonal line (3)
**2-fold rotational symmetry: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (4)
*2 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**symmetry with respect to both grid line directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2)
**symmetry with respect to both diagonal directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (7)
**4-fold rotational symmetry: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (8)
*1 fixed polyomino for each free polyomino:
**all symmetry of the square: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1).

In the same way, the number of one-sided polyominoes depends on polyomino symmetry as follows:
*2 one-sided polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**no symmetry
**2-fold rotational symmetry: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
**4-fold rotational symmetry: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
*1 one-sided polyomino for each free polyomino:
**all symmetry of the square: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
**mirror symmetry with respect to one of the grid line directions
**mirror symmetry with respect to a diagonal line
**symmetry with respect to both grid line directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
**symmetry with respect to both diagonal directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Algorithms for enumeration of fixed polyominoes===

====Inductive algorithms====
Each polyomino of order ''n''+1 can be obtained by adding a square to a polyomino of order ''n''. This leads to algorithms for generating polyominoes inductively.

Most simply, given a list of polyominoes of order ''n'', squares may be added next to each polyomino in each possible position, and the resulting polyomino of order ''n''+1 added to the list if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares that should not be considered reduce the number of cases that need to be checked for duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, pp. 73–79&lt;/ref&gt; This method may be used to enumerate either free or fixed polyominoes.

A more sophisticated method, described by Redelmeier, has been used by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of order ''n'' be stored in order to enumerate those of order ''n''+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea is that we begin with a single square, and from there, recursively add squares. Depending on the details, it may count each ''n''-omino ''n'' times, once from starting from each of its ''n'' squares, or may be arranged to count each once only.

The simplest implementation involves adding one square at a time. Beginning with an initial square, number the adjacent squares, clockwise from the top, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Now pick a number between 1 and 4, and add a square at that location. Number the unnumbered adjacent squares, starting with 5. Then, pick a number larger than the previously picked number, and add that square. Continue picking a number larger than the number of the current square, adding that square, and then numbering the new adjacent squares. When ''n'' squares have been created, an ''n''-omino has been created.

This method ensures that each fixed polyomino is counted exactly ''n'' times, once for each starting square. It can be optimized so that it counts each polyomino only once, rather than ''n'' times. Starting with the initial square, declare it to be the lower-left square of the polyomino. Simply do not number any square that is on a lower row, or left of the square on the same row. This is the version described by Redelmeier.

If one wishes to count free polyominoes instead, then one may check for symmetries after creating each ''n''-omino. However, it is faster&lt;ref&gt;Redelmeier, section 4&lt;/ref&gt; to generate symmetric polyominoes separately (by a variation of this method)&lt;ref&gt;Redelmeier, section 6&lt;/ref&gt; and so determine the number of free polyominoes by [[Burnside's lemma]].

====Transfer-matrix method====
The most modern algorithm for enumerating the fixed polyominoes was discovered by [[Iwan Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jensen |first=Iwan |date=February 2001 |title=Enumerations of Lattice Animals and Trees |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=102 |issue=3–4 |pages=865–881 |doi=10.1023/A:1004855020556 |arxiv=cond-mat/0007239|bibcode=2001JSP...102..865J }}&lt;/ref&gt; An improvement on Andrew Conway's method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conway |first=Andrew | year=1995 | title=Enumerating 2D percolation series by the finite-lattice method: theory | journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General | volume=28 |issue=2 | pages=335–349 | zbl=0849.05003 | doi=10.1088/0305-4470/28/2/011|bibcode=1995JPhA...28..335C }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is exponentially faster than the previous methods (however, its running time is still exponential in ''n'').

Both Conway's and Jensen's versions of the transfer-matrix method involve counting the number of polyominoes that have a certain width. Computing the number for all widths gives the total number of polyominoes. The basic idea behind the method is that possible beginning rows are considered, and then to determine the minimum number of squares needed to complete the polyomino of the given width. Combined with the use of [[generating function]]s, this technique is able to count many polyominoes at once, thus enabling it to run many times faster than methods that have to generate every polyomino.

Although it has excellent running time, the tradeoff is that this algorithm uses exponential amounts of memory (many [[gigabyte]]s of memory are needed for ''n'' above 50), is much harder to program than the other methods, and can't currently be used to count free polyominoes.

===Asymptotic growth of the number of polyominoes===

====Fixed polyominoes====
Theoretical arguments and numerical calculations support the estimate for the number of fixed polyominoes of size n
:&lt;math&gt;A_n \sim \frac{c\lambda^n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' = 4.0626 and ''c'' = 0.3169.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jensen |first=Iwan |author2=Guttmann, Anthony J. |year=2000 |title=Statistics of lattice animals (polyominoes) and polygons |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General |volume=33 |pages=L257–L263 |doi=10.1088/0305-4470/33/29/102 |issue=29 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0007238v1.pdf |arxiv=cond-mat/0007238v1 |bibcode=2000JPhA...33L.257J |access-date=2018-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112356/https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0007238v1.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this result is not proven and the values of ''λ'' and ''c'' are only estimates.

The known theoretical results are not nearly as specific as this estimate. It has been proven that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} (A_n)^\frac{1}{n} = \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

exists. In other words, ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]]. The best known lower bound for ''λ'' is 4.00253.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barequet |first=Gill |url=http://www.cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204031-4-an-improved-lower-bound-on-the-growth-constant-of-polyominoes/fulltext |title=λ &gt; 4: An Improved Lower Bound on the Growth Constant of Polyominoes |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known upper bound, not improved since the 1970s, is {{nowrap|''λ'' &amp;lt; 4.65}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klarner |first=D.A. |author2=Rivest, R.L. |year=1973 |title=A procedure for improving the upper bound for the number of ''n''-ominoes |journal=Canadian Journal of Mathematics |volume=25 |pages=585–602 |url=http://historical.ncstrl.org/litesite-data/stan/CS-TR-72-263.pdf |format=PDF of technical report version |accessdate=2007-05-11 |doi=10.4153/CJM-1973-060-4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126083002/http://historical.ncstrl.org/litesite-data/stan/CS-TR-72-263.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To establish a lower bound, a simple but highly effective method is concatenation of polyominoes. Define the upper-right square to be the rightmost square in the uppermost row of the polyomino. Define the bottom-left square similarly. Then, the upper-right square of any polyomino of size ''n'' can be attached to the bottom-left square of any polyomino of size ''m'' to produce a unique (''n''+''m'')-omino. This proves {{nowrap|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;le; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Using this equation, one can show {{nowrap|''λ'' &amp;ge; (''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all ''n''. Refinements of this procedure combined with data for ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' produce the lower bound given above.

The upper bound is attained by generalizing the inductive method of enumerating polyominoes. Instead of adding one square at a time, one adds a cluster of squares at a time. This is often described as adding ''twigs''. By proving that every ''n''-omino is a sequence of twigs, and by proving limits on the combinations of possible twigs, one obtains an upper bound on the number of ''n''-ominoes. For example, in the algorithm outlined above, at each step we must choose a larger number, and at most three new numbers are added (since at most three unnumbered squares are adjacent to any numbered square). This can be used to obtain an upper bound of 6.75. Using 2.8 million twigs, [[David A. Klarner|Klarner]] and [[Ron Rivest|Rivest]] obtained an upper bound of 4.65.

====Free polyominoes====
Approximations for the number of fixed polyominoes and free polyominoes are related in a simple way. A free polyomino with no [[symmetries]] (rotation or reflection) corresponds to 8 distinct fixed polyominoes, and for large ''n'', most ''n''-ominoes have no symmetries. Therefore, the number of fixed ''n''-ominoes is approximately 8 times the number of free ''n''-ominoes. Moreover, this approximation is exponentially more accurate as ''n'' increases.&lt;ref name="Redelmeier, section 3"/&gt;

===Special classes of polyominoes===
Exact formulas are known for enumerating polyominoes of special classes, such as the class of ''convex'' polyominoes and the class of ''directed'' polyominoes.

The definition of a ''convex'' polyomino is different from the usual definition of [[Convex set|convexity]], but is similar to the definition used for the [[orthogonal convex hull]]. A polyomino is said to be ''vertically'' or ''column convex'' if its intersection with any vertical line is convex (in other words, each column has no holes). Similarly, a polyomino is said to be ''horizontally'' or ''row convex'' if its intersection with any horizontal line is convex.  A polyomino is said to be ''convex'' if it is row and column convex.&lt;ref name=W151&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilf | first=Herbert S. | authorlink=Herbert Wilf | title=Generatingfunctionology | edition=2nd | location=Boston, MA | publisher=Academic Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-12-751956-4 | zbl=0831.05001 | page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A polyomino is said to be ''directed'' if it contains a square, known as the ''root'', such that every other square can be reached by movements of up or right one square, without leaving the polyomino.

Directed polyominoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bousquet-Mélou |first=Mireille | authorlink = Mireille Bousquet-Mélou |year=1998 |title=New enumerative results on two-dimensional directed animals |journal=Discrete Mathematics |volume=180 |issue=1–3 |pages=73–106 |doi=10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00109-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; column (or row) convex polyominoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delest |first=M.-P. |year=1988 |title=Generating functions for column-convex polyominoes |journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=12–31 |doi=10.1016/0097-3165(88)90071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and convex polyominoes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bousquet-Mélou |first1=Mireille | author1-link = Mireille Bousquet-Mélou |last2=Fédou | first2 = Jean-Marc |year=1995 |title=The generating function of convex polyominoes: The resolution of a ''q''-differential system |journal=Discrete Mathematics |volume=137 |issue=1–3 |pages=53–75 |doi=10.1016/0012-365X(93)E0161-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been effectively enumerated by area ''n'', as well as by some other parameters such as perimeter, using [[generating function]]s.

A polyomino is [[equable shape|equable]] if its area equals its perimeter. An equable polyomino must be made from an [[even number]] of squares; every even number greater than 15 is possible. For instance, the 16-omino in the form of a 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4 square and the 18-omino in the form of a 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;6 rectangle are both equable. For polyominoes with fewer than 15 squares, the perimeter always exceeds the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Geometry Labs|first=Henri|last=Picciotto|year=1999|publisher=MathEducationPage.org|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7gTMKr7TT6gC&amp;pg=PA208}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiling with polyominoes==
In [[recreational mathematics]], challenges are often posed for [[Tessellation|tiling]] a prescribed region, or the entire plane, with polyominoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=George E. |title=Polyominoes: A guide to puzzles and problems in tiling |year=1996 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |isbn=0-88385-501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related problems are investigated in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].

===Tiling regions with sets of polyominoes===
Puzzles commonly ask for tiling a given region with a given set of polyominoes, such as the 12 pentominoes. Golomb's and Gardner's books have many examples. A typical puzzle is to tile a 6×10 rectangle with the twelve pentominoes; the 2339 solutions to this were found in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C.B. Haselgrove |author2=Jenifer Haselgrove |date=October 1960 |title=A Computer Program for Pentominoes |journal=[[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|Eureka]] |volume=23 |pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where multiple copies of the polyominoes in the set are allowed, Golomb defines a hierarchy of different regions that a set may be able to tile, such as rectangles, strips, and the whole plane, and shows that whether polyominoes from a given set can tile the plane is [[recursive set|undecidable]], by mapping sets of [[Wang tile]]s to sets of polyominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Golomb |first=Solomon W. |year=1970 |title=Tiling with Sets of Polyominoes |journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory |volume=9 |pages=60–71 |doi=10.1016/S0021-9800(70)80055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiling regions with copies of a single polyomino===
Another class of problems asks whether copies of a given polyomino can tile a [[rectangle]], and if so, what rectangles they can tile.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, ''Polyominoes'', chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; These problems have been extensively studied for particular polyominoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Polyomino/rectifiable_bib.html |title=References for Rectifiable Polyominoes |accessdate=2007-05-11 |last=Reid |first=Michael |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040116204311/http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Polyomino/rectifiable_bib.html |archivedate=2004-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tables of results for individual polyominoes are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Polyomino/rectifiable_data.html |title=List of known prime rectangles for various polyominoes |accessdate=2007-05-11 |last=Reid |first=Michael |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416210221/http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Polyomino/rectifiable_data.html |archivedate=2007-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David A. Klarner|Klarner]] and Göbel showed that for any polyomino there is a finite set of ''prime'' rectangles it tiles, such that all other rectangles it tiles can be tiled by those prime rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klarner |first=D.A. |author2=Göbel, F. |year=1969 |title=Packing boxes with congruent figures |journal=Indagationes Mathematicae |volume=31 |pages=465–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical.ncstrl.org/litesite-data/stan/CS-TR-73-338.pdf |title=A Finite Basis Theorem Revisited |accessdate=2007-05-12 |last=Klarner |first=David A. |date=February 1973 |format=PDF |publisher=Stanford University Technical Report STAN-CS-73–338 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023221204/http://historical.ncstrl.org/litesite-data/stan/CS-TR-73-338.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamenetsky and Cooke showed how various disjoint (called "holey") polyominoes can tile rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1411.2699 |title=Tiling rectangles with holey polyominoes|last=Kamenetsky |first=Dmitry | author2=Cooke, Tristrom |date=2015|class=cs.CG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond rectangles, Golomb gave his hierarchy for single polyominoes: a polyomino may tile a rectangle, a half strip, a bent strip, an enlarged copy of itself, a quadrant, a strip, a [[half plane]], the whole plane, certain combinations, or none of these. There are certain implications among these, both obvious (for example, if a polyomino tiles the half plane then it tiles the whole plane) and less so (for example, if a polyomino tiles an enlarged copy of itself, then it tiles the quadrant). Polyominoes of orders up to 6 are characterized in this hierarchy (with the status of one hexomino, later found to tile a rectangle, unresolved at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Golomb |first=Solomon W. |year=1966 |title=Tiling with Polyominoes |journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory |volume=1 |pages=280–296 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/S0021-9800(66)80033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Cris Moore|Cristopher Moore]] and John Michael Robson showed that the problem of tiling one polyomino with copies of another is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Cristopher |authorlink1=Cris Moore |last2=Robson |first2=John Michael |title=Hard Tiling Problems with Simple Tiles |year=2001 |url=http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/00-03-019.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617140921/http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/00-03-019.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ivars|last=Petersen|title=Math Trek: Tiling with Polyominoes|date=September 25, 1999|journal=[[Science News]]|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc99/9_25_99/mathland.htm|access-date=March 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320031732/http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc99/9_25_99/mathland.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiling the plane with copies of a single polyomino===
Tiling the plane with copies of a single polyomino has also been much discussed. It was noted in 1965 that all polyominoes up to hexominoes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Martin |date=July 1965 |title=On the relation between mathematics and the ordered patterns of Op art |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=213 |issue=1 |pages=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all but four heptominoes tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Martin |date=August 1965 |title=Thoughts on the task of communication with intelligent organisms on other worlds |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=213 |issue=2 |pages=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then established by David Bird that all but 26 octominoes tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Martin |date=August 1975 |title=More about tiling the plane: the possibilities of polyominoes, polyiamonds and polyhexes |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=233 |issue=2 |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawsthorne found that all but 235 polyominoes of order 9 tile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rawsthorne |first=Daniel A. |year=1988 |title=Tiling complexity of small ''n''-ominoes (''n''&lt;10) |journal=Discrete Mathematics |volume=70 |pages=71–75 |doi=10.1016/0012-365X(88)90081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such results have been extended to higher orders by Rhoads (to order 14)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhoads |first=Glenn C. |title=Planar Tilings and the Search for an Aperiodic Prototile |year=2003 |publisher=PhD dissertation, Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Polyominoes tiling the plane have been classified by the symmetries of their tilings and by the number of aspects (orientations) in which the tiles appear in them.&lt;ref&gt;Grünbaum and Shephard, section 9.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keating |first=K. |author2=Vince, A. |year=1999 |title=Isohedral Polyomino Tiling of the Plane |journal=Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry |volume=21 |pages=615–630 |doi=10.1007/PL00009442 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conway criterion false negative nonominoes.svg|thumb|180px|The two tiling nonominoes not satisfying the Conway criterion.]]
The study of which polyominoes can tile the plane has been facilitated using the [[Conway criterion]]: except for two nonominoes, all tiling polyominoes up to order 9 form a patch of at least one tile satisfying it, with higher-order exceptions more frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rhoads |first=Glenn C. |year=2005 |title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds |journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics |volume=174 |pages=329–353 |doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several polyominoes can tile larger copies of themselves, and repeating this process recursively gives a [[rep-tile]] tiling of the plane. For instance, for every positive integer {{mvar|n}}, it is possible to combine {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} copies of the L-tromino, L-tetromino, or P-pentomino into a single larger shape similar to the smaller polyomino from which it was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Tiling a common figure with various polyominoes===
[[Image:PentominoCompatibilityTW.svg|thumb|A minimal compatibility figure for the T and W [[pentomino]]es.]]
The ''compatibility problem'' is to take two or more polyominoes and find a figure that can be tiled with each. Polyomino compatibility has been widely studied since the 1990s. Jorge Luis Mireles and Giovanni Resta have published websites of systematic results,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027093922/http://geocities.com/jorgeluismireles/polypolyominoes/ Mireles, J.L., "Poly&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ominoes"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iread.it/Poly/ |title=Resta, G., "Polypolyominoes" |access-date=2010-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222051130/http://www.iread.it/Poly/ |archive-date=2011-02-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Livio Zucca shows results for some complicated cases like three different pentominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://userpages.monmouth.com/~colonel/rosp/triplep.html |title=Zucca, L., "Remembrance of Software Past" |access-date=2011-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315235124/http://userpages.monmouth.com/~colonel/rosp/triplep.html |archive-date=2012-03-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general problem can be hard. The first compatibility figure for the L and X pentominoes was published in 2005 and had 80 tiles of each kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Barbans |first=Uldis |last2=Cibulis |first2=Andris |last3=Lee |first3=Gilbert |last4=Liu |first4=Andy |last5=Wainwright |first5=Robert |contribution=Polyomino Number Theory (III) |editor-last=Cipra |editor-first=Barry |editor-link = Barry A.

Peters |year=2005 |pages=131–136 |isbn=978-1-56881-204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pairs of polyominoes have been proved incompatible by systematic exhaustion. No algorithm is known for deciding whether two arbitrary polyominoes are compatible.

==Polyominoes in puzzles and games==
In addition to the tiling problems described above, there are recreational mathematics puzzles that require folding a polyomino to create other shapes. Gardner proposed several simple games with a set of free pentominoes and a chessboard. Some variants of the [[Sudoku#Variants|Sudoku]] puzzle use polyomino-shaped regions on the grid. The video game [[Tetris]] is based on the seven one-sided tetrominoes (spelled "Tetriminos" in the game), and the board game [[Blokus]] uses all of the free polyominoes up to pentominoes.

==Etymology==
The word ''polyomino'' and the names of the various orders of polyomino are all back-formations from the word ''[[Dominoes|domino]]'', a common game piece consisting of two squares, with the first letter ''d-'' fancifully interpreted as a version of the prefix ''di-'' meaning "two."  The name ''domino'' for the game piece is believed to come from the spotted masquerade garment ''domino'', from Latin ''dominus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition, entry ''domino''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the [[numerical prefix]]es are Greek. Polyominoes of order 9 and 11 more often take the Latin prefixes ''nona-'' (nonomino) and ''undeca-'' (undecomino) than the Greek prefixes ''ennea-'' (enneomino) and ''hendeca-'' (hendecomino).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9804">'''Protein subcellular localization prediction''' (or just protein localization prediction) involves the prediction of where a [[protein]] resides in a [[cell (biology)|cell]], its [[subcellular localization]].

In general, prediction tools take as input information about a protein, such as a [[protein sequence]] of [[amino acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and produce a predicted location within the cell as output, such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[Endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]], [[extracellular space]], or other [[Organelle|organelles]]. The aim is to build tools that can accurately predict the outcome of [[protein targeting]] in cells.

Prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important component of [[bioinformatics]] based prediction of [[protein function]] and [[genome project|genome annotation]], and it can aid the identification of drug targets. 

== Background ==

Experimentally determining the [[subcellular localization]] of a [[protein]] can be a laborious and time consuming task. [[Immunolabeling]] or tagging (such as with a [[green fluorescent protein]]) to view localization using [[fluorescence microscope]] are often used. A high throughput alternative is to use prediction. 

Through the development of new approaches in computer science, coupled with an increased dataset of proteins of known localization, computational tools can now provide fast and accurate localization predictions for many organisms. This has resulted in subcellular localization prediction becoming one of the challenges being successfully aided by [[bioinformatics]], and [[machine learning]].

Many prediction methods now exceed the accuracy of some high-throughput laboratory methods for the identification of protein subcellular localization.&lt;ref name="pmid16288665"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rey S, Gardy JL, Brinkman FS | title = Assessing the precision of high-throughput computational and laboratory approaches for the genome-wide identification of protein subcellular localization in bacteria | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 162 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16288665 | pmc = 1314894 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-6-162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, some predictors have been developed&lt;ref name="chou1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou KC, Shen HB | title = Cell-PLoc: a package of Web servers for predicting subcellular localization of proteins in various organisms | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–62 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18274516 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used to deal with proteins that may simultaneously exist, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Experimental validation is typically required to confirm the predicted localizations.

Predictors can be specialized for proteins in different organisms. Some are specialized for eukaryotic proteins,&lt;ref name="pmid21483473"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou KC, Wu ZC, Xiao X | title = iLoc-Euk: a multi-label classifier for predicting the subcellular localization of singleplex and multiplex eukaryotic proteins | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e18258 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21483473 | pmc = 3068162 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some for human proteins,&lt;ref name="pmid19651102"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shen HB, Chou KC | title = A top-down approach to enhance the power of predicting human protein subcellular localization: Hum-mPLoc 2.0 | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 394 | issue = 2 | pages = 269–74 | date = Nov 2009 | pmid = 19651102 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2009.07.046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and some for plant proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid20596258"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou KC, Shen HB | title = Plant-mPLoc: a top-down strategy to augment the power for predicting plant protein subcellular localization | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11335 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20596258 | pmc = 2893129 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods for the prediction of bacterial localization predictors, and their accuracy, have been reviewed.&lt;ref name="pmid16964270"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardy JL, Brinkman FS | title = Methods for predicting bacterial protein subcellular localization | journal = Nature Reviews.

Protein sorting signals and prediction of subcellular localization.  Adv. Protein Chem., 2000, 54, 277-344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chou, K. C.; Shen, H. B.  Review: Recent progresses in protein subcellular location prediction" ''Anal. Biochem'' 2007, 370, 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent tools and an experience report can be found in a recent paper by [http://bioinformatics.ysu.edu/tools/subcell.html Meinken and Min (2012)].

== Application ==

Knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein can significantly improve target identification during the [[drug discovery]] process. For example, [[secreted protein]]s and [[plasma membrane]] proteins are easily accessible by drug molecules due to their localization in the extracellular space or on the cell surface.

Bacterial cell surface and secreted proteins are also of interest for their potential as vaccine candidates or as diagnostic targets. Aberrant subcellular localization of proteins has been observed in the cells of several diseases, such as [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Secreted proteins from some archaea that can survive in unusual environments have industrially important applications.

By using prediction a high number of proteins can be assessed in order to find candidates that are trafficked to the desired location.

== Databases ==

The results of subcellular localization prediction can be stored in databases. Examples include the multi-species database [https://compartments.jensenlab.org/ Compartments], FunSecKB2, a fungal database;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioinformatics.ysu.edu/secretomes/fungi2/index.php|title=FunSecKB2 (The Fungal Secretome and Subcellular Proteome KnowledgeBase 2.1)|website=bioinformatics.ysu.edu|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; PlantSecKB, a plant database;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioinformatics.ysu.edu/secretomes/plant/index.php|title=PlantSecKB (The Plant Secretome and Subcellular Proteome KnowledgeBase)|website=bioinformatics.ysu.edu|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetazSecKB, an animal and human database;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioinformatics.ysu.edu/secretomes/animal/index.php|title=MetazSecKB (The Metazoa (Human &amp; Animal) Protein Subcelluar Location, Secretome and Subcellular Proteome Database)|website=bioinformatics.ysu.edu|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ProtSecKB, a protist database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proteomics.ysu.edu/secretomes/protist/index.php|title=ProtSecKB (The Protist Secretome and Subcellular Proteome KnowledgeBase)|website=proteomics.ysu.edu|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6364">In [[mathematics]], a '''pseudometric space''' is a [[generalization]] of a [[metric space]] in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. In the same way as every [[normed space]] is a [[metric space]], every [[seminormed space]] is a pseudometric space. Because of this analogy the term [[semimetric space]] (which has a different meaning in [[topology]]) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in [[functional analysis]].

When a topology is generated using a family of pseudometrics, the space is called a [[gauge space]].

==Definition==
A pseudometric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a non-negative real-valued function &lt;math&gt;d\colon X \times X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; (called a '''pseudometric''') such that, for every &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

#&lt;math&gt;d(x,x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt; (''symmetry'')
#&lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \leqslant d(x,y) + d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; (''[[subadditivity]]''/''[[triangle inequality]]'')
&lt;!-- \,\!  not useful anymore, hence not mentioned in WP:MATH. --&gt;

Unlike a metric space, points in a pseudometric space need not be [[identity of indiscernibles|distinguishable]]; that is, one may have &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt; for distinct values &lt;math&gt;x\ne y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* Pseudometrics arise naturally in [[functional analysis]]. Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(X)&lt;/math&gt; of real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; together with a special point &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X&lt;/math&gt;. This point then induces a pseudometric on the space of functions, given by
::&lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = |f(x_0)-g(x_0)|&lt;/math&gt;
:for &lt;math&gt;f,g\in \mathcal{F}(X)&lt;/math&gt;

* For vector spaces &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, a [[seminorm]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; induces a pseudometric on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, as
::&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=p(x-y).&lt;/math&gt;
:Conversely, a homogeneous, translation invariant pseudometric induces a seminorm.

* Pseudometrics also arise in the theory of hyperbolic [[complex manifold]]s: see [[Kobayashi metric]].
* Every [[measure space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu)&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a complete pseudometric space by defining
::&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := \mu(A\vartriangle B)&lt;/math&gt;
:for all &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, where the triangle denotes [[symmetric difference]].
* If &lt;math&gt;f:X_1 \rightarrow X_2&lt;/math&gt; is a function and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a pseudometric on X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y) := d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt;/math&gt; gives a pseudometric on X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a metric and f is [[Injective function|injective]], then d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a metric.

==Topology==
The '''pseudometric topology''' is the [[topological space|topology]] induced by the [[open balls]]

:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p)=\{ x\in X\mid d(p,x)&lt;r \},&lt;/math&gt;

which form a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=6284|title=Pseudometric topology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A topological space is said to be a '''pseudometrizable topological space''' if the space can be given a pseudometric such that the pseudometric topology coincides with the given topology on the space.

The difference between pseudometrics and metrics is entirely topological. That is, a pseudometric is a metric if and only if the topology it generates is [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] (i.e. distinct points are topologically distinguishable).

==Metric identification==
The vanishing of the pseudometric induces an [[equivalence relation]], called the '''metric identification''', that converts the pseudometric space into a full-fledged [[metric space]].  This is done by defining &lt;math&gt;x\sim y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X^*=X/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of {{Var|X}} by this equivalence relation and define
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  d^*:(X/\sim)&amp;\times (X/\sim)\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \\
  d^*([x],[y])&amp;=d(x,y)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;d^*&lt;/math&gt; is a metric on &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X^*,d^*)&lt;/math&gt; is a well-defined metric space, called the '''metric space induced by the pseudometric space''' &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howes|first=Norman R.|title=Modern Analysis and Topology|year=1995|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-387-97986-7|url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/analysis/book/978-0-387-97986-1|accessdate=10 September 2012|page=27|quote=Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a pseudo-metric space and define an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be the quotient space &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; the canonical projection that maps each point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; onto the equivalence class that contains it. Define the metric &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\rho(a,b) = d(p^{-1}(a),p^{-1}(b))&lt;/math&gt; for each pair &lt;math&gt;a,b \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. It is easily shown that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a metric and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; defines the quotient topology on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A comprehensive course in analysis|last=Simon|first=Barry|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2015|isbn=1470410990|location=Providence, Rhode Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metric identification preserves the induced topologies. That is, a subset &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is open (or closed) in &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi(A)=[A]&lt;/math&gt; is open (or closed) in &lt;math&gt;(X^*,d^*)&lt;/math&gt; and A is saturated. The topological identification is the [[Kolmogorov quotient]].

An example of this construction is the [[Complete metric space#Completion|completion of a metric space]] by its [[Cauchy sequences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9215">A '''smart market''' is a periodic [[auction]] which is cleared by the [[operations research]] technique of [[mathematical optimization]], such as [[linear programming]]. The '''smart market''' is operated by a market manager. Trades are not bilateral, between pairs of people, but rather to or from a pool.  A smart market can assist market operation when trades would otherwise have significant [[transaction costs]] or [[externalities]].

Most other types of [[auctions]] can be cleared by a simple process of [[sorting]] bids from lowest to highest. Goods may be divisible, as with milk or flour, or indivisible, as with paintings or houses. Finding a market-clearing allocation corresponds to solution of a simple [[knapsack problem]], and does not require much computation. By contrast, a smart market allows [[market clearing]] with arbitrary constraints. During market design, constraints are selected to match the relevant physics and economics of the allocation problem. A good overview is given in McCabe et al. (1991).&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Kevin, Stephen Rassenti, and Vernon Smith (1991). Smart computer-assisted markets. Science. 254 534-538.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorial auction]]s are smart markets in which goods are indivisible,&lt;ref&gt;Pekec, Aleksandar and Michael H. Rothkopf (2003), Combinatorial Auction Design, MANAGEMENT SCIENCE, Vol. 49, No. 11, November 2003, pp. 1485-1503.&lt;/ref&gt; but some smart markets allocate divisible goods such as electricity and natural gas.

Compared to traditional market structures, a smart market substantially reduces transaction costs, allows competition which would not be possible otherwise, and can eliminate externalities. Despite complex constraints, a smart market allows the benefits of a modern financial exchange system. Fulfilment of the contract is backed by the exchange; parties are generally anonymous; the market manager enforces regulation to ensure fairness and transparency; and markets are orderly, especially during stressful conditions.

A smart market may be a one-sided auction in which participants buy from the market manager, a one-sided [[procurement]] ([[reverse auction]]) in which participants sell to the market manager, or two-sided, in which the market manager balances supplying participants with demanding participants. In a two-sided smart market, the market manager may be a net seller, a net buyer, or simply a revenue-neutral broker.

Smart markets are achievable due to an enabling confluence of technologies: the internet to transmit users’ bids and the resulting prices and quantities, increased computation power to run the simulation and linear program, and real time monitoring.

==Examples of smart markets==

The term appears to have been first used by Rassenti, Smith, and Bulfin in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Rassenti, S.J., V.L. Smith, and R.L. Bluffing (1982). “A Combinatorial Auction Mechanism for Airport time Slot Allocation,” Bell J. of Economics, v.13, pp. 402-417.&lt;/ref&gt; That article proposed a [[combinatorial auction]] for airplane take-off and landing slots. The U.S. government is now seeking to implement such an auction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/nyregion/05slots.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[electricity market]] is an important example of a two-sided smart market.,&lt;ref&gt;Alvey T., Goodwin D., Xingwang M., Streiffert D. and Sun D. (1998). A security-constrained bid-clearing system for the NZ wholesale electricity market. IEEE Trans. Power Systems, 13(2), 340-346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogan W.W, Read E.G and Ring B.J. (1996). Using Mathematical Programming for Electricity Spot Pricing. Int’l Trans. in Operations Research, 3, (3-4), 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity markets clear every few minutes, and require coordination to ensure that power [[generation]] matches demand, and that power flows do not exceed network line capacities. Generators offer to supply tranches of power at a range of prices. Wholesale power distributors bid to buy tranches of power at a range of prices. To clear the market, the market manager solves a linear program in which the decision variables are how much power to accept from each generator, the flow of power on each line, and how much power to provide to each distributor. 

After solution, the primal variables prescribe the dispatch (that is, how much power each generator should produce). The dual variables provide the market clearing prices. By clearing the market based on the dual prices, participants are charged on marginal values, rather than as bid. Thus, every seller is guaranteed to receive at least as much as was bid and possibly more. Every buyer is guaranteed to pay no more than was offered, and possibly less. Without the smart market, the line operator, all generators, and all distributors would have to be part of a [[monopoly]] in order to guarantee system coordination.

[[Natural gas]] markets are sometimes cleared by smart markets,&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Kevin, Stephen Rasenti, and Vernon Smith (1990). Auction Design for Composite Goods: The Natural Gas Industry, J. of Economic Behavior and Organization, September, 127-149.&lt;/ref&gt; as in Australia [http://www.vencorp.com.au]. The system operator serves as the market manager. Operation of the gas pipeline network require coordination to ensure that gas supply matches demand, and that flows do not exceed pipe capacities. Gas suppliers offer a range of quantities at a range of prices. Distributors bid to buy a range of quantities at a range of prices. To clear the market, the market manager solves a linear program in which the decision variables are the gas to accept from each supplier, the flow of gas on each pipe segment, and how much gas to provide to each distributor. As with electricity markets, after solution, the primal variables prescribe the optimal flows, and the dual variables provide the market clearing prices. The objective minimizes the cost of supplying power.

The [[spectrum auction]] is a one-sided smart market which is cleared by an integer program.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravorti, B., W.W. Sharkey, Y. Spiegel and S. Wilkie (1995). Auctioning the Airwaves: The Contest for Broadband PCS Spectrum, J. Econ. &amp; Mgt Strategy, 4(2), 267-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants purchase radio spectrum from government. These [[combinatorial auction]]s are cleared as bid, rather than at prices based on dual variables. Only recently have researchers found robust means to obtain dual variables from [[integer programs]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, R.P., P.M. Sotkiewicz, B.F. Hobbs, M.H. Rothkopf, W.R. Stewart (2005). Effective market-clearing prices in markets with non-convexities. European Journal of Operational Research. 164 269-285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies and governments sometimes use smart markets in procurement, as for [[transportation]] services. The Chilean government, for example, uses a smart market to choose caterers for school meal programs.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Rafael, Lysette Henriquez, Jaime Catalán, Gabriel Y. Weintraub, Cristián Martinez, “A Combinatorial Auction Improves School Meals in Chile,” Interfaces, vol. 32, no. 6, Nov-Dec 2002, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]] uses a smart market for course registration. The system ensures that the class seats go to those students who most want them, while ensuring that the number of students in each class stays within the room capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, R.L., J. Sankaran, and L. Schrage (1993). An Auction Method for Course Registration, Interfaces, 23(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart markets are now being proposed for environmental services, including water.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J. J., A. Dinar, et al. (2000). The Design of ‘Smart’ Water Market Institutions Using Laboratory Experiments. Env and Resource Economics 17(4), 375-394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raffensperger, J. F. and M. Milke (2005). A Design for a Fresh Water Spot Market. Water Science and Technology: Water Supply 5(6), 217-224.&lt;/ref&gt; The more sophisticated of these designs rely on [[hydrological optimization]] &lt;ref&gt;Ahlfeld, D., Barlow, P., and Mulligan, A. (2005). GWM–A ground–water mgt process for the USGS modular ground–water model (MODFLOW–2000), U.S. Geological Survey Open–File Report 2005–1072.
&lt;/ref&gt; and hydrological run-off models.

== Formulations ==

A smart market formulation may be written as a net pool, in which the decision variables explicitly calculate buys and sells, and the market model clears only those quantities. The net pool market can be mathematically infeasible if participants are unwilling to trade sufficient quantities to allow feasibility. Alternatively, the formulation may be a gross pool, in which the decision variables determine total quantities that each participant receives; the market manager calculates net sales after the model's solution, based on participants' initial holdings. The gross pool market will tend to be mathematically feasible, but could have an unacceptably high cost in the optimal objective value, should (buy) bids be too low compared to (sell) offers. The difference between these two formulations is only technical, as the market designs are economically equivalent by the [[Coase theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15963">[[File:Composite number Cuisenaire rods 10.png|thumb|10 is square-free, as its divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10, none of which is a perfect square (the first few perfect squares being 1, 4, 9, and 16)]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''square-free integer''' (or '''squarefree integer''') is an [[integer]] which is [[divisor|divisible]] by no [[square number|perfect square]] other than 1. That is, its [[prime factorization]] has exactly one factor for each prime that appears in it. For example, {{nowrap|1=10 = 2 ⋅ 5}} is square-free, but {{nowrap|1=18 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3}} is not, because 18 is divisible by {{nowrap|1=9 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The smallest positive square-free numbers are

:1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, ... {{OEIS|id=A005117}}

==Square-free factors of integers==
The [[radical of an integer]] is its largest square-free factor. An integer is square-free [[if and only if]] it is equal to its radical.

Any arbitrary positive integer {{math|''n''}} can be represented in a unique way as the product of a [[powerful number]] (that is a integer such that is divisible by the square of every prime factor) and a square-free integer, which are [[coprime]]. The square-free factor, called the ''square-free part'' of the number, is the largest square-free divisor {{math|''k''}} of {{math|''n''}} that is coprime with {{math|''n''/''k''}}. The square-free part of an integer may be smaller than the largest square-free divisor.

Any arbitrary positive integer {{math|''n''}} can be represented in a unique way as the product of a [[square]] and a square-free integer :
:&lt;math&gt; n=m^2 k&lt;/math&gt;
In this factorization, {{math|''m''}} is the largest divisor of ''{{math|n''}} such that {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a divisor of {{math|''n''}}. 

In summary, there are three square-free factors that are naturally associated to every integer: the square-free part, the above factor {{mvar|k}}, and the largest square-free factor. Each is a factor of the next one. All are easily deduced from a [[prime factorization]]: if
:&lt;math&gt;n=\prod_{i=1}^h p_i^{e_i}&lt;/math&gt;
is the prime factorization of {{mvar|n}}, where &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots, p_h&lt;/math&gt; are distinct prime numbers, then the square-free part is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{e_i=1} p_i,&lt;/math&gt;
The square-free factor such the quotient is a square is 
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{e_i \text{ odd}} p_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and the largest square-free factor is 
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^h p_i.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if &lt;math&gt;n=75600=2^4\cdot 3^3\cdot 5^2\cdot 7,&lt;/math&gt; the square-free part is {{math|7}}, the square-free factor such that the quotient is a square is {{math|1=3 ⋅ 7 = 21}}, and the largest square-free factor is {{math|1=2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 = 210}}.

No algorithm is known for computing any of these square-free factors, which is faster than computing the complete prime factorization. In particular, there is no known [[polynomial-time]] algorithm for computing the square-free part of an integer, and no known polynomial-time algorithm for [[decision problem|determining]] whether a number is square-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adleman|first=Leonard M.|last2=Mccurley|first2=Kevin S.|date=|title=Open Problems in Number Theoretic Complexity, II|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.48.4877|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite, polynomial-time algorithms are known for [[primality testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=Manindra|last2=Kayal|first2=Neeraj|last3=Saxena|first3=Nitin|date=2004-09-01|title=PRIMES is in P|url=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2004/160-2/p12|journal=Annals of Mathematics|language=en-US|volume=160|issue=2|pages=781–793|doi=10.4007/annals.2004.160.781|issn=0003-486X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major difference between the arithmetic of the integers, and the arithmetic of the [[univariate polynomial]]s, as polynomial-time algorithms are known for [[square-free factorization]] of polynomials (in short, the largest square-free factor of a polynomial is its quotient by the [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of the polynomial and its [[formal derivative]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richards, C.: Algorithms for factoring square-free polynomials over finite fields. Master thesis, Simon Fraser University, Canada (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalent characterizations==
A positive integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if in the [[canonical representation of a positive integer|prime factorization]] of ''n'', no prime factor occurs with an exponent larger than one. Another way of stating the same is that for every prime [[divisor|factor]] ''p'' of ''n'', the prime ''p'' does not evenly divide&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''p''. Also ''n'' is square-free if and only if in every factorization ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab'', the factors ''a'' and ''b'' are [[coprime]].  An immediate result of this definition is that all prime numbers are square-free.

A positive integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if all [[abelian group]]s of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]], which is the case if and only if any such group is [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This follows from the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s.

A integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if the [[factor ring]] '''Z'''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''n'''''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) is a [[product of rings|product]] of [[field (mathematics)|field]]s. This follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] and the fact that a ring of the form '''Z'''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''k'''''Z''' is a field if and only if ''k'' is a prime.

For every positive integer ''n'', the set of all positive divisors of ''n'' becomes a [[partially ordered set]] if we use [[divisor|divisibility]] as the order relation. This partially ordered set is always a [[distributive lattice]]. It is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] if and only if ''n'' is square-free.

A positive integer ''n'' is square-free [[if and only if]] &amp;mu;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, where μ denotes the [[Möbius function]].

==Dirichlet generating function==
The [[Dirichlet generating function]] for the square-free numbers is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(2s) } = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ |\mu(n)|}{n^{s}} &lt;/math&gt; where &amp;zeta;(''s'') is the [[Riemann zeta function]].

This is easily seen from the [[Euler product]]
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(2s) } =\prod_p \frac{(1-p^{-2s})}{(1-p^{-s})}=\prod_p (1+p^{-s}). &lt;/math&gt;

==Distribution==
Let ''Q''(''x'') denote the number of square-free integers between 1 and ''x'' ({{OEIS2C|A013928}} shifting index by 1). For large ''n'', 3/4 of the positive integers less than ''n'' are not divisible by 4, 8/9 of these numbers are not divisible by 9, and so on. Because these events are independent, we obtain the approximation:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) \approx x\prod_{p\ \text{prime}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) = x\prod_{p\ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p^2})^{-1}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) \approx x\prod_{p\ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{p^2}+\frac{1}{p^4}+\cdots} = \frac{x}{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}} = \frac{x}{\zeta(2)} &lt;/math&gt;

This argument can be made rigorous, and a very elementary estimate yields

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = \frac{x}{\zeta(2)} + O\left(\sqrt{x}\right) = \frac{6x}{\pi^2} + O\left(\sqrt{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[pi]] and [[big O notation]]) since we use the above characterization to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=\sum_{n\leq x} \sum_{d^2\mid n} \mu(d)=\sum_{d\leq x} \mu(d)\sum_{n\leq x, d^2\mid n}1=\sum_{d\leq x} \mu(d)\left\lfloor\frac{x}{d^2}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
and, observing that the last summand is zero for &lt;math&gt;d&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x)=\sum_{d\leq\sqrt{x}} \mu(d)\left\lfloor\frac{x}{d^2}\right\rfloor
=\sum_{d\leq\sqrt{x}} \frac{x\mu(d)}{d^2}+O(\sum_{d\leq\sqrt{x}} 1)
=x\sum_{d\leq\sqrt{x}} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^2}+O(\sqrt{x})
=x\sum_{d} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^2}+O\left(x\sum_{d&gt;\sqrt{x}}\frac{1}{d^2}+\sqrt{x}\right)
=\frac{x}{\zeta(2)}+O(\sqrt{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;
By exploiting the largest known zero-free region of the Riemann zeta function, due to [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]], {{Interlanguage link multi|N.M. Korobov|ru|3=Коробов, Николай Михайлович}} and [[Hans-Egon Richert]], the maximal size of the error term has been reduced
by [[Arnold Walfisz]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Walfisz. "Weylsche Exponentialsummen in der neueren Zahlentheorie" ([[VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften]], Berlin 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and we have
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = \frac{6x}{\pi^2} + O\left(x^{1/2}\exp\left(-c\frac{(\log x)^{3/5}}{(\log\log x)^{1/5}}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
for some positive constant ''c''. Under the [[Riemann hypothesis]], the error term can be further reduced&lt;ref&gt;Jia, Chao Hua. "The distribution of square-free numbers", ''Science in China Series A: Mathematics'' '''36''':2 (1993), pp. 154–169. Cited in Pappalardi 2003, [http://www.mat.uniroma3.it/users/pappa/papers/allahabad2003.pdf A Survey on ''k''-freeness]; also see Kaneenika Sinha, "[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~kansinha/maxnrevfinal.pdf Average orders of certain arithmetical functions]", ''Journal of the Ramanujan Mathematical Society'' '''21''':3 (2006), pp. 267–277.&lt;/ref&gt; to yield
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = \frac{x}{\zeta(2)} + O\left(x^{17/54+\varepsilon}\right) = \frac{6x}{\pi^2} + O\left(x^{17/54+\varepsilon}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The asymptotic/[[natural density]] of square-free numbers is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{Q(x)}{x} = \frac{6}{\pi^2} = \frac{1}{\zeta(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]] and 1/ζ(2) is approximately 0.6079. Therefore over 3/5 of the integers are square-free.

Likewise, if ''Q''(''x'',''n'') denotes the number of ''n''-free integers (e.g. 3-free integers being cube-free integers) between 1 and ''x'', one can show
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x,n) = \frac{x}{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^n}} + O\left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right) = \frac{x}{\zeta(n)} + O\left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since a multiple of 4 must have a square factor 4=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it cannot occur that four consecutive integers are all square-free. On the other hand, there exist infinitely many integers ''n'' for which 4''n'' +1, 4''n'' +2, 4''n'' +3 are all square-free. Otherwise, observing that 4''n'' and at least one of 4''n'' +1, 4''n'' +2, 4''n'' +3 among four could be non-square-free for sufficiently large ''n'', half of all positive integers minus finitely many must be non-square-free and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) \leq \frac{x}{2}+C&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''C'',
contrary to the above asymptotic estimate for &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

There exist sequences of consecutive non-square-free integers of arbitrary length.  Indeed, if ''n'' satisfies a simultaneous congruence
:&lt;math&gt;n\equiv -i\pmod{p_i^2} \qquad (i=1, 2, \ldots, l)&lt;/math&gt;
for distinct primes &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_l&lt;/math&gt;, then each &lt;math&gt;n+i&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''p&lt;sub&gt;i &lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Parent | first1=D. P. |title=Exercises in Number Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] New York | isbn=978-1-4757-5194-9 | url=https://www.springer.com/book/9780387960630 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-5194-9 | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the above-mentioned estimate &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = 6x/\pi^2 + O\left(\sqrt{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; implies that, for some constant ''c'', there always exists a square-free integer between ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;x+c\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; for positive ''x''. Moreover, an elementary argument allows us to replace &lt;math&gt;x+c\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x+cx^{1/5}\log x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michael | first1 = Filaseta | last2 = Ognian | first2 = Trifonov | year = 1992 | title = On gaps between squarefree numbers II | url = | journal = J.

==Encoding as binary numbers==
If we represent a square-free number as the infinite product

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=0}^\infty (p_{n+1})^{a_n}, a_n \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace,\text{ and }p_n\text{ is the }n\text{th prime}, &lt;/math&gt;

then we may take those &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and use them as bits in a binary number with the encoding

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty {a_n}\cdot 2^n .&lt;/math&gt;

The square-free number 42 has factorization 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;7, or as an infinite product 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;11&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;13&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;···  Thus the number 42 may be encoded as the binary sequence &lt;tt&gt;...001011&lt;/tt&gt; or 11 decimal. (Note that the binary digits are reversed from the ordering in the infinite product.)

Since the prime factorization of every number is unique, so also is every binary encoding of the square-free integers.

The converse is also true. Since every positive integer has a unique binary representation it is possible to reverse this encoding so that they may be decoded into a unique square-free integer.

Again, for example, if we begin with the number 42, this time as simply a positive integer, we have its binary representation &lt;tt&gt;101010&lt;/tt&gt;. This decodes to 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;11&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;13&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;13 =&amp;nbsp;273.

Thus binary encoding of squarefree numbers describes a [[bijection]] between the nonnegative integers and the set of positive squarefree integers.

(See sequences [[OEIS:A019565|A019565]], [[OEIS:A048672|A048672]] and [[OEIS:A064273|A064273]] in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]].)

==Erdős squarefree conjecture==
The [[central binomial coefficient]]

: &lt;math&gt;{2n \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;

is never squarefree for ''n'' &gt; 4. This was proven in 1985 for all sufficiently large integers by [[András Sárközy]],&lt;ref&gt;András Sárközy. On divisors of binomial coefficients, I. 
J. Number Theory 20 (1985), no. 1, 70–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and for all integers &gt; 4 in 1996 by [[Olivier Ramaré]] and [[Andrew Granville]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Ramaré and Andrew Granville. Explicit bounds on exponential sums and the scarcity of squarefree binomial coefficients. Mathematika 43 (1996), no. 1, 73–107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squarefree core==
The [[multiplicative function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{core}_t(n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined
to map positive integers ''n'' to ''t''-free numbers by reducing the
exponents in the prime power representation modulo ''t'':
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{core}_t(p^e) = p^{e\bmod t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The value set of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{core}_2&lt;/math&gt;, in particular, are the
square-free integers. Their [[Dirichlet generating function]]s are
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\mathrm{core}_t(n)}{n^s}
= \frac{\zeta(ts)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(ts-t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[OEIS]] representatives are {{OEIS2C|A007913}} (''t''=2), {{OEIS2C|A050985}} (''t''=3) and {{OEIS2C|A053165}} (''t''=4).

'''Technical lettering''' is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other [[character (computing)|characters]] in [[technical drawing]]. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for, an object. With the goals of [[legibility]] and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability.   [[Engineering drawing]]s use a [[sans-serif|Gothic sans-serif]] script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of [[machine]]s.

==Methods of forming letters==
# ''Freehand lettering'' is done without the assistance of tools. To regulate lettering height, commonly 3&amp;nbsp;mm (⅛ in), [[wiktionary:guideline|guidelines]] are drawn.
# ''Mechanical lettering'' is done using tools such as lettering guides, templates, or using a small mechanical [[pantograph]] referred to by the [[Keuffel and Esser]] trademark "Leroy"
# Modern drawings are lettered with [[computer-aided design]] software.

==Freehand lettering==
[[File:Technical Lettering.jpg|thumb|Technical Lettering. Similar to ISOCP font, available in Autocad.]]
The letters to be drawn, though freehanded, should be stable and graceful. In some cases stability is impossible; for example, ''P'' and ''F'' are unavoidably top-heavy.  In other cases the stability and grace of the letters may be maintained either by drawing the lower parts of the letters like ''B'',''E'' etc. wider than the upper parts, or by drawing the horizontal line at the center of these letters just above their geometric axis. (Exception: In case of the letter ''A'', the horizontal member is drawn below the geometric center, to maintain ''equality of areas below and above the center line''. If a horizontal line is drawn exactly at the center, then the difference in the areas of the triangle above the line and the trapezium below the line is much larger. This creates an unusual effect to our eyes.)

Emphasis should be on the overall beauty of a word, rather than individual letters.

Most freehand lettering is done in a "[[sans-serif|gothic]]" style, i.e., with a constant line thickness; either "straight gothic", with vertical strokes perpendicular to the baseline, or "inclined gothic", with vertical strokes at about 75°.

==Mechanical lettering==
[[File:Leroy letter set.jpg|thumb|K &amp; E LEROY lettering set (1959)]]
Mechanical lettering is sometimes done using a [[pantograph]], a device consisting of four bars ("links") which are pinned to each other to form a [[parallelogram]]. The links can pivot about these pins. The lowermost link of the parallelogram is fixed to two rigid supports. One vertical link at one end is connected to a profile tracer, which traces the profile of the letter to be drawn, and the second vertical link and the other horizontal link are jointly connected to a pencil that draws the exact shape of the profile traced.

==Dimensions of letters==
* ''The Nominal Size of lettering'' is defined by the height (h) of the outline contour of the upper-case (capital).
* ''Central Line'' is the imaginary line in the middle of each line or line element which is a constitutive part of a graphic character set.
* If we consider ''d'' as the width of the line element and ''h'' as the height of the line element, then the two standard ratios for d/h are: 1/14 and 1/10, which are feasible because they result in a minimum number of line thicknesses.
* ''Location of Central Lines'' –  The nominal size (h) and the spacing between characters (a) shall be taken as the basis for defining the central line.
*''Range of Nominal Sizes'' – The nominal size is typically one of the sequence 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 5&amp;nbsp;mm, 7&amp;nbsp;mm, 10&amp;nbsp;mm, 14&amp;nbsp;mm, 20&amp;nbsp;mm.  Successive members of this sequence are approximately in a ratio of the [[square root of 2]], as in the [[ISO 216]] series of [[paper size]]s.
*''Lettering Angle'' – The lettering may be vertical (upright) or inclined (sloped) to the right at 75° from the horizontal.
* The spacing between two characters may be reduced by half, if this gives a better visual effect.
* Various letters are divided into number of parts so that dimensions will be accurate.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} [[File:Lettering.jpg|thumb|Dimensioning of Letters]]
* The size of letter is described by its height. According to the height of letters, they are classified as Lettering A or Lettering B.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}{{cn|date=September 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">In [[mathematics]], '''Vopěnka's principle''' is a [[large cardinal]] axiom. 
The intuition behind the axiom is that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every [[proper class]], some members are similar to others, with this similarity formalized through [[elementary embedding]]s.

Vopěnka's principle was first introduced by [[Petr Vopěnka]] and independently considered by [[H. Jerome Keisler]], and was written up by {{harvtxt|Solovay|Reinhardt|Kanamori|1978}}.
According to {{harvtxt|Pudlák|2013|loc=p. 204}}, Vopěnka's principle was originally intended as a joke: Vopěnka was apparently unenthusiastic about large cardinals and introduced his principle as a bogus large cardinal property, planning to show later that it was not consistent. However, before publishing his inconsistency proof he found a flaw in it.

==Definition==

Vopěnka's principle asserts that for every [[proper class]] of [[binary relation]]s (each with set-sized domain), there is one [[elementary embedding|elementarily embeddable]] into another. This cannot be stated as a single sentence of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] as it involves a quantification over classes.  A cardinal κ is called a '''Vopěnka cardinal''' if it is [[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]] and Vopěnka's principle holds in the rank ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; (allowing arbitrary ''S'' ⊂ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; as "classes").
&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanamori|first1=Akihiro||author-link=Akihiro Kanamori|title=The higher infinite: large cardinals in set theory from their beginnings|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=9783540003847|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many equivalent formulations are possible.
For example, Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to each of the following statements. 
* For every proper class of [[Directed graph|simple directed graphs]], there are two members of the class with a homomorphism between them.&lt;ref name="AdR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosicky|first1=Jiří Adámek ; Jiří|title=Locally presentable and accessible categories|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521422612|edition=Digital print. 2004.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For any [[Signature (logic)|signature]] ''Σ'' and any proper class of ''Σ''-structures, there are two members of the class with an elementary embedding between them.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* For every predicate ''P'' and proper class ''S'' of [[ordinal number|ordinals]], there is a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'':(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') → (V&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') for some κ and λ in ''S''.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;
* The [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of ordinals cannot be fully embedded in the category of graphs.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* Every subfunctor of an [[Accessible category|accessible functor]] is accessible.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* (In a definable classes setting) For every natural number ''n'', there exists a [[Extendible cardinal#Variants and relation to other cardinals|''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-extendible cardinal]].&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagaria|first1=Joan|title=''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-cardinals|journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic|date=23 December 2011|volume=51|issue=3–4|pages=213–240|doi=10.1007/s00153-011-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength==

Even when restricted to predicates and proper classes definable in first order set theory, the principle implies existence of Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; correct [[extendible cardinal]]s for every ''n''.

If κ is an [[huge cardinal|almost huge cardinal]], then a strong form of Vopěnka's principle holds in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;:

:There is a  κ-complete [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' such that for every {''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;κ} where each ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a binary relation and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, there is ''S''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''U'' and a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'': ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' in ''S''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9614">In mathematics, '''Watson's lemma''', proved by [[G. N. Watson]] (1918, p. 133), has significant application within the theory on the [[asymptotic behavior]] of [[integral]]s.

== Statement of the lemma ==

Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; T \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt; be fixed.  Assume &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)=t^\lambda\,g(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite number of  derivatives in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;g(0)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; -1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Suppose, in addition, either that 

:&lt;math&gt;|\varphi(t)| &lt; Ke^{bt} \ \forall t&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K,b&lt;/math&gt; are independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, or that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^T |\varphi(t)|\, \mathrm dt &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, it is true that for all positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\int_0^T e^{-x t}\varphi(t)\, \mathrm dt\right| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; 

and that the following [[asymptotic equivalence]] holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^T e^{-x t}\varphi(t)\, \mathrm dt \sim\ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{g^{(n)}(0)\ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n!\ x^{\lambda+n+1}},\ \ (x&gt;0,\ x\rightarrow \infty).&lt;/math&gt;

See, for instance, {{harvtxt|Watson|1918}} for the original proof or {{harvtxt|Miller|2006}} for a more recent development.

== Proof ==

We will prove the version of Watson's lemma which assumes that &lt;math&gt;|\varphi(t)|&lt;/math&gt; has at most exponential growth as &lt;math&gt;t \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  The basic idea behind the proof is that we will approximate &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; by finitely many terms of its Taylor series.  Since the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are only assumed to exist in a neighborhood of the origin, we will essentially proceed by removing the tail of the integral, applying [[Taylor's theorem#Explicit formulae for the remainder|Taylor's theorem with remainder]] in the remaining small interval, then adding the tail back on in the end.  At each step we will carefully estimate how much we are throwing away or adding on.  This proof is a modification of the one found in {{harvtxt|Miller|2006}}.

Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; T \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt; and suppose that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable function of the form &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = t^\lambda g(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; -1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite number of continuous derivatives in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\delta]&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta &lt; T&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;|\varphi(t)| \leq Ke^{bt}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\delta \leq t \leq T&lt;/math&gt;, where the constants &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

We can show that the integral is finite for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; large enough by writing
:&lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \int_0^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt = \int_0^\delta e^{-xt} \varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt + \int_\delta^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
and estimating each term.

For the first term we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\int_0^\delta e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt\right| \leq \int_0^\delta e^{-xt}|\varphi(t)|\,\mathrm dt \leq \int_0^\delta |\varphi(t)|\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the last integral is finite by the assumptions that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\delta]&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; -1&lt;/math&gt;.  For the second term we use the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is exponentially bounded to see that, for &lt;math&gt;x &gt; b&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left|\int_\delta^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt\right| &amp;\leq \int_\delta^T e^{-xt} |\varphi(t)|\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;\leq K \int_\delta^T e^{(b-x)t}\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;\leq K \int_\delta^\infty e^{(b-x)t}\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;= K \, \frac{e^{(b-x)\delta}}{x-b}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The finiteness of the original integral then follows from applying the triangle inequality to &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can deduce from the above calculation that
:&lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \int_0^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt = \int_0^\delta e^{-xt} \varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt + O\left(x^{-1} e^{-\delta x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

By appealing to [[Taylor's theorem#Explicit formulae for the remainder|Taylor's theorem with remainder]] we know that, for each integer &lt;math&gt;N \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;g(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\,t^n + \frac{g^{(N+1)}(t^*)}{(N+1)!}\,t^{N+1}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t \leq \delta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t^* \leq t&lt;/math&gt;.  Plugging this in to the first term in &lt;math&gt;(2)&lt;/math&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(3) \quad \int_0^\delta e^{-xt} \varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \int_0^\delta e^{-xt} t^\lambda g(t)\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0)}{n!} \int_0^\delta t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt + \frac{1}{(N+1)!} \int_0^\delta g^{(N+1)}(t^*)\, t^{\lambda+N+1} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
To bound the term involving the remainder we use the assumption that &lt;math&gt;g^{(N+1)}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\delta]&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular it is bounded there.  As such we see that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left|\int_0^\delta g^{(N+1)}(t^*)\, t^{\lambda+N+1} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt\right| &amp;\leq \sup_{t \in [0,\delta]} \left|g^{(N+1)}(t)\right| \int_0^\delta t^{\lambda+N+1} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;&lt; \sup_{t \in [0,\delta]} \left|g^{(N+1)}(t)\right| \int_0^\infty t^{\lambda+N+1} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;= \sup_{t \in [0,\delta]} \left|g^{(N+1)}(t)\right| \,\frac{\Gamma(\lambda + N + 2)}{x^{\lambda+N+2}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Here we have used the fact that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty t^a e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt = \frac{\Gamma(a+1)}{x^{a+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a &gt; -1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]].

From the above calculation we see from &lt;math&gt;(3)&lt;/math&gt; that
:&lt;math&gt;(4) \quad \int_0^\delta e^{-xt} \varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{g^{(n)}(0)}{n!} \int_0^\delta t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt + O\left(x^{-\lambda-N-2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

We will now add the tails on to each integral in &lt;math&gt;(4)&lt;/math&gt;.  For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^\delta t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \int_0^\infty t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt - \int_\delta^\infty t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt \\[5pt]
&amp;= \frac{\Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{x^{\lambda+n+1}} - \int_\delta^\infty t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and we will show that the remaining integrals are exponentially small.  Indeed, if we make the change of variables &lt;math&gt;t = s + \delta&lt;/math&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_\delta^\infty t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \int_0^\infty (s+\delta)^{\lambda + n} e^{-x(s+\delta)}\,ds \\[5pt]
&amp;= e^{-\delta x} \int_0^\infty (s+\delta)^{\lambda + n} e^{-xs}\,ds \\[5pt]
&amp;\leq e^{-\delta x} \int_0^\infty (s+\delta)^{\lambda + n} e^{-s}\,ds
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;x \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\delta t^{\lambda + n} e^{-xt}\,\mathrm dt = \frac{\Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{x^{\lambda+n+1}} + O\left(e^{-\delta x}\right) \text{ as } x \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute this last result into &lt;math&gt;(4)&lt;/math&gt; we find that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^\delta e^{-xt} \varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0) \ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n! \ x^{\lambda+n+1}} + O\left(e^{-\delta x}\right) + O\left(x^{-\lambda-N-2}\right) \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0) \ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n! \ x^{\lambda+n+1}} + O\left(x^{-\lambda-N-2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, substituting this into &lt;math&gt;(2)&lt;/math&gt; we conclude that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0) \ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n! \ x^{\lambda+n+1}} + O\left(x^{-\lambda-N-2}\right) + O\left(x^{-1} e^{-\delta x}\right) \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{g^{(n)}(0) \ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n! \ x^{\lambda+n+1}} + O\left(x^{-\lambda-N-2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Since this last expression is true for each integer &lt;math&gt;N \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; we have thus shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^T e^{-xt}\varphi(t)\,\mathrm dt \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{g^{(n)}(0) \ \Gamma(\lambda+n+1)}{n! \ x^{\lambda+n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, where the infinite series is interpreted as an [[asymptotic expansion]] of the integral in question.

== Example ==
When &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, the [[confluent hypergeometric function]] of the first kind has the integral representation
:&lt;math&gt;{}_1F_1(a,b,x) = \frac{\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b-a)}\int_0^1 e^{xt} t^{a-1} (1-t)^{b-a-1}\,\mathrm dt,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]].  The change of variables &lt;math&gt;t = 1-s&lt;/math&gt; puts this into the form
:&lt;math&gt;{}_1F_1(a,b,x) = \frac{\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b-a)}\,e^x\int_0^1 e^{-xs} (1-s)^{a-1} s^{b-a-1}\,ds,&lt;/math&gt;
which is now amenable to the use of Watson's lemma.  Taking &lt;math&gt;\lambda = b-a-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(s) = (1-s)^{a-1}&lt;/math&gt;, Watson's lemma tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 e^{-xs} (1-s)^{a-1} s^{b-a-1}\,ds \sim \Gamma(b-a) x^{a-b} \quad \text{as } x \to \infty \text{ with } x &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which allows us to conclude that
:&lt;math&gt; {}_1F_1(a,b,x) \sim \frac{\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a)}\,x^{a-b} e^x \quad \text{as } x \to \infty \text{ with } x &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
