==Notes==
{{note label|tie|a|a}}The medal was originally awarded to Daily on a "casting vote", but it was forgotten that a countback would decide the medal in the event of tie – so both were given the medal after this error was discovered, since Krepp would have won outright had the countback been done first.

'''23rd Street Grounds''', also known as '''State Street Grounds''' and '''23rd Street Park''', and sometimes spelled out as '''Twenty-third Street Grounds''', was a [[ballpark]] in [[Chicago]]. In it, the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] played [[baseball]] from [[1874 in sports|1874]] to [[1877 in sports|1877]], the first two years in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] and the latter two in the [[National League]].

23rd Street first hosted baseball in 1872–1873, rented out by the Chicago White Stockings as the club nursed its financial wounds following the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire]] (for two years following the fire, it did not field a team). Seven games were even relocated to Chicago by professional teams in other major cities. The Cleveland and Troy clubs played two and four home games here, respectively, in [[1872 in sports|1872]], when they were struggling economically (both went out of business). The [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] played one in [[1873 in sports|1873]] when they were flourishing.

The grounds was on a block bounded by 23rd Street, [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], 22nd Street (now [[Cermak Road]]) and what is now Federal Street. No illustration is known to survive, but contemporary newspaper descriptions imply that the diamond was in the north end of the block; a line drawn from [[home plate]] through the [[pitcher's mound]] and [[second base]] would have pointed south. If so, fair territory would probably have been shaped like a modern five-sided "home plate". (Home plate was square in shape at that time.)  It has been discussed in ''Green Cathedrals'', Philip J. Lowry's book on American baseball venues.

The final game played at this park was on Saturday, October 6, 1877. Chicago defeated Louisville 4-0 behind a shutout effort from hurler [[Laurie Reis]]. The final home run at the grounds was hit four days earlier by [[Lip Pike]] of Cincinnati.

'''''Against the Ropes''''' is a 2004 American [[sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Charles S. Dutton]] (in his [[directorial debut]]) and starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Omar Epps]]. The story is a fictionalized account of [[boxing]] manager [[Jackie Kallen]], who was the first woman to become a success in the sport. Kallen has a bit part in the film playing a reporter, and a few lines in the scene where the press interviews the principal characters.

The film was shot primarily at the  [[Wolstein Center]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], Canada at the [[Copps Coliseum]].&lt;ref name=hamfilm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&amp;&amp;locations=Hamilton,+Ontario,+Canada |title=Internet Movie Database - List of Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Against the Ropes'' grossed less than $6 million in the US and was panned by critics for its resemblance to other boxing films.

==Plot==
{{cleanup-PR|section|date=March 2015}}
At a young age, Jackie Kallen learns about boxing with her father and uncle in a small gym. Later, she becomes the assistant to a [[Cleveland]] boxing promoter. Her boss then begins doing business with Sam LaRocca, a sports manager, during a middleweight championship fight.

LaRocca asks afterward what she thought of the fight. Obviously unimpressed with Jackie's knowledge of boxing, LaRocca offers her the loser's contract for a dollar. She goes to visit the fighter at home, only to find him addicted to drugs.

Enter Luther Shaw, a small-time hood. Kallen watches in horror and fascination as Shaw pummels the former [[middleweight]] champ. She offers to manage him professionally. Shaw is at first hesitant, but he eventually signs on with her.

Because of LaRocca's influence, Kallen can't find Shaw a fight anywhere in [[Ohio]], so the two are forced to go on the road until Shaw makes a name for himself. Jackie begins to get swept up in all the attention she gets for being the first female boxing manager. Her attention eventually shifts from Shaw to her own media persona as her fighter's number of wins continues to climb.

Finally realizing that she is not paying enough attention to her only client, Kallen agrees to sell Shaw's contract to LaRocca on the condition that he be given a championship fight. LaRocca agrees, setting Shaw up for a shot at the title before he could be ready. Kallen arrives at the fight and stands in Shaw's corner as he pulls off an upset and wins the championship.

''Against the Ropes'' was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $6,614,280, with an estimated budget of $39,000,000. It opened up at No. 8 at the box office, grossing $3,038,546 in the opening weekend. The film was released on February 20, 2004 to 1,601 theaters (widest release) gathering an average of $1,897 per theater. The film closed its box office run after seven weeks, gathering a total of $5,884,190 from the domestic market and $730,090 from overseas for an international total of $6,614,280.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=againsttheropes.htm Against the Ropes (2004)]. ''[[Box Office Mojo]]''. Retrieved 2010-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception of the film was negative. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a "Rotten" rating of 12% based on 121 reviews and an average rating of 4.2 out of 10, summarizing it as "a bland, dumbed-down package of sports cliches."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/against_the_ropes Against the Ropes Movie Reviews, Pictures]. ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''. Retrieved 2010-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film did receive some positive reviews; [[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3 stars out of 4, remarking:
:"It works near the end of "Against the Ropes," a biopic about Jackie Kallen, who was (and is) the first female fight promoter in the all-male world of professional boxing. It works, and another cliche works, too: the Big Fight scene, right out of "Rocky" and every other boxing movie, in which the hero gets pounded silly but then somehow, after becoming inspired between rounds, comes back and is filled with skill and fury."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040220/REVIEWS/402200304/1023 Against the Ropes :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews].

'''Betting arbitrage''' ("miraclebets", "surebets", sports arbitrage) is an example of [[arbitrage]] arising on betting markets due to either [[bookmaker|bookmakers']] differing opinions on event outcomes or errors. When conditions allow, by placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Mathematically arbitrage occurs when there are a set of odds, which represent all mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all state space possibilities (i.e. all outcomes) of an event, whose implied probabilities add up to less than 1.&lt;ref name=Cortis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cortis |first1=Dominic |title=Expected Values and variance in bookmaker payouts: A Theoretical Approach towards setting limits on odds |url=http://ubplj.org/index.php/jpm/article/view/987/968 |accessdate= |year=2015 |publisher= |volume=9 |series=1 |journal= Journal of Prediction Markets |location= |isbn= |page= |section=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the bettors' slang an arbitrage is often referred to as an '''arb'''; people who use arbitrage are called '''arbers'''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Arbitrage betting involves relatively large sums of money, given that 98% of arbitrage opportunities return less than 1.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keynes|first=Milton|title=Reward without Risk? An Introduction to Arbitrage Betting and the Asian Handicap|url=http://www.topbettingreviews.com/arbitrage-betting-asian-handicap/|publisher=TBR|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is usually detected quickly by bookmakers, who typically hold an unfavorable view of it, and this can result in half of an arbitrage bet being canceled. Arbitrage betting is almost always insufficiently profitable due to detection, unreliable betting websites, limiting of stakes, hackers, and scammers that use high percentage arbitrages to trick bettors into providing security credentials.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Bookmakers generally disapprove of betting arbitrage, and restrict or close the accounts of those who they suspect of engaging in arbitrage betting.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Although arbitrage betting has existed since the beginnings of bookmaking, the rise of the Internet, odds-comparison websites and [[betting exchanges]] have made the practice easier to perform. On the other hand, these changes also made it easier for bookmakers to keep their odds in line with the market, because arbitrage bettors are basically acting as [[market maker]]s.

In Britain, a practice has developed in which highly experienced "key men" employ others to place bets on their behalf, so as to avoid detection and increase accessibility to retail bookmakers and allow the financiers or key arbitragers to stay at a computer to keep track of market movement.

Arbitrage is an extremely fast-paced process and its successful performance requires lots of time, experience, dedication and discipline, and especially [[liquidity]].

== Theory ==

There are a number of potential arbitrage deals. Below is an explanation of some of them including formulas and risks associated with them. The table below introduces a number of variables that will be used to formalise the arbitrage models.

{| border="1"
|-
|Variable || Explanation
|-
| &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;      || Stake in outcome 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;      || Stake in outcome 2
|-
| &lt;math&gt;o_1&lt;/math&gt;      || Odds for outcome 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt;o_2&lt;/math&gt;      || Odds for outcome 2
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;      || Return if outcome 1 occurs
|-
| &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;      || Return if outcome 2 occurs
|}

=== Using bookmakers ===
This type of arbitrage takes advantage of different odds offered by different bookmakers. For an example of an event with only two possible outcomes (e.g. a [[tennis]] match - either Federer wins or Henman wins), the two bookmakers have different ideas of who has the best chances of winning. They offer the following [[Fixed-odds betting|Fixed-odds gambling]] on the outcomes of the event in both fractional and decimal format:

Fractional odds:
{| border="1"
|-
|         ||Bookmaker 1 || Bookmaker2 
|-
| Outcome 1 || 1/4        || 143/100
|-
| Outcome 2 || 39/10        || 57/20
|}

Decimal odds:
{| border="1"
|-
|         ||Bookmaker 1 || Bookmaker2 
|-
| Outcome 1 || 1.25        || 1.43
|-
| Outcome 2 || 3.9        || 2.85
|}

The bookmaker's return rate is &lt;math&gt;1- (1.25*3.9)/(1.25+3.9)= 5.34\%&lt;/math&gt;, which is the amount the bookmaker earns on offering bets at some event. Bookmaker 1 will in this example expect to earn 5.34% on bets on the tennis game. For an individual bookmaker, the sum of the inverse of all outcomes of an event will always be greater than 1.
&lt;math&gt;1.25^{-1} + 3.9^{-1} = 1.056&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1.43^{-1} + 2.85^{-1} = 1.051&lt;/math&gt;

Inverse of decimal odds:
{| border="1"
|-
|         ||Bookmaker 1 || Bookmaker2 
|-
| Outcome 1 || &lt;math&gt;1.25^{-1}=0.8&lt;/math&gt;        || &lt;math&gt;1.43^{-1}=0.699&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Outcome 2 || &lt;math&gt;3.9^{-1}=0.256&lt;/math&gt;        || &lt;math&gt;2.85^{-1}=0.351&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The idea of arbitrage betting is to find odds at different bookmakers, where the sum of the inverse of all the outcomes are below 1, meaning that the bookmakers disagree on the chances of the outcomes. This discrepancy can be used to obtain a profit.

For instance if one places a bet on outcome 1 at bookmaker 2 and outcome 2 at bookmaker 1:

&lt;math&gt;1.43^{-1} + 3.9^{-1} = 0.956&lt;/math&gt;

Placing a bet of $100 on the most likely outcome with the lowest odds (outcome 1 with bookmaker 2) and a bet of $36.67 &lt;math&gt;(\$100\cdot (1.43/3.9))&lt;/math&gt; on outcome 2 at bookmaker 1 would ensure the bettor a profit. When there are more than two possible outcomes the value of the subsequent bets can be calculated with respect to the lowest quoted odds.

In case outcome 1 comes out, one could collect &lt;math&gt;r_1 = \$100 * 1.43 = \$143&lt;/math&gt; from bookmaker 2. In case outcome 2 comes out, one could collect &lt;math&gt;r_2 = \$36.67 \cdot 3.9 = \$143&lt;/math&gt; from bookmaker 1. One would have invested $136.67, but have collected $143, a profit of $6.33 (4.6%) no matter the outcome of the event.

So for 2 odds &lt;math&gt;o_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;o_1^{-1} + o_2^{-1} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. If one wishes to place stake &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; at outcome 1, then one should place &lt;math&gt;s_2 = s_1 \cdot o_1 / o_2&lt;/math&gt; at outcome 2, to even out the odds, and receive the same return no matter the outcome of the event.

Or in other words, if there are two outcomes, a 1/1 and a 2/1, by covering the 1/1 with $500 and the 2/1 with $333, one is guaranteed to win $1000 at a cost of $833, giving a 20% profit. More often profits exists around the 4% mark or less.

Reducing the risk of human error is vital being that the mathematical formula is sound and only external factors add "risk". Numerous online arbitrage calculator tools exist to help bettors get the math right. For example, arbitrage calculators can handle calculations for both book arbitrage ("back/back" or "lay/lay") and "back/lay" arbitrage opportunities on an intra-exchange or inter-exchange basis, and is free.

For arbitrages involving three outcomes (e.g. a game which can be won, lost or drawn) having the odds &lt;math&gt;o_1&lt;/math&gt; for Outcome 1, &lt;math&gt;o_2&lt;/math&gt; for outcome 2 and &lt;math&gt;o_3&lt;/math&gt; for outcome 3 with their respective bids being &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_3&lt;/math&gt; and sum of the bids being B.

The amount required to bet on each possibility in order to ensure profit can be calculated by

&lt;math&gt;b_1 = B / (1 + (o_1/o_2) + (o_1/o_3) )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b_2 = B / (1 + (o_2/o_1) + (o_2/o_3) )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b_3 = B / (1 + (o_3/o_1) + (o_3/o_2) )&lt;/math&gt;

=== Back-lay sports ===
[[Betting exchange]]s such as Smarkets have opened up a new range of arbitrage possibilities since on the exchanges it is possible to ''lay'' (i.e. to bet against) as well as to back an outcome. Arbitrage using only the back or lay side might occur on betting exchanges. It is in principle the same as the arbitrage using different bookmakers. Arbitrage using back and lay side is possible if a lay bet on one exchange provides shorter odds than a back bet on another exchange or bookmaker. However, the commission charged by the bookmakers and exchanges must be included into calculations.

Back-lay sports arbitrage is often called "scalping" or "trading". Scalping is not actually arbitrage, but short term trading. In the context of sports arbitrage betting a scalping trader or scalper looks to make lots of small profits, which in time can add up. In theory a trader could turn a small investment into large profits by re-investing his earlier profits into future bets so as to generate [[exponential growth]]. Scalping relies on liquidity in the markets and that the odds will fluctuate around a mean point. A key advantage to scalping on one exchange is that most exchanges charge commission only on the net winnings in a particular event, thus ensuring that even the smallest favorable difference in the odds will guarantee some profit.

=== Bonus sports ===
Many bookmakers offer first time users a signup bonus in the range $10–200 for depositing an initial amount. They typically demand that this amount is wagered a number of times before the bonus can be withdrawn. Bonus sport arbitraging, also known as [[matched betting]], is a form of sports arbitraging where the bettor hedges or backs their bets as usual, but since they received the bonus, a small loss can be allowed on each wager (2–5%), which comes off their profit. In this way the bookmakers wagering demand can be met and the initial deposit and sign up bonus can be withdrawn with little loss.

The advantage over usual betting arbitrage is that it is a lot easier to find bets with an acceptable loss, instead of an actual profit. Since most bookmakers offer these bonuses this can potentially be exploited to harvest the sign up bonuses.

By signing up to various bookmakers, it is possible to turn these "free" bets into cash fairly quickly, and either making a small arbitrage, or in the majority of cases, making a small loss on each bet, or trade.  However, it is relatively time consuming to find close matched bets or arbitrages, which is where a middleman service is useful. As many bookmakers require a certain turnover of the bonus amount, matching money from different bookmakers against each other enables the player to in effect quickly "play free" the money of the losing bookmaker and in effect transfer it to the winning bookmaker. By avoiding most of the turnover requirements in this way the player can usually expect a 70-80% return on investment.

As well as spending time physically matching odds from various bet sites to exchanges, the other draw back with bonus bagging and arbitrage trading in this sense is that often the free bets are "non-stake returned".  This effectively reduces the odds, in decimal format, by 1.  Therefore, in order to reduce "losses" on the free bet, it is necessary to place a bet with high odds, so that the percentage difference of the decrease in odds is minimised.

=== Shop arbitrage (sharbing) ===

Shop arbitrage (also known as sharbing or shop-arbing) is the process of using a [[betting shop]]'s coupons and a betting exchange to create an arbitrage position. This is made possible because online prices change quickly to close these positions and betting shops are slower to change the prices on their printed coupons.

== Risks ==
{{prose|section|date=March 2016}}
While often claimed to be "risk-free", this is only true if an arbitrage is successfully completed; in reality, there are several threats to this:

*'''Disappearance of arbitrage:''' Arbitrages in online sports markets have a median lifetime of around 15 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;"How quickly is temporary market inefficiency removed?" Ben R. Marshall  ''The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance'' '''49''' (2009) 917–930&lt;/ref&gt; after which the difference in odds underpinning them vanishes through betting activity. Without rapid alerting and action, it is possible to fail to make all the "legs" of the arbitrage before it vanishes, thus transforming it from a risk-free arbitrage into a conventional bet with the usual risks involved.  High street bookmakers however, offer their odds days in advance and rarely change them once they have been set.  These arbitrages can have a lifetime of several hours.
*'''Hackers:''' Due to the large number of accounts that have to be created and managed (containing personal details such as email, name, address, ewallet, credit card information and often even a copy of the bettor's ID/passport or driver's license), arbitrage traders are highly susceptible to cyber fraud, such as bank account theft. While making deposits is usually made easy and quick, making withdrawals often requires proof of identity in the form of passport/driver license, copies of which need to be shared with the bookmakers via fax/email or even postal mail, which causes additional identity theft risks.  Traders are often attracted to high odds comparison sites that yield high percentage profits per stake (5-30%); this is often used by hackers to lure a high number of arbitrage bettors that then place large sums of money on these arb's, only to lose all of the profit and even entire savings in bank accounts to hackers or untrustworthy websites, which may further use the gathered data to sell personal data to criminals.
*'''Making errors as an arber:''' In the excitement of the action and due to the high number of bets placed, it is not uncommon to make a mistake (like traders on financial markets). For example, the appropriate stakes may be incorrectly calculated, or be placed on the wrong "legs" of the arb, locking in a loss, or there may be inadequate funds in one of the accounts to complete the arb. Those errors might temporarily have an important impact. In the long term, the benefit will depend on the odds.  For example, one could actually make more money by placing the "wrong" bet where the outcome happens to be beneficial, though not justified by the arbitrage calculation.  However, repetition of this stroke of luck is unlikely, assuming the bookmaker has calculated the odds so they make a profit. Websites and bet placement interfaces differ between bookmakers, so that arbitrage bettors need to be familiar with different web interfaces. In some sports different bookmakers deal with outcomes in different ways (they differ in their handling of - for example - player withdrawal due to injury in tennis, overtime in [[ice hockey]]), meaning that both "legs" can lose. Matching terms for all bookmakers is time consuming, requires lots of expertise and experience, while still being fairly error-prone.
*'''Detection:''' There are very few bookmakers who openly tolerate arbing. Many bookmakers may now be using shared security servers in order to pinpoint people suspected of arbitrage betting; they can simply limit stakes to make arbing unprofitable and even close accounts without honoring a bet that was placed. Loss of deposited money into a bookmaker could occur. This usually leads to unprofitable arbing as the most successful bookmakers are so adept at identifying arbitrage bettors. To avoid detection, people sometimes use special arbing VPN and VPS services.
*'''Stake reviewal:''' Some bookmakers are known to accept only very small stakes by default, while requiring larger stakes to be manually reviewed before being accepted, which basically makes it difficult for an arbitrage better to determine if a leg was completely accepted or not, until it may be too late.
*'''Bet cancellation:''' If a bettor places bets so as to make an arbitrage and one bookmaker cancels a bet, the bettor could find himself in a bad position because he is actually betting with all the risks implied. The bettor can repeat the bet that has been cancelled so as minimize the risk, but if he cannot get the same odds he had before he may be forced to take a loss. In some cases the situation arises when there are very high potential payouts by the [[bookmaker]], perhaps due to an unintentional error made while quoting odds. Many jurisdictions allow bookmakers to cancel bets in the event of such a "palpable" ["obvious"] error in the quoted odds. This is often loosely defined as an obvious mistake, but whether a "palp" in fact has been made is often the sole discretion of the bookmaker.

Other potential problems include:
* Arbers' dedicated email addresses are subject to advertising campaigns from third parties which suggests that client data may be resold behind the scenes.
* Bookmakers who encourage responsible gambling will close accounts where they see only large losses, unaware that the arbitrage trader has made wins at other books.
* Capital diffusion is serious; many bookmakers make it very easy to deposit funds and difficult to withdraw them (requiring lots of additional information, and documents as proof of identity, i.e. a passport/ID copy). Making a return involves many bets spread over typically many bookmakers and keeping track requires good record-keeping and discipline.
* Responding to an available arb may require transfer of funds from one bookmaker to another, through one or more ewallet accounts with each withdrawal requiring special approval.
* While there are commercial software products and web services available to help with some of these tasks, they are complicated and may involve significant initial investments and monthly subscription fees.
* Arbitrage bettors using software tools or web services to find arbitrages will often make an existing arbitrage even more prominent and obvious to the bookmaker because of the number of arbitrage bettors placing bets on the same outcome, so that the lifetime of an arbitrage found via such tools is often even much shorter than the average 15 minutes. Thus, the risk of seeing bets revoked is also often much higher for arbitrages found via such tools than for arbitrages found manually, that are not shared with other arbitrage bettors.
* Arbing often involves making use of bookmaker bonuses which usually require substantial transactions before being eligible for withdrawal, thus reducing total liquidity.
* Foreign currency movements can wipe out small percentage gains and can make quick calculation of stakes difficult.
* Transferring funds between bookmakers and ewallets may create additional costs at some point; most bookmakers and/or ewallets limit deposits to certain amounts per month.
* Withdrawals are often limited to a certain amount per month or to a certain number of free withdrawals per month
* Withdrawals are often charged for, not just on the side of the bookmaker, but sometimes also on the ewallet side (transfer to the bettor's bank account).
* In some countries, additional costs are imposed by government taxes, so that the final profit is further reduced by a fixed percentage of say 5% (Germany/Europe).
* Professional arbitrage betting may eat up considerable time and energy and requires lots of experience and liquidity, as well as sufficient funds to recover from inevitable losses that will happen sooner or later due to the aforementioned reasons.
* Typically, arbitrages have a profit margin of only 2-5% - many other arbitrages are regarded as "high risk" ("palps"). Accordingly, profits accumulated through 20-40 successful arbitrages can be lost on a single failed bet.
* Won arbitrages realized via betting exchanges are typically subject to a commission fee of about 4-5%. However, frequent punters may be subject to a discount of up to 60%, i.e. a minimum commission rate of 3%).
* Smaller betting exchanges may not be able to deal with consistently winning punters.

'''Ashford University Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Clinton, Iowa]].  It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and is operated by and is the home field of the [[Clinton LumberKings]] [[minor league]] baseball team of the [[Midwest League]].  It was built in 1937 and its capacity is roughly 5,500 fans.

==History==
The construction of Riverview Stadium began in 1935 and completed in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration project, and it beckoned baseball's return after a 19-year hiatus in the city. The [[Clinton Owls]], a [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] affiliate in the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League|Three-I League]], christened the stadium with a first-place finish that season. The stadium was renamed Alliant Energy Field in 2002 and has undergone several renovation projects in recent years: replacement of entire field lighting system, new home clubhouse, installation of new drainage tiles, expansion of both dugouts and the renovation of covered batting cages. In 2006, the stadium underwent a $4.2 million renovation. On October 1, 2011 the stadium was renamed Ashford University Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20060208&amp;content_id=41029308&amp;sid=t500&amp;vkey=team1|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alliant Energy Field Renamed|url=http://www.clintonherald.com/local/x1078453332/Alliant-Energy-Field-renamed|newspaper=[[Clinton Herald]]|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the ballpark played host to the Midwest League All-Star Game as the East All-Stars defeated the West All-Stars 6–3 in front of 2,561 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=L’Kings Consider Season a Success|first=Scott|last=McNeish|url=http://www.clintonherald.com/highschoolsports/x1081139346/L-Kings-consider-season-a-success/print|newspaper=[[Clinton Herald]]|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, in addition to playing host to the franchise record setting LumberKings (86-54), the field was transformed overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to become a football field.  The LumberKings played host to [[Camanche High School]] Football in the inaugural "LumberBowl."  Camanche hosted [[Williamsburg High School (Iowa)|Williamsburg High School]] in the game on September 16, 2016.  The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated the Indians 55-7.

==Features==
Features to the stadium include the Leinenkugel's Lumber Lounge party deck located in right field, the Coors Light Picnic Pavilion and berm in left field, the Dr. Pepper Picnic Garden party area along the left field foul line and bullpen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Group Party Information|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20130220&amp;content_id=41834800&amp;sid=t500&amp;vkey=tickets|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal had seen a number of controversial incidents in the previous seasons. The rivalry between the two clubs had grown more intense since the formation of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, since when all but one Premier League title had been won by Manchester United or Arsenal ([[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] won the title in [[1994–95 FA Premier League|1994–95]]). However, the rivalry could be traced back to [[Alex Ferguson]]'s first fixture against Arsenal as United manager in 1987, when [[David Rocastle]] was sent off and a row erupted.&lt;ref name="rivalry"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |title=Bad blood is simmering again as United and Arsenal prepare to lock horns |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/26/arsenal-manchester-united-champions-league |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, [[Brian McClair]] missed a penalty for United in an [[1987–88 FA Cup|FA Cup]] tie and [[Nigel Winterburn]] made a point of aggravating him. McClair got his revenge in 1990: after a lunging tackle from Winterburn on [[Denis Irwin]], McClair and Irwin both kicked Winterburn while he lay on the floor, sparking a [[Manchester United F.C.–Arsenal F.C. brawl (1990)|21-man brawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1083793/Tension-arguments-battles-pizza-Past-clashes-Manchester-United-v-Arsenal.html |title=Tensions, arguments, battles and pizza |work=Mail Online |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=4 June 2009| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20090422085838/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1083793/Tension-arguments-battles-pizza-Past-clashes-Manchester-United-v-Arsenal.html| archivedate= 22 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams were fined and deducted points and it has often been suggested that this was a turning point in relations.&lt;ref name="rivalry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Ornstein |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8017049.stm |title=Arsenal 'must triumph in Europe' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504200438/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8017049.stm| archivedate= 4 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry continued to intensify as "hard men" such as [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Roy Keane]] and [[Martin Keown]] joined the sides.

The previous league match between the two clubs in April 2003 at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] was a competitive and bad-tempered affair. In a match that finished in a 2–2 draw, [[Sol Campbell]] received a straight red card for violent conduct after elbowing [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=McCarra |title=United on pole as Campbell sees red |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/17/match.arsenal |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=17 April 2003 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Highbury title deadlock |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2935603.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United went on to claim the title from Arsenal by five points after clawing back from being eight points down at the start of March 2003.

The clubs had also been paired together in the fourth round of the [[2002–03 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in February 2003. [[Paul Scholes]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] of Manchester United, and Patrick Vieira of Arsenal were all shown yellow cards within the first seven minutes of the match and referee [[Jeff Winter]] had to call Vieira and Roy Keane together to calm their teammates down. Keane himself received a yellow card in the first half and [[Ryan Giggs]] missed an open goal from 18&amp;nbsp;yards. Arsenal eventually won the match 2–0 and the result infuriated Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] to such an extent that he kicked a boot across the changing room that hit [[David Beckham]] above the left eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal cruise past Manchester United |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2740035.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2003 |accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, both teams met in another heated match at the [[Millennium Stadium]] a month earlier for the [[2003 FA Community Shield|2003 Community Shield]]. [[Phil Neville]] was booked in the first minute for a challenge on Patrick Vieira, and a minute later [[Ashley Cole]] received a booking for fouling Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Yellow cards were also given to [[Quinton Fortune]] and [[Paul Scholes]] for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute [[Francis Jeffers]] was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Campbell charge deepens the rift |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/aug/20/newsstory.sport |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 August 2003 |accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant [[Jens Lehmann]] but it was his opposite number and fellow debutant [[Tim Howard]] who was the hero, saving penalties from [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Robert Pires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd win Community Shield |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3125653.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2003 |accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal entered the match in second place in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|Premier League]] after five matches,&lt;ref name="pregame_table"&gt;{{cite web |title=English Premier League 2003–2004 : Table on 20.09.2003 |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2003-2004/table/2003-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210125/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2003-2004/table/2003-09-20 |publisher=Statto Organisation |archivedate=3 March 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding an unbeaten record that stretched back to the end of the [[2002–03 FA Premier League|previous season]]. Manchester United were a point behind Arsenal in third place, but they had already lost one match that season,&lt;ref name="pregame_table"/&gt; against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] three weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beattie sinks Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3172831.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match==
===Summary===
Arsenal were missing defender [[Sol Campbell]] from their team after the death of his father, and manager [[Arsène Wenger]] dropped wingers [[Robert Pires]] and [[Sylvain Wiltord]] in favour of [[Ray Parlour]] and [[Fredrik Ljungberg]], creating a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deadlock at Old Trafford |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3084372.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 September 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; United themselves were without [[Paul Scholes]] due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with [[Phil Neville]], [[Roy Keane]] and [[Quinton Fortune]] completing a defensively minded midfield.&lt;ref name="stephenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stephenson |first=Rebecca |editor1-first=Sarah |editor1-last=Shaddick |date=October 2003|title=Title fight lives up to its billing! |journal=United |issue=134 |page=89 |publisher=Future Publishing |location=Manchester }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] was fouled on the right wing 40&amp;nbsp;yards from goal in the 13th minute, [[Ryan Giggs]] was presented with the first chance of the match; although intended as a cross, Giggs' free-kick hit the outside of the post.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt; Another foul on Ronaldo gave Giggs another chance to apply pressure with a crossed free-kick shortly after, but [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] was only able to loop the ball over the goal with his head with goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] beaten.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt; Arsenal's attacking play lacked their usual ambition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manchester United Official Members' Yearbook 2003/04 |year=2004 |publisher=Carlton Books |location=London |isbn=0-233-00105-0 |pages=26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their best opportunity coming in the 75th minute, when a deft touch from [[Dennis Bergkamp]] almost played [[Patrick Vieira]] into the penalty area.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt;

The match was characterised by a large number of fouls – 13 by United, 18 by Arsenal – and referee [[Steve Bennett (referee)|Steve Bennett]] showed four yellow cards to each team, although most of those came as a result of the fracas at the end of the game.&lt;ref name="stephenson"/&gt; Vieira was booked in the 77th minute for a foul on [[Quinton Fortune]], and was shown a second yellow card not long after, in the 80th minute.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt; In challenging for a high ball outside the Arsenal penalty area, Van Nistelrooy jumped up onto Vieira's back. Vieira fell to the ground and kicked out at Van Nistelrooy in retaliation, causing the Manchester United striker to jump backwards. Van Nistelrooy was booked for the original foul, and although Vieira's kick failed to connect with the Dutchman, the referee believed that the intent was there and booked Vieira for the second time, resulting in his dismissal.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt;

Despite Arsenal being reduced to 10 men, the scores remained level as the game went into its final minute, when [[Diego Forlán]] went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender [[Martin Keown]] while trying to reach a [[Gary Neville]] cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt; Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United.&lt;ref name="stephenson"/&gt; Lehmann tried to put him off by moving from side to side along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.&lt;ref name="bbc_report"/&gt;

At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by Arsenal players [[Martin Keown]], [[Lauren Etame Mayer|Lauren]], [[Ray Parlour]], [[Ashley Cole]] and [[Kolo Touré]]. Keown jumped up next to Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms down hard on the Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy in the back and Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain [[Roy Keane]], but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Mikaël Silvestre]], [[Quinton Fortune]] and [[Rio Ferdinand]] also became involved in the situation.&lt;ref name="eleventh_heaven"&gt;{{cite video |date=2004 |title=Eleventh Heaven |medium=DVD |publisher=Video Collection International |time=00:16:53–00:21:40 |asin=B0001NIXJQ |asin-tld=co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the post-match interviews, Van Nistelrooy was accused by both Vieira and Arsenal's manager, [[Arsène Wenger]], of feigning contact to get Vieira sent off, while United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] defended his player and denied he had dived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Nistelrooy accused |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3127572.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these reactions, six Arsenal players, two Manchester United players and Arsenal Football Club itself were charged with improper conduct by [[The Football Association]].&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eight charged after bust-up |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3128290.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a club, Arsenal were charged with "failing to ensure the proper behaviour of their players", while their players' charges ranged from one charge of improper conduct for Ashley Cole's "involvement in a confrontation with Cristiano Ronaldo after the final whistle" to Lauren's two counts of violent behaviour for "kicking out at Quinton Fortune following the penalty award and for forcibly pushing Ruud van Nistelrooy in the back following the final whistle", and two counts of improper conduct for "confronting Van Nistelrooy after Patrick Vieira's sending-off, and for confronting Ryan Giggs after the final whistle".&lt;ref name="charges"/&gt; Manchester United as a club were not charged, but Ryan Giggs was charged with improper conduct for "his involvement in a confrontation with Lauren after the match had ended" and Cristiano Ronaldo was charged with improper conduct for "confronting Martin Keown at the conclusion of the match". [[Phil Neville]] was also warned about his future behaviour.&lt;ref name="charges"/&gt;

Arsenal and their players pleaded guilty to the charges against them, but still received a £175,000 fine, the largest ever given to a club by the FA.&lt;ref name="punishment"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nigel |last=Adderley |title=Q&amp;A: Arsenal's punishment |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3229229.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2003 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren, Martin Keown, [[Patrick Vieira]] and Ray Parlour were all suspended for between one and four matches:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Roach |title=Old Trafford row: your verdict |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3154474.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2003 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren received a four-game ban – half of the potential ban he could have received – and a £40,000 fine; Keown was suspended for three matches and had to pay a £20,000 fine; Vieira and Parlour were given one-game bans and had to pay £20,000 and £10,000 respectively.&lt;ref name="punishment"/&gt; [[Jens Lehmann]] was originally charged but this was later dropped.&lt;ref name="punishment"/&gt; [[Ashley Cole]] was not suspended but was given a £10,000 fine.&lt;ref name="punishment"/&gt; Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo both pleaded not guilty to their involvement in the incident, but after a five-hour hearing in December 2003, Giggs was handed a £7,500 fine and Ronaldo a £4,000 fine and both were warned about their future conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Rowbottom |title=Giggs and Ronaldo escape bans for fracas |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/giggs-and-ronaldo-escape-bans-for-fracas-575326.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=2 December 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal finished the league season without a single defeat and earned the tag of ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'', a tag once given to the [[1888–89 Football League|1888–89]] [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] team, the only previous team to go through a league season undefeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Barclay |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2378953/Arsenal-join-the-Invincibles.html |title=Arsenal join the Invincibles |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=15 May 2004 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Collins |title=Arsenal hailed as the 'New Invincibles' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-302958/Arsenal-hailed-New-Invincibles.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=16 May 2004 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Arsenal The Invincibles |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3713537.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2004 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The return fixture between the two sides at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal 1–1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3553027.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] but defeated [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[2004 FA Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd win FA Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3725063.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 May 2004 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal 0–1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3571955.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 April 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 2–0 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3727552.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2004 |accessdate=4 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the two clubs were involved in another incident at [[Old Trafford]], variously dubbed the ''Battle of Old Trafford II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FA set to dismiss Fergie's dossier |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-324229/FA-set-dismiss-Fergies-dossier.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Battle of the Buffet]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Oliver |last=Kay |title=After 'Battle of the Buffet', rivals ready for second helpings |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/after-battle-of-the-buffet-rivals-ready-for-second-helpings-xr67qd3bbhq |newspaper=The Times |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the ''Battle of Old Trafford''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man United Win Battle Of Old Trafford |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806413240107 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714012449/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806413240107 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2012 |work=[[Sky News]] |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting|BskyB]] |date=24 October 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bodø Spektrum''' is an indoor sports complex in [[Bodø]], [[Norway]]. In 1990, construction of Nordlandshallen started, which would allow Glimt a winter training ground,&lt;ref&gt;Arntzen (1994): 60&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 21 September 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Arntzen (1994): 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest hall is '''Nordlandshallen''', an [[association football]] hall with [[artificial turf]] and seating for 5,500 used by [[Bodø/Glimt]] and [[Grand Bodø]]. '''Bodøhallen''' opened in 2007 and is used for [[team handball|handball]] by [[Bodø HK]]. It also consists of '''Nordlandsbadet''', a water park.

Nordlandshallen was used as Bodø/Glimts main venue during the last season matches in the [[Norwegian Premier League]] in 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Full vinter i idretts-Norge |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |last=Johannessen |first=Bjørn Arne |last2=Sandmoe |first2=Thorleif |date=16 October 1993 |page=42 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Glimt mot Skeid inne |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=17 October 1997 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cricket field parts.svg|thumb|A limited number of fielders are allowed in outfield during powerplay.]]
In the sport of [[cricket]], different '''fielding restrictions''' are imposed depending on the type of match. They are used to discourage certain bowling tactics, or to encourage the batsmen to play big shots, enabling them to hit fours and sixes. Each team has nine fielders other than the wicket-keeper and bowler. The captain decides the fielding positions usually after consulting with the bowler. In [[Test cricket]] matches, the fielding restrictions are relaxed as compared to a [[One Day International]].

==All forms==
In all forms of cricket, only two fielders are allowed in the quadrant between the fielding positions of ''square leg'' and ''long stop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-28-the-fielder/ |title=Law 28 – The fielder |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to prevent the outlawed and controversial [[bodyline]] tactics from being used. No fielder is allowed on or over the pitch until the batsman has had a chance to play the ball.

==One day cricket==
Various rules concerning have applied during the history of [[one day cricket]], with the dual aim of encouraging the batsman to play attacking shots and to prevent the fielding team from being too defensive by posting all their fielders on the boundary. The current rules applying to One Day Internationals were first introduced as trial rules in July 2001, and are also used for some other limited overs tournaments.

===Men's Fielding Restriction Circles===

An oval shall made by drawing two semi-circles on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the middle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be {{convert|30|yd|m}}.  The semi-circles shall be linked by lines which are drawn parallel to the pitch. This line, is commonly known as the circle. Further, two circles centered on each wicket of {{convert|15|yd|m}} radius are drawn and combined encompasses an area known as the ''close infield.'' During the first 10 overs of a 50-over innings a maximum of two fielders are allowed to be deployed in the outfield. Before July 2015, a minimum of two fielders (other than the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] and [[wicket-keeper]]) had to be deployed in the close infield during Powerplay 1&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/icc-changes-powerplay-fielding-free-hit-rules-in-odis/articleshow/47839734.cms ICC changes rules again]&lt;/ref&gt;
. If the number of overs in the innings is restricted to less than 24, the length of the fielding restrictions is reduced to eight or nine overs. At least 3 fielders must remain on either the Off or Leg Side.

T10 cricket has the same restrictions as T20 but for half the time. Only two men outside the circle for the first six overs.

===Women's Fielding Restriction Circles===

In the Women's game the infield and close infield circles are smaller than in the Men's game. With the semicircles of the infield having a radius of {{convert|23|m|yd}} and the close infield circles having a radius of {{convert|12|m|yd}}

The restriction of having a maximum of three fielders in the outfield is applied for a further two blocks of five overs, with the captains of the fielding and the batting sides deciding the timing of one block each. These five-over spells are called [[Powerplay (cricket)|Powerplay]] 2 and Powerplay 3 and may be shortened if the length of the innings is restricted (Powerplay 1 is the first block of 10). Powerplays were first encountered in the [[One Day International]] between [[England]] and [[Australia]] on 7 July 2005.

For the rest of the innings, a more generous maximum of five fielders in the outfield applies.

===History===
Fielding restrictions were first introduced in the Australian 1980-81 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crictrivia.com/onedaycricket.html|title= One-Day Cricket|publisher= CricTrivia.com|date= December 2005|accessdate= 16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, only two fieldsmen were allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fieldsmen allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs.&lt;ref name=1992newrules&gt;{{cite web|title=Colourful cricket, and that rain rule|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/story/475370.html|publisher=ESPN Cric Info|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was shortened to ten overs in 2005, and two five-over powerplays were introduced, with the bowling team having discretion over the timing for both. In 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. In 2011, the teams were restricted to completing the discretionary powerplays between the 16th and 40th overs; previously, the powerplays could take place at any time between the 11th and 50th overs.

On October 30, 2012, changes to the rules for fielding restrictions in one-day matches were officially implemented by the ICC. The number of Powerplay blocks were reduced to two; the first occurs within the first 10 overs, restricting the team to two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. The second block, the Batting Powerplay with a restriction of three fielders outside the circle, must occur by the 40th over.&lt;ref name=cricinfo-amendments&gt;{{cite web|title=Amended playing conditions to take effect|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/588728.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle in non-Powerplay overs has also been reduced to four (from five).&lt;ref name=cricinfo-amendments/&gt;

In June 2015 rules changed to do away with batting poweplay, and allowed up to 5 fielders outside the circle in last 10 overs. The 2015 rule changes also included the removal of batting power play. &lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/icc-changes-powerplay-fielding-free-hit-rules-in-odis/articleshow/47839734.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twenty20==
The number of players in the outfield area is the same as for the One-day format, but the restriction lasts for the first six of the twenty overs, and there is no "Batting" or "Bowling" (Powerplays 2 and 3 in ODI's) Powerplay.
Whereas in Twenty20 format a team can have maximum of five fielders outside {{convert|30|yd|m}} ({{convert|25|yd|m}} for women) after first six overs of twenty overs.

[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division, including a "GB" column]]
In most North American sports, the phrase '''games behind''' or '''games back''' (often abbreviated '''GB'''), is a common way to reflect the gap between a leading team and another team in a sports league, conference, or division.

==Example==
In the below standings from the [[1994 Major League Baseball season]], the [[Atlanta Braves]] are six ''games behind'' the [[Montreal Expos]]. Atlanta would have to win six games, and Montreal would have to lose six games, to tie for first. The leading team is always zero games behind itself, and this is typically indicated in standings by a dash rather than a zero.
&lt;center&gt;{{1994 NL East standings}}&lt;/center&gt;
==Computing games behind==
Games behind is calculated by using either of the following formulas, in which Team A is a leading team, and Team B is a trailing team. Example math in this section uses the above standings, with Montreal as Team A and Atlanta as Team B.


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{Team A's wins – Team A's losses}) - (\text{Team B's wins – Team B's losses})}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{74 – 40}) - (\text{68 – 46})}{2} = \frac{\text{34 – 22}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6&lt;/math&gt;


Alternately:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{Team A's wins – Team B's wins}) + (\text{Team B's losses – Team A's losses})}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\text{Games Behind} = \frac{(\text{74 – 68}) + (\text{46 – 40})}{2} = \frac{\text{6 + 6}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6&lt;/math&gt;


Notes:
* It can alternately be said that Montreal is six ''games ahead'' of Atlanta.
* A games behind situation can change rapidly when two teams contesting for the lead play each other. For example, Atlanta could cut Montreal's lead in half (to three games) by sweeping a three-game head-to-head series.
* The leading team, in terms of games behind, is the team with the best won–loss ''difference''. This is not always the team with the most wins. For example, a team with a 80–70 record (10 more wins than losses) would be one game behind a team with a 79–67 record (12 more wins than losses).

==Anomalies==
The formulas implicitly treat any difference in the number of games played by the two teams as each unplayed game being "worth" 0.5 wins and 0.5 losses. This can lead to anomalies when teams have played an unequal number of games, especially during the early portion of a season.

* Two teams with different [[winning percentage]]s may be tied in terms of games behind. For example Team A at 6–4 would be tied with Team B at 4–2, in terms of games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.

* A team with a lower winning percentage may lead (in terms of games behind) a team with a higher winning percentage. For example, Team A at 6–4 would lead Team B at 2–1, by a half-game when calculating games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.

::An example of this occurred in May 2018, when the [[New York Yankees]] were 28–13 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] were 30–14. The ''games behind'' calculation had New York a half-game behind Boston; however, New York had the better winning percentage, at .683 compared to .682 for Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2018&amp;month=05&amp;day=17 |title=MLB Scores and Standings |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leagues generally use winning percentage to order teams, so in both of the above examples, Team B would be considered to be in first place.

==Usage==
[[File:NBA_Standings_29Nov1965.png|thumb|right|NBA standings in November 1965 as published in ''[[Star Tribune|The Minneapolis Star]]'']]
The games behind calculation is often used in professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]], where tie games are not permitted. [[Standings]] for these sports appearing in print or online during a season will have teams ordered by winning percentages, with a "GB" column provided as a convenience to the reader. Games behind is used less often in [[American football]], where ties are possible but relatively uncommon. Games behind is rarely used in [[ice hockey]] and [[Association football|soccer]], where ties are common and standings points are typically used.

===Major League Baseball===
[[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) defines games behind as "the average of the differences between the leading team wins and the trailing team wins, and the leading teams losses and the trailing team losses."&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/?tcid=mm_mlb_standings&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} A games behind column almost always appears in MLB standings for each five-team division.

====Wild card race====
In the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 MLB season]], the [[American League]] and [[National League]] each split into three divisions, and each added a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team to the playoffs. Following this change, it became common for the media to publish an additional set of standings for the wild card race. It included all teams from a league, with the exception of the division leaders, and games behind was calculated with respect to the team with the highest standing in the wild card race.

In the [[2012 Major League Baseball season|2012 MLB season]], both leagues add a second wild card team. Now, games behind in the wild card race is calculated with respect to the team with ''second highest'' standing in the wild card race. MLB's website distinguishes this statistic as ''wild card games behind'', abbreviated WCGB. Assuming that teams are not tied for first place in the wild card race, this results in the team leading the wild card race being shown as some number of "games ahead" of the second place team, indicated by a plus sign ("+") in the standings. 

===National Basketball Association===
[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) standings typically report games behind within each five-team division. However, it is not as closely followed as in baseball, because more teams qualify for the NBA playoffs, and the divisional statistics are not as important for playoff qualification. Sometimes, especially nearing the end of the regular season, games behind will be given with respect to the eighth position in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], as the eighth position is the last to qualify for the playoffs in each conference.

===National Football League===
[[File:NFL_Standings_23Oct1972.png|thumb|right|NFL standings in October 1972 as published in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'']]
[[National Football League]] (NFL) standings sometimes report games behind, although the statistic is not emphasized; winning percentage is used, computed from each team's win–loss–tie record. This is especially true since the introduction of the bye week in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], exacerbating differences in the number of games that teams have played at various points in time. Games behind is omitted from standings on the NFL's website and is absent from most published standings.

===Other sports===
The games behind statistic is eschewed in sports where tie games are traditionally common, such as the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). Leagues in these sports typically rank teams by awarding a certain number of points for each win or tie. The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also does not use games behind, and awards standings points.

===Related usage===
Teams are sometimes referred to as being over or under "five hundred", in comparison to a [[Winning percentage#500|.500]] winning percentage. The calculation for this is simple subtraction (there is no division by two).  For example, a team at 55–50 is "five games over five hundred", while a team at 40–50 would be "ten games under five hundred". 'Above' and 'below' can be substituted for 'over' and 'under', respectively.

'''Handicaps''' (or "'''odds'''") in [[chess]] are [[chess variant|variant]] ways to enable a weaker player to have a chance of winning against a stronger one. There are a variety of such handicaps, such as [[List of chess terms#Material|material]] odds (the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces), extra moves (the weaker player  has an agreed number of moves at the beginning of the game), extra time on the [[Game clock|chess clock]], and special conditions (such as requiring the odds-giver to deliver [[checkmate]] with a specified piece or pawn). Various permutations of these, such as "pawn and two moves", are also possible.
 
Handicaps were quite popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, when chess was often played for money stakes, in order to induce weaker players to play for wagers. Today handicaps are rarely seen in serious competition outside of [[human–computer chess matches]]. As [[chess engine|chess engines]] have been routinely superior to even [[chess master]]s since the early 21st century, human players need considerable odds to have practical chances in such matches.{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

== History ==

According to [[Harry Golombek]], "Odds-giving reached its heyday in the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century."&lt;ref name="GolombekEncyclopediap.218"&gt;Harry Golombek, ''Golombek’s Encyclopedia of Chess'', Crown Publishers, 1977, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was so prevalent in the 18th century that [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] (1726–1795) played the vast majority of his games at odds.&lt;ref name="GolombekEncyclopediap.218"/&gt; About fifteen percent of the known games of [[Paul Morphy]] (1837–1884) are games in which he gave odds.&lt;ref&gt;Macon Shibut, ''Paul Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory'', Dover Publications, 2004, p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-486-43574-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Staunton]] in ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'' (1847) advised inexperienced players to accept odds offered by superior players and, upon improving to the point that they can themselves give odds to some players, to avoid playing such players on even terms, warning that doing so is apt to induce "an indolent, neglectful habit of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7BAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Chess-player's Handbook |page=46|author=Howard Staunton|publisher=Bohn  |year= 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, Staunton published ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', a 510-page work "chiefly directed to the exposition of openings where one party gives odds".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Just over 300 pages were devoted to odds games: Book I (pages 1 to 185) contained games played at various odds, and most of Book V (pages 380–496) discussed various types of odds, including exotic and unusual ones.&lt;ref&gt;Books II and III were devoted to games not at odds, classified by [[chess opening|opening]], Book IV analyzed the games of Staunton's 1843 match against [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint Amant]]. The last chapter of Book V was devoted to [[chess problem]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; The late-19th century [[chess opening]] [[treatise]] ''Chess Openings Ancient and Modern'', by [[Edward Freeborough]] and [[Charles Ranken]], included fourteen pages of analysis of best play in games played at odds of pawn and move, pawn and two moves, and either knight.&lt;ref&gt;E. Freeborough and Rev. C.E. Ranken, ''Chess Openings Ancient and Modern'', Third Edition, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Co., London, 1896, pp. 271–84. The authors, after discussing general principles applicable to odds games, devoted pages 274–76 to analyzing games played at pawn and move, pages 277–79 to pawn and two moves games, pages 281–82 to games played at queen knight odds, and page 283 to the unusual odds of king knight.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macon Shibut writes that in the mid-19th century "chess was a gambling game ... . Individual matches for stakes were the focus of organized play. Matches between leading players attracted a wide following so masters often succeeded in finding sponsors to back their personal wagers."&lt;ref name="Shibutp.122"&gt;Macon Shibut, ''Paul Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory'', Dover Publications, 2004, p. 122. {{ISBN|978-0-486-43574-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the available sums were generally relatively meager, and travel was arduous, so the amount of money obtained in this way was not sufficient to enable professional chess players to support themselves financially.&lt;ref name="Shibutp.122"/&gt; Moreover, the [[London 1851 chess tournament|first major chess tournament]] was not organized until 1851,&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, it was not until the International Tournament of 1851, held at [[the Crystal Palace]] of the [[The Great Exhibition|London Exhibition]], that tournament play entered the chess scene." [[Robert Byrne (chess player)|Robert Byrne]] [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E1DD1338F937A25752C0A961958260 "Chess"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 14, 1997. Accessed July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and chess tournaments remained a rarity for several decades following.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuben Fine]] writes that for [[Adolf Anderssen]] (1818–1879), winner of the 1851 tournament, "There were few tournaments (none at all from 1851 to 1857)". Reuben Fine, ''The World's Great Chess Games'', Dover, 1983, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-486-24512-8}}. Similarly, for [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] (1836–1900), the first [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]], "active tournaments were few and far between ... Steinitz could hardly find one every three or four years". ''Id.'' at 31. It was only during [[Emanuel Lasker|Emanuel Lasker's]] 1894–1921 reign as World Champion that "the institution of the chess tournament was really developed", with "half a dozen international tournaments a year and innumerable local ones". ''Id.'' at 49.&lt;/ref&gt; With tournaments an unreliable means of making a living, odds-giving became a way for masters to entice amateurs into playing for wagers, since the odds gave the amateur a fighting chance.&lt;ref name="Shibutp.122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HooperWhyldp.166"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was the pernicious practice at the time [of Philidor] for the best players to give odds to weaker ones, no doubt as an inducement for them to play for wagers." Harry Golombek, ''Chess: A History'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The odds system even became the earliest rating system: amateurs were graded according to what handicap they needed to compete against a master, and were referred to as a "Rook player" or "Pawn and move player", for example, as we would today speak of players by their [[Elo rating]]s (e.g. a "1200 player" or an "1800 player").&lt;ref&gt;Macon Shibut, ''Paul Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory'', Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 122–23. {{ISBN|978-0-486-43574-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The playing of games at odds gradually grew rarer as the nineteenth century proceeded.&lt;ref name="GolombekEncyclopediap.218"/&gt; Today, except for time odds, they have all but disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Shibut addresses the question "why has odds chess all but disappeared today?" Macon Shibut, ''Paul Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory'', Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 122. {{ISBN|978-0-486-43574-9}}. He notes that, "Today, the game's gambling heritage is best preserved in the arena of [[blitz chess]] and, not coincidentally, we can still find oddsgiving in blitz. However, ''time'' odds have replaced material as the preferred form of handicapping." ''Id.'' at 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Shibut posits that games played at material odds became unpopular for (1) technological, (2) political, and (3) philosophical reasons. Taking these in turn, first, the introduction of [[chess clocks]] gave rise to a new way to give odds, one that has today supplanted material odds as the preferred mode of odds-giving. Second, the [[Soviet Union]] supported chess masters and sponsored chess education, but expected chess masters "to be cultural icons, not hustlers". Third, chess began to be treated in a scientific, logical way, "with an assumption of idealized 'best play' [coming] to underpin all analysis". From this perspective, a game beginning from a "lost" position becomes less interesting, even distasteful.&lt;ref name="Shibutp.124"/&gt; Writings by [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] (1836–1900), the first World Champion, and [[James Mason (chess player)|James Mason]] (1849–1905) are consistent with the last point.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] learner should seek as much as possible to play on even terms with superior players. From experience and observation we feel sure that he will learn much faster in this manner than by taking odds. The latter method of practice engenders the habit on the part of the odds-receiver of exchanging pieces without any motive other than to reduce the forces. He may also with comparative impunity commit many mistakes anyone of which would surely cost him the game if he started on even terms, and the object of the student ought to be not so much to win games as to train himself to play correctly. By taking odds a players loses the opportunity to observe the finer points of play of his adversary who on account of his inferiority in force cannot always afford to adopt the best strategy and is more apt to resort to lines of play which he knows to be unsound, relying on the inability of the weaker player to perceive the correct reply. Moreover, the openings in games at odds are quite different from those adopted in even games and, therefore, the odds-receiver is not advancing in one important branch of Chess knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Wilhelm Steinitz, ''The Modern Chess Instructor'', Part I, Edition Olms Zürich, 1990 (reprint of 1889 work), pp. xxix–xxx. {{ISBN|3-283-00111-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, odds play is somewhat foreign to the general principles of Chess, and, therefore, less conducive to improvement of the player—giver or receiver—than serious conduct of the game on proper even terms. This would be so for the weaker party, if only because correctness of development must needs be missing, the whole theory of the opening being distorted and disturbed; and it would be so, for the stronger party, if only because of the habit of speculative and unsound combination odds play so naturally induces—a habit which if once acquired is so difficult of rejection, and whose effects cannot fail to prove inconvenient to its subject, when confronted by a foeman entirely worthy of his steel, and calling for the full exercise of all his powers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; James Mason, ''The Principles of Chess in Theory and Practice'', David McKay, Fourth Edition, c. 1910, pp. 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Ralph Ginzburg]] published in the January 1962 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', future [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Bobby Fischer]] was quoted as saying that women were weak chessplayers and that he could successfully give knight odds to any woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Ginzburg, "Portrait of a Genius as a Young Chess Master", ''Harper's Magazine'', January 1962, pp. 49–55, at 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobby-fischer.net/bobby_fischer_quotes_96.htm Bobby Fischer quotes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026233735/http://www.bobby-fischer.net/bobby_fischer_quotes_96.htm |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[I.

Marseilles received queen odds, in return for which it undertook to force Paris to checkmate it. (See game at the end of this article.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main===

[[Harry Golombek]] gives the following list of material odds (in increasing handicap level):&lt;ref name="GolombekEncyclopediap.218"/&gt;

Note that the odds-giver plays White unless otherwise indicated, and "pawn odds" normally refers to the f-pawn (i.e. the pawn initially located on the f2-square for White, and on the f7-square for Black).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess Player's Handbook'', Henry G. Bohn, 1847, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Mason, ''The Principles of Chess in Theory and Practice'', David McKay, Fourth Edition, c. 1910, pp. 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Odds of the move''': The weaker player plays White.
* '''Two moves''': The weaker player plays White and starts the game by making two moves.
* '''Pawn and move''': The weaker player plays White; a black [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] (typically that on f7) is removed from the board.
* '''Pawn and two moves''': The weaker player plays the first two moves, and Black's pawn on f7 is removed.
* '''Knight odds''': One of the stronger player's [[Knight (chess)|knights]] is removed, usually the queen knight on b1 or b8.
* '''Rook odds''': One of the stronger player's [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] is removed, usually the queen rook on a1 or a8.
*'''Rook and pawn''': The stronger player's queen rook and f-pawn are removed.
*'''Two minor pieces''': The odds-giver chooses which of their two knights and/or bishops to remove.
*'''Rook and knight''': The stronger player's queen rook and queen knight are removed.
* '''Queen odds''': The stronger player's [[Queen (chess)|queen]] is removed.
*'''Two rooks''': Both rooks of the stronger player are removed.
*'''Queen and rook''': The stronger player's queen and queen rook are removed.
*'''Queenside odds''': All queenside pieces (not pawns) of the stronger player is removed.
*'''Strong king''': The weaker player's king may move up to two squares in any direction in a straight line.

|White mates in two moves regardless what Black plays}}

[[Larry Kaufman]] writes that under the chess tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, the handicap below knight odds was:
* '''Pawn and three moves''': White plays the first three moves, and Black plays without the f7-pawn.&lt;ref name="Kaufman2008-6-30"&gt;[http://rybkaforum.net/cgi-bin/rybkaforum/topic_show.pl?tid=4658 2008-06-30 comment by Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt; In odds games with extra moves (pawn and two moves, pawn and three moves), the odds-receiver cannot move beyond the fourth rank with those moves.&lt;ref name="StauntonCompanionp.440"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5ZRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Howard Staunton|title=The Chess-Player's Companion|publisher= Henry G. Bohn|year= 1849|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horowitz1971pp.56-57"&gt;[[I.A. Horowitz]], ''All About Chess'', Collier Books, 1971, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, White could win immediately with 1.e3 2.Bd3 3.Qh5+ g6 4.Qxg6+ hxg6 5.Bxg6#.&lt;ref name="Kaufman2008-6-30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StauntonCompanionp.440"/&gt;

Even with the "no moves beyond the fourth rank" proviso, Black cannot give White an unlimited number of moves. Doing so would allow White to set up the position at right, when White's dual threats of 1.Qxf7# and 1.Ned6+ cxd6 2.Nxd6# are immediately decisive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Soltis|Andy Soltis]], ''Chess to Enjoy'', Stein and Day, 1978, pp. 104–05. {{ISBN|0-8128-6059-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[I.A. Horowitz]] adds to the above list the following:&lt;ref name="Horowitz1971pp.56-57"/&gt;

*'''Draw odds''': The smallest of these handicaps; the stronger player plays White, and draws are counted as wins for Black.
*'''Queen for a rook''': A handicap between knight odds and rook odds; the odds-giver's queen, and the odds-receiver's queen rook, are removed.
*'''Queen for a knight''': A handicap slightly greater than rook odds; the odds-giver's queen, and the odds-receiver's queen knight, are removed.

If a rook is given, the player giving the odds can still [[Castling|castle]] with the absent rook, moving only the king.&lt;ref name="Abrahams"&gt;

===Others===

Time handicaps are most often practiced in [[blitz chess|blitz]] games.  The stronger player may be given one or two minutes to play the whole game, while the weaker player receives five minutes or more. Money odds are another way of compensating for a difference in strength; the stronger player puts up some multiple (three, five, ten, etc.) of the amount of money put up by the weaker player.&lt;ref&gt;Staunton discusses 2–1 money odds, for example betting two [[British pounds|pounds]] on each game to the opponent's one. Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 388–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1963 Bobby Fischer, playing five-minute chess, gave 10–1 money odds to [[Stewart Reuben]] and 20–1 money odds to National Master Asa Hoffman. John Donaldson and Eric Tangborn, ''The Unknown Bobby Fischer'', International Chess Enterprises, 1999, p. 71. {{ISBN|1-879479-85-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th–19th centuries pion coiffé (capped or marked pawn) handicapping was sometimes used. The stronger player must checkmate with a particular pawn, which is usually marked at the start of play. The pawn cannot be promoted;  giving checkmate with any other pawn or piece loses the game. Pion coiffé is considered to be about equivalent to giving odds of a queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5ZRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Howard Staunton|title=The Chess-Player's Companion|publisher= Henry G. Bohn|year= 1849|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, games have occasionally been played with a ringed piece, where a ring or band is placed around a particular piece, and the player giving odds must checkmate with that piece.&lt;ref name="ChernevWondersp.31"&gt;[[Irving Chernev]], ''Wonders and Curiosities of Chess'', Dover Publications, 1974, p. 31. {{ISBN|0-486-23007-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WinterKCKp.31"&gt;Edward Winter, ''Kings, Commoners and Knaves'', Russell Enterprises, 1999, pp. 114–15. {{ISBN|1-888690-04-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChessNotes3502"&gt;[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter03.html#3500._Capablanca_origins Chess Notes No. 3502]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of odds, along with pion coiffé, are very difficult for the odds-giver, who cannot allow the odds-receiver to [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]] for the capped or ringed piece or pawn.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, p. 383 (quoting Carrera).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[O]bviously, the odds-receiver can go to any limit of material sacrifice in order to get rid of that one 'fatal' piece. Conversely, this means that the odds-giver must guard that particular piece no less jealously than his King—a condition liable to cramp the style and tax the ingenuity of the best player." Assiac, ''The Pleasures of Chess'', Dover Publications, 1960, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in pion coiffé, after 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5, Black already threatens to sacrifice the queen for the capped pawn if it is the a-, d-, or g-pawn, to play 3...Qe5+ followed by such a sacrifice if it is the b- or h-pawn, or to play 3...Qe4+ followed by a sacrifice if it is the c-pawn.

* '''Checkmate on a particular square''': This may mean either that the odds-receiver's king must be mated while on the specified square, or that the odds-giver's piece must administer mate from that square. Carrera considered the first of these roughly equivalent to knight odds, the second a bit less.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Assiac observed of the first, "This sounds like a formidable proposition, but it really isn't. All the better player has to do is reduce the game to a favorable ending. Thereafter, having promoted a pawn or two, he will find the rest easy."&lt;ref name="Assiac, 1960, p. 150"&gt;Assiac, ''The Pleasures of Chess'', Dover Publications, 1960, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Checkmate with a pawn''': The mating pawn may be any pawn, not a specified pawn, as in pion coiffé. Carrera considered this form of odds equivalent to giving odds of two pawns.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Giving all the pieces for two moves each time''': The odds-giver begins the game with only the king and pawns, while the odds-receiver has a full complement of pieces and pawns. In exchange for this, the odds-giver plays two moves on each turn, while the odds-receiver can only play one. Carrera wrote that while some considered this an even game, he thought that it favored the pieces, although the side with the pieces must play cautiously. The player with the pieces should try to eliminate the pawns, for instance by giving up two pawns for one, or a minor piece for two pawns.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also called [[Monster chess]] (which usually uses 4 pawns).
* '''Giving the king the knight's move''': The odds-receiver's king, in addition to being able to move in the usual manner, is able to move like a knight. Carrera considered this form of odds improper because it allows the odds-receiver to use his king to checkmate the enemy king from a knight's move away (for example, with the odds-receiver's king at g6 and the odds-giver's king at h8, the latter is in [[check (chess)|check]] and, if no legal response is possible, is checkmated).&lt;ref name="Howard Staunton 1849, pp. 390"&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrera considered this form of odds equivalent to giving rook and pawn odds. Because of the king's unusual power, the odds-giver requires more material than usual in order to checkmate a bare king (for example, queen and another piece, or two rooks).&lt;ref name="Howard Staunton 1849, pp. 390"/&gt;
* '''Giving the queen the knight's move''': Similarly to the above, the odds-receiver's queen (rather than king) has the [[Amazon (chess)|additional ability to move like a knight]]. This makes the queen very powerful, since she has the ability to administer mate without the assistance of any other pieces (for instance, an enhanced queen on h6 mates a king on h8, since Kg8 would still leave the king in check). Carrera considered this roughly equivalent to knight odds, although it varied depending on the players' strengths.&lt;ref name="Howard Staunton 1849, pp. 390"/&gt;
* '''Odds of the castled king''': The odds-receiver begins the game with the positions of his king and one of his rooks interchanged (e.g., king on h8 or a8, and the displaced rook on the king's square). The first way (king on h8, rook on e8) is used unless otherwise specified before the game. Carrera thought this form of odds equivalent to the player with normally placed pieces giving a little less than two pawns, or a little less than a knight if the a8-rook and king are the ones interchanged. Staunton noted that Carrera's description and examples of these odds "are not adapted to our mode of castling" since the king and rook do not end up on the same squares they would normally occupy after castling.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staunton also mentioned the following unusual forms of odds not discussed by Carrera:
* '''Odds of the losing game''': The odds-giver undertakes to force the odds-receiver to checkmate him.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; (See Paris–Marseilles, correspondence 1878, given below.)
* '''Additional pawns''': The odds-giver permits the odds-receiver to begin the game with a specified number of extra pawns (for example, eight extra pawns).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', 1849, pp. 395–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless specially agreed, the side with the extra pawns moves first.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Odds of queen rook in exchange for the opponent's queen knight, or pawn and move, or pawn and two moves'''.&lt;ref&gt;Staunton, ''The Chess Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 409–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Odds of queen knight in exchange for pawn and move, or in exchange for the first two moves'''.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess Player's Companion'', Henry G. Bohn, 1849, pp. 435–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rating equivalent ==

[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Kaufman]] wrote the following about the [[Elo rating]] equivalence of giving knight odds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rybkaforum.net/cgi-bin/rybkaforum/topic_show.pl?tid=4249 2008-06-02 comment on Rybka Community Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Elo equivalent of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the "weak" player is around [[International Master|IM]] level, but it drops as you go down. For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When you get down to the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaufman has written that Kasparov could give pawn and move odds to a low grandmaster (2500 FIDE rating) and be slightly favored, and would have even chances at knight odds against a player with a FIDE rating of 2115.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Kaufman, [https://archive.is/20120630212329/http://home.comcast.net/~danheisman/Articles/evaluation_of_material_imbalance.htm The Evaluation of Material Imbalances], originally published in ''[[Chess Life]]'', March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame''' is a museum in [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The museum collects and preserves the history of [[harness racing]] and serves as a [[hall of fame]] for [[Trot (horse gait)|The American Standardbred horse]].

[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] is the birthplace of [[Hambletonian 10]], the  ancestor of all American [[Standardbred horse]]s, and many of the early [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian races]] were held in Goshen at the Good Time Park mile track. Established in 1838, the neighboring half-mile [[Historic Track]] is a [[National Historic Landmark]], the oldest harness horse track still in use in the United States. Stables still operate on the grounds and races are held annually. The museum opened in 1951, during Goshen's Hambletonian Stake era.

==Hall of Fame==
The [[Timber framing|half-timber]] building that houses the museum was built as a stable in 1913. It houses artwork by famous equine artists and racing memorabilia dating back to the start of trotting. Exhibits include more than 1,700&amp;nbsp;paintings, lithographs and sculptures, 19,300 photographs, hundreds of drivers' uniforms, 75&amp;nbsp;[[sulky|sulkies]], 59 sulkies and 7 carts, and a preserved stable which serves as a walk-through display case for racing equipment. The museum also maintains a research library with more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;books and videos on the sport of harness racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Harness Museum &amp; Hall of Fame |title=Historic Collection and Library Research Services |url=http://www.harnessmuseum.com/Pages/Collections/collections.htm |accessdate=2006-05-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060502055139/http://www.harnessmuseum.com/Pages/Collections/collections.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall of Fame is contained within the museum.

The Hall of Fame inducts nominees under several categories, divided between those for horses and those for humans, including drivers, owners, and trainers. The three main categories are Living Persons, Living Horses, and Immortals. Winners from each category are inducted on Hall of Fame Day, the first Sunday of each July.

===Living persons===
Living people are nominated for the Hall of Fame annually by the [[United States Harness Writers Association]], based upon their "ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contribution to harness racing." All members with more than 10&amp;nbsp;years of membership are eligible to vote, and 75% support is needed for a nomination to pass. Winners receive a ring, and a statuette of each inductee is added to the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=fame&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Harness Museum &amp; Hall of Fame |title=Harness Racing Hall of Fame |url=http://www.harnessmuseum.com/hofelections.htm |accessdate=2009-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218150047/http://www.harnessmuseum.com/hofelections.htm |archivedate=2010-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living horses===
The museum maintains a nomination committee which compiles a list of five nominees per year to be voted on by all museum members. All horses are required to have been drug-free during their careers and to have been retired from the sport for at least five years. There is a category for race horses, another for [[stallion (horse)|stallions]], and another for [[mare (horse)|broodmare]]s, each with its own criteria. Winners receive a plaque in the Hall of Fame, and a replica is presented to the current owner of each horse.&lt;ref name="fame"/&gt;

===Immortals===
Museum members in good standing nominate people and horses who are deceased more than 3 years. The nominations are reviewed by a committee, recommendations are made to the board of trustees, and the board elects the honorees. Inductees include horses such as [[Greyhound (horse)|Greyhound]] and [[Victory Song (horse)|Victory Song]] and drivers such as Thomas S. Berry [[Del Cameron]], [[Jim Dennis]], Gladys F. Harriman and [[Gene Riegle]]. Inductees are trainers, owners, breeders, industry executives, artists, writers, and horses.&lt;ref name="fame"/&gt;

[[File:New York Red Bulls vs CD FAS (15264450902).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Squad number, as depicted on an [[association football]] jersey.]]

In sports, particularly [[team sport|team]] sports, the '''name''', often referred to as the '''uniform name''', '''squad name''', '''jersey name''', '''shirt name''' is the name worn on a player's [[uniform]].

Originally, the [[Number (sports)|number]] worn on a player's [[uniform]] was used to identify and distinguish each players (and sometimes others, such as coaches and [[official (sports)|officials]]) from others wearing the same or similar uniforms. 
But, In order to identify players in detail, The name worn on a player's [[uniform]] is used. Especially In [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|American professional sports]], Name priting were introduced in [[1960s]].

The name is typically displayed on the rear of the [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]], often accompanied by the numeber. Name printig is also used from a [[sports marketing]] point. For example, To promote the player to fans and jersey sales)

In generall, official [[surname]] is used, But [[Nickname]] is also used. 

==Association football==
In association football, In [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], [[Number (sports)|numbers]] were introduced on the back of team jerseys. In [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA]] made changes to the jersey, and squad numbers were also printed on the front. 
Player names were also printed on the back of the jerseys for the first time. These modifications were implemented to make it easier for television and radio broadcasters to identify players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifamuseum.com/stories/blog/usa-94-a-15th-world-cup-full-of-firsts-2610677/ FIFA World Football Museum: USA '94: A World Cup of firsts ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[UEFA Euro 1992]] and [[1993–94 FA Premier League]], Name printing on jersey was used, but After [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Name printing is commonly used in various football competitions all over the world.

==Baseball==
In [[Major League Baseball]], Name printing on jersey was used in [[1960s]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYv0FtTPhco 1968 World Series Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ice hockey==
To start the [[1977–78 NHL season|1977–78 season]], the [[National Hockey League]] placed into effect a rule that also required players' sweaters to display the names of the players wearing them in addition to their [[Number (sports)#Ice hockey|number]], but [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Harold Ballard]] initially refused to follow the new rule, fearing that he would not be able to sell programs at his team's games. The NHL responded by threatening to levy a fine on the team in February 1978, so Ballard complied by making the letters the same color as the background they were on, which for the team's road jerseys was blue. The League threatened further sanctions, and despite playing more than one game with their "unreadable" sweaters, Ballard's Maple Leafs finally complied in earnest by making the blue jerseys' letters white.&lt;ref name=impressions&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLaere|first=Matt|title=What's in a Number?|publisher=''Impressions''|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|url=https://www.impressionsmagazine.com/digital-decorating/heat-transfer/whats-in-a-number/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Number''''' is the leading [[Japan]]ese [[sports]] [[magazine]] published on every Thursday by [[Bungeishunju]].&lt;ref name="sine"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sine Agergaard|author2=Nina Clara Tiesler|title=Women, Soccer and Transnational Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vu9TBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=16 September 2016|date=21 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-93938-0|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name is ''Sports Graphic Number''.&lt;ref name=sine/&gt; The magazine is based in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=sine/&gt;

The first issue, released in April 1980, drew attention by the piece {{nihongo|''Enatsu's 21 balls''|江夏の21球|Enatsu no 21 kyu}}. Yet the magazine failed to return a profit for the next 10 years. Today however, the magazine is one of the most profitable publications of [[Bungeishunju]]. The success of the magazine also led other rival publishers to launch sports magazines, though they tend to be less successful.

'''Richfield Ice Arena''' is an [[Ice rink|ice arena]] located in the city of [[Richfield, Minnesota]].  The Arena offers skating lessons, skate rental, open skating and open hockey.  The Arena is the home rink for Richfield High School and Holy Angels High School, as well as the [[Minnesota Magicians]], a [[North American Hockey League]] team. The Richfield Hockey Association coordinates the youth hockey program.

==History==
The original main Rink #1 built back in 1971 has seating for 1,400 spectators, and room for another 500 fans that can watch while standing.  Adjacent to Rink #1 is the newer Rink #2 which was added in 1999 to the arena and serves as more of a practice sheet of ice.  Rink 2 has only nominal seating for only 200 fans in steel bleachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Richfield Ice Arena|url=http://history.vintagemnhockey.com/page/show/813589-richfield-ice-arena-|publisher=Vintage Minnesota Hockey|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvements==
The City of Richfield plans to invest $2 million in the building, adding a locker room for the Magicians, expanding the lobby, adding classrooms and a training facility.&lt;ref name="improvements"/&gt;

In [[National Football League]] lore, the '''Snowplow Game''' was a regular-season game played between the [[1982 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and [[1982 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] on December 12, 1982, at [[Schaefer Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]. The stadium's snowplow operator, Mark Henderson, cleared a spot on the snowy field specifically for New England kicker [[John Smith (American football)|John Smith]] so he could kick the game-winning field goal to give the Patriots a 3–0 win.

==Overview==
The night before this game, heavy rains had soaked the AstroTurf surface at New England's [[Schaefer Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]. The field froze over, and conditions were made significantly worse as a snowstorm hit during the game. As a result, an emergency ground rule was put into play where the officials could call time-out and allow the ground crew to use a [[snowplow]] to clear the yard markers. Despite this rule, the ground crew could not plow often enough to keep the field clear. The two teams remained scoreless late into the fourth quarter.  With 4:45 left to go in the game and on-field conditions worsening, Patriots coach [[Ron Meyer]] motioned to snowplow operator Mark Henderson to clear a spot on the field specifically for [[placekicker]] [[John Smith (American football)|John Smith]]. According to Meyer, it was quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] who suggested asking Henderson to clear the field for the kick. As Henderson recalled years later, "I saw Coach Meyer running to me, shouting and pointing to the field. I kind of knew what he was trying to say, so I got on the tractor and drove onto the field." At first, no one had thought it suspicious, assuming that the plow would go straight across, and allow for a more accurate measurement (which turned out to be 33 yards).  Instead, the plow veered left, directly in front of the goal post, giving Smith a clean spot from which to kick.  [[Matt Cavanaugh]] held for the kick, which was successful. 

On the following drive by the Miami Dolphins, linebacker [[Don Blackmon]] picked off Dolphins quarterback [[David Woodley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Today in Pro Football History: 1982: Patriots Beat Dolphins in "Snowplow Game"|url = http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2015/12/1982-patriots-beat-dolphins-in-snowplow.html|website = Today in Pro Football History|date = 2015-12-12|accessdate = 2015-12-14|first = Keith|last = Yowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  Patriots won the game by the final score of 3–0. The game ball was awarded to all-pro linebacker [[Steve Nelson (American football)|Steve Nelson]], who subsequently donated it to his alma mater, [[North Dakota State University]]. Henderson also received a game ball from a grateful Meyer after the game.

Dolphins coach [[Don Shula]], angry with the move and believing it to be against the league rules, pointed out that the league's [[unfair act]] clause allowed the league to overturn the game result. He met with NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] several days later concerning his protest, and although Rozelle agreed with Shula that the use of the plow gave the Patriots an unfair advantage, he said that he had never reversed the result of a game and was not going to start doing so for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;"NFL Top 10: Bad Weather Games", produced by NFL Network&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
Henderson, a convicted burglar on a [[work release]] program from [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Norfolk|MCI-Norfolk]] at the time of the game, was released from prison a few years later and currently works in the construction business.  When interviewed years later about the controversy surrounding the game, Henderson jokingly remarked, "What are they gonna do, throw me in jail?"{{Citation needed|reason=Henderson's imprisonment and subsequent quote as well as his current profession are verifiable, but no source is provided for this paragraph|date=May 2018}}

Both teams would make the playoffs, with the Patriots finishing 7th in the AFC, and the Dolphins finishing 2nd (the normal division-oriented playoff format was scrapped due to the player's strike that shortened the 1982 season), but the Dolphins would exact revenge, eliminating the Patriots by a score of 28-13, en route to the Dolphins' reaching [[Super Bowl XVII]].

The following year, the NFL banned the use of snowplows on the field during a game. In a 2007 interview for an [[NFL Network]] segment about the game, Shula recalled protesting the [[palpably unfair act|"unfair" act]], to which Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] responded that, while he agreed wholeheartedly, without a rule explicitly barring such use of the plow, there was nothing he could do. Ron Meyer, who was also interviewed, said that he didn't see why it was such a controversy at the time, saying, "The only thing I could see (the Dolphins) arguing about was 'unfair competitive advantage'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smb0ItO_w-o&amp;feature=related |title=Top Ten Bad Weather Games: #7 The Snow Bowl |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The incident is commemorated with an interactive exhibit at the Hall at Patriot Place within the Patriots' current home, [[Gillette Stadium]]. The plow itself, a [[John Deere tractor|John Deere Model 314 tractor]] with sweeper attached, hangs from the ceiling at the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Michael|work=[[USA Today]]|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/12/happy-anniversary-to-nfls-infamous-snowplow-game/1#.UqUbpqVn994|title=Happy anniversary to NFL's 'Snowplow Game'|date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stationary bicycle''' (also known as '''exercise bicycle''', '''exercise bike''', '''spinning bike''', or '''exercycle''') is a device used as [[exercise equipment]]. It includes a [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]], [[Bicycle pedal|pedal]]s, and some form of [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] arranged as on a (stationary) [[bicycle]].

A stationary bicycle is usually a special-purpose [[exercise machine]] resembling a bicycle without wheels. It is also possible to adapt an ordinary bicycle for stationary exercise by placing it on [[bicycle rollers]] or a [[trainer (bicycling)|trainer]]. Rollers and trainers are often used by [[bicycle racing|racing cyclists]] to warm up before racing, or to train on their own machines indoors.

==History==
The ancestors of modern stationary bicycles date back to the end of the eighteenth century.  The [[Gymnasticon]] was an early example.

Some models feature handlebars that are connected to the pedals so that the upper body can be exercised along with the lower body. Most exercise bikes provide a mechanism for applying resistance to the pedals which increases the intensity of the exercise. Resistance mechanisms include [[magnet]]s, [[fan (implement)|fans]], and [[friction]] mechanisms. Some models allow the user to pedal backwards to exercise [[antagonist muscle]]s which are not exercised in forward pedaling. Exercise bicycles are typically manufactured using a crankshaft and [[bottom bracket]], which turns a [[flywheel]] by means of a belt or chain. The [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] on these moving parts wear with use and may require replacement.

Specialized indoor bicycles manufactured using a weighted flywheel at the front are used in the indoor cycling exercises called [[indoor cycling|spinning]].

==Uses==
Exercise bikes are used for exercise, to increase general fitness, for [[weight loss]], and for training for cycle events. The exercise bike has long been used for [[physical therapy]] because of the low-impact, safe, and effective cardiovascular exercise it provides.  The low-impact movement involved in operating an exercise bike does not put much stress on joints and does not involve sporadic motions that some other fitness equipment may require.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, as with typical biking, extended use of a stationary bike has been linked to decreased sexual function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Harvey B.|title=Biking and sex—avoid the vicious cycle|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/biking-and-sex-avoid-the-vicious-cycle-201209145290|website=Harvard Health Blog|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stationary bikes are also used for physical testing, i.e. as ergometers for measuring power. Traditionally this is done by imposing a certain level of resistance mechanically and/or measuring this. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friction-loaded cycle ergometers: Past, present and future|url=https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311916.2015.1029237.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a good overview. Modern ergometers and even many consumer exercise bikes are fitted with electronic sensors and displays.

Ergometers, such as CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System), are used in space (e.g. in the [[ISS]]) to counter cardiovascular deconditioning in the microgravity environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (CEVIS)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/841.html|website=www.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temecula Valley Balloon and Wine Festival''' is held annually, the first weekend of June at [[Lake Skinner]] Recreation Area in the [[Temecula Valley AVA]] of [[Southern California]]. The event features morning [[Hot air balloon|balloon]] launches, evening [[Night glow|balloon glows]], [[wine tasting]] from more than 20 wineries, [[wine competition]], [[food and wine pairing]], concerts featuring country on Friday, Classic Rock and Rock on Saturday, and Jazz on Sunday. There is also a giant arts and craft faire, kids faire, and fine art paintings on exhibit within the wine gardens.

== History ==
The ''Temecula Valley Balloon and Wine Festival'', then known as the Rancho California Balloon and Wine Festival, was started in 1983 by Walt Darren, a commercial airline pilot and avid balloonist and by Evelyn Harker a veteran event organizer and [[fund raiser]]. The seed money was provided by Kaiser Development Company and sponsors came from the local community giving what they could with many contributions consisting of in-kind services and products.

At this time, there were only six wineries in the region. (There are over 40 wineries in the region now.) The first Balloon and Wine Festival was launched in the Spring of 1984 and was a monumental success for a town of only 9,000 residents. More than 4,000 people were in attendance that year as 35 balloons were launched from the Rancho California Plaza area off Ynez Road (now Tower Plaza).
  
As the Festival grew, music was added and the event was moved to the Sports Park.  In 1986 as the event continued to grow, it was moved to Cherry Street and the first ever poster contest was held. During 1987-1988, the Festival was moved back to the Sports Park and in 1989, it was moved to its current location at Lake Skinner. In 1988, the Festival featured live entertainment with the Coasters and [[Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials|Little Anthony and the Imperials]]. In 1991, [[the Beach Boys]] entertained.

==Modern history==
Today's concerts are held on two stages. Recent years have included [[Blake Shelton]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Sugar Ray]], [[Collective Soul]], [[Gin Blossoms]], [[James Otto]], [[Chuck Wicks]], [[Peter Frampton]] and [[Five for Fighting]]. The event also includes a [[freestyle motocross]] show on Sunday.

In 1991 the Temecula Valley Balloon and Wine Festival Association was formed when the Chamber of Commerce ceased producing the event. The mission statement of this new non-profit [[charitable organization]] was (and still is) to enhance the charitable, cultural, educational and economic development of the region.

During the 1992-1993 Festival years, no [[hot air balloon]]s were launched but a balloon glow was presented by Paradise Chevrolet in 1993. While the theme of hot air balloons and wine has always served to anchor the event, each year new attractions have been introduced.

'''''The Benchwarmers''''' is a 2006 American [[Sports film|sports]]-[[comedy film]] directed by [[Dennis Dugan]] and starring [[Rob Schneider]], [[David Spade]], and [[Jon Heder]]. It is produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[Happy Madison Productions]] and is distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].

==Plot==
Gus Matthews, Richie Goodman, and Clark Reedy are three adult "nerds" who spent much of their childhoods longing to play sports, especially baseball, but never got the chance. Clark and Richie were unpopular children who were constantly bullied by the jocks and were never able to play baseball or other sports because of their lack of athletic ability. Gus Matthews, who does not talk much about his past, is surprisingly good at baseball even though he also lacks an athletic record. When a nerdy, unathletic boy named Nelson and his friends are ruthlessly bullied and kicked off a nearby baseball diamond by a team of [[Bullying|bullies]] who belong to a local [[little league]] team, Gus and Clark chase the bullies away. When Gus and Clark come with Richie to the field to play and get back their feel for the game, the bullies return and demand that they leave. Gus challenges the bullies to play them for the field, and the three friends, despite Clark and Richie's poor abilities, win the game due to Gus's superior skill. Days later, a man named Brad, who was one of Clark and Richie's bullies, challenges them to another baseball game with his team, but the three friends win again.

Later, Nelson's billionaire father, Mel, tells the trio that he is impressed with their wins, and explains his plan to hold a round-robin with all the mean-spirited little league teams in the state, plus their team. The winners will be given access to a new multimillion-dollar baseball park that he is building. Wanting to capture the spirit and fun in baseball which they never had when they were kids, as well as seeing this as an opportunity to teach children everywhere that bullying is wrong and that all children, regardless of ability, should be given equal opportunities in sports, the three name themselves the Benchwarmers and join the tournament. They play against every little league team in the tournament, despite the fact that they are three adults squaring off against nine kids per team. The Benchwarmers win every single game, with Clark and Richie's abilities gradually improving, and the team becomes popular among many nerds, children with poor athletic abilities, and the general public. Their success causes increasing frustration and bitterness amongst the mean-spirited teams of jocks, who start meeting to think of plans to defeat the Benchwarmers.

At the semi-final game, the competing team's coach Wayne bribes the umpire by entering a 30-year-old Dominican man named Carlos into the league claiming him to be 12 years old (despite the fake birth certificate being written in green crayon). Carlos proves to be a professional, purposely stepping on Gus' hand at one point to injure it too much for him to pitch. But the Benchwarmers eventually manage to defeat Carlos by making him too drunk to actually pitch properly and they manage to win when Richie's [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and [[Heliophobia|heliophobic]] brother Howie is hit by the pitch but forces the winning run.

After multiple unsuccessful attempts to derail the trio and halt their winning streak, the Benchwarmers' adversaries finally find a weakness that they can exploit. They find evidence that Gus was a bully himself as a child, known for using name calling over physical force and had bullied one boy named Marcus so intensely that he had to be sent to a [[mental institution]]. Seizing this opportunity, the bully teams expose Gus' secret to the public, shaming Gus into resigning from the team. However, on his wife Liz's advice, Gus sincerely apologizes to Marcus just before the final game. In return, Marcus forgives Gus in an incredibly moving speech in front of everyone right on the field at the beginning of the final game. Gus re-joins the team, announcing that Marcus is the Benchwarmers' new third-base coach.

In the final game, Gus, Clark and Richie do not play; rather, they let a team consisting of Nelson and other non-athletic children play, to give them a chance to compete. The final is played against a team with their heartless coach, Jerry, who is the leader of all the mean bully jocks on the local little league teams, and was Richie and Clark's main bully when they were children. In the final inning, the Benchwarmers are losing, but Jerry's team sees that the Benchwarmers are having fun playing the game anyway despite losing. Seeing how heartless and uncaring Jerry is and realizing the true spirit of the game, they decide to let Nelson hit the ball, and let him score a run, saying that Jerry is "the loser". The Benchwarmers storm the field, celebrating the fact that they were not shut out, and they give an enraged Jerry a taste of his own medicine, giving him a wedgie. Later, the entire Benchwarmers team celebrates at [[Pizza Hut]] where Richie and Clark manage to get girlfriends, and Gus ecstatically announces that he is going to become a father. Everyone rejoices at the trio's happiness.

'''Thomas Faulkner''' (c.1719–1785), known as 'Long Tom', was a noted English [[cricket]]er, wrestler and boxer. A [[Surrey]] man, he was a prominent [[single wicket cricket|single wicket player]] who is recorded playing in challenge matches at the [[Artillery Ground]]. He played regularly for the prestigious [[Addington Cricket Club]] in Surrey and appears in the records from 1744 until 1761.&lt;ref name=LLB&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153248/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1741.html#faulkner From Lads to Lord's – profile].  See also various cricket seasons linked from [[History of cricket (1726–40)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulkner was also a well-known [[prizefighter]].  His first recorded fight was at Long Fields, [[Bloomsbury]], roughly the site of the present [[Russell Square]], 16 February 1757, against a Frenchman, Monsieur Petit.  Faulkner won after ten rounds and 39 minutes.  One of his last was against the Irishman Rossemus Gregory, 28 April 1777, which he won after twenty rounds and a gruelling 116 minutes. He was known to have had a broken nose.

Faulkner retired to manage the ''Welsh Harp'' public house at 28 Aylesbury Street, [[Clerkenwell|St James Clerkenwell]].  He died 14 March 1785, at a stated age of 66 years, and was buried in St James's churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'' (London, 1785), 55, p. 237; TNA PROB 11/1127/309.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''VAM''' is the abbreviation for the Italian term '''''v'''elocità '''a'''scensionale '''m'''edia'', translated in English to mean "average ascent speed" or "mean ascent velocity", but usually referred to as '''VAM'''. The term, which was coined by [[Italy|Italian]] [[physician]] and [[Bicycle racing|cycling coach]] [[Michele Ferrari]], is the speed of [[elevation]] gain, usually stated in units of metres per hour.

==Background==
VAM is a parameter used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed; it is useful for relatively objective comparisons of performances and estimating a rider's power output per kilogram of body mass, which is one of the most important qualities of a cyclist who competes in stage races and other mountainous events. [[Michele Ferrari|Dr. Michele Ferrari]] also stated that VAM values exponentially rise up with every gradient increase. For example, a 1180 VAM of a 64 kg rider on a 5% gradient is equivalent to a VAM of 1400 m/h on a 10 % or a VAM of 1675 m/h on a 13% gradient. Ambient conditions (e.g. friction, air resistance) have less effect on steeper slopes (absorb less power) since speeds are lower on steeper slopes &lt;ref name=FerrariCN&gt;{{cite web

  | title = An Interview With Dr. Michele Ferrari, part one - The Eye Of The Storm 
  | url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2003/interviews/?id=ferrari03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Ferrari53x12&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Ferrari
  | first = Michele
  | title = The rider’s performance: how to measure it? 
  | url=http://www.53x12.com/do/show?page=article&amp;id=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym VAM is not truly expanded in English, where many think the V stands in some way for vertical, and the M represents metres, for instance "Vertical Ascent Metres/Hour."  Ferrari says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I called this parameter Average Ascent Speed (‘VAM’ in its Italian abbreviation from Velocità Ascensionale Media).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A direct translation of "velocità ascensionale media" is "mean ([[average]]) ascent velocity" leading to an expansion of the acronym in English as Velocity, Ascent, Mean.

==Definition==
VAM is calculated the following way:
:VAM = (metres ascended x 60) / Minutes it took to ascend

A standard unit term with the same meaning is Vm/h, vertical metres per hour; the two are used interchangeably.

The relationship between VAM and relative power output is expressed as follows:

:Relative power (Watts/kg) = VAM (metres/hour) / (Gradient factor x 100)

This gradient factor ranges between 2.6 for a gradient of 6% and 3.1 for a gradient of 11%. To work out the gradient factor take 2 + (% grade/10)

==Examples==
Examples:&lt;ref name=FerrariCN/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1800+ Vm/h: [[Lance Armstrong]].
&lt;br /&gt;
1650-1800 Vm/h: Top 10 / Tour de France GC or mountain stage winner.
&lt;br /&gt;
1450-1650 Vm/h: Top 20 / Tour de France GC; top 20 on tough mountain stage.
&lt;br /&gt;
1300-1450 Vm/h: Finishing Tour de France mountain stages in peloton
&lt;br /&gt;
1100-1300 Vm/h: [[Autobus (cycling)|The Autobus Crew]]

'''Dr. Yuri Ilichev''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Ильичев Юрий Петрович, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: Júrí Ilitchev; December 8, 1927 &amp;ndash; February 10, 1988) was the coach of the national football teams of [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].

Little is known about the Soviet trainer, one of only a handful of coaches from the USSR that worked outside the [[Iron Curtain]]. The trainer from Moscow held a doctorate in [[Sports science]] and was appointed as head coach of Spartak Kostroma in November 1959, and spent six years at the club.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.mod-site.net/gb/u/spartak_ks-1/m/1278531658.html#1278531658&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that he worked in [[Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Poland]], though he may have worked or taught [[Physical education]] at Universities in those countries. He spent many years in [[Iraq]] and [[Iceland]] writing up his thesis on youth players and football, which he published in 1975. Only ten years earlier, he had gained a doctorate in [[Pedagogy|Sports pedegogy]].

In 1969, the [[Iraq Football Association]] appointed the Soviet trainer as head coach of the [[Iraq national football team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iraq-coach.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624004107/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iraq-coach.html |archivedate=June 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; military team and youth team, and managed some impressive results including the 3&amp;ndash;0 thrashing of East Germany's national side by the Iraqi youth team (playing under the name of Baghdad Youth XI) on December 12, 1969 with a hat-trick from young outside right [[Falih Abid Hajim]].

The coach continued to build the national side around his youth team players such as [[Jalal Abdul Rahman]], Rahim Karim, [[Falah Hassan]], and [[Ali Kadhim]], with his influential captain and midfield general [[Douglas Aziz]] however after a surprising 1&amp;ndash;0 defeat to [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]] in a 1972 Olympic qualifier in [[Beirut]], the coach's contract with the Iraq FA had finished and he returned to Moscow to work as a scientific worker at the Central State Institute of Physical Culture.

In 1973, after an agreement between the Icelandic and the Soviet consul in Iceland, it was agreed that they would send Dr. Ilichev to coach [[Valur]]. In only a couple of years, he managed to form a strong selection however after his contract ended the Soviet authorities did not agree to an extension to remain in Iceland, and he returned to teach Physical Education in Moscow. He returned in 1976 and managed the team for two years before moving to [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavík]] until the Soviet authorities called the coach back to Moscow. His compatriot [[Yuri Sedov]] was offered to [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur]] in his place and he went on to win the league title with the club, with the team that Ilichev had built.

He went on to coach both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and the Icelandic youth team from 1978–1979 and Icelandic clubs [[Valur]] (1974–1978) and [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavík]] (1978–1979)
