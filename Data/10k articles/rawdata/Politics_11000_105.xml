      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12012">{{Communist Romania}}
The '''1980s austerity policy in Romania''' was imposed by [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]n [[dictator]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in order to pay out the [[external debt]] incurred by the state in the 1970s. Beginning in 1981, the austerity led to [[economic stagnation]] throughout the 1980s, being a "sui generis [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]" which lowered the [[competitiveness]] of the [[Economy of the Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian economy]] and decreased the amount of exports.&lt;ref name="Daianu393"/&gt;

The harsh austerity measures negatively affected the [[living standards]] of the [[Romanians]], increased shortages&lt;ref name="Daianu393"/&gt; and eventually led to the [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|death of Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and collapse of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] through the [[Romanian Revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|December 1989]].

==Background==
Between 1950 and 1975, Romania's economy grew at one of the fastest rates in the world&lt;ref name="Bacon374"&gt;Bacon, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1960s and early 1970s, Ceaușescu was considered one of the "enlightened" Eastern European leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Through his domestic policies, he tried in the late 1960s to get the support of the people, as he increased wages, reformed the pension system and encouraged consumption by decreasing the prices of consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the economy continued to grow in the 1970s, much of the growth was achieved through investment in [[heavy industry]] (34.1% of the GDP in the 1971-1975 five-year plan) rather than [[consumption (economics)|consumption]].&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; Some industries, such as [[petrochemicals]] and [[steel]], had a [[production capacity]] higher than demand in the local and the available external markets, resulting in underused capacities.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; Overall, the economy suffered from the combination of productive and inefficient units, as well as the falsification of statistics and large inventories of unsold production.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt;

The Romanian economy had a strong bias toward large enterprises: 87% of all industrial workers and 85% of industrial output were in enterprises having more than 1000 employees, leading to a lack of flexibility of the economy.&lt;ref name="Daianu393"&gt;Dăianu, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth was, according to [[Daniel Dăianu]], a case of [[immiserizing growth]], as the industrialization and increased ties with market economies were rushed with a weak functional basis, by ignoring the market mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Daianu392"&gt;Dăianu, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of growth limited the potential of increasing the exports and the hard currency for repaying the loans was obtained through cuts in the imports.&lt;ref name="Daianu392"/&gt;

==International loans==
{{main|Foreign debt of the Socialist Republic of Romania}}
Early in the 1970s, the Western countries were willing to fund Romania's acquisition of technology through loans given on political considerations.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; The debts of Romania to Western creditors rose from just $1.2 billion in 1971 to a peak of $13 billion in 1982.&lt;ref name="Georgescu270"&gt;Georgescu, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1970s energy crisis]] combined with the increase in interest rates made Romania incapable of repaying its debts.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt;

In 1981, in order to pay its due debts, Romania requested a [[line of credit]] from the [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; and adopted a policy to pay back all its debt.&lt;ref name="debthalved"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/28/business/debt-halved-romania-says.html Debt Halved, Romania Says], ''The New York Times'' November 28, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; 

As [[Romania-IMF relations|recommended by the IMF]], imports were reduced and exports were increased. The effect of the cuts in imports in Romania, a net importer of food from the West, was however not correctly estimated by the foreign analysts and it led to food shortages.&lt;ref name="deletant248"&gt;Deletant, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1986, it paid half its debt&lt;ref name="debthalved"/&gt; and it finished paying its whole debt early in 1989, ahead of schedule. 

Nevertheless, the austerity policy continued even after all the debts had been paid.

==Austerity policy==
Ceaușescu started an austerity program without reforming Romania's centralised and inflexible planning.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; Domestic energy resources were channelled towards the inefficient production of goods intended to be exported.&lt;ref name="Bacon374"/&gt; Even basic necessities, such as food, heating, electricity and medical care were rationed and infrastructure was left to decay.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, p. 374-375&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the austerity programme, by 1983, the standard of living had fallen by 19-40 percent, according to IMF figures.&lt;ref name="Georgescu260"/&gt;

===Inflation and lowering of real incomes===
Starting in 1978, the government began increasing the prices of goods and services that had been stable until then: included in the first wave of price increases were food, services, public transportation, clothing, wood and wood products. In 1979, a second wave of price increases began, for energy: prices for petrol, natural gas and electricity were increased.&lt;ref name="Georgescu260"/&gt;

Throughout 1982, prices were increased again; initially, the plan was to have just one large increase in basic goods, but eventually, the decision taken was to increase prices gradually, for all products. Just for the year 1982, the increase reached 35%.&lt;ref name="Burakowski274"&gt;Burakowski, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was energy usage restricted, but its price was increased as well: electricity was raised by 30% and natural gas by 150%.&lt;ref name="Burakowski274"/&gt;

On October 7/8, 1982, the Central Committee approved a law on the participation of workers in the investment fund of state-owned companies. Through this act, the workers were given the "right" (in practice, it was mandatory) to invest their money and become, theoretically, co-owners of the company. In practice, it meant a reduction in wages for workers, with part of their earnings given to the investment fund of the company.&lt;ref name="Burakowski275"&gt;Burakowski, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1982, a new reform of the salaries system was introduced: part of the wages were to be paid to the workers only if the company achieved its goals. This part was initially 24% and later increased to 27%. The goals were often not achieved, so de facto this meant a decrease in wages.&lt;ref name="Burakowski276"&gt;Burakowski, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Real incomes began to shrink not only due to inflation, but also due to the lack of availability of certain products, while the flourishing [[black market]] priced out most people.&lt;ref name="Georgescu271"&gt;Georgescu, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government cuts===
According to [[Vlad Georgescu]], the state appeared to have given up its social functions, as social spending declined throughout the 1980s. Between 1980 and 1985, cuts were made by the state in its housing expenditure (37%), healthcare (17%) and education, culture and science (53%), according to data provided to the [[Comecon]].&lt;ref name="Georgescu271"/&gt;

The healthcare cuts led to an increase in [[infant mortality]] rates (one of the highest in Europe) and high [[AIDS]] prevalence,&lt;ref&gt;Roper, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; the disease being transmitted through the reuse of [[hypodermic needle]]s in hospitals.

===Food shortages===
[[File:Bucur Obor (1986).jpg|thumb|A queue for cooking oil, Bucharest, 1986]]
Romania's agriculture had been ignored as the government focused on industrialisation: the highly inefficient agriculture sector employed more than 30% of the working force,&lt;ref name="Georgescu261"&gt;Georgescu, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; but received little and mismanaged investment. Despite this, Romania's agriculture still lacked sufficient labour, the state solving the issue by taking each year millions of school children and university students (2.5 million in 1981, 2 million in 1982) to contribute to the [[harvest]] or whatever work was needed in the fields.&lt;ref name="Georgescu261"/&gt;

Romania began to suffer chronic food shortages and despite the attempts of the government to solve the problem, it persisted throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1983, the collective farms and individual peasants had to deliver produce to the state (something that had been previously abolished in 1956) and, when selling their products in [[farmers' market]]s, they had to adhere to strictly enforced price ceilings.&lt;ref name="Georgescu270"/&gt;

In 1981, a [[rationing]] system for basic foodstuffs was started for bread, milk, cooking oil, sugar, and meat.&lt;ref name="Georgescu260"/&gt; Rationing of some foodstuffs such as bread, flour, sugar and milk was only outside the capital, Bucharest being excepted from it.&lt;ref name="deletant248"/&gt; At Ceaușescu's initiative, a "Rational Eating Programme" began, being a "scientific plan" for limiting the calorie intake for the Romanians, claiming that the Romanians were eating too much. It tried to reduce the calorie intake by 9-15 percent to 2,800-3,000 calories per day. In December 1983, a new dietary programme for 1984 set even lower allowances.&lt;ref name="Georgescu260"&gt;Georgescu, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy usage===
The electricity and [[district heating]] were often stopped in order to save energy, leading to unbearable winters.&lt;ref name="Georgescu272"&gt;Georgescu, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of hot water was also restricted to one day per week in most apartments.&lt;ref name="deletant248"/&gt; Unannounced power cuts affected even hospitals' regular functioning: for instance, in the winter of 1983, dozens of babies in [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s died due to the power cuts to the incubators.&lt;ref name="deletant248"/&gt; [[Street light]]ing was often turned off and generally reduced to a bare minimum.&lt;ref name="Burakowski274"/&gt;

Petrol was rationed; private car owners were only allowed to buy 30 litres of petrol per month&lt;ref name="deletant248"/&gt; and private driving bans were regularly imposed.&lt;ref name="Georgescu272"/&gt; In order to save fuel, the media even appealed to peasants to replace mechanical work with manual work, using carts and horses instead of trucks and tractors.&lt;ref name="Georgescu272"/&gt;

In 1985, Ceaușescu shut down all regional radio stations and limited television to a single channel broadcasting only two to three hours a day, in both cases to conserve energy.

==1989 revolution==
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}

The economic austerity, along with political repression, were the main reasons behind the protests and revolution of 1989.&lt;ref name="Roper57"&gt;Roper, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; His politics isolated him not only from the people, but also from the party (as seen by the [[Letter of the Six]] in March 1989) and the military.&lt;ref name="Roper57"/&gt;

'''American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey''' was a not for profit publicity project intended to raise awareness about [[public lands]] in the United States.  It involved teams of travellers making their way across the United States, from Mexico to Canada,  while avoiding private estates.

==Background==
Nearly one-third of the United States belongs to US citizens in the form of public lands. As the nation's urban and suburban populations expand, public lands and open spaces become ever more important. In spite of the importance of public lands, they are unknown to millions of Americans.

In 2002 the nonprofit [[Public Lands Interpretive Association]] (PLIA) partnered with the [[National Geographic Society]], federal and state land management agencies, private businesses and other organizations in an attempt to focus national attention on American public estate by highlighting the experiences of two groups of travelers who followed a route from Mexico to Canada, which stayed on public lands the entire way -- "the first ever made entirely on public lands.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2002/2002-08-01-06.asp 3,000 Mile Trek Showcases American Lands] ''Environment Science News Service'' , 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  This journey, known as American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey, aimed to create a broad national exposure about the role and relevancy of [[public land]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020731_frontiers.html Handwerk, Brian. Trekkers to Cross United States Entirely on Public Lands] ''National Geographic News.'' August 1, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Trek==
On July 31, 2002 two teams of travelers started simultaneously from the Mexican and the Canadian borders in New Mexico and Montana. During the following two months they traversed more than 2600 miles and crossed six states,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2002/2002-08-01-06.asp 3,000 Miles Trek Showcases American Lands] ''Environment Science News Service'' Aug 2002&lt;/ref&gt; entirely on public lands.

The trek set out to show ways people enjoy and get about on public lands. The trekkers traveled on foot, horseback, mountain bikes, ATVs and off-road motorcycles, in canoes, whitewater rafts, motorboats and four wheel drive vehicles.

The teams met sixty days later on [[National Public Lands Day]] in the [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest]] near Salt Lake City, Utah.

==The Teams==

'''The North Team''' left from the Canada–US border in Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, Montana, and traveled south toward Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Education==
American Frontiers attempted to present a balanced view of America’s public lands—their history and their uses—by engaging the two teams in special public land showcase events, round table discussions, back country classrooms and en route visits to schools and communities to learn about public land issues.  Trek updates were shown on the television show “National Geographic Today” and through daily postings by team members at the American Frontiers website.

===Trek Events===
Both Teams took part in educational events along their trek. These events were hosted by [[US Fish and Wildlife Service|US Fish&amp; Wildlife]], [[US Forest Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]], [[US Geological Survey]], and others.

Some of the North Team trek events included a tour of the OCI Trona Mine near [[Green River, Wyoming|Green River, WY]], attending a wild horse and burro adoption event in Jackson, WY, and paddling across Clark Canyon Reservoir in a dugout canoe, following the steps (or paddle strokes) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Some of the South Team’s events ranged from a Wilderness Roundtable discussion in Silver City, NM about the importance of the [[Gila Wilderness]] in the lives of surrounding communities, a discussion about ATV use in the [[Fishlake National Forest]] in Utah, and a presentation on Condor reintroduction in the [[Kaibab National Forest]].

===Lesson Plans and Educational Resources===
Interpretive and educational materials, including a [http://publiclands.org/visitorcenter/slideshow/ 45 minute slide show] about the history of public lands and [http://americanfrontiers.net/lessons/ lesson plans] to be used in the classroom, can be found at the American Frontiers website.

===Geography Action! 2002===
American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey inspired the National Geographic Society’s Geography Action! 2002 curriculum, aimed at teaching school-aged children the beauty and the benefits of America's public lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpslakes.usace.army.mil/employees/cecwon/pdfs/amfront02-2.pdf Update on American Frontiers/ Geography Action!] ''Corpslakes'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsors==

American Frontier’s sponsors, including National Geographic Society, Coleman Company, Coca-Cola Company, American Honda, and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] show the range of interests, from education to camping or motorized sports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.off-road.com/atv/feature/american-frontiers-journey-across-public-lands-10873.html  ''American Frontiers Journey Across Public Lands'' ] by Dean Waters, ''Off-Road.com'', Nov 2002&lt;/ref&gt; that this event appealed to.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">A '''blue team''' is a group of individuals who perform an analysis of [[information systems]] to ensure security, identify security flaws, verify the effectiveness of each security measure, and to make certain all security measures will continue to be effective after implementation.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sypris Electronics|title=DoDD 8570.1: Blue Team|url=https://www.sypriselectronics.com/information-security/cyber-security-solutions/computer-network-defense/|website=Sypris Electronics|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As part of the [[United States]] [[computer security]] defense initiative, [[red team]]s were developed to exploit other malicious entities that would do them harm. As a result, blue teams were developed to design defensive measures against such red team activities.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rowland|title=How your red team penetration testers can help improve your blue team|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/how-your-red-team-penetration-testers-can-help-improve-your-blue-team/article/431023/|website=SC Magazine|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident response==
If an incident does occur within the organization, the blue team will perform the following six steps to handle the situation:

#Preparation
#Identification
#Containment
#Eradication
#Recovery
#Lessons learned&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Don|title=Blue Team Handbook: Incident Response Edition|date=2014|publisher=reateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1500734756|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating system hardening===
In preparation for a computer security incident, the blue team will perform [[hardening (computing)|hardening]] techniques on all operating systems throughout the organization.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite web|author1=SANS Institute|title=Cyber Guardian: Blue Team|url=https://www.sans.org/cyber-guardian/blue-team|website=SANS|publisher=SANS Institute|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perimeter defense===
The blue team must always be mindful of the network perimeter, including traffic flow, packet filtering, proxy firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;

=== Tools ===
Blue Teams employ a wide range of tools allowing them to detect an attack, collect forensic data, perform data analysis and make changes to thwart future attacks and mitigate threats. Some of the tools include:

==== Log Management and Analysis ====

* [[FortiSIEM (a.k.a. AccelOps)]]
* [[AlienVault]]
* [[Splunk]]
* [[Rapid7]]
* [[SolarWinds|Solarwinds]]
* [[Qradar (IBM)]]

==== Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Technology ====
[[Security information and event management|SIEM]] software supports threat detection and security incident response by performing real-time data collection and analysis of security events. This type of software also uses data sources outside of the network including Indicators of Compromise (IoC) threat intelligence.

[[Image:Primaryreview.jpg|500px|thumb|right|Logo of the Primary Review]]
Following a lengthy period of consultation and planning, the '''Cambridge Primary Review'''[http://www.primaryreview.org.uk] (CPR) was launched in October 2006 as a fully independent enquiry into the condition and future of primary education in England. The Review, directed by Professor [[Robin Alexander]] [http://www.robinalexander.org.uk/], has been supported since its inception by grants from Esmée Fairbairn Foundation[http://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/]. The scope of the Review and the depth of its evidence have made it the most comprehensive enquiry into English primary education since the [[Plowden report]] of 1967. Between October 2007 and February 2009 the Review published 31 interim reports, including 28 surveys of published research, 39 briefings, 14 media releases and several newspaper articles. The Review's 608-page final report '''Children, their World, their Education: final report and recommendations of the Cambridge Primary Review''' &lt;ref&gt;'''Children, their World, their Education: final report and recommendations of the Cambridge Primary Review''' [http://www.routledge.com/9780415548717]&lt;/ref&gt;
was published on 16 October 2009, together with an 850-page companion volume, The Cambridge Primary Review Research Surveys. Both books are published by Routledge. 

The Review's work has fallen into four distinct phases:
January 2004 – September 2006 : consultation and planning.
October 2006 – September 2009 : implementation and interim reporting.
October 2009 – September 2010 : publication, dissemination and discussion of the final report.
October 2010 – September 2012 : building on the CPR through professional networking and policy engagement.

==The Cambridge Primary Review National Network==

Following the Review's dissemination phase, the Cambridge Primary Review National Network [https://web.archive.org/web/20120201232159/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/network/about_the_network.php] has been established to encourage and support the development of excellence in primary education. The network is guided by commitment to:

equity, both social and educational

empowerment of children and teachers

expertise in childhood, pedagogy (learning, teaching, curriculum, assessment) and leadership

excellence in learning and teaching.

The Cambridge Primary Review National Network [https://web.archive.org/web/20120201232159/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/network/about_the_network.php] was led by Alison Peacock, headteacher at The Wroxham School, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, from July 2010 until March 2013. The network operates a number of regional centres, based in higher education institutions [https://web.archive.org/web/20120201235904/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/network/regional_centres.php] around England.

==Remit==

The Review's remit, as agreed between Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the University of Cambridge in 2005-6, was as follows: 

1.With respect to public provision in England, the Review will seek to identify the purposes which the primary phase of education should serve, the values which it should espouse, the curriculum and learning environment which it should provide, and the conditions which are necessary to ensure both that these are of the highest and most consistent quality possible, and that they address the needs of children and society over the coming decades.

2.The Review will pay close regard to national and international evidence from research, inspection and other sources on the character and adequacy of current provision in respect of the above, on the prospects for recent initiatives, and on other available options. It will seek the advice of expert advisers and witnesses, and it will invite submissions and take soundings from a wide range of interested agencies and individuals, both statutory and non-statutory.

3.The Review will publish both interim findings and a final report. The latter will combine evidence, analysis and conclusions together with recommendations for both national policy and the work of schools and other relevant agencies.

==Evidence==
The Cambridge Primary Review had four main strands of evidence:

'''Submissions''' Following the convention in enquiries of this kind, submissions were invited from all who wished to contribute. By March 2009, 1052 submissions had been received. They ranged from brief single-issue expressions of opinion to substantial documents of up to 300 pages covering several or all of the themes and comprising both detailed evidence and recommendations for the future. The majority of the submissions were from national organisations, but a significant number came from individuals. In addition, the Review received several thousand informal submissions and comments by email.

'''Soundings''' This strand had three parts. The Community Soundings were a series of nine regionally based one- to two-day events, each comprising a sequence of meetings with representatives from schools and the communities they serve. The Community Soundings took place between January and March 2007, and entailed 87 witness sessions with groups of pupils, parents, governors, teachers, teaching assistants and heads, and with educational and community representatives from the areas in which the soundings took place. The National Soundings were more formal meetings in 2008-9 with national organisations both inside and outside education. These helped the team to clarify matters which were particularly problematic or contested, in preparation for the writing of the final report. In addition to the formal evidence-gathering procedures, the Review's director and other team members met representatives of many national and regional bodies for the exchange of information and ideas. By February 2009, 146 such meetings had taken place or were scheduled, in addition to the 94 community and national soundings, making a total of 240 sessions.

'''Surveys''' Several months before the launch of the Review, 28 surveys of published research relating to the Review's ten themes were commissioned, on the basis of competitive bidding and peer review, from 66 academic consultants in leading university departments of education and allied fields. The resulting research reports and their accompanying briefings and media releases were published in cross-thematic groups over several months, starting between October 2007 and May 2008. They provoked considerable media, public and political interest, and provided the top UK news story on several occasions. The surveys were published by Routledge in October 2009 under the title, 'The Cambridge Primary Review Research Surveys' (edited by Robin Alexander)[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202004148/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/publications/companion_research_volume.php].

'''Searches and policy mapping''' With the co-operation of [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|DfES]]/[[Department for Children, Schools and Families|DCSF]](now [[Department for Education|DfE]]), QCA (now [[Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency|QCDA]]), [[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]], and [[Training and Development Agency for Schools|TDA]], the Review tracked recent policy and examined official data bearing on the primary phase. This provided the necessary legal, demographic, financial and statistical background to the Review and an important resource for its consideration of policy options. The Review also searched relevant [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and other international data.

'''The balance of evidence''' The four evidential strands sought to balance opinion-seeking with empirical data; non-interactive expressions of opinion with face-to-face discussion; official data with independent research; and material from England with that from other parts of the UK and from international sources. This enquiry, unlike some of its predecessors, looked outwards from primary schools to the wider society, and made full but judicious use of international data and ideas from other countries.

==Policy Priorities==

The Review proposed the following as priorities for policymakers derived from the 75 recommendations
with which the Cambridge Primary Reviewʼs final report ends (quoted with permission of the Cambridge Primary Review) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120201204130/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/downloads/revised_2011-02/POLICY_PRIORITIES_BRIEFING_REVISED_2_11.pdf]. 

1. Accelerate the drive to reduce Englandʼs gross and overlapping gaps in wealth, wellbeing
and educational attainment, all of them far wider in England than most other developed countries.
Understand that teachers can do only so much to close the attainment gap for as long as the lives of
so many children are blighted by poverty and disadvantage. Excellence requires equity.

2. Make childrenʼs agency and rights a reality in policy, schools and classrooms. Apply the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child in ways which reinforce what we now know about how children
most effectively learn, but do so with common sense and an understanding of context so that ʻpupil
voiceʼ does not degenerate into tokenism or fad.

3. Consolidate the Early Years Foundation Stage, extending it to age six so as to give young children
the best possible foundation for oracy, literacy, numeracy, the wider curriculum and lifelong learning.
And if there is still any doubt about what the CPR said on this matter, let it be understood that this is
about the character of the early years and early primary curriculum, not the school starting age.

4. Address the perennially neglected question of what primary education is for. The Mrs Beeton
approach – first catch your curriculum, then liberally garnish with aims – is not the way to proceed.
Aims must be grounded in a clear framework of values – for education is at heart a moral matter – and
in properly argued positions on childhood, society, the wider world and the nature and advancement of
knowledge and understanding. And aims should shape curriculum, pedagogy, assessment and the
wider life of the school, not be added as mere decoration.

5. Replace curriculum tinkering by genuine curriculum reform. Seize the opportunity presented by
the dropping of the primary curriculum clauses from the Children, Schools and Families Bill and the
launch of the new national curriculum review in January 2011. Understand that the Rose reviewʼs
narrow remit prevented it from addressing some of the problems of the primary curriculum which are
most in need of attention, especially the counterproductive sacrificing of curriculum entitlement to a
needlessly restricted notion of ʻstandardsʼ, the corrosive split between the ʻbasicsʼ and the rest, the
muddled posturing on subjects, knowledge and skills, and the vital matter of the relationship between
curriculum quality, expertise and staffing; and that the curriculum debate therefore remains wide open.
But donʼt think that the minimalism of the 1950s (or 1870s) is an adequate alternative. Look instead at
the Cambridge model: an aims-driven entitlement curriculum of breadth, richness and contemporary
relevance, which secures the basics and much more besides, and combines a national framework
with a strong local component.

6. Abandon the dogma that there is no alternative to SATs. Stop treating testing and assessment as
synonymous. Stop making Year 6 tests bear the triple burden of assessing pupils, evaluating schools
and monitoring national performance. Abandon the naive belief that testing of itself drives up
standards. It doesnʼt: good teaching does. Initiate wholesale assessment reform drawing on the
wealth of alternative models now available, so that we can at last have systems of formative and
summative assessment – in which tests certainly have a place – which do their jobs validly, reliably and
without causing collateral damage. Adopt the CPRʼs definition of standards as excellence in all
domains of the curriculum to which children are statutorily entitled, not just the 3Rs. And understand
that those who argue for reform are every bit as committed to rigorous assessment and accountability
as those who pin everything on the current tests. The issue is not whether children should be
assessed or schools should be accountable – they should – but how and in relation to what.

7. Replace the pedagogy of official recipe by pedagogies of repertoire, evidence and principle.
Recognise that this is no soft option, for in place of mere compliance with what others expect we want
teachers to be accountable to evidence so that they can justify the decisions they take. Note that the
CPRʼs evaluation of over 4000 published sources shows how far that evidence differs from some
versions of ʻbest practiceʼ which teachers are currently required to adopt. As the Cambridge report
says: ʻChildren will not learn to think for themselves if their teachers are expected merely to do as they
are told.ʼ[https://web.archive.org/web/20120415145529/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/publications/final_report.php]

8. Replace the governmentʼs professional standards for teachers, which have limited evidential
provenance, by a framework validated by research about how teachers develop as they progress from
novice to expert. Retain guidance and support for those who need it, but liberate the nationʼs most
talented teachers – and hence the learning of their pupils – from banal and bureaucratic prescriptions.
Balance the need to give new teachers the necessary knowledge, skill and confidence for their first
appointment with the vital ingredient that teacher educators have been forced to drop: critical
engagement with the larger questions of educational context, content and purpose.

9. Grasp at last the primary school staffing nettle. Recognise that the generalist class teacher system
inherited from the nineteenth century confers undoubted educational benefits, but that in terms of the
range and depth of knowledge required by a modern curriculum it may demand more than many
teachers can give. Initiate a full review of primary school staffing, assessing expertise, roles and
numbers against the tasks which primary schools are required to undertake. Consider more flexible
ways of staffing primary schools using a mix of generalists, semi-specialists and specialists, and
exploit opportunities for professional partnerships and exchanges, especially for small schools. Reassess,
too, the balance of teachers, teaching assistants and other support staff. Give head teachers
time and support to do the job for which they are most needed: leading learning and assuring quality.

10. Help schools to work in partnership with each other and with their communities rather than in
competition, sharing ideas, expertise and resources – including across the primary/secondary divide –
and together identifying local educational needs and opportunities. End the league table rat race and –
since Finland is the country whose educational standards policy-makers seek to match – note
Finlandʼs paramount commitment to social and educational equity through a genuinely comprehensive
school system of consistently high quality.

11. Re-balance the relationship between government, national agencies, local authorities and
schools. Reverse the centralising thrust of recent policy. End government micro-management of
teaching. Require national agencies and local authorities to be independent advisers rather than
political cheerleaders or enforcers, and to argue their cases with due rigour. Re-invigorate parental
and community engagement in schools and the curriculum. Abandon myth, spin and the selective use
of evidence. Restore the checks and balances which are so vital to the formulation of sound policy.
Exploit the unrivalled compendium of evidence and ideas which the Cambridge Review has provided
on this and the other matters above. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120201204130/http://www.primaryreview.org.uk/downloads/revised_2011-02/POLICY_PRIORITIES_BRIEFING_REVISED_2_11.pdf]

The '''Congressional Soccer Match''' is an annual [[association football|soccer]] game played each summer by members of the [[United States Congress]]. The game began in 2013 and in its current format in 2014. In the match, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] form separate teams and play against each other. The event is hosted by the [[United States Soccer Foundation]] and generally features members of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, and former professional players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United legends competing in sixth annual Congressional Soccer Match |url=https://www.dcunited.com/post/2018/05/15/united-legends-competing-sixth-annual-congressional-soccer-match |website=DCUnited.com |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money raised from the match is donated to local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charity soccer match benefiting children living in underserved communities. |url=https://ussoccerfoundation.org/events/congressional-soccer-match |website=U.S. Soccer Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''English basement''' is an [[apartment]] on the lowest floor of a building, generally a [[townhouse]] or [[brownstone]], which is partially below and partially above ground level and which has its own separate entrance from the rest of the building. 

==Realty==
English basements are often [[renting|rented]] out separately from the main dwelling, either by a single [[landlord]] who owns both portions of the building or by a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] of the building who [[sub-let]]s the English basement. English basements are most common in larger, older [[cities]] like [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]. 

==Phrase==
In other cities, such as [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]], this space is referred to as a "garden apartment".{{cn|date=July 2012}} The phrase "English basement" is mostly an Americanism. In [[Québec]], in both English and French, this space is known as a "demi sous-sol," literally a "half-basement." In the [[United Kingdom]], this style of apartment is usually known as a "garden flat". The origin of the term "English basement" dates back to at least the mid-19th century. The earliest citation in the OED is 1853 ("1853   N.Y. Daily Times 8 July 5/3 (advt.)    House for sale... A new three-story English basement house."). Some people refer to it as the "garden level". Building codes in most cities use neither of the phrases, stating that any floor partly below grade-level is simply a "basement" and a floor more than 50% below grade-level is a "cellar".{{cn|date=July 2012}}

'''Eskil Magnusson''' was the [[lawspeaker]] of [[Västergötland]] in [[Sweden]] c. 1215–1227, and is the first attested lawspeaker in what is now Sweden about whom we have any extensive information.

==Biography==
He was a member of the [[House of Bjelbo|Bjelbo]] dynasty, which in the 1250s became Sweden's royal dynasty. He was the son of [[Magnus Minniskiöld]], and the elder brother of [[Birger Jarl]], the most powerful man of Sweden in the middle of the 13th century.

Around 1217, he married [[Kristina Nilsdotter]], the widow of the Norwegian earl [[Hakon the Mad]] (d. 1214), whose son Knut was a pretender to the Norwegian throne. Due to the location of his jurisdiction and his marriage to Kristina, Eskil had good contacts in Norway and often functioned as a negotiator between the Swedish and the Norwegian government. Some time during 1218-1220, he was visited by his Icelandic writer and politician [[Snorri Sturluson]].&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite book|title=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon|chapter=Eskil [Magnusson]|author=Rosén, Jerker|year=1953|volume=14|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eskil was noted for his learning and seems to have had an important role in codifying the [[Västgötalagen]] or law of Västergötland, the oldest known Swedish text written in the Latin script.&lt;ref&gt;Inger Larsson, 'The Role of the Swedish Lawman in the Spread of Lay Literacy', in ''Along the Oral-Written Continuum: Types of Texts, Relations and the Implications'', ed. by Slavica Ranković, Leidulf Melve, and [[Else Mundal]], Utrecht Studies in Medieval Literacy, 20 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 411-27 (pp. 411-13).&lt;/ref&gt; The list lawspeakers of Västergötland appended to Västgötalagen tells that he collected and edited the province's laws, and administered justice with great consideration. He had good judgment, the learning of a cleric and he was ''superior to all the chiefains of the kingdom''. The list also claims that he distinguished himself in bravery and that it would take a long time until another man of that kind was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Äldre Västgötalagen och dess bilagor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9122">In [[architecture|architectural]], [[construction]], and [[real estate]], '''floor area''', '''floor space''', or '''floorspace''' is the area (measured as square feet or square metres) taken up by a building or part of it. The ways of defining "floor area" depend on what factors of the building should or should not be included, such as external walls, internal walls, corridors, lift shafts, stairs, etc. Generally there are 3 major differences in measuring floor area.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Smith and David Jaggar, ''Building Cost Planning for the Design Team'', Butterworth-Heinemann, London, 2006. Duncan Cartlidge, ''Quantity Surveyor's Pocket Book'', Butterworth-Heinemann, London, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gross floor area''' (GFA) - The total floor area contained within the building measured to the external face of the external walls.
* '''Gross internal area''' (GIA) - The floor area contained within the building measured to the internal face of the external walls.
* '''Net internal area''' (NIA) (or usable floor area UFA) - The NIA is the GIA less the floor areas taken up by lobbies, enclosed machinery rooms on the roof, stairs and escalators, mechanical and electrical services, lifts, columns, toilet areas (other than in domestic property), ducts, and risers.

==Gross floor area==
[[File:Measuring Gross Floor Area (GFA).gif|thumb|Measuring gross floor area (GFA)]]

'''Gross floor area''' (GFA) in [[real estate]] is the total floor area inside the building envelope, including the external walls, and excluding the roof.

Definitions of GFA, including which areas are to be counted towards it and which areas aren't, vary around the world. Adding to this confusion is the practice among some developers to use [[gross leasable area]] (GLA) and GFA interchangeably, or to use GFA as GLA, even though GLA usually excludes corridors and other public areas inside the development, while both figures include areas occupied by structure, like walls and columns.

===In Hong Kong===
Hong Kong law Chapter 123F, [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/25C2868DA2669A12482575EE003F079B/$FILE/CAP_123F_e_b5.pdf Building (Planning) Regulations], Regulation 23 sect 3 sub-paragraph (a) defined that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Subject to sub-paragraph (b), for the purposes of regulations 19, 20, 21 and 22, the gross floor area of a building shall be the area contained within the external walls of the building measured at each floor level (including any floor below the level of the ground), together with the area of each balcony in the building, which shall be calculated from the overall dimensions of the balcony (including the thickness of the sides thereof), and the thickness of the external walls of the building.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
sub-paragraph (b):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In determining the gross floor area for the purposes of regulations 20, 21 and 22, the Building Authority may disregard any floor space that he is satisfied is constructed or intended to be used solely for parking motor vehicles, loading or unloading of motor vehicles, or for refuse storage chambers, refuse storage and material recovery chambers, material recovery chambers, refuse storage and material recovery rooms, refuse chutes, refuse hopper rooms and other types of facilities provided to facilitate the separation of refuse to the satisfaction of the Building Authority, or for access facilities for telecommunications and broadcasting services, or occupied solely by machinery or equipment for any lift, air-conditioning or heating system or any similar service. (L.N. 406 of 1987; 39 of 2000 s. 7)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The non-accountable GFA is further defined in Practice Notes for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers no APP-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/25C2868DA2669A12482575EE003F079B/$FILE/CAP_123F_e_b5.pdf|title = CAP 123F, Building (Planning) Regulations|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|format = PDF|access-date =|accessdate = 2016-07-10|work = Department of Justice, Government of HKSAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permitted GFA in Hong Kong land lease agreement generally the maximum GFA (excluding the non-accountable above) to develop. However it may be further reduced by the effect of plot ratio, maximum site coverage, maximum permitted height of building and Outline Zoning Plan. Moreover, roof and other uncovered area is exclude in Permitted GFA but usually had restricted use as opening space, corridor or emergence escaping area.

;Green features
Since 2001, to encourage the incorporation of green features in building developments, further facilities could be excluded/disregard in GFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200804/09/P200804090135.htm|title=LCQ11: Residential projects with green features|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2010-02-16|author=Carrie Lam|work=Development Bureau|publisher=Hong Kong Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined at Joint Practice Notes on protection and improvement of the built and natural environment no. 1 and no. 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.gov.hk/english/documents/joint/JPN01.pdf|title=JPN1: Green and Innovative Buildings |accessdate=2010-02-16|work=Buildings Department, Lands Department &amp; Planning Department|publisher=Government of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.gov.hk/english/documents/joint/JPN02.pdf|format=PDF |title=JPN2: Second Package of Incentives to Promote Green and Innovative Buildings  |accessdate=2010-02-16|work=Buildings Department, Lands Department &amp; Planning Department|publisher=Government of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since such facilities granted extra floor area to develop and usually included in the GFA/ selling area the developer sold to end-user, which made end-user confused, government planned to abolish the exclusion of green features and use alternative way to encourage green features. For the total floor area, HK use the term [[Site Coverage]].

===In Singapore===
GFA in Singapore, defined by [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] as of March 2014 is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ura.gov.sg/circulars/text/dcdgfahb_d0e4.htm |title=Handbook on GROSS FLOOR AREA |accessdate=2014-03-23|work=Urban Redevelopment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
3  Definition of Gross Floor Area

3.1 All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses are deemed the gross floor area of the building for purposes of plot ratio control and development charge. The gross floor area is the total area of the covered floor space measured between the centre line of party walls, including the thickness of external walls but excluding voids. Accessibility and usability are not criteria for exclusion from GFA.

3.2 URA reserves the right to decide on GFA matters based on the specific design of a development proposal on a case-by-case basis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With effect from January 2014, Private enclosed spaces (PES) and private roof terraces (PRT) are counted as part of the bonus GFA capped at 10% above the Master Plan that also includes balconies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ura.gov.sg/dc/connect/connect13-01/reliable-03.html |title=Private Enclosed Spaces &amp; Private Roof Terraces to be included as GFA |accessdate=2014-03-23|work=Urban Redevelopment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gross leasable area ==
'''Gross leasable area''' ('''GLA''') is the amount of floor space available to be rented in a commercial property. Specifically, gross leasable area is the total floor area designed for tenant occupancy and exclusive use, including any [[basement]]s, [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]s, or upper floors. It is typically expressed in square metres (although in some places such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the square foot is used). It is measured from the center line of joint partitions and from outside wall faces. That is, gross leasable area is the area for which tenants pay rent, and thus the area that produces income for the property owner.

For a property with only one tenant, the measurements [[Gross Floor Area]] (GFA) and Gross Leasable Area (GLA) are essentially equal.

The [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] has established a standard with [[American National Standards Institute]], ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-1996 for measuring floor area and calculating gross leasable area and loss factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''four-year junior college''' was a type of educational institution in the United States in the 20th century that provided education from the 11th to the 14th grades, corresponding to the last two years of [[high school]] and the first two years of [[university|college]]. Although these are now considered [[secondary education]] and [[tertiary education]] respectively, advocates of the four-year junior college argued that all four years should be considered part of secondary education.{{sfn|Sexson &amp; Harbeson|1946|p=xvii}}

The first proposal for four-year junior colleges was made in 1894, by [[George A. Merrill]], Director of the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts]] in [[San Francisco, California]].{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=12}} The first law formally authorizing such institutions was enacted in 1908.{{sfn|Eells|1931|p=113}} However, the idea took some time to catch on. The first four-year junior was established in Texas in 1923 as Hillsboro Junior College, known today as [[Hill College]].{{sfn|Winter|1964|pp=12-13}}  Many others were established soon thereafter, but even in 1931, they numbered fewer than ten nationwide.{{sfn|Eells|1931|p=113}}

The four-year junior college movement was closely associated with a broader movement for a [[6-4-4]] [[educational system]]:{{sfn|Eells|1931|pp=101}} six years of elementary school, four years of [[junior high school]], and four years of junior college (or "senior school"{{sfn|Eells|1931|p=113}}). Under this plan, graduation from junior college would "mark the end of the period of general education",{{sfn|Wood|1930|p=515}} and students who wished would then proceed to more specialized education leading to the bachelor's degree and beyond.

Around its peak in 1942, the movement embraced 34 institutions nationwide, enrolling about 16,000 students in total.{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=13}}  Five of these institutions and 8,000 of the students were in California.{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=13}} The development of the movement in California was aided by a state law allowing individual districts to adopt a 6-4-4 plan. Seven did so and established four-year public junior colleges: Pasadena (1928), Compton (1932), Ventura (1937), Pomona (1942), Napa (1942), Vallejo (1945), Stockton (1948).{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=13}}  From the late–1940s to the early–1960s, all of these localities changed back to a traditional high-school system. The last holdout was Napa, which reverted in 1964.{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=13}}

==Arguments==
Advocates of four-year junior colleges advanced ten arguments in their system's favor:{{sfn|Eells|1931|pp=101-108}}
# Four-year junior colleges could deal better with the unique psychological challenges of [[adolescence]].
# Unnecessary overlap between high-school and college coursework could be eliminated.
# Capital and maintenance costs could be reduced.
# Student time could be saved, with "superior" students finishing in three years rather than four.{{sfn|Eells|1931|p=106}}
# Students could be better prepared for [[semiprofession]]al work.
# Better [[student counseling]] could be provided over a four-year period than in a two-year junior college.
# Localities that could not support a two-year junior college due to scale would be able to support a four-year one.{{sfn|Eells|1931|p=106}}{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=12}}
# The four-year junior college would more closely resemble the successful German [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] system.
# The legal dropout age of 16 makes the 10th grade a more logical breaking point than the 12th.
# A four-year junior institution can attract better teachers and staff than a two-year one.

==Aftermath==

Four-year junior colleges and the 6-4-4 movement were never able to achieve the critical mass required to shift the national educational system, and had faded away by the mid-1960s. A number of problems have been cited for the inability of the idea to take root, including problems with inter-institutional competition, resistance to change, and vested interests.  In addition, "one of the greatest problems" was the incompatibility between the restrictions imposed by law on high school students in the institution's first two years and the greater freedom desired by  students in the institution's second two years.{{sfn|Winter|1964|p=13}} The differing regulatory and accreditation requirements often also meant that students in the last two years of the school could not take the same classes as students in the first two years for equivalent credit.

Perhaps as a result of these issues, in some institutions, such as [[Shimer College]] in Illinois, the four-year junior college essentially functioned as two separate institutions, with most students either transferring in or out after the 12th grade, and only a handful of students continuing through the full four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Report of a Survey of Frances Shimer College|year=1944|first=John Dale|last=Russell|page=185|publisher=University of Chicago|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/ReportOfASurveyOfFrancesShimerCollege}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, many of the economies envisioned by advocates of the four-year junior college system could not be achieved.

The public junior colleges that had adopted four-year junior college curricula, such as those in California and Texas, chiefly returned to a two-year junior college model; many are now [[community college]]s.  Many of the private colleges that had adopted the model are now four-year colleges.

The problem of providing a smooth transition between high school and college remained, however, and was tackled by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], first at the [[University of Chicago]] and later nationwide through the [[Fund for the Advancement of Education]].  Hutchins' approach involved eliminating the last two years of high school entirely for the top 25% of students, and allowing them to proceed directly to college and obtain their bachelor's degree at the age at which they would ordinarily have been only two years through college.  The plan faced stiff resistance from a variety of entrenched constituencies, including university faculty and high school principals, and most such [[early entrance to college]] programs disappeared, reappearing decades later as a form of [[gifted education]].  However, at Shimer College in Chicago, which had previously been a women's four-year junior college, an early entrance program descended directly from the Hutchins program remains in place.

[[File:Hand holding a red fundraising box.jpg|thumb|Door to door fundraising frequently involves a hand-held collection box]]
'''Fundraising''' or '''fund raising''' (also known as "''development''") is the process of gathering voluntary contributions of money or other [[resources]], by requesting donations from individuals, businesses, charitable foundations, or governmental agencies (see also [[crowd funding]]). Although fundraising typically refers to efforts to gather money for [[non-profit organizations]], it is sometimes used to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other sources of capital {{not a typo|for}} for-profit enterprises.

Traditionally, fundraising consisted mostly of asking for donations on the street or at people's doors, and this is experiencing very strong growth&lt;ref name="verystronggrowth"&gt;{{cite web | title=Very Strong Growth | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/57f949abe4b0d786aa52b428?timestamp=1476386732613 | publisher=Huffington Post | accessdate=2016-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of [[Street fundraiser|face-to-face fundraising]], but new forms of fundraising, such as online fundraising, have emerged in recent years, though these are often based on older methods such as [[grassroots fundraising]].

==Organizations==
Fundraising is a significant way that [[non-profit organization]]s may obtain the money for their operations. These operations can involve a very broad array of concerns such as [[religion|religious]] or [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] groups such as [[research]] organizations, [[public broadcasting|public broadcasters]], [[political campaign]]s and [[environmental issues]].

Some examples of charitable organizations include [[student]] [[scholarship]] merit awards for [[sports|athletic]] or [[academics|academic]] achievement, [[humanitarian]] and ecological concerns, [[disaster]] relief, [[human rights]], [[research]], and other social issues.

Some of the most substantial fundraising efforts in the United States are conducted by '''colleges and universities'''. Commonly the fundraising, or "development" / "advancement," program, makes a distinction between annual fund appeals and major campaigns. Most institutions use professional development officers to conduct superior fundraising appeals for both the entire institution or individual colleges and departments. Examples of this include athletics&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., H. Rice, and I. Sturrock, "On the Offense: Three Athletic Fund-Raisers Tell How They Score." ''CASE Currents'', December 1981, 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen, Michael. (2009). ''Academic Library Development Officers in Fund Raising: How They Perceive Their Work'', [[VDM Verlag Dr. Müller]], {{ISBN|3-639-19373-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally important are fundraising efforts by virtually all recognized '''religious groups''' throughout the world. These efforts are organized on a local, national, and global level. Sometimes, such funds will go exclusively toward assisting the basic needs of others, while money may at other times be used only for [[evangelism]] or [[proselytism]]. Usually, religious organizations mix the two, which can sometimes cause tension.

[[Image:Obama Biden rally 3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign team organised a [[Fundraising for the 2008 United States presidential election|record-breaking fundraising effort]] in 2008 based on [[grassroots fundraising]]]]

Fundraising also plays a major role in '''[[political campaigns]]'''.  This fact, despite numerous [[campaign finance reform]] laws, continues to be a highly controversial topic in [[United States|American]] politics. [[Political action committee]]s (PACs) are the best-known organizations that back candidates and [[political party|political parties]], though others such as [[527 group]]s also have an impact. Some advocacy organizations conduct fundraising ''for-or-against'' policy issues in an attempt to influence legislation.

While '''public broadcasters''' are completely government-funded in much of the world, there are many countries where some funds must come from donations from the public. In the United States less than 15% of local public broadcasting stations' funding comes from the federal government. [[Pledge drive]]s, a type of annual giving, commonly occur about three times each year, usually lasting one to two weeks each time. Viewership and listenership often decline significantly during funding periods, so special programming may be aired in order to keep regular viewers and listeners interested.

==Sources==

Fundraising can come from a variety of sources using a variety methods.  These include grants from government agencies, non-profit foundations or corporations; donations from individuals; and sales and services. Income from endowment is not strictly fundraising but rather the fruits of the investment of previous fundraising.

=== Grants from agencies, foundations or corporations ===
Non-profit organizations also raise funds through competing for grant funding. [[Grant (money)|Grants]] are offered by governmental units and private foundations/ charitable trusts to non-profit organizations for the benefit of all parties to the transaction.

Charitable giving by corporations is estimated to be $15.29 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Giving USA 2011 - The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This consists of [[Corporate donations|corporate grants]] as well as [[matching gift]] and [[volunteer grants]]. 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer employee [[matching gift]] programs and 40% offer [[volunteer grant]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublethedonation.com/Content/Statistics.html |title=The Most Important Matching Gift Statistics |publisher=Doublethedonation.com |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are charitable giving programs set up by corporations in which the company matches donations made by employees to eligible nonprofit organizations or provides grants to eligible nonprofit organizations as a way to recognize and promote employee volunteerism.

=== Individual donors ===
The donor base (often called a file) for higher education includes alumni, parents, friends, private foundations, and corporations. Gifts of appreciated property are important components of such efforts because the tax advantage they confer on the donor encourages larger gifts. The process of soliciting appreciated assets is called [[planned giving]].

The classic development program at institutions of higher learning include prospect identification, [[prospect research]] and verification of the prospect's viability, cultivation, solicitation, and finally stewardship, the latter being the process of keeping donors informed about how past support has been used.

When goods or professional services are donated to an organization rather than cash, this is called an in-kind gift.

A number of charities and non-profit organizations are increasingly using the internet as a means to raise funds; this practice is referred to as online fundraising. For example, the [[NSPCC]] operates a search engine which generates funds via [[Pay per click]] links, and [[Better The World]] operates tools allowing funds to be raised via members viewing ethical ads on a browser sidebar and/or blog widget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alabamacharity.wordpress.com|title=Alabama Charity Blog|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Save the Children]]'s Dave Hartman wrote after the $1 Million Operation Sharecraft online campaign, "We may have reached our mark, but this is just the beginning of a new era of fundraising and using social media and digital technology to better the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/world-famous-professional-gamer-raises-1-million-for-charity-through-canadian-startup-fundrazr-2012-06-18|title=World Famous Professional Gamer raises 1 Million for Charity online through FundRazr|publisher=Techvibes|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales and services ===
While fundraising often involves the donation of money as an outright gift, money may also be generated by selling a product of some kind, also known as [[Fundraiser#Product Fundraisers|product fundraising]]. [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] are well known for selling [[cookie]]s in order to generate funds. It is also common to see on-line [[Impulse buying|impulse sales links]] to be accompanied by statements that a proportion of proceeds will be directed to a particular charitable foundation.  Tax law may require differentiating between the cost of an item versus its gift value, such as a $100.00 per person dinner, for a $25.00 cost meal.  Fundraising often involves recognition to the donor, such as naming rights or adding donors to an honor roll or other general recognition.  Charity Ad Books are another form of donation for recognition, sponsorship or selling of ads often in an event related program or group directory.

== Purposes ==
Organizations raise funds to support capital projects, endowments, or operating expenses of current programs.

Capital fundraising is when fundraising is conducted to raise major sums for a building or endowment, and generally keep such funds separate from operating funds. This is often done over a period of time (in a capital campaign) to encourage donors to give more than they would normally give and tap donors, especially corporations and foundations who would not otherwise give. A capital campaign normally begins with a private phase before launching a public appeal.

Many non-profit organizations solicit funds for a [[financial endowment]], which is a sum of money that is [[investment|invested]] to generate an annual return. Although endowments may be created when a sizable gift is received from an individual or [[family]], often as directed in a [[Will (law)|will]] upon the death of a family member, they more typically are the result of many gifts over time from a variety of sources.

==Fundraising methods==

=== Fundraising events ===
A fundraising event (also called a fundraiser) is an [[media event|event]] or [[Political campaign|campaign]] whose primary purpose is to raise money for a cause, [[Charitable organization|charity]] or [[Charitable organization|non-profit organization]]. Fundraisers often benefit charitable, non-profit, religious, or [[non-governmental organization]]s, though there are also fundraisers that benefit for-profit companies and individuals.

Special events are another method of raising funds. These range from formal dinners to [[benefit concert]]s to [[walkathon]]s. Events are used to increase visibility and support for an organization as well as raising funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowhownonprofit.org/funding/fundraising/events/events|title=Events - How to organise an event to raise money/awareness for your organisation|publisher=KnowHow NonProfit|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Events can feature activities for the group such as speakers, a dance, an outing or entertainment, to encourage group participation and giving.  Events can also include fundraising methods such as a raffle or charity auction.  Events often feature notable sponsors or honoree.  Events often feature a charity "ad book" as a program guide for the event, but more importantly, as another fundraiser providing members, supporters and vendors to show their support of and to the group at the event by way of placing an ad-like page, 1/2 page, 1/4 page, stating or showing support.  Events and their associated fundraisers can be a major source of a group's revenue, visibility and donor relations.

One specific type of event is the "ad book" fundraiser, where those who wish to give funds to a fundraising group do so through the sponsorship or statement within a book of advertisements.

Online fundraising pages have become very popular for people taking part in activities such as a charity. Those pages facilitate online payments in support of the charity.

Popular charity fundraisers in major American cities include lavish black-tie gala benefit dinners that honor celebrities, philanthropists, and business leaders who help to fundraise for the event's goals through solicitations of their social and business connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aC_HRgg0UoM4&amp;refer |publisher=Bloomberg News |title=Bruce Kovner's $5 Million Can't Get Lobster on Menu at Met Gala |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donor relationship and cultivation===
Often called donor cultivation, relationship building is the foundation on which most fundraising takes place.&lt;ref name="elevationgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelevationgroup.com/documents/TheKingdomCurrencyYonker.pdf|title=The Kingdom Currency|last=Yonker|first=Larry|date=June 2002|format=PDF|author2=McGinty, Chuck|author3=Donaldson, Devlin|accessdate=2007-06-22}} &lt;!-- This appears to be a self-published paper by a consultant - we really need a better source - something published in a fundraising journal for instance.  Preferably a review or study of fundraising practices considering the assertion. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most development strategies divide donors into categories based on annual gifts. For instance, major donors are those that give at the highest level of the organization's fundraising scale and mid-level donors are in the middle.

More sophisticated strategies use tools to overlay demographic and other [[market segmentation]] data against their database of donors in order to more precisely customize communication and more effectively target resources.&lt;ref name="nonprofittimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nptimes.com/enews/tips/marketing.html#market7|title=Useful Past Tips: Marketing|publisher=Nonprofit Times|accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;!--This isn't a great reference either.  It's a tips/how-to page, not an analysis of how orgs fundraise so doesn't exactly support the assertions... --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Peter Maple]] in the UK&lt;ref&gt;Maple P,(2003) Marketing Strategy for Effective Fundraising, DSC&lt;/ref&gt; shows that charities generally underinvest in good marketing research spending around a quarter of what an equivalent sized for profit company might spend.

Donor relations and stewardship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/171926511_1.html|title=Entrepreneur - Start, run and grow your business.|work=Entrepreneur|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; professionals support fundraisers by recognizing and thanking donors, and demonstrating the impact of their donations in a fashion that will cultivate future giving to nonprofit organizations.

Recent research by [[Adrian Sargeant]] and the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]]' Fundraising Effectiveness Project suggests the sector has a long way to go in improving the quality of donor relations. The sector generally loses 50–60% of its newly acquired donors between their first and second donations and one in three, year on year thereafter. The economics of regular or sustained giving are rather different, but even then organizations routinely lose 30% of their donors from one year to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Sargeant A. and Jay E. (2004) Building Donor Loyalty, Jossey Bass, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital and comprehensive campaigns===
A '''capital campaign''' is "an intensive fundraising effort designed to raise a specified sum of money within a defined time period to meet the varied asset-building needs of an organization". Asset-building activities include the construction, renovation or expansion of facilities (for example, a new building), the acquisition or improvement of land, equipment, or other items, and additions to a [[financial endowment]]. Two characteristics set capital campaigns apart from other forms of fund-raising activities. First, "the gifts solicited are much larger than those generally sought during an annual fund". Second, "pledges are emphasized as commitments payable over a number of years convenient to the donor or through the transfer of appreciated [[Real property|real]] or [[personal property]]".&lt;ref name="Pierpont"&gt;Robert Pierpont, "[http://www.philanthropy.iupui.edu/TheFundRaisingSchool/PrecourseReadings/precourse_capitalcampaignspierpont.aspx Capital Campaigns]" (2002).  Center on Philanthropy, Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of capital campaigns have been identified. The traditional "[[brick and mortar]]" campaign, focused on building construction or improvements, was considered a "once in a lifetime" campaign in the past because of the ambitious goals of the campaign. Today, however, organizations frequently schedule capital campaigns every five to ten years, and "the megagoals announced by large institutions often are the result of 'counting everything' during a five-to seven-year campaign period".&lt;ref name="Pierpont" /&gt;

A second type of campaign is the '''comprehensive, integrated, or total development campaign''', which aims for a longer fund-raising program based on a long-term analysis of the organization's needs and direction. This form of campaign can wrap together capital projects, endowment and operating expenses as its purpose, and use a variety of fund-raising activities, such as annual gift drives, which are "slower-paced and lack the intensity of the traditional capital campaign".&lt;ref name="Pierpont" /&gt;

===Accountable fundraising===
Some [[non-profit organization]]s demonstrate greater accountability by showing donors the direct impact of their fundraising efforts. This accountability usually comes in the form of a vote, where the members select a specific program or charity that they would like their money to go to. A specific example of accountable fundraising is the organization [[Better The World]] which allows members to select the charity which receives the money they have raised; members can constantly keep track of the amount raised on the browser sidebar tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=2488023|title=Young Professionals Giving Back|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional fundraisers===
Many non-profit organizations take advantage of the services of professional fundraisers. These fundraisers may be paid for their services either through fees unrelated to the amounts of money to be raised, or by retaining a percentage of raised funds (percentage-based compensation). The latter approach is expressly forbidden under the Code of Ethics of the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]] (AFP), a professional membership body.&lt;ref name="afpcodeofethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afpnet.org/ka/ka-3.cfm?content_item_id=1068&amp;folder_id=897|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=Association of Fundraising Professionals|accessdate=2007-01-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206142837/http://www.afpnet.org/ka/ka-3.cfm?content_item_id=1068&amp;folder_id=897|archivedate=2006-12-06|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, by far the most common practice of American non-profits is to employ a staff person whose main responsibility is fund raising.  This person is paid a salary like any other employee, and is usually a part of the top management staff of the organization.

Some non-profit organizations nonetheless engage fundraisers who are paid a percentage of the funds they raise. In the United States, this ratio of funds retained to funds passed on to the non-profit is subject to reporting to a number of state's [[Attorney General#United States|Attorneys General]] or [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretaries of state]].&lt;ref name="ratioexample"&gt;For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/charities/cfr.aspx|title=Commercial Fundraiser Activity Reports (State of WA)|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ratio is highly variable and subject to change over time and place, and it is a point of contention between a segment of the general public and the non-profit organizations.

The term "professional fundraiser" is in many cases a legislated term referring to third-party firms whose services are contracted for, whereas "fundraising professionals" or development officers are often individuals or staff at charitable non-profits.  Although potentially confusing, the distinction is an important one to note.

Fundraising professionals, who have been employed with not-for-profit organizations as fundraisers or as fundraising consultants, for at least sixty (60) months, can become certified as a Certified Fund Raising Executive (CFRE). The CFRE credential is administered by CFRE International, an independent 501(c)6 whose sole mission is dedicated to setting standards in philanthropy through a valid and reliable certification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfre.org|title=CFRE International – Certified Fund Raising Executive|publisher=Cfre.org|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialty within the fundraising profession is the '''"grant professional."''' Grant professionals with at least three years experience, and other requirements, can become certified as '''Grant Professional Certified (GPC).''' The GPC credential is administered by '''Grant Professionals Certification Institute''', whose mission is to strengthen the nonprofit sector's ability to pursue and maintain public sector and private sector funding by promoting competency and ethical practices within the field of ''grantsmanship''. The certification process is designed to measure minimum knowledge and skills related to all aspects of grant development and management, including but not limited to such areas as grant research or pre-production, grant construction, grant reporting, public sector funding, private sector funding, ethics and grant accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantcredential.org|title=GPCI|publisher=Grantcredential.org|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxation ==

Organizations in the United States established for charitable purposes are allowed to raise funds from many sources. They are given a specific designation by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), commonly noted as [[501(c)(3)]] organizations. Other nonprofits such as fraternal associations have different IRS designations, and may or may not be eligible to raise funds. Financial information on many nonprofits, including all nonprofits that file annual IRS 990 forms is available from [[GuideStar]].

==History and evolution==

Hindi has an approximately [[History of Hindustani|ten-century history]]. In this period, it has accommodated several linguistic influences. Contact with [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indic-European languages]] has led to historical 'mixes' or fusions, e.g., [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Rekhta]]. Linguistic fusions were celebrated by Bhakti poets, in approximately the 15th-17th centuries as 'khichdi boli' – or amalgamated speech.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Kothari |first= Rita |date= April 19, 2011 |title= Chutnefying English |publisher= Penguin Books |page = 37 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 18th century, with the rising dominion of the [[East India Company]], also called 'Company Raj' (literally, 'Company Rule'), the languages of India were brought into contact with the foreign element of English. In colonized India, English became a symbol of authority and a powerful hegemonic tool to propagate British culture, including Christianity.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Mukherjee |first= Alok |date= October 18, 2009 |title= This Gift of English |publisher = Orient Blackswan Pvt. Ltd. |page = 175 |isbn = 978-8125036012}} &lt;/ref&gt; The political ascendancy of the British reflected into social and professional roles; this meant that the legal system as well as the studies in medicine and science were conducted in English. 

This led to an interest in the promotion of English into the society of Indian natives. Educated Indians, or 'brown sahibs', wished to participate in academia and pursue professional careers. Raja Rammohan Roy, a social and education reformer, advocated that English be taught to Indians by certain British gentlemen for the benefit and instruction of the native Indians.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IgEEptNmwEwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+history+of+hinglish&amp;ots=EhIdmrVO0s&amp;sig=7m2yDXvJ1L-uj2S4ws9D6y6aK10#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20history%20of%20hinglish&amp;f=false |title=The Alchemy of English: The Spread, Functions, and Models of Non-native Englishes. |publisher= The University of Illinois Press |page = 7 |author= Braj Kachru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Grant, the president of the East India Company's board of control, championed the cause of English education as a 'cure for darkness' where 'darkness' was 'Hindoo ignorance'. The Charter Act was passed in 1813. This legalized missionary work by the Company, including the introduction of English education.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Mukherjee |first= Alok |date= October 18, 2009 |title= This Gift of English |publisher = Orient Blackswan Pvt. Ltd. |page = 114-116 |isbn=978-8125036012}} &lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the twentieth century, English had become the unifying language in the Indian struggle for independence against the British. 

Meanwhile, English was on its way to becoming the first global lingua franca. By the end of the twentieth century, it had special status in seventy countries, including India.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Crystal |first= David |date= March 1, 1997 |title= English as a Global Language |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 1-2}} &lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, English began to represent modernization and internationalization, with more and more jobs requiring basic fluency in it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url = http://englishforbusiness.free.fr/yes/blogger/Not_the_Queen's_English_Newsweek.pdf| title = Not the Queen's English| date = March 7, 2007| author = Carla Power| publisher = Newsweek MSNBC International}} &lt;/ref&gt; In India especially, the language came to acquire a social prestige, 'a class apart of education', which prompted native Indian or South Asian speakers to turn bilingual, speaking their mother tongue at home or in a local context, but English in academic or work environments.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IgEEptNmwEwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+history+of+hinglish&amp;ots=EhIdmrVO0s&amp;sig=7m2yDXvJ1L-uj2S4ws9D6y6aK10#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20history%20of%20hinglish&amp;f=false |title=The Alchemy of English: The Spread, Functions, and Models of Non-native Englishes. |publisher= The University of Illinois Press |page = 1|author= Braj Kachru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contact of 'South Asian' languages, which is a category that refers inclusively to Hindi and Indian languages, with English, led to the emergence of the linguistic phenomenon now known as Hinglish. Many common Indic words such as 'pyjamas', 'karma', 'guru' and 'yoga' were incorporated into English usage, and vice versa ('road', 'sweater', and 'plate'). This is in parallel with several other similar hybrids around the world, like [[Spanglish]] (Spanish + English) and [[Taglish]] (Tagalog + English). In recent years, due to an increase in literacy and connectivity, the interchange of languages has reached new heights, especially due to increasing online immersion. English is the most widely used language on the internet, and this is a further impetus to the use of Hinglish online by native Hindi speakers, especially among the youth. 

While Hinglish has arisen from the presence of English in India, it is not merely Hindi and English spoken side by side, but a language type in itself, like all linguistic fusions. Aside from the borrowing of vocabulary, there is the phenomenon of switching between languages, called [[code switching]], direct translations, adapting certain words, and infusing the flavours of each language into each other.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Kothari |first= Rita |date= April 19, 2011 |title= Chutnefying English |publisher= Penguin Books |page = 39 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian English variety, or simply Hinglish, is the Indian adaption of English in a very endocentric manner, which is why it is popular among the youth. Like other dynamic language mixes, Hinglish is now thought to 'have a life of its own'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Agnihotri |first= Ramakant |date= October 18, 2009 |title= Indian English |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan |page = 212 |isbn = 9780230220393}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A dictionary for Hinglish has been published.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

{{History of the Jews in England}}

Around the start of the 19th century, various factors led to a more positive image of the [[Jews]] in England. As the century went on, [[German Jews|Jews of German origin]] acquired greater social status. Despite powerful opposition, there was a gradual move towards [[Religious intolerance#Historical perspectives|religious toleration]] and full [[civil rights]] for the Jews. 

==Improvement of Jewish relations==

One reason for an improvement in the public image of the Jews at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th can be found in positive attitudes towards Jewish [[pugilist]]s. A further cause for kindlier feeling on the part of at least the [[middle class]]es of [[England|Englishmen]] toward the Jews was supplied by the revival of [[Religious conversion|conversionist]] hopes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Misled doubtless by the tendency to desertion shown by not a few of the [[Sephardim]], many [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians anticipated the conversion ''en masse'' of the Jewish population, and on the initiative of [[Lewis Way]] the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|London Society for the Promotion of Christianity Among the Jews]] was founded in 1809. This and kindred societies wasted large sums of money with indifferent results but, politically, they helped to increase sympathy for the Jews among the [[non-conformist]]s, who formed the bulk of their contributors and were at the same time becoming a leading factor in the formation of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] policy.

==British Israelism==
Similarly, at a much later period the craze of [[British Israelism]] made many of the narrower [[Bible Christian]]s more sympathetic toward the Jews. On the other hand, the great influence of Dr. [[Thomas Arnold]] in the Liberal ranks was ultimately directed against the Jewish hopes. The more [[Erastian]] he was, the more he desired to see the legislature exclusively Christian.

==Rise of German Jewish community==
In the meanwhile the lead among the English Jews was passing from the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]] to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|German]] section of the community. The bankers Goldsmid acquired both influence and culture, and their efforts to raise the community were soon to be supplemented by those of [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]], the ablest of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Mayer Rothschild]]'s sons, who had settled first in [[Manchester]] and afterward in [[London]]. The times were in a measure propitious for a new effort to remove the civil [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] of the Jews. The example of [[France]] had not been without its effect. The rising tide in favour of religious liberty, as applied to dissenters generally and to [[Roman Catholic]]s in particular, might have been expected to carry with it more favourable conditions for the Jews; but a long struggle was to intervene before "Englishmen of the Jewish persuasion" were to have equal [[rights]] with other Englishmen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6832">'''Joint implementation''' ('''JI''') is one of three [[flexibility mechanisms]] set out in the Kyoto Protocol to help countries with binding [[greenhouse gas]] emissions targets (the [[United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change#Annex_I_countries|Annex I]] countries) meet their obligations. JI is described in Article 6 of the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;For more on JI see http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/joint_implementation/items/1674.php&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 6, any Annex I country can invest in an emission reduction project (referred to as a "Joint Implementation Project") in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically. In this way countries can lower the costs of complying with their [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] targets by investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an Annex I country where reducing emissions may be cheaper, and then using the resulting [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs) towards their commitment goal.

A JI project might involve, for example, replacing a coal-fired power plant with a more efficient [[combined heat and power]] plant. Most JI projects are expected to take place in the economies in transition (the EIT Parties) noted in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol identifies 12 economies in transition: [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Russia and Ukraine are slated to host the greatest number of JI projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cdmpipeline.org/ji-projects.htm#1 |title=JI Pipeline Analysis and Database |author= |work=UNEP Risoe CDM/ |year=2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], the JI has caused less concern of spurious emission reductions, as the JI project, in contrast to the CDM project, takes place in a country which has a commitment to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.

The process of receiving credit for JI projects is somewhat complex. Emission reduction projects are awarded credits called [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs), which represents an emission reduction equivalent to one tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. The ERUs come from the host country's pool of assigned emissions credits, known as [[Assigned Amount Units]], or AAUs. Each Annex I party has a predetermined amount of AAUs, calculated on the basis of its 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels.&lt;ref&gt;The initial assigned amount of AAUs is equal to a country's 1990 level of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, less five percent, multiplied over five years.  Each AAU is worth 1 ton of C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;2 equivalent. This formula is set forth in Article 3 Paragraph 1 of the Kyoto Protocol. The actual emission limitations for each Annex I Party are listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;/ref&gt; By requiring JI credits to come from a host country's pool of AAUs, the Kyoto Protocol ensures that the total amount of emissions credits among Annex I parties does not change for the duration of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.&lt;ref&gt;To illustrate, suppose the Kyoto Protocol only had three Annex I parties, countries A, B and C, each having 100 AAUs for the whole first commitment period. This would mean that the total number of credits at the beginning of the first commitment period would be equal to 300. Now suppose that A hosted a JI project for B, resulting in 10 credits-worth of emissions reductions. A would have to convert 10 of its AAUs to ERUs and transfer them to B. So in the end, A would have ten ''less'' credits, or 90 AAUs (100 AAUs minus 10 converted ERUs); B would have ten ''more'' credits (100 AAUs plus 10 ERUs from the project), and country C would remain with its 100 AAUs. The total number of credits at the end of the first commitment period would be the same -- 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

The formal crediting period for JI was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|date=March 2009

|publisher=Carbon Trust website
|accessdate= March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. By 2012, it is expected that the total number of ERUs generated by JI will be around 300 million. This estimate is based on values taken from project plans, and makes no adjustment to account for delivery in practice.

Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these projected savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions.

In December 2012, ERU prices crashed to a low of 15c before recovering to 23c after news that EU’s Climate Change Committee was to vote on a ban of ERUs from countries that have not signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in  '''Palau''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in [[Palau]] since 23 July 2014, when the current Penal Code took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/3/article_15872.php|title=Palau decriminalises sex between men|work=[[GayNZ.com]]|date=15 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214223543/http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/3/article_15872.php|archivedate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandtimes.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16941:new-penal-code-takes-effect|title=New Penal Code takes effect|work=[[Island Times]]|date=25 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024115929/http://www.islandtimes.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16941:new-penal-code-takes-effect|archivedate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, male same-sex sexual activity was illegal and punishable by up to ten years in prison; however, female same-sex activity was legal.&lt;ref name="ILGA 2013"&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |date=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Palau signed the "[[LGBT rights at the United Nations|joint statement on ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity]]" at the [[United Nations]], condemning violence and discrimination against LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/ |title=Over 80 Nations Support Statement at Human Rights Council on LGBT Rights » US Mission Geneva |publisher=Geneva.usmission.gov |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
After recommendations from other countries at the [[Universal Periodic Review]] in October 2011, the Palauan Government promised to fully decriminalise homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1110/S00303/decriminalizing-homosexuality-step-to-genuine-legal-equality.htm|title=Decriminalizing homosexuality step to genuine legal equality|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/palau|title=Palau|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, President [[Tommy Remengesau]] signed into law the new Penal Code, which does not contain provisions outlawing consensual sex between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://76crimes.com/2014/10/16/two-tiny-nations-drop-anti-gay-laws-palau-and-sao-tome/ Two tiny nations drop anti-gay laws: Palau and Sao Tome] ''Erasing 76 Crimes''&lt;/ref&gt; The Penal Code took effect on 23 July 2014.

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
[[Constitution of Palau|Palau’s Constitution]] defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The same-sex marriage ban was added to the Constitution in 2008. The ban was among the 22 amendments passed during the [[Palauan referendum, 2008|November 4, 2008 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2d.ch/detailed_display.php?lname=votes&amp;table=votes&amp;page=1&amp;parent_id=&amp;sublinkname=results&amp;id=57796&amp;profile=1&amp;continent=Australia/Oceania&amp;insti=&amp;res=&amp;year=&amp;page=1|title=C2D - Centre for research on direct democracy|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415061530/http://c2d.ch/detailed_display.php?lname=votes&amp;table=votes&amp;page=1&amp;parent_id=&amp;sublinkname=results&amp;id=57796&amp;profile=1&amp;continent=Australia%2FOceania&amp;insti=&amp;res=&amp;year=&amp;page=1|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/2011/11/23/283/|title=Asian-Pacific Law &amp; Policy Journal  » Blog Archive   » The Rights and Liberties of the Palau Constitution by Kevin Bennardo|publisher=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leaping Lena''' was a West German [[racing pigeon]] who got lost in [[Czechoslovakia]] during a routine 1954 flight.  When she returned home two days later, there was a message addressed to [[Radio Free Europe]] attached to one of her legs.  It read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 August 1954|page=32|title=Coos and Kudos to Greet 'Anti-Red' Pigeon Who Flew Message Through Iron Curtain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|We plead with you not to slow down in the fight against communism because communism must be destroyed. We beg for a speedy liberation from the power of the Kremlin and the establishment of a United States of Europe.&lt;br&gt;We listen to your broadcasts. They present a completely true picture of life behind the Iron Curtain. We would like you to tell us how we can combat bolshevism and the tyrannical dictatorship existing here.&lt;br&gt;We are taking every opportunity to work against the regime and do everything in our power to sabotage it.}}
It was signed "Unbowed [[Plzeň|Pilsen]]."

Leaping Lena was brought to the United States in August 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 August 1954|title=Iron Curtain Bird Here on Crusade|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; quarantined for 3 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 August 1954|page=19|title=Heroine Pigeon Now a 'Citizen'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was used to raise money for Radio Free Europe as part of a publicity campaign for the [[Crusade for Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|title=Radio Free Europe's "Crusade for Freedom"|pages=116&amp;ndash;117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaping Lena was then kept at [[Fort Monmouth]]'s [[United States Army Pigeon Service|Pigeon Breeding and Training Center]].

The '''Galician Armed League''' (''Liga Armada Galega'' in [[Galician language]]) was an armed organization formed by former members of the [[GRAPO]]. They injured two [[Spanish police|policemen]] in 1978, and claimed to have killed a [[Guardia Civil]] the same year in [[Santiago de Compostela]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.march.es/ceacs/biblioteca/proyectos/linz/documento.asp?reg=r-56124|title=Artículo: La Liga Armada Gallega reivindica el atentado de Santiago - ABC - 29/08/1978 - Archivo Linz de la Transición española • Fundación Juan March|first=Fundación Juan|last=March|date=|work=March.es|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[GRAPO]] also claimed the murder. The group was completed disbanded in 1980.

The [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Siniestro Total]] mentions this organization in one of their most emblematic songs: "Miña Terra Galega".

'''''Lubyanka Criminal Group''''' ({{lang-ru|Лубянская преступная группировка}}; also translated as ''The Gang from Lubyanka'') is a book by [[Alexander Litvinenko]] about the alleged transformation of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Russian Security Services]] into a criminal and terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litvinenko|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="group"&gt;[http://old.prima-news.ru/eng/news/articles/2002/9/30/17082.html The FSB as a criminal grouping] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110823155751/http://old.prima-news.ru/eng/news/articles/2002/9/30/17082.html |date=2011-08-23 }}, Andrei Antonov, [[Prima News]], 2002-09-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] is known as [[KGB]] headquarters. In the book, the authors claim that Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] and other [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] officers have been involved in organized crime, including covering up [[drug traffic]] from [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://prima-news.ru/eng/news/news/2002/10/11/17326.html Litvinenko accuses president Putin of involvement in drug business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092620/http://prima-news.ru/eng/news/news/2002/10/11/17326.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, by [[Prima (news agency)|Prima News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was withdrawn from sales in Russia by request from the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155844/http://old.prima-news.ru/eng/news/news/2004/1/30/27326.html State secret disclosed in the book about terrorist acts], [[Prima (news agency)|Prima News]]&lt;/ref&gt; according to The Moscow Human Rights News Agency [[Prima (news agency)|Prima News]]. In response, the authors allowed the book's publication and distribution by anyone in Russia free of charge.  [[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alexander Goldfarb]], the executive director of [[International Foundation for Civil Liberties]] which licensed the book's copyright in Russia, stated, "By banning the books for the first time since the Soviet times, FSB threw down a challenge to the society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007033412/http://old.prima-news.ru/eng/news/news/2004/2/1/27343.html Copyright removed from books by Litvinenko and Felshtinskiy], [[Prima (news agency)|Prima News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Interior Minister of Russia [[Anatoly Kulikov]] promised to bring a libel suit against the book but did not follow it through.&lt;ref name="Dissident"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Viktor Suvorov]], author of ''[[Icebreaker (Suvorov)|Icebreaker]]'' said that the book is "Terrifying, gripping and instructive".&lt;ref name="group"/&gt;  According to Suvorov: 
{{Quotation|1=Litvinenko described a leading criminal group that provides "protection" for all other organized crime in the country and which continues the criminal war against their own people", like their [[KGB]] and [[NKVD]] predecessors. "Book proves: Lubyanka was taken over by the [[enemies of the people]] (who else would put their own people on the needle and [[Russian apartment bombings|blow up sleeping children]]?)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suvorov.com/books/unpublished/a001.htm Why United States do not have "external intelligence"?], by [[Viktor Suvorov]]&lt;/ref&gt; "If Putin's team can not disprove the facts provided by Litvinenko, Putin must shoot himself. [[Nikolai Patrushev|Patrushev]] and all other leadership of Lubyanka Criminal Group must follow his example.}}

Former Soviet [[prisoner of conscience]] [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] stated, "Litvinenko eloquently depicts that what was long considered to be the 'shield and sword' of the communist party is in reality a huge criminal mechanism".&lt;ref name="group"/&gt; 

As Andrei Antonov writes, "the way Litvinenko sees it, the FSB is clearly a criminal and even terrorist organization.

The Market-Adjusted Performance Indicator (MAPI) measures the performance of a company’s management using a relative performance indicator designed to capture management performance as holistically as possible by covering both short-term success and long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporting-times.com/9_06_verguetung_leistung/ ''Reporting Times.''] reporting-times.com, September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The MAPI is an important element for targeted [[corporate governance]]. 
[[Bengt Holmström]], with his economic research and his findings, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize for Economics]] in 2016, laid the theoretical foundation for the application of a relative performance indicator. It states that top management should be incentivised with a long-term relative performance indicator for its variable compensation. 

In the context of a research project of the [[University of Zurich]] under the direction of [[Ernst Fehr]], the MAPI was developed and implemented with the consultancy firm Fehr Advice &amp; Partners. To do this, a listed company’s [[total shareholder return]] (TSR) is compared with the TSR of a customised, relevant peer group. This way external market shocks, for which the management should be neither rewarded nor penalised, can be excluded. The difference between the TSR of the company and that of its peer group provides insights into the actual performance of the CEO and top management. This makes management performance transparent.

Ernst Fehr and [[Adriano B. Lucatelli]] calculated the MAPI for all the firms in the Swiss Performance Index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/22118-adriano-b-lucatelli-ernst-fehr-mapi ''Adriano B. Lucatelli: “Share Price Doesn't Tell the Whole Truth”''] finews.com 26 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation model of the [[National Bank of Liechtenstein|Liechtensteinische Landesbank]] is mainly based on the concept of the MAPI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llb.li/de/medien/medienmitteilungen/2017/honorierungspolitik-der-llb-auf-platz-1 ''Fachjury wählt Honorierungspolitik der LLB auf Platz eins'']  Liechtensteinische Landesbank 23 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality''' ({{lang-nl|Ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit}}; LNV) is the [[Ministries of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry]] responsible for [[Agriculture|Agricultural policy]], [[Food policy]], [[Food safety]], [[Fishery|Fisheries]], [[Forestry]], [[Habitat conservation|Natural conservation]], and [[Animal welfare]]. The Ministry was created in 1935 and in 2010 the department was merged with the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Environment (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]] and was named the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation. In 2017 the Ministry was reinstated. The [[List of Ministers of Agriculture of the Netherlands|Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] ({{lang-nl|Minister van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit}}) is the head of the Ministry and a member of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands]]. The current Minister is [[Carola Schouten]] who also serves as Third [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2199008-vicepremier-carola-schouten-cu-heeft-haar-wortels-in-het-boerenbedrijf.html|title=Vicepremier Carola Schouten (CU) heeft haar wortels in het boerenbedrijf|publisher=NOS|date=21 October 2017|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

==Responsibilities==
The Ministry was responsible for four fields of policy:
* [[Agriculture]] and [[fisheries]];
* [[Habitat conservation|Natural conservation]], open air recreation and [[national park]]s;
* [[Food Safety]];
* Rural development.

==History==
The Ministry was established as a separate ministry, called "Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries", in 1935. Agriculture and fisheries policy had previously been integrated into the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] and later into the Ministry of Water, Trade and Industry.

After the [[Second World War]] the Ministry became responsible for the rationing of food and the reconstruction of the agricultural sector. As such it became much more important. Between 1946 and 1982 the ministry was a "client"-oriented ministry, oriented at the development of the agriculture sector in accordance to the European [[Common Agricultural Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Neelen et al. (2003), ''De bestuurlijk kaart van Nederland'', p.69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the ministry also became responsible for natural conservation and open air recreation, which used to be part of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Social Work. As such it became more focused on sustainable development of the agricultural sector. 

In 2003 the Food and Goods Authority became part of the ministry, which was renamed Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality.

==Organisation==
The Ministry has currently one [[Government agency]] and one Directorate:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6637">'''Multifunctionality in agriculture''' (often simply ''multifunctionality'') refers to the numerous benefits that agricultural policies may provide for a country or region. Generally speaking, multifunctionality refers to the ''non-trade'' benefits of agriculture, that is, benefits other than commerce and food production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These include, in the WTO definition of multifunctionality, environmental protection, landscape preservation, rural employment, and food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These can be broadly classified as benefits to society, culture, a national economy as a whole, national security, and other concerns. For example, in addition to providing food and plant-derived products for the population, agriculture may also provide jobs for rural people and contribute to the viability of the area, create a more stable food supply, and provide other desired environmental and rural outputs.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality,” &lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multifunctionality and agricultural policies==
The numerous externalities, both positive and negative, which are associated with agriculture are important considerations for policy makers. Sometimes current agricultural practices and markets produce too much of an undesired effect or not enough of a desired one. Governments may step in to correct such market failures with policies designed to either encourage or discourage a certain practice. However, individual policies may carry consequences for other policies and for other countries. Such policies are therefore a major topic of discussion in the international community.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality: About,”&lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing [[protectionist]] policies on agriculture is one step that may need to be taken for a country to maximize positive externalities, minimize negative ones and make sure that the mixture of outputs derived from agriculture corresponds to the needs of society.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, removing agricultural supports is often cause for consternation among public officials, who may predict the loss of certain positive externalities of the policies already in place. At the same time, officials may fear the implementation of new market protections in other countries which are trying to promote the production of such outputs of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx&gt;.(8)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, advocates for free trade, such as [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] recommend that countries reduce as much as possible their agricultural protections and institute policies which specifically target the production of the positive non-commodity outputs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14).&lt;/ref&gt;

To help countries formulate their agricultural policies, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] has established a framework for analyzing non-commodity outputs of agricultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality: About,”&lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing the multifunctionality of agriculture and the appropriate policies to implement, there are several concepts that need to be considered. The first of these is jointness, or the extent to which the intended agricultural product and the incidental non-commodity outputs of agricultural activity are linked. The production of some non-commodity outputs may be inseparable from agricultural commodity outputs while others may be produced independently of agricultural activity. The goal is to separate agricultural commodities and non-commodity outputs as much as possible. The next issue to be addressed is whether or not the production or non-production of the non-commodity output in question constitutes a market failure. If there is no market failure, there is no need for a policy to correct it. Finally policy makers should examine the characteristics of the output in question since it may have both a degree of market failure and jointness associated with it. After considering the matter from these three perspectives, policy makers may find non-governmental ways of addressing dealing with non-commodity outputs or make changes in their agricultural policies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx&gt; (9-11).&lt;/ref&gt;

==WTO trade discussions==

In agricultural trade discussions in the WTO, the EU and Japan, among others, argue that multifunctionality justifies continued protection and subsidization of agriculture.  The United States and the [[Cairns Group]] argue that support of multifunctionality should be specific, targeted, and provided in a non-trade distorting manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norway Scholarship''' is the only official scholarship to the [[University of Oxford]] that is awarded in [[Norway]]. Norway Scholars receive funding for one or two years of study and research at [[Oxford University]]  and the scholar always becomes a member of [[Wadham College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://www.unifor.no/fund.aspx?fund=92 |title=  Norsk Oxford - stipendium ved Wadham College eller Norway Scholarship|publisher= UNIFOR

The first Norway Scholarship was awarded in 1920. Since then, one '''Norway Scholar''' has been selected annually, except for a few periods, such as during the [[Second World War]]. The scholarship is highly competitive, and is awarded to a student or recent graduate of [[Oslo University]]. Past Norway Scholars have included  [[Nordahl Grieg]], [[Peter A. Munch]] and [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]].

==History==
The idea for a scholarship fund enabling students from Royal Frederik University, (now [[University of Oslo]]) to study for one year at [[Wadham College]] in [[Oxford]] was conceived in 1919 by a young alumnus of the college, who during the war years 1914–18 had held the post of British vice-consul at [[Kristiansund]] in [[Møre og Romsdal]], Norway.  Arthur Ivor Garland Jayne (1882-1958) was a son of  [[Francis Jayne]] (1845–1921) [[Bishop of Chester]]. Arthur Jayne had married Fredrikke Marie Cathrine von Munthe af Morgenstierne, daughter of Professor [[Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne]] (1851–1930), Rector of the [[University of Oslo]] (1912–1918). As with famous Polar explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], he gave NOK 5000.- towards the establishment of a Norwegian Oxford Scholarship Fund. Altogether Jayne succeeded in raising NOK. 60 000.- or approximately GBP 2780. Jayne spent his later life as a lecturer in English at the [[University of Oslo]].

Arthur Jayne retrospectively explained his initiative in a letter dated 14. October 1945 to Professor [[Didrik Arup Seip]] (1884–1963), then Rector of [[Oslo University]], in the following words:

''At the time of the first world war – - – a considerable amount of ‘Allied’ propaganda material, sent to [[Norway]] and intended to inform Norwegian opinion about the war, proved ill-adapted to enlist the understanding sympathy of those who had previously had cultural or business contacts with the nations in conflict with the Allies. The experience seemed to indicate the great importance of any educational facilities which would bring the youth of Norway and Britain into really close association with each other. It struck me that one useful step in that direction could be some permanent arrangement which would enable Norwegian students to participate in the typically English form of university life that exists in the college system of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. Without actual residence in a college this is impossible. But whereas foreign students have been able to attend courses at English universities, it has always been very difficult for them to obtain permission to reside at a college, sharing to the full all that the college environment can offer.''

From 1920, with the exception of the years 1926–27 and  the war years 1940–44, Norwegian students were awarded the Norway Scholarship for studies of the most varied description. However, as the basic funding of the scholarship proved inadequate, the scholars soon became dependent on supplementary grants from other university funds, but from the late 1970s even this arrangement proved inadequate to meet rising costs. For some years no scholars were appointed at all. The basic foundation capital had by then shrunk to only NOK. 130 000.- (about GBP 6500.- at the current rate of exchange). 

In the late 1970s [[Alf Bøe]] (Wadham. 1952) as head of the Committee, called on  Andor Birkeland (Wadham. 1946) of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]],  accountant Sven Guldberg (Wadham. 1937) and former Minister for Culture [[Helge Sivertsen]] (Wadham. 1938). With the help of the College and of William Bentley, British Ambassador to Norway, they were able to raise NOK 1 170 000 (around GBP 117 000). In the 1990s Bøe formed a new committee consisting of Michael Benskin (St. Peter's. 1965), Haakon Melander (Balliol. 1966) and Erik Rudeng (Norway scholar. 1969). [[Iver B. Neumann]] (Norway Scholar. 1988) was recruited in 1993. When Bøe retired in 2003, Neumann took over as chair. Bjørn Blindheim (Norway Scholar. 1992) and Neumann formed a Norwegian chapter of the Oxford Society, with Blindheim as chair. Since 1981 the Committee has organised an annual dinner with a guest of honour from Oxford University, who has also given one or more lectures locally in Oslo. King [[Harald V of Norway]] ([[Balliol College]].1960) often participates at the grand dinner of Norway Scholars that is held each year in [[Oslo]] by the Oxford University Society Norway.

The '''Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative''' ('''PCPCC''') is a coalition of more than 1,000 organizations and individuals — employers, consumer and patient/family advocacy groups, patient quality organizations, health plans, labor unions, hospitals, physicians and other health professionals — that works to develop and advance an effective and efficient health system built on a strong foundation of primary care and the [[medical home|patient-centered medical home]] (PCMH) model, an approach to providing comprehensive care for children, youth, and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/10/AR2008091001482.html|title=Patient-Centered 'Medical Home' Models Lag in Key Areas|date=September 10, 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/1252194-p2.html|title=State's medical networks acclaimed.

==History==
The Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative  was created in late 2006, when several large national employers came together with the four major U.S. primary care physician associations in order to:
#Advance an effective and efficient health system built on a strong foundation of primary care and the patient-centered medical home
#Facilitate improvements in patient-physician relations
#Create a more effective and efficient model of healthcare delivery
To achieve these goals, the PCPCC has created an open forum where healthcare stakeholders freely communicate and work together to improve the future of the American medical system. The Collaborative has developed model language for inclusion in health reform proposals to include the PCMH concept. It also acts as a key source for the continued education of congressional representatives, the federal and state governments, and individual practices on the PCHM model as a superior form of healthcare delivery.

==Activities==
Having achieved significant success in getting the PCMH included as a foundational model of care in national and state-level health care reform efforts as well as in the commercial health insurance market, the Collaborative is now working with partners to obtain full-scale implementation so all patients and families can receive care in a PCMH.  In order to realize this vision for modern, robust primary care services, the Collaborative is working to:
*Disseminate expert opinion, resources, and tools to assist clinicians in transforming their primary care setting into a PCMH
*Educate policy makers, consumers, health care advocates, employers, purchasers, and payers on the benefits of receiving care in a PCMH
*Share evidence and outcomes of the PCMH that demonstrate improved quality, lower costs, and increased efficiencies in care
*Advocate for policies and payment models necessary to implement and sustain PCMHs in the community
*Disseminate information about implementation of promising PCMH initiatives

In addition to the work of the PCPCC, the Patient-Centered Primary Care Foundation (PCPCF) currently engages in education of the PCMH model through public conferences, webinars, policy papers, guides, and toolkits.

==Member Organizations==
Today, PCPCC’s membership represents more than 1,200 stakeholder organizations and 50 million health care consumers throughout the U.S. split into two different tiers of membership.

'''Executive Committee Members'''

The PCPCC’s Executive Committee is a valuable group of members that provide leadership and work in partnership with PCPCC's Board of Directors and staff.  Members represent a range of health care stakeholders, including health professional associations, employers, purchasers, health plans, health systems, pharmaceutical firms, professional associations and quality improvement organizations. Member benefits include access to exclusive leadership roles, events and organizational initiatives. Each member contributes annual dues that support the development of educational tools, publications and conferences. 

'''General Members'''

The Collaborative’s general public membership is free of charge and includes many benefits. General members are invited to join the Collaborative’s national weekly call and receive monthly updates on the work of the five Centers. Members also have free access to many Collaborative resources.

'''Polydimethylsiloxane''' ('''PDMS'''), also known as '''dimethylpolysiloxane''' or '''dimethicone''', belongs to a group of polymeric [[organosilicon]] compounds that are commonly referred to as [[silicone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecetoc.org/jacc-reports "Linear Polydimethylsiloxanes"] Joint Assessment of Commodity Chemicals, September 1994 (Report No. 26) {{ISSN|0773-6339}}-26.&lt;/ref&gt; PDMS is the most widely used [[silicon]]-based [[organic compound|organic]] [[polymer]], and is particularly known for its unusual [[rheology|rheological]] (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear, and, in general, inert, non-[[Toxicity|toxic]], and non-[[Flammability|flammable]]. It is one of several types of [[silicone oil]] ([[polymer]]ized [[siloxane]]). Its applications range from contact lenses and medical devices to [[elastomer]]s; it is also present in shampoos (as dimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), [[caulking]], [[lubricant]]s and heat-resistant tiles.

==Structure==
The [[chemical formula]] for PDMS is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of repeating [[monomer]] [SiO(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] units.&lt;ref name=West&gt;Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. “Inorganic Polymers” Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. {{ISBN|0-13-465881-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial synthesis can begin from [[dimethyldichlorosilane]] and water by the following net reaction:
:&lt;math chem&gt;n\ce{Si(CH3)2Cl2} + (n+1)\ce{H2O -&gt; HO[-Si(CH3)2O-]_\mathit{n}H} + 2n\ce{HCl}&lt;/math&gt;
The polymerization reaction evolves [[hydrochloric acid]]. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the [[chlorine]] atoms in the [[silane]] precursor were replaced with [[acetate]] groups.  In this case, the polymerization produces [[acetic acid]], which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone [[caulk]] and [[adhesive]]s.

===Branching and capping===
Hydrolysis of  Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generates a polymer that is terminated with [[silanol]] groups (-Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH]).  These reactive centers are typically "capped" by reaction with [[trimethylsilyl chloride]]:
:2 Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  [Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}-2&lt;/sub&gt;[Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   [Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}-2&lt;/sub&gt;[Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

Silane precursors with more acid-forming groups and fewer methyl groups, such as methyltrichlorosilane, can be used to introduce [[Branching (chemistry)|branches]] or [[cross-link]]s in the polymer chain. Under ideal conditions, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This can be used to produce hard [[silicone resin]]s. In a similar manner, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.

Well-defined PDMS with a low polydispersity index and high homogeneity is produced by controlled anionic ring-opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane. Using this methodology it is possible to synthesize linear block copolymers, heteroarm star-shaped block copolymers and many other macromolecular architectures.

The polymer is manufactured in multiple [[viscosity|viscosities]], ranging from a thin pourable liquid (when ''n'' is very low), to a thick rubbery semi-solid (when ''n'' is very high). PDMS [[molecule]]s have quite flexible polymer backbones (or chains) due to their siloxane linkages, which are analogous to the [[ether]] linkages used to impart rubberiness to [[polyurethane]]s. Such flexible chains become loosely entangled when [[molecular weight]] is high, which results in PDMS' unusually high level of [[viscoelasticity]].

==Mechanical properties==
[[Image:PDMS-cylindertje onder stereomicroscoop.jpg|thumb|Hardened PDMS cylinder on the glass of a [[stereomicroscope]] light.]]
PDMS is [[viscoelastic]], meaning that at long flow times (or high temperatures), it acts like a [[Viscosity|viscous liquid]], similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[solid]], similar to rubber. In other words, if some PDMS is left on a surface overnight (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections. However, if the same PDMS is rolled into a sphere and thrown onto the same surface (short flow time), it will bounce like a rubber ball.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;

Although the viscoelastic properties of PDMS can be intuitively observed using the simple experiment described above, they can be more precisely measured using [[dynamic mechanical analysis]]. This method requires determination of the material's flow characteristics over a wide range of temperatures, flow rates, and deformations. Because of PDMS's chemical stability, it is often used as a calibration fluid for this type of experiment.

The [[shear modulus]] of PDMS varies with preparation conditions, but is typically in the range of 100 kPa to 3 MPa. The [[loss tangent]] is very low {{nobr|(tan δ ≪ 0.001)}}.&lt;ref name="pdms_mechanical"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lotters, J. C. |author2=Olthuis, W. |author3=Veltink, P. H. |author4=Bergveld, P. |doi=10.1088/0960-1317/7/3/017|title=The mechanical properties of the rubber elastic polymer polydimethylsiloxane for sensor applications|journal=J Micromech Microeng|year=1997|volume=7|pages=145–147|issue=3|bibcode=1997JMiMi...7..145L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical compatibility==
After [[polymerization]] and [[cross-link]]ing, solid PDMS samples will present an external [[hydrophobic]] surface.&lt;ref name="pdms_review"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000101)21:1&lt;27::AID-ELPS27&gt;3.0.CO;2-C| pmid = 10634468| title = Fabrication of microfluidic systems in poly(dimethylsiloxane)| journal = Electrophoresis| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| year = 2000| last1 = McDonald | first1 = J.

A. | last7 = Whitesides | first7 = G. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This surface will appear metallic and shiny, although the substrate is clear. This surface chemistry makes it difficult for polar solvents (such as water) to wet the PDMS surface, and may lead to adsorption of hydrophobic contaminants. [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] [[oxidation]] can be used to alter the surface chemistry, adding [[silanol]] (SiOH) groups to the surface. Atmospheric air plasma and argon plasma will work for this application. This treatment renders the PDMS surface [[hydrophilic]], allowing water to wet it. This is frequently required for water-based [[microfluidics]]. The oxidized surface resists [[adsorption]] of hydrophobic and negatively charged species. The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with trichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's hydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is vacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="hydrophobic_recovery"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. Hillborg |author2=J.F. Ankner |author3=U.W. Gedde |author4=G.D. Smith |author5=H.K. Yasuda |author6=K. Wikstrom |doi=10.1016/S0032-3861(00)00039-2|title= Crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane exposed to oxygen plasma studied by neutron reflectometry and other surface specific techniques|journal=Polymer|year=2000|volume=41|pages=6851–6863|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid PDMS samples (whether surface oxidized or not) will not allow aqueous solvents to infiltrate and swell the material. Thus PDMS structures can be used in combination with water and alcohol solvents without material deformation. However most [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents will [[Diffusion|diffuse]] into the material and cause it to swell,&lt;ref name="pdms_review" /&gt; making them incompatible with PDMS devices. Despite this, some organic solvents lead to sufficiently small swelling that they can be used with PDMS, for instance within the channels of PDMS microfluidic devices. The swelling ratio is roughly inversely related to the [[solubility|solubility parameter]] of the solvent. [[Diisopropylamine]] swells PDMS to the greatest extent; solvents such as [[chloroform]], [[ether]], and [[THF]] swell the material to a large extent. Solvents such as [[acetone]], [[1-propanol]], and [[pyridine]] swell the material to a small extent. Alcohols and polar solvents such as [[methanol]], [[glycerol]] and water do not swell the material appreciably.&lt;ref name="solvent_review"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lee, J. N. |author2=Park, C. |author3=Whitesides, G. M. |doi=10.1021/ac0346712 |title=Solvent Compatibility of Poly(dimethylsiloxane)-Based Microfluidic Devices|journal=Anal. Chem. |year=2003|volume=75|pages=6544–6554|pmid=14640726|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Surfactants and antifoaming agents===
PDMS is a common [[surfactant]] and is a component of [[defoamer]]s, which are used to suppress the formation of foams.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Höfer, Franz Jost, Milan J. Schwuger, Rolf Scharf, Jürgen Geke, Josef Kresse, Herbert Lingmann, Rudolf Veitenhansl and Werner Erwied "Foams and Foam Control" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_465}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PDMS, in a modified form, is used as an [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] [[Penetrant (biochemical)|penetrant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrrbs.com.au/chemicalspulse.htm |title=Pulse Penetrant |accessdate=3 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220150630/http://www.nrrbs.com.au/chemicalspulse.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a critical ingredient in water-repelling coatings, such as [[Rain-X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/brands?tbl=brands&amp;id=21003001 Rain X The Invisible Windshield Wiper]. householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic fluids and related applications===
Dimethicone is also the active silicone fluid in automotive viscous limited slip differentials and couplings. This is usually a non-serviceable OEM component but can be replaced with mixed performance results due to variances in effectiveness caused by refill weights or non-standard pressurizations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Soft lithography===
PDMS is commonly used as a stamp resin in the procedure of [[soft lithography]], making it one of the most common materials used for flow delivery in [[microfluidics]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-tutorials/microfluidic-reviews-and-tutorials/the-poly-di-methyl-siloxane-pdms-and-microfluidics/ PDMS in microfluidics : a review and tutorial]. elveflow.com&lt;/ref&gt; The process of soft lithography consists of creating an elastic stamp, which enables the transfer of patterns of only a few nanometers in size onto glass, silicon or polymer surfaces. With this type of technique, it is possible to produce devices that can be used in the areas of optic telecommunications or biomedical research. The stamp is produced from the normal techniques of [[photolithography]] or [[electron-beam lithography]]. The resolution depends on the mask used and can reach 6&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|place = London |year = 2008|pages = 92–93 |isbn = 1-84704-002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bio-MEMS|biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems]] (bio-MEMS), soft lithography is used extensively for microfluidics in both organic and inorganic contexts. Silicon wafers are used to design channels, and PDMS is then poured over these wafers and left to harden. When removed, even the smallest of details is left imprinted in the PDMS. With this particular PDMS block, hydrophilic surface modification is conducted using [[Plasma etcher|plasma etching]] techniques. Plasma treatment disrupts surface silicon-oxygen bonds, and a plasma-treated glass slide is usually placed on the activated side of the PDMS (the plasma-treated, now hydrophilic side with imprints). Once activation wears off and bonds begin to reform, silicon-oxygen bonds are formed between the surface atoms of the glass and the surface atoms of the PDMS, and the slide becomes permanently sealed to the PDMS, thus creating a waterproof channel. With these devices, researchers can utilize various surface chemistry techniques for different functions creating unique lab-on-a-chip devices for rapid parallel testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(05)00702-9 | last1 = Rogers | first1 = J.

PDMS can be [[cross-link]]ed into networks and is a commonly used system for studying the elasticity of polymer networks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} PDMS can be directly patterned by surface-charge lithography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning|author1=S.

PDMS is being used in the making of synthetic [[gecko adhesion]] dry adhesive materials, to date only in laboratory test quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/146885.php Inspired by Gecko Feet, UMass Amherst Scientists Invent Super-Adhesive Material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223092733/http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/146885.php |date=2012-02-23 }}. 16 Feb 2012, UMass Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[flexible electronics]] researchers use PDMS because of its low cost, easy fabrication, flexibility, and optical transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep01098| title = Flexible packaging of solid-state integrated circuit chips with elastomeric microfluidics| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 3| pages = 1098| year = 2013| last1 = Zhang | first1 = B. | last2 = Dong | first2 = Q. | last3 = Korman | first3 = C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine and cosmetics===
Activated dimethicone, a mixture of polydimethylsiloxanes and [[silicon dioxide]] (sometimes called [[simeticone|simethicone]]), is often used in [[over-the-counter drug]]s as an [[defoamer|antifoaming agent]] and [[carminative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FXXQzQ_zf0C&amp;pg=PA369|page=369|title=Techniques in musculoskeletal rehabilitation|author1=Prentice, William E.  |author2=Voight, Michael L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2001|isbn=0-07-135498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xhe2wLrSz58C&amp;pg=PA447|page=447|title=Helicobacter Pylori: Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Cure 1998|author1=Hunt, Richard H. |author2=Tytgat, G.

====Skin====
PDMS is used variously in the cosmetic and consumer product industry as well. For example, PDMS can be used in the treatment of [[head lice]] on the scalp&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dimethicone is used widely in skin-moisturizing lotions where it is listed as an active ingredient whose purpose is "skin protection." Some cosmetic formulations use dimethicone and related siloxane polymers in concentrations of use up to 15%. The [[Cosmetic Ingredient Review]]'s (CIR) Expert Panel, has concluded that dimethicone and related polymers are "safe as used in cosmetic formulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1091581803022S204|title=Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Stearoxy Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Methicone, Amino Bispropyl Dimethicone, Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, Amodimethicone Hydroxystearate, Behenoxy Dimethicone, C24-28 Alkyl Methicone, C30-45 Alkyl Methicone, C30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone, Cetearyl Methicone, Cetyl Dimethicone, Dimethoxysilyl Ethylenediaminopropyl Dimethicone, Hexyl Methicone, Hydroxypropyldimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethicone, Stearyl Dimethicone, Stearyl Methicone, and Vinyldimethicone|year=2003|journal=International Journal of Toxicology|volume=22|pages=11–35|pmid=14555417|last1=Nair|first1=B|author2=Cosmetic Ingredients Review Expert Panel|issue=2 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hair====
PDMS compounds such as amodimethicone, are effective conditioners when formulated to consist of small particles and be soluble in water or alcohol/act as surfactants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schueller, Randy |author2=Romanowski, Perry |title=Conditioning Agents for Hair and Skin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_ETtcJM_0gC|date=1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-1921-0|page= 273|quote=Amodimethicone is recognized for its extremely robust conditioning and for its ability to form clear products when used in high-surfactant shampoos. Amodimethicone is a useful ingredient in conditioners, gels, mousses, and permanents, but its use in shampoos has proved troublesome due to interactions between the cationic and the anionic surfactants, which can result in compatibility problems. However, the amodimethicone emulsion can be made compatible in high-surfactant-level shampoos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Goddard, E.

These "uncapped" amino- functional silicone compounds may be characterized by a linear or branched structure. In either case, amodimethicone polymers will undergo a condensation cure reaction during drying to form a somewhat durable elastomeric film on the hair, providing wet- and dry- combing benefits, lowering triboelectric charging effects, and increasing softness of the dry hair. They are excellent conditioning agents, often found in conditioners, mousses, [[setting lotion]]s, and less frequently in 2-in-l shampoos}}&lt;/ref&gt; (especially for damaged hair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iwata, Hiroshi |title=Formulas, Ingredients and Production of Cosmetics: Technology of Skin- and Hair-Care Products in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5miBgSRcD4cC|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-4-431-54060-1|page =144|quote=Amodimethicone is the most widely used amino-modified silicone.

===Foods===
PDMS is added to many cooking oils (as an antifoaming agent) to prevent oil splatter during the cooking process. As a result of this, PDMS can be found in trace quantities in many fast food items such as [[McDonald's]] [[Chicken McNuggets]], french fries, hash browns, milkshakes and smoothies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Domestic and niche uses ===
Many people are indirectly familiar with PDMS because it is an important component in [[Silly Putty]], to which PDMS imparts its characteristic viscoelastic properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluorous.com/journal/?p=86 Micro Total Analysis Systems, Silly Putty, and Fluorous Peptides]. fluorous.com. January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another toy PDMS is used in is [[Kinetic Sand]]. The rubbery, vinegary-smelling silicone caulks, adhesives, and aquarium sealants are also well-known. PDMS is also used as a component in [[silicone grease]] and other silicone based [[lubricant]]s, as well as in [[Defoamer|defoaming agents]], [[Release agent|mold release agents]], damping fluids, [[heat transfer]] fluids, polishes, [[cosmetics]], hair conditioners and other applications. PDMS has also been used as a filler fluid in [[breast implant]]s.

It can be used as a [[sorbent]] for the analysis of headspace ([[dissolved gas analysis]]) of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf010877x| pmid = 11804511| title = Headspace Sorptive Extraction (HSSE), Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE), and Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) Applied to the Analysis of Roasted Arabica Coffee and Coffee Brew| journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry| volume = 50| issue = 3| pages = 449| year = 2002| last1 = Bicchi | first1 = C. | last2 = Iori | first2 = C. | last3 = Rubiolo | first3 = P. | last4 = Sandra | first4 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and environmental considerations==
According to ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia'', no "marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment" have been noted for siloxanes. PDMS is nonbiodegradable, but is absorbed in waste water treatment facilities. Its degradation is catalyzed by various [[clay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Moretto, Hans-Heinrich; Schulze, Manfred and Wagner, Gebhard (2005) "Silicones" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3071">The '''Popular Liberation Front''' (Spanish: '''''Frente Popular Libertador''''', or '''FPL''') was a Guatemalan political party formed in 1944 largely patronized by the middle class{{sfn|Ameringer|1992|p=347}} and university students.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=34}} It was a part of the popular movement that overthrew dictator [[Jorge Ubico]] and began the [[Guatemalan Revolution]]. During this period, it was one of the two largest Guatemalan parties, the other being the [[National Renovation Party]] (PRN) led by teachers.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=27}} In Guatemala's first democratic elections in 1944, it joined a broad coalition of revolutionary parties to support the election bid of [[Juan José Arévalo]], but subsequently distanced itself from his government.{{sfn|Ameringer|1992|p=347}} In November 1945, it merged with the National Renovation Party to form the [[Revolutionary Action Party]] (PAR), but split from it eighteen months later. This split was partially the result of ideological differences, and partially the result of manipulations by Arévalo, who preferred to deal with a fractured opposition.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=39-40}} During the period that it was a part of the PAR, as well as in alliance with the PRN, it enjoyed a majority in the Guatemalan Congress for the entire presidential term of Juan José Arévalo, and until 1949, it was the largest of the parties involved in the Guatemalan Revolution.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=39-40}}

The FPL was also the most conservative of the revolutionary parties, until 1949. In that year the party split between those who supported the presidential candidacy of [[Francisco Javier Arana]], and those who opposed him. Arana's supporters left to form the "FPL Ortodoxo," or the Orthodox FPL.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=57-58}} In the 1950 election, the remainder of the FPL formally endorsed Víctor Manuel Giordani, but some party members defected to support Jorge García Granados, another moderate civilian, while still others supported [[Jacobo Árbenz]], the defence minister and the administration's candidate.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=74}} This infighting furthered the decline of the FPL.

'''Project No One Leaves''' (PNOL) is a [[Boston]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit]]  tenants' rights organization which provides legal education to people living in [[foreclosure|foreclosed homes]] to enable them to understand and protect their legal rights. The group was established in 2008 by members of the [[Harvard Legal Aid Bureau]] who specialized in housing law in response to a perceived spike in foreclosures and mass [[eviction]]s in low-income Boston neighborhoods.

==Organizational history==
===Establishment===

Project No One Leaves (PNOL) began in January 2008 with the establishment of a Foreclosure Task Force of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau by [[Harvard Law School]] students Nick Hartigan and David Haller.&lt;ref name="HLAB"&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/clinical/news/hallerhartigan.html "HLAB Students Stemming Foreclosure Crisis in Boston,"] Harvard Law School, Office of Pro Bono and Clinical Programs, www.law.harvard.edu/ Retrieved March 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of that same year Project No One Leaves was formally launched,&lt;ref name="HLAB" /&gt; with Hartigan and Haller being joined by Tony Borich, another Harvard student affiliated with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, the oldest student-run [[legal aid]] organization in the United States.&lt;ref name="McArdle"&gt;Elaine McArdle, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2010/winter/outside.php "Staunching the Foreclosure Crisis: ‘Project No One Leaves’ keeps people in their homes,"] ''Harvard Law Bulletin,'' Winter 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The trio were concerned about an uptick in foreclosures and evictions meted out against low-income Bostonians due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and set out to inform the occupants of foreclosed homes of their legal rights under the state laws of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="McArdle" /&gt;

Project No One Leaves makes use of newly filed foreclosures in the area to create a [[database]] of affected residences.&lt;ref name="McArdle" /&gt; Residents are then contacted in person by volunteers with the project, which include students at [[Harvard Law School]] and eight other Boston-area law schools and colleges,&lt;ref name="McArdle" /&gt; as well as undergraduates and members of concerned community groups. In 2009, more than 1,000 people living in foreclosed properties were contacted by Project No One Leaves and informed of their legal rights, with a view to helping keep victims of foreclosure in their own homes.&lt;ref name="McArdle" /&gt;

Canvassers encourage residents to attend meetings of [[City Life/Vida Urbana]] to meet others in similar straits and help interested individuals to make contact with Harvard Legal Aid's Foreclosure Task Force and other legal aid organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlegalaid.org/projects/foreclosure-task-force Foreclosure Task Force information page.] Retrieved March 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[grassroots]] contact enables [[lawsuit|legal action]] to be taken against those [[Mortgage law|mortgage-holders]] who are in violation of the law. Law students have won a series of cash settlements by those banks which have failed to keep the properties they hold in satisfactory condition for habitation.&lt;ref name="McArdle" /&gt;

Working together, Project No One Leaves volunteers, City Life community organizers, and other groups work to pressure banks holding foreclosed properties to resell the assets to community lender [[Boston Community Capital]] (BCC), which mortgages or sometimes rents them to the original occupants at the current deflated market rate.&lt;ref&gt;John Leland, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/us/22foreclose.html?dbk "Finding in Foreclosure a Beginning, Not an End,"] ''New York Times,'' March 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; BCC makes its money by charging a 25 percent premium on its purchase price.&lt;ref name=HomeTeam /&gt; Residents are thus allowed to stay in their current dwelling on a more affordable [[fixed-rate mortgage]], while banks are able to expeditiously turn over their foreclosed properties for somewhat more than they would typically expect.&lt;ref name=HomeTeam&gt;Sasha Abramsky, [http://www.thenation.com/article/161464/fighting-foreclosure-boston "The Boston Home Team: An Unlikely Grassroots Coalition is Fighting the City's Foreclosure Crisis One Property at a Time,"] ''The Nation,'' vol. 293, no. 1/2 (July 4/11, 2011), pp. 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13 months between May 2010 and June 2011, BCC purchased a total of 55 properties containing a total of 125 residential units.&lt;ref name=HomeTeam /&gt; Plans are in place for the future purchase and resale of hundreds of more homes, primarily in [[working class]] areas of Boston.&lt;ref name=HomeTeam /&gt;

===Growth===

Over its first three years of its existence, Project No One Leaves has grown, with additional chapters sprouting in Boston and elsewhere in the United States, including [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/nooneleavesmiami/ No One Leaves Miami official website], Retrieved March 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Project No One Leaves organized a national conference in which lawyers and [[community organizer]]s from 15 states came to Boston to learn about the foreclosure resistance model espoused by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2010/11/16_foreclosure-conference.html "Community Responses to the Foreclosure Crisis,"] November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National recognition===

The joint activities of Project No One Leaves and City Life have attracted national attention via the [[PBS News Hour]],&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lehrer (moderator), [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec10/foreclosures_10-19.html "Boston Group Helps Homeowners 'Stand Up, Fight Back' Against Foreclosure,"] air date: October 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Times]],''&lt;ref&gt;John Leland, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/us/22foreclose.html?dbk "Finding in Foreclosure a Beginning, Not an End,"] ''New York Times,'' March 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Public Radio]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen Brown, [http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-02-2011/no-one-leaves.html "No One Leaves Help for Struggling Homeowners to Avoid Foreclosure,"] February 22, 2011 (audio).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Bassett, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/foreclosure-fighters-boston_n_794096.html "Boston Foreclosure Fighters: Banks Are 'Deceptive In Hosts of Ways.'"] ''The Huffington Post,'' December 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Project No One Leaves has also received recognition from national housing organizations, such as the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, [http://www.nlchp.org/view_newsletter.cfm?id=68 ''In Just Times,"] vol. 9, no. 12 (December 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 Project No One Leaves founders Dave Haller and Nick Hartigan received the Outstanding Student Award from the [[Clinical Legal Education Association]] in recognition of their excellence in clinical legal work.&lt;ref name="HLAB" /&gt;

Project No One Leaves and Boston Community Capital saw their national stature further elevated in April 2010 when chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] [[Ben Bernanke]] cited their efforts as an example of how "local communities are meeting the challenges of tough times" in a public speech.&lt;ref name=HomeTeam /&gt;

'''Project Sapphire''' was a successful 1994 [[covert operation]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] in cooperation with the [[Government of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan government]] to reduce the threat of [[nuclear proliferation]] by removing nuclear material from the country as part of the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|Cooperative Threat Reduction Program]]. A warehouse at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant outside [[Oskemen|Ust-Kamenogorsk]] housed {{convert|1,322|lbs|kg}} of weapons grade [[enriched uranium]] to fuel [[Alfa class submarine]]s (90% U-235). Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the fuel was poorly documented and secured, and in danger of being sold for use in the construction of nuclear weapons. This mission stands as a successful attempt of a country secretly moving in to another country to protect them from the dangers of nuclear weapons left behind by the Soviet Union.

== Background ==
Careless nuclear testings in the northeast of [[Kazakhstan]] as a result of the [[Cold War]] and the [[arms race]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] resulted in the spread of [[Neuralgia|nuclear neuralgia]] amongst the countries citizens. The development of these health issues as well as the adoption of Gorbachev's [[glasnost]] campaign sparked a public anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan. The independence of Kazakhstan also saw the rise of leaders who sought to differentiate themselves from the former communist nation. Once a part of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], [[Kazakhstan]] was very reliant on relations with Russia in the 90's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-15|title=History of Kazakhstan|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Kazakhstan&amp;oldid=760186623|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With millions of ethnic Russians living in the country, leaders of Kazakhstan did not want to create trouble because of Russia's influence on their economics, factories, and technology. They also wanted to remove post-Soviet nuclear materials because Kazakhstan lacked the facilities and technical capacity to sustain nuclear weapons. Prior to the collapse of the USSR, Kazakhstan's first president [[Nursultan Nazarbayev|Nazarbayev]] announced that the country would be a non-nuclear state once it was admitted into the United Nations. In May 1992, Nazarbayev joined the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]]. Further conversations with America's president [[George H. W. Bush]] and senators [[Richard Lugar]] and [[Sam Nunn]] created stronger ties between Kazakhstan and America. Finally economics pushed Kazakhstan towards [[Nuclear proliferation|de-nuclearization]] because the country's large oil reserves could only be sourced by Western technology. Obtaining this western support would only be possible with non-nuclear proliferation and joining the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|NPT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/celebrating-the-success-project-sapphire-11709|title=Celebrating the Success of Project Sapphire|last=Courtney|first=William|date=21 November 2014|website=e.g. The National Interest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] (CTR) program was established in 1986 in order to minimize the threat of nuclear proliferation especially in Asia and the Soviet Union. The Nunn-Lugar Act was inspired and sponsored by Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar to take on Project Sapphire and dismantle nuclear weapons in Former Soviet blocs as showed in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-16|title=Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nunn%E2%80%93Lugar_Cooperative_Threat_Reduction&amp;oldid=780591326|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==
The fall of the [[Soviet Union]] left nuclear weapons materials spread across developing countries. Two United States Senators, [[Sam Nunn]] and [[Richard Lugar]], in office at the time, saw the importance of monitoring the location of these materials, so that they could help prevent [[nuclear proliferation]]. It was a fear that the lack of monitoring would result in the aid of underdeveloped or threatening countries that did not previously have access to this weapons grade materials. In the early 1990s, the two Senators were able to deduce a number of resources that [[Kazakhstan]] had because they became aware of the resources the Soviet Union had in the newly formed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=United States Government|first=|date=1996|title=Project Sapphire After Action Report|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB491/docs/01%20-%20After%20Action%20report%20DTRA.pdf|journal=After Action report DTRA|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan's [[Enriched uranium|HEU]] was left behind by a Soviet submarine project and there was enough of the material to fuel 24 atomic bombs. The uranium-235 was 90-91% enriched in pure metal form.

After months of preparation, 29 men and 2 women were recruited in October 1994 to embark on a covert mission to remove the uranium. On October 7, [[Bill Clinton]] signed a classified directive to approve the airlift-composed of 3 C-5 aircraft-to leave from Delaware's [[Dover Air Force Base]] to Kazakhstan. The team spent 12 hours a day from October 14 to November 11 packing up uranium (including seven different types of uranium some laced with toxic beryllium). The project had to be under extreme secrecy or the entire mission would have been compromised. The team found 1032 containers in the warehouse and repacked the material into 448 shipping containers. Bad weather set in and on the way to the airport the trucks carrying the HEU were almost compromised due to the ice and sleet. Finally the plane was loaded and flown for 20 hours (the longest flight for a C-5 in U.S. history) back to Delaware.

On November 23, 1994, the Clinton Administration announced that the uranium had been removed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/20/AR2009092002881_4.html?sid=ST2009092002315|title=How U.S. Removed Half a Ton of Uranium From Kazakhstan|date=2009-09-21|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Since Project Sapphire, HEU has been removed from 20 research reactors from various former Soviet bloc nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This project shows how through the United States' economic, diplomatic, and technical rescources, Kazakhstan was able to draw closer in its effort to become a Nonnuclear Weapons State.

The effects from Project Sapphire are seen today in U.S. foreign policy and trade. The U.S.'s nuclear clean out  programs, such as the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|CTR]], were vital to former Soviet countries such as Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine in that they prevented the proliferation of Post Soviet nuclear materials. Today there are currently 9 members in the [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear club]] including The United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/01/06/nine-nations-possess-nuclear-weapns/78350588/|title=The Nuclear Club: Who are the 9 members?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/project-sapphire-20-years-later-and-still-relevant/|title=Project Sapphire: 20 Years Later, and Still Relevant|last=Diplomat|first=Dena Sholk, The|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''Performance Anomalies'', the clandestine removal of [[weapons-grade uranium]] under Project Sapphire was not complete, resulting in a secret cache of uranium in [[Kazakhstan]] that attracts jihadis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4xrWxfC_DUC&amp;pg=PT179&amp;lpg=PT179&amp;dq=performance+anomalies+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YorVN8tCsp&amp;sig=tFr8qVZsq0MQ_6Yak1dhoOoYr2c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivmafOvujTAhXM1CYKHRHECXoQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20anomalies%20project&amp;f=false|title=Performance Anomalies: A Novel|last=Lee|first=Victor Robert|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Perimeter Six Press|isbn=9781938409202|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=R4xrWxfC_DUC&amp;pg=PT179&amp;lpg=PT179&amp;dq=performance+anomalies+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YorVN8tCsp&amp;sig=tFr8qVZsq0MQ_6Yak1dhoOoYr2c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivmafOvujTAhXM1CYKHRHECXoQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20anomalies%20proj]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">'''Santiphap Park''' ({{lang-th|สวนสันติภาพ}}, {{RTGS|''Suan Santiphap''}}, literally "Peace Park") is an {{convert|8|acre|km2|sing=on}} park in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. It is located between [[Ratchawithi Road]] and [[Rang Nam Road]] in [[Ratchathewi]] district.
[[Image:Map Ratchathewi.png|thumb|right|Location in green]]

The land on which Santiphap Park is built is leased from the [[Crown Property Bureau]] by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA). It was previously the site of subsidized housing overseen by the [[National Housing Authority (Thailand)|National Housing Authority]]. The BMA obtained a 30-year lease, beginning in October 1990. Construction on the park began in 1997.&lt;ref name="PPO"&gt;[http://203.155.220.217/office/ppdd/publicpark/thai/mainpark/T_Santiphap.html Suan Santiphap], Public Park Office, Department of Environment (in Thai). Retrieved on February 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santiphap Park was opened to the public on August 18, 1998. The name ''Santiphap'', meaning "peace", as well as the date of the park's opening, commemorate the end of [[World War II]], which took place 53 years earlier.&lt;ref name="PPO"/&gt;

The [[dove]] is the symbol of Santiphap Park. A [[black oxide|blackened]] bronze sculpture situated in the park's central pond depicts a dove carrying in its beak an olive branch with five blossoms, representing the spread of peace throughout the world. The sculpture is based on a drawing by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref name="PPO"/&gt;

The entrance signs to Santiphap Park are a facsimile of the handwriting of [[Buddhadasa|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu]], a renowned [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], philosopher and pacifist.&lt;ref name="PPO"/&gt;

Over 30 species of birds have been recorded in the park since its creation. Birds most often seen or heard there:  [[rock dove|rock pigeon]], [[spotted dove]], [[zebra dove]], [[plaintive cuckoo]], [[Asian koel|common koel]], [[coppersmith barbet]], [[Asian palm-swift]],  [[streak-eared bulbul]], [[black-naped oriole]], [[large-billed crow]], [[oriental magpie-robin]], [[Malaysian pied fantail|pied fantail]], [[black-collared starling]], [[Asian pied starling]], [[common myna]], [[great myna|white-vented myna]], [[olive-backed sunbird]],  [[scarlet-backed flowerpecker]], [[Eurasian tree sparrow]]. Common winter (October-March) visitors: [[barn swallow]], [[red-breasted flycatcher]], [[inornate warbler]]. Species which are seen there less often (but all year round): [[Chinese pond-heron]], [[little egret]], [[striated heron]], [[painted stork]], [[house swift]], [[common iora]], [[common tailorbird]], [[yellow-vented bulbul]], [[red-whiskered bulbul]], [[house sparrow]]. Less common winter visitors: [[ashy drongo]], [[brown shrike]]. In the wasteland on which the park was later constructed, [[white-breasted waterhen]], [[black-capped kingfisher]], and [[verditer flycatcher]] were also recorded. Much more unusually for central Bangkok,
[[orange-headed thrush]] and [[laced woodpecker]] have been recorded in a quieter condominium garden 50 m from the park.

The park contains a public address system which is used to broadcast a numbered list of park rules at 07:00, 08:00, 15:00, and 18:00; the national anthem at 08:00 and 18:00; and Thai music 07:00-10:00 and 15:00-18:00 most days. The rules and anthem are often audible from over a block away. Complaints by local residents have been ignored by the park management. The central circular paved area in the park is used for aerobics 18:00-18:45, weather permitting.

Santiphap Park is open from 05:00 until 21:00, and is used by 2-3,000 people on working days, and 3-4,000 on holidays.&lt;ref name="PPO"/&gt;

'''School choice''' is a term for [[K–12]] public education options in the [[United States]], describing a wide array of programs offering students and their families alternatives to [[Public school (government funded)|publicly provided schools]], to which students are generally assigned by the location of their family residence. In the United States, the most common—both by number of programs and by number of participating students—school choice programs are [[scholarship tax credit]] programs, which allow individuals or corporations to receive tax credits toward their state taxes in exchange for donations made to non-profit organizations that grant [[private school]] scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Choice Virtual Yearbook|url=http://www.createonline.com/Whats%20Inside.pdf|website=Alliance for School Choice|access-date=2014-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715002125/http://www.createonline.com/Whats%20Inside.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, a similar subsidy may be provided by the state through a [[school voucher]] program.  Other school choice options include open enrollment laws (which allow students to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] outside the district in which the students live), [[charter school]]s, [[magnet schools]], [[virtual schools]], [[homeschooling]], education savings accounts (ESAs), and individual tax credits or deductions for educational expenses.

==History==
Economist and [[Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] proposed in 1955 using [[free market]] principles to improve the [[Education in the United States|United States public school system]]. The practice had been that children were assigned a public school based on where their parents live, which public schools were funded by state and local taxes. Friedman proposed that parents should be able to receive those education funds in the form of [[School voucher|vouchers]], which would allow them to choose their children's schools, including both public and private, religious and non-religious options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/The-Friedmans/The-Friedmans-on-School-Choice/The-Role-of-Government-in-Education-(1995).aspx|title=The Role of Government in Education|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Friedman and his wife economist [[Rose Director Friedman]] founded the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, (now [[EdChoice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=33913|title=Friedman Foundation Calls for Tax Credits to Benefit K–12 Education|date=February 10, 2009|work=Inside Indiana Business|accessdate=12 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511122302/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=33913|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/rally-to-unite-public-310078.html|title=Rally to unite public, private groups that back vouchers|last=Dodd  |first=D.

The first use of school vouchers in the United States came in the form of state tuition grants provided by [[Virginia]]'s 1956 [[Stanley plan|Stanley Plan]], which financed white-only private schools known as [[segregation academies]]. Other states followed until the practice was disallowed by ''[[Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]'' (1964). While ''school choice'' has always implied school improvement, debates have regularly followed about the motivation and implementation.

==Forms==

=== Scholarship tax credits ===
{{main|Scholarship tax credit}}
States with scholarship tax credit programs grant individuals and/or businesses a credit, whether full or partial, toward their taxes for donations made to scholarship granting organizations (also called school tuition organizations). SGOs/STOs use the donations to create scholarships that are then given to help pay for the cost of tuition for students. These scholarships allow students to attend private schools or out-of-district public schools that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for many families. These programs currently exist in fourteen states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia in the [[#United States|United States]].&lt;ref name="School Choice Programs"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Choice Programs|url=http://www.edchoice.org/School-Choice/School-Choice-Programs|website=Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vouchers ===
{{main|School voucher}}
[[School voucher|Vouchers]] give students the opportunity to attend a private school of their choosing, secular or religious. This would be paid for by accessing all or part of the public funding set aside for their children’s education.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/|title=Types of School Choice - EdChoice|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charter schools ===
{{main|Charter school}}
Charter schools are independent public schools which are exempt from many of the state and local regulations which govern most public schools. These exemptions grant charter schools some autonomy and flexibility with decision-making, such as teacher union contracts, hiring, and curriculum. In return, charter schools are subject to stricter accountability on spending and academic performance. The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws, though they vary in how charter schools are approved. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, [[City Academy High School]], opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/ |title=Clinton touts success of public charter schools |date=2000-05-04 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821180747/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/ |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of charter schools has increased with the support of the Obama Administration. Under the Administration, the Department of Education has provided funding incentives to states and school districts that increase the number of charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=I. Frankenberg II. Siegel-Hawley III. Wang|first=I. Erica II. Genevieve III. Jia|year=2011|title=Choice without equity: Charter school segregation|url=|journal=Education policy analysis archive|volume=19|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhere between 22 and 26% of Dayton, Ohio children are in charter schools.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/12/02/index.html|title=Catholic schools: Victims of choice|last=Elliot|first=Scott|date=2005-12-02|publisher=Dayton Daily News|accessdate=2008-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905062647/http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/12/02/index.html|archivedate=2008-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest percentage in the nation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%), and Arizona. Almost one in four public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.

Charter schools can also come in the form of cyber charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like all charter schools, cyber charters are public schools, but they are free from some of the rules and regulations that conventional public schools must follow.

=== Magnet schools ===
{{main|Magnet school}}
[[File:MA Public High School District Open Enrollment Status by town.png|thumb|250px|The Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] allows the school committees of public school districts to have open enrollment policies. Towns in Massachusetts represented by the "School Choice Receiving District Status" (open enrollment status) of their public high school district for the 2016-2017 academic year. Towns represented in blue have school districts with an open enrollment policy for kindergarten through high school. Towns represented in purple have school districts with open enrollment only for specific grades. Towns represented in red have school districts with a closed enrollment policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/|title=School Choice - School Finance|website=www.doe.mass.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology, or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, some (but not all) magnet schools require a test to get in. Magnet schools are an example of open enrollment programs. Open enrollment refers to district or statewide programs that allow families to choose public schools other than the ones they are assigned. Intradistrict open enrollment programs allow school choice within a district. Interdistrict open enrollment allows families to choose schools outside the district in other districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2013|title=School Choice in the States: A Policy Landscape|url=|journal=Council of Chief State School Officers|volume=|pages=|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home schooling ===
{{main|Homeschooling}}
"Home education" or "home schooling" is instruction in a child's home, or provided primarily by a parent, or under direct parental control. Informal home education has always taken place, and formal instruction in the home has at times also been very popular. As public education grew in popularity during the 1900s, however, the number of people educated at home using a planned curriculum dropped. In the last 20 years, in contrast, the number of children being formally educated at home has grown tremendously, in particular in the United States. The laws relevant to home education differ throughout the country. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the federal government, about 1.1 million children were home educated in 2003.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/nhes/homeschool/|title=1.1 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2003|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''District of Choice'''

District of Choice is a program in California created during 1993, allowing any California public school district to enroll students outside district lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ab_19_cfa_930614_094114_asm_floor|title=Assembly Third Reading-AB19|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Chuck|website=Official California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Assembly|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To participate in the program, district governing boards only need to declare themselves a District of Choice and set a quota for how many transfer students to accept to participate in the program. School districts cannot discriminate among students to enroll, but can limit them through an unbiased lottery system. The program was created in response to several parent's concerns over the lack of choice of schools to enroll their children in. Currently 47 school districts and 10,000 students participate in the program, serving 5 percent of school districts and 0.2 percent of students in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3331|title=Evaluation of the School District of Choice Program|last=|first=|date=January 27, 2016|website=Legislative Analyst's Office|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education Savings Accounts ===
This variant of school choice allows the parent to withdraw their child out of the public or charter school, and receive a direct deposit of public funds into a government-authorized savings account. These funds are often distributed in the form of a debit card that can be used to pay for various services, such as private school tuition and fees, online programs, private tutoring, community college costs, higher education services, and other approved learning materials and services. ESA’s also acquire the ability to pay for a combination of public school courses and private services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/education-savings-account/|title=What is an Education Savings Account? - EdChoice|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax credit/deduction for educational expenses ===
Certain states allow parents to claim a tax credit or deduction as a means to provide relief for certain educational expenses. These can include private school tuition, textbooks, school supplies and equipment, tutoring, and transportation. Currently, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have such programs.&lt;ref&gt;The ABC's of School Choice, 2014 Ed., Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual Tax Credit and Deduction Option ===

*This form of choice abates the income tax for parents, so approved educational expenses are economical. Approved educational expenses include private school tuition, supplies, computers, books, tutors, and transportation.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tax credits: lowers the total a person owes on taxes

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tax deduction: reduces a persons total taxable income

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/how-do-k-12-education-tax-credits-deductions-work/|title=How Do K–12 Education Tax Credits and Deductions Work? - EdChoice|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online Learning ===
Online learning permits students to work with teachers and their courses over the internet. This can be used in cooperation with, or in place of traditional classroom instruction. The online learning can be also paid for by accessing ESA’s and vouchers.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Customized Learning ===
This form of tutelage is a student-tailored form of education. This form of instruction can have various combinations. For example, course choice programs, public school courses, and special education therapies can all be integrated into a students curriculum. There are a myriad of possibilities, especially as learning innovations continue to occur.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== Debate ==

=== Support ===
The goal of school choice programs is to give parents more control over their child's education and to allow parents to pursue the most appropriate learning environments for children. For example, school choice may enable parents to choose a school that provides religious instruction, stronger discipline, better foundational skills (including reading, writing, mathematics, and science), everyday skills (from handling money to farming), or other desirable foci.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Scott|author2=Janice Aurini |title=Exploring School Choice in Canada: Who Chooses What and Why|journal=Canadian Public Policy|date=Dec 2011|volume=37|issue=4|pages=459–477|doi=10.1353/cpp.2011.0047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gulosino&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulosino|first=Charisse|author2=Christopher Lubienski |title=School's strategic responses to competition in segregated urban areas: Patterns in school locations in Metropolitan Detroit|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|date=May 2011|volume=19|issue=13|pages=1–29|url=http://www.redalyc.org/src/inicio/ArtPdfRed.jsp?iCve=275019735013|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of voucher models of school choice argue that choice creates competition between schools for students. Schools that fail to attract students can be closed. Advocates of school choice argue that this competition for students (and the dollars that come with them) create a catalyst for schools to create innovative programs, become more responsive to parental demands, and to increase student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubienski|first=Christopher|author2=Jack Dougherty |title=Mapping Educational Opportunity: Spatial Analysis and School Choices|journal=American Journal of Education|date=August 2009|volume=115|issue=4|pages=485–491|doi=10.1086/599783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline Hoxby]] suggests that this competition increases the productivity of a school. Hoxby describes a productive school as being one that produces high student achievement for each dollar spent.&lt;ref name=Hoxby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoxby|first=Caroline M.|title=School Choice and School Productivity Could School Choice Be a Tide that Lifts All Boats?|journal=The Economics of School Choice|year=2003|pages=287–342|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c10091|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that this competition gives parents more power to influence their child's school in the school marketplace. Parents and students become the consumers and schools must work to attract new students with new programs. Parents also have the ability to punish schools that they judge to be inferior by leaving the 'bad' school for a better, more highly ranked school.&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, Claude and Andre Brassard.  "Education Governance in Canada, 1990-2003: Trends and Significance" ''Canadian Perspectives on the Sociology of Education''. Ed. Cynthia 	Levine-Rasky. Don Wells: Oxford University Press, 2009. 255-274.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents look for schools that will advocate for the needs of their child and if the school does not meet the needs required for that child, parents have the choice to find a school that will be more suitable.&lt;ref name=Bosetti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bosetti|first=Lynn|title=Determinants of School Choice: Understanding How Parents Choose Elementary Schools in Alberta|journal=Journal of Education Policy|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=4|pages=387–405|doi=10.1080/0268093042000227465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom to choose puts the consequences of good or bad choosing on the parents instead of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosetti|first=Lynn|year=2005|title=Public Education at a Crossroad|url=|journal=American Journal of Education|volume=11|pages=435–441|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument in favor of school choice is based on cost-effectiveness. Studies undertaken by the [[Cato Institute]] and other [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservative]] [[think tank]]s conclude that privately run education both costs less and produces superior outcomes compared to public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/new/09-03/09-02-03r.html |title=$5000 School Vouchers Would Give Most Students Access to Quality Private Schools |date=2003-09-02 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814125444/http://www.cato.org/new/09-03/09-02-03r.html |archive-date=2008-08-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa486.pdf |format=PDF|title=What Does a Voucher Buy? |date=2003-08-28 |last=Salisbury |first=David |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arizona&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=16478 |title=Arizona Private Schools Half as Expensive as Public Schools |last=Murray |first=Vicki |publisher=The Heartland Institute |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapolicy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Centers/education/policynote/04_milewski_publiceducation.html |title=K-12 Public Education Spending in Washington |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Washington Policy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821125957/http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Centers/education/policynote/04_milewski_publiceducation.html |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that since children from impoverished families almost exclusively attend D or F ranked public schools, school choice programs would give parents the power to opt their children out of poorly-performing schools assigned by zip code and seek better education elsewhere. Supporters say this would level the playing field by broadening opportunities for low-income students—particularly minorities—to attend high-quality schools that would otherwise be accessible only to higher-income families.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040829-114519-1566r.htm|title=12 million languish in failing public schools, report says|date=2004-08-29|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organisation Internationale pour le Droit à l'Education et la Liberté d'Enseignement (OIDEL), an international [[non-profit organization]] for the development of [[freedom of education]], maintains that the [[right to education]] is a fundamental [[human right]] which cannot exist without the presence of State benefits and the protection of individual liberties. According to the organization, freedom of education notably implies the freedom for parents to choose a school for their children without discrimination on the basis of finances. To advance freedom of education, OIDEL promotes a greater parity between public and private schooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OIDEL - A Presentation|url=http://www.oidel.ch/anglais/presentation/prospectus%20OIDEL%20anglais.pdf|publisher=Organisation Internationale pour le Droit à l'Education et la Liberté d'Enseignement|pages=1–2|format=Portable Document Format|accessdate=2009-04-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Teachers' unions in the United States are very opposed to school choice. School choice measures are criticized as [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]] in an under-regulated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/education/who-profiting-charters-big-bucks-behind-charter-school-secrecy-financial-scandal-and|title=Who Is Profiting From Charters?

Public school entities are chiefly concerned that these school choice measures are taking funding away from public schools and therefore depleting their already strained resources. Other opponents of certain school choice policies (particularly vouchers) have cited the [[Establishment Clause]] and individual state [[Blaine Amendment|Blaine amendments]], which forbid, to one degree or another, the use of direct government aid to religiously affiliated entities. This is of particular concern in the voucher debate because voucher dollars are often spent at [[parochial school]]s.

Some school choice measures are criticized by public school entities, organizations opposed to church-state entanglement, and self-identified liberal advocacy groups. Known plaintiffs who have filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of state sponsored school choice laws are as follows: School Boards Associations, Public School Districts, Federations for Teachers, Associations of School Business Officials, Education Associations/Associations of Educators (unions for public school teachers), the American Civil Liberties Union, Freedom From Religion Foundation, and People for the American Way.&lt;ref&gt;The ABC's of School Choice, 2014 Ed., The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that school choice programs reduce housing prices, and that they do so in high-performing districts more than in low-performing districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=Il Hwan|title=School choice, housing prices, and residential sorting: Empirical evidence from inter-and intra-district choice|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|date=May 2015|volume=52|pages=39–49|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2015.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregation in school choice models ===
School choice systems afford families the opportunity to choose where to enroll their child among all available schools in a district.  The policy is an alternative to neighborhood schools, which often assign low-income families to lower-performing schools and high-income families to higher performing, better-funded schools.  In theory, school choice should lead to less segregation by race and class than neighborhood school policies by allowing families to select schools outside their neighborhoods.  However, a closer look at the reality of school choice presents several ways in which the policy does not provide equal opportunities to all students.  A longitudinal interview study showed that families of lower socioeconomic status considered and eventually chose lower-performing schools than their higher-income peers.  Low-income families lacked the social networks and access to information to learn which schools were higher-performing, and sometimes a family's own history with school achievement affected their choice for their child.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, C. A. (2009). All Choices Created Equal? The Role of Choice Sets in the Selection of Schools. Peabody Journal of Education, 84(2), 191–208. http://doi.org/10.1080/01619560902810146&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of the current school choice models do not offer transportation to out-of-neighborhood schools, which discourages low-income families from selecting schools outside their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Betts, J. R., Rice, L. A., Zau, A. C., Tang, Y. E., &amp; Koedel, C. R. (2006). Does School Choice Work? Effects on Student Integration and Achievement. Public Policy Institute of California. http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_806JBR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies continue to support that choice schools are a contributing factor to racial segregation. A study conducted in 2006 examined the 22 largest school districts in the United States and findings suggested that there is more racial segregation in school districts with choice schools because public schools had less white students. It is important to note that there was a greater racial segregation between white and Hispanic students. This study found that there would be less segregation if students attended their school based on district boundaries &lt;ref&gt;Saporito, S., &amp; Sohoni, D. (2006). Coloring outside the lines: racial segregation in public schools and their attendance boundaries. ''Sociology of Education'', 79, 81-105.&lt;/ref&gt;. Magnet schools had a goal to help desegregate schools, but studies continue to highlight that school choice tends to be racially-based. For example, white parents were least likely to enroll their students in a school with a large population of African Americans &lt;ref&gt;Saporito, S. (2003). Private choices, public consequences: magnet school choice and segregation by race and poverty. ''Social Problems'', 50, 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;. This highlights the downfall of magnet schools being a choice school system to desegregate communities, because of the choices being made by parents. As more choice schools continue to replace public schools in the district, the problem of racial segregation is still prevalent if educational equity and opportunity remain a goal in the United States school system. 

For the California School District of Choice program, analysis from the California State Assembly demonstrates possible evidence that the program is excluding low-income students and increasing racial segregation. A report from the legislature lists several Districts of Choice accepting Black, Latino, and low-income students at lower percentages than the city or the student's original district demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly Third Reading-AB185. ''California Legislative Information''. California State Assembly. Retrieved from August 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature found that Latino students consist of 66 percent of students enrolling in original districts, while only 32 percent transfer to Districts of Choice. During the program's inception, a budget was provided for transportation, but the budget currently does not exist and some Districts of Choice do not pick up that extra cost. Critics argue that the lack of transportation creates a barrier for low income students to enter the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oakparktalon.org/4512/news/district-of-choice-bill-moves-through-state-legislature/|title=District of Choice bill moves through state legislature|last=Burt|first=Nick|work=Talon|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several school districts have sued Districts of Choice over concerns of accepting and excluding specific demographics.

Charter schools are another example of school choice. Parents can opt out of their traditional public school to attend a charter, regardless of school district.  Charters are significantly more segregated than their traditional public school counterparts.&lt;ref name="Frankenberg, E. 2011"&gt;Frankenberg, E., Siegel-hawley, G., &amp; Wang, J. (2011). Choice without equity: charter school segregation.  Education Policy Analysis Archives, 19(1), 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive study using three national data sources on schools in the United States examined the enrollment characteristics of charter schools as opposed to traditional public schools. The study found that Black students are over-enrolled in charters nationally, and the same is true for Latino students in metro areas.  In a majority of states, at least half of the Latino and Black students in charters are in intensely segregated minority schools (90–100% minority.)  Conversely, in diverse parts of the West and the South, charters serve racially isolated white populations.  Charters also enroll a higher percent of low-income students than public schools nationally.&lt;ref name="Frankenberg, E. 2011" /&gt;

The next question we must answer is why school choice systems and charter schools are more racially segregated.  One theory is that because choice systems allow parents to select their own school, any differing priorities between racial groups would cause some schools to be more appealing to black families, others to white families, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;Kleitz, B., Weiher, G. R., Tedin, K., &amp; Matland, R. (2000). Kleitz.pdf. Social Science Quarterly, 81(3), 846–854.&lt;/ref&gt;  While no racial differences in school preferences have been found through self-report, to truly examine parental motivations, we must also look at behaviors. This idea was examined in a group of parents who had switched their children out of the traditional public school and into a charter.  A survey was paired with an analysis of the characteristics of the school that each family left, and the characteristics of the charter school where the family then placed their child.  These results showed that regardless of stated preferences, parents chose to place their students in schools where they would have more classmates of their own race, even if this meant placing the child in a school with lower test scores.  This effect was the same across White, Black and Latino families.  However, this trend was seen only in choosing elementary and middle schools, not at the high school level.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, D. R. (2007). The Impact of School Choice on Racial Segregation in Charter Schools. Educational Policy, 22(6), 805–829. http://doi.org/10.1177/0895904807310043&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiher, G. R., &amp; Tedin, K. L. (2002). Does Choice Lead to Racially Distinctive Schools? Charter Schools and Household Preferences. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 21(1), 79–92. http://doi.org/10.1002/pam.1041&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it appears that parents are moving to more racially segregated schools, these choices are not necessarily motivated by race.   Instead, parents may be influenced by the location of the school.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Jacobs, N. (2013). Understanding School Choice: Location as a Determinant of Charter School Racial, Economic, and Linguistic Segregation. Education and Urban Society, 45(4), 459–482. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124511413388&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar study, the proximity of the school to the family's home was found to be a significant predictor of school choice.  The author suggests, then, that the segregation found in charter schools is not due to a parental bias towards racially homogeneous schools.  Instead, segregation in school choice programs is a reflection of the deeply segregated neighborhoods in our country, and the fact that parents want their child's school to be close to home.&lt;ref name="doi.org" /&gt; Another study was conducted in Washington D.C. with 11,000 students in reference to the proximity theory of school choice. This study supported parents’ choice for schools based on school proximity, which is contrary to the belief that they choose schools based on academic scores. When parents choose schools based on what school is closest to them, it fosters racial segregation through economic means due to surrounding schools in a wealthy neighborhood versus people residing in a low- income neighborhood &lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, N. (2011). Understanding school choice: location as a determinant of charter school racial, economic, and linguistic segregation. ''Education and Urban Society'', 45, 459-482. 

doi: 10.1177/0013124511413388    &lt;/ref&gt;. This racial segregation stems from a systems level as to why more choice schools are being placed in neighborhoods with higher SES (socioeconomic status) and the determinants for these specific choice school placements.

Finally, it is important to consider the ramifications of a system that is significantly more racially segregated than traditional public schools. In an ethnographic study of three California charters serving populations segregated by race and class, the majority Black and Latino schools suffered from fewer financial resources.  These schools received less financial support from families, and had to fund services for their students that families from the majority white school paid for on their own, such as school supplies or emotional counseling. Additionally, teachers in the lower-income, minority segregated schools had less training and fewer resources.  One result of this was that frustrated teachers were more likely to attribute difficulties to negative student characteristics and the values of the child's family.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, K. (2008). To Have and to Have Not: The Socioeconomics of Charter Schools. Education and Urban Society, 41(2), 248–279. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124508325674&lt;/ref&gt; Black and Latino students have also been shown to have significantly lower achievement gains on standardized testing when in schools with high minority populations, based on a correlational study using No Child Left Behind data.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, D. N. (2006). Lost Learning, Forgotten Promises: A National Analysis of School Racial Segregation, Student Achievement, and Controlled Choice Plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
The broad effect of school choice and charter schools is to increase race and class segregation in schools.  This isolation creates environments in schools that do not reflect the make-up of the United States, and prevent students from being exposed to peers of different races or cultures.  More research is needed to examine how racially and economically segregated schools affect students' attitudes towards other races and classes. It is also important to remember that even some schools with diverse populations do not function as such: many highly "integrated" schools are in fact heavily tracked, with disproportionately fewer students of color in advanced tracks.  The real work ahead is to devise a system to functionally integrate schools so that students of all races and classes have access to equally successful schools, advanced courses, and preparation for higher education.

==International overview and major institutional options==

=== Finland ===
{{main|Education in Finland}}

The basic compulsory [[education|educational system]] in [[Finland]] is the nine-year [[comprehensive school]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''peruskoulu'', [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] ''grundskola'', "basic school"), for which school attendance is mandatory ([[homeschooling#Finland|homeschooling]] is allowed, but extremely rare). There are no so-called "gifted" programs. The more able children are expected to help those who are slower to catch on.

=== France ===
{{Main|Education in France}}
The [[France|French]] government subsidizes most private primary and secondary schools, including those affiliated with religious denominations, under contracts stipulating that education must follow the same curriculum as public schools and that schools cannot discriminate on grounds of religion or force pupils to attend religion classes.

This system of ''école libre'' (Free Schooling) is mostly used not for religious reasons, but for practical reasons (private schools may offer more services, such as after-class tutoring) as well as the desire of parents living in disenfranchised areas to send their children away from the local schools, where they perceive that the youth are too prone to delinquency or have too many difficulties keeping up with schooling requirements that the educational content is bound to suffer. The threatened repealing of that status in the 1980s triggered mass street demonstrations in favor of the status. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Sweden ===
{{Main|Education in Sweden}}
Sweden reformed its school system in 1992.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Free to choose, and learn | publisher = The Economist | date = 2007-05-03 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9119786 | accessdate = 2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its system of school choice is one of the freest in the world, allowing students to use public funds for the publicly or privately run school of their choice, including religious and for-profit schools.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt; Fifteen years after the reform, private school enrollment had increased from 1% to 10% of the student population.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

=== Chile ===
{{Main|Education in Chile}}
In [[Chile]], there is an extensive voucher system in which the state pays private and municipal schools directly, based on average attendance (90% of the country students utilize such a system). The result has been a steady increase in the number and recruitment of private schools that show consistently better results in [[standardized test]]ing than municipal schools. The reduction of students in municipal schools has gone from 78% of all students in 1981, to 57% in 1990, and to less than 50% in 2005.

Regarding vouchers in Chile, researchers have found that when controls for the student's background (parental income and education) are introduced, the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McEwan|first=Patrick J.|author2=Martin Carnoy |date=Fall 2000|title=The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Private Schools in Chile's Voucher System|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=22|issue=3|pages=213–239|doi=10.3102/01623737022003213}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also greater variation within each subsector than between the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mizala|first=Alejandra |author2=Pilar Romaguera |title=Determinación de Factores Explicativos de los Resultados Escolares en Educación Media en Chile|publisher=Centre for Applied Economics, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Chile|date=August 2000|series=Economy Series No. 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

A variety of forms of school choice exist in the United States. It is a highly debatable subject because some people wish to use taxpayer dollars in order to allow low-income students the choice of a private schools by way of vouchers. Research has shown that the students who transfer do worse in math and reading than their public school counterparts; not until an average of four years in the voucher program do the transfer students show to be performing equal to their counterparts in the public education system.

====Scholarship tax credits====
Scholarship tax credit programs currently exist in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia.&lt;ref name="School Choice Programs"/&gt;

Arizona has a well-known and fast-growing tax credit program. In the Arizona Individual Private School Tuition Tax Credit Program, in accordance with A.R.S. §43-1089&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/43/01089.htm&amp;Title=43&amp;DocType=ARS|title=Format Document|website=www.azleg.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and §1089.03,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/43/01089-03.htm&amp;Title=43&amp;DocType=ARS|title=Format Document|website=www.azleg.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals can claim up to $1,053 and couples filing joint returns can claim up to $2106 (for 2014, amounts are indexed annually).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/SchoolTaxCreditsforIndividuals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 24,000 children received scholarships in the 2011-2012 school year. Since the program has started in 1998, over 77,500 taxpayers have participated in the program, providing over $500 million in scholarship money for children at private schools across the state.&lt;ref&gt;Private School Tuition Organization Income Tax Credits In Arizona: A Summary of Activity FY 2013. Arizona Department of Revenue, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arizona program was challenged in court in ''[[Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn|ACSTO v Winn]]'' by a group of state taxpayers on the grounds that the tax credit violated the First Amendment because the tuition grants could go to students who attend private schools with religious affiliations.&lt;ref name=scotus&gt;Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn et al. 987 U.S. 9 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was initially brought against the state until the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization (ACSTO), one of the largest School Tuition Organizations in the state, voluntarily stepped in to represent the defense with the help of the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (formerly Alliance Defense Fund).  Typically, taxpayers are not allowed to bring suit against the government regarding how taxes are spent because injury would be purely speculative. In addition, insomuch as a donation to a School Tuition Organization is still a charitable act, just like any donation to a charity, there would be no standing unless all charitable deduction programs nationwide were brought under scrutiny. The Court ruled 5-4 to let the tax credit program stand.&lt;ref name=scotus/&gt; In April 2011, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that a majority of American voters (60%) felt that the tax credits support school choice for parents whereas 26% felt as it the tax credits support religion.&lt;ref name=FDU&gt;[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind Poll [http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2011/taxcredits/ "Public Blesses Arizona Christian School Tuition"] press release (April 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iowa, the Educational Opportunities Act was signed into law in 2006, creating a pool of tax credits for eligible donors to student tuition organizations (STOs).  At first, these tax caps were $5 million but in 2007, Governor [[Chet Culver]] increased the total amount to $7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/iac/rule/11-26-2014.701.42.32.pdf|title=School tuition organization tax credit|last=|first=|date=|website=iowa.gov|publisher=Iowa Department of Revenue|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iowa Alliance for Choice in Education]] (Iowa ACE) oversees the STOs and advocates for school choice in Iowa.

Greater Opportunities for Access to Learning (GOAL) is the Georgia program which offers a state income tax credit to donors of scholarships to private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://romenews-tribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-%20&amp;id=4152577-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-&amp;instance=home_news|title=GOAL to aid private schools, donors: Saturday is the deadline for a tax break to benefit schools and their contributors.|last=Bell|first=Daniel|date=October 27, 2009|work=Rome News-Tribune|accessdate=2009-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715201729/http://romenews-tribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-%20&amp;id=4152577-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-&amp;instance=home_news|archive-date=2011-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Greg, [https://www.npr.org/2012/08/15/158691518/tax-credit-scholarships-reignite-voucher-debate "Tax Credit Scholarships Reignite Voucher Debate"], [[NPR]] ''All Things Considered'', August 15, 2012.

====Vouchers====

Vouchers currently exist in Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Indiana and, most recently, the District of Columbia&lt;ref name=heritage2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/bg1848.cfm|title=Choices in Education: 2005 Progress Report|last=Kafer|first=Krista|date=2005-04-25|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907094551/http://heritage.org/Research/Education/bg1848.cfm|archive-date=2008-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgia.

The largest and oldest Voucher program is in Milwaukee. Started in 1990, and expanded in 1995, it currently allows no more than 15% of the district's public school enrollment to use vouchers. As of 2005 over 14,000 students use vouchers and they are nearing the 15% cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/SchoolChoice/Wisconsin.cfm|title=School Choice - Wisconsin|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919004716/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/SchoolChoice/Wisconsin.cfm|archive-date=2008-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School vouchers are legally controversial in some states. In 2014 a lawsuit sought to challenge the legality of the Florida voucher program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-school-voucher-lawsuit-20140828-story.html|title=Lawsuit calls Florida voucher program unconstitutional|first=Leslie|last=Postal|website=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the legal and moral precedents for vouchers may have been set by the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. bill]], which includes a voucher program for university-level education of veterans.{{synthesis|date=January 2015}} The G.I. bill permits veterans to take their educational benefits at religious schools, an extremely divisive issue when applied to primary and secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', 536 U.S. 639 (2002), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that school vouchers could be used to pay for education in sectarian schools without violating the Establishment Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. As a result, states are basically free to enact voucher programs that provide funding for any school of the parent's choosing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The Supreme Court has not decided, however, whether states can provide vouchers for secular schools only, excluding sectarian schools. Proponents of funding for parochial schools argue that such an exclusion would violate the free exercise clause. However, in ''[[Locke v. Davey]]'', 540 U.S. 712 (2004), the Court held that states could exclude majors in "devotional theology" from an otherwise generally available college scholarship. The Court has not indicated, however, whether this holding extends to the public school context, and it may well be limited to the context of individuals training to enter the ministry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

====Charter schools====
The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, City Academy, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Dayton, Ohio has between 22–26% of all children in charter schools.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; This is the highest percentage in the nation. Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%) and the State of Arizona. Almost 1 in 4 public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.

Charter schools can also come in the form of Cyber Charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like charter schools, they are public schools, but free of many of the rules and regulations that public schools must follow.

====Magnet schools====
{{main|Magnet school}}
Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, the students must test into the school.

====Home schooling====
{{main|Homeschooling}}
The laws relevant to homeschooling differ between US states. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the Federal Government, about 1.1 million children were Home Educated in 2003.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"/&gt;

====College====
The United States has school choice at the university level. College students can get subsidized tuition by attending ''any'' public college or university within their state of residence. Furthermore, the U.S. federal government provides tuition assistance for both public and private colleges via the [[G.I. Bill]] and federally guaranteed [[student loans]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">{{Other uses|Power index (disambiguation){{!}}Power index}}
The '''Shapley–Shubik power index''' was formulated by [[Lloyd Shapley]] and [[Martin Shubik]] in 1954 to measure the powers of players in a voting game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapley |first=L. S. |first2=M. |last2=Shubik |title=A Method for Evaluating the Distribution of Power in a Committee System |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=787–792 |year=1954 |doi=10.2307/1951053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The index often reveals surprising power distribution that is not obvious on the surface.

The constituents of a voting system, such as legislative bodies, executives, shareholders, individual legislators, and so forth, can be viewed as players in an [[n-player game|''n''-player game]]. Players with the same preferences form coalitions. Any coalition that has enough votes to pass a bill or elect a candidate is called winning, and the others are called losing. Based on [[Shapley value]], Shapley and Shubik concluded that the power of a coalition was not simply proportional to its size.

The power of a coalition (or a player) is measured by the fraction of the possible voting sequences in which that coalition casts the deciding vote, that is, the vote that first guarantees passage or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hu |first=Xingwei |title=An Asymmetric Shapley–Shubik Power Index |journal=International Journal of Game Theory |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–240 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s00182-006-0011-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power index is normalized between 0 and 1. A power of 0 means that a coalition has no effect at all on the outcome of the game; and a power of 1 means a coalition determines the outcome by its vote. Also the sum of the powers of all the players is always equal to 1.

There are some algorithms for calculating the power index, e.g., dynamic programming techniques, enumeration methods and Monte Carlo methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Matsui  | first1 = Tomomi  | last2 = Matsui  | first2 = Yasuko  | title = A Survey of Algorithms for Calculating Power Indices of Weighted Majority Games | journal = J. Oper. Res. Soc. Japan  | volume = 43 | issue = 1  | pages =  71–86  | year = 2000 | url = http://www.orsj.or.jp/~archive/pdf/e_mag/Vol.43_01_071.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Suppose decisions are made by majority rule in a body consisting of A, B, C, D, who have 3, 2, 1 and 1 votes, respectively. The majority vote threshold is 4. There are [[Factorial|4!]] = 24 possible orders for these members to vote:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A'''B'''CD
| A'''B'''DC
| A'''C'''BD
| A'''C'''DB
| A'''D'''BC
| A'''D'''CB
|-
| B'''A'''CD
| B'''A'''DC
| BC'''A'''D
| BC'''D'''A
| BD'''A'''C
| BD'''C'''A
|-
| C'''A'''BD
| C'''A'''DB
| CB'''A'''D
| CB'''D'''A
| CD'''A'''B
| CD'''B'''A
|-
| D'''A'''BC
| D'''A'''CB
| DB'''A'''C
| DB'''C'''A
| DC'''A'''B
| DC'''B'''A
|}
For each voting sequence the pivot voter – that voter who first raises the cumulative sum to 4 or more – is bolded. Here, A is pivotal in 12 of the 24 sequences. Therefore, A has an index of power 1/2. The others have an index of power 1/6. Curiously, B has no more power than C and D. When you consider that A's vote determines the outcome unless the others unite against A, it becomes clear that B, C, D play identical roles. This reflects in the power indices.

Suppose that in another majority-rule voting body with &lt;math&gt;2n+1&lt;/math&gt; members, in which a single strong member has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; votes and the remaining &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; members have one vote each. It then turns out that the power of the strong member is &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{k}{2n+2-k}&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; increases, the strong member's power increases disproportionately until it approaches half the total vote and this person gains virtually all the power. This phenomenon often happens to large shareholders and business takeovers.

== Applications ==
The index has been applied to the analysis of voting in the [[Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varela|first=Diego|last2=Prado-Dominguez|first2=Javier|date=2012-01-01|title=Negotiating the Lisbon Treaty: Redistribution, Efficiency and Power Indices|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/fau/aucocz/au2012_107.html|journal=Czech Economic Review|volume=6|issue=2|pages=107–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thaba 'Nchu''' is a town in [[Free State (province)|Free State]], [[South Africa]], located 60&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Bloemfontein]] and 17&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Botshabelo]]. The population is largely made up of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] and [[Sotho people]]. The town was settled in the 1830s and officially established in 1873. The town grew larger following the 1913 [[Natives' Land Act]] that stated Thaba 'Nchu as a [[Bantustan|homeland]] for Tswana people. It was known among the [[Voortrekkers]] as '''Blesberg''' (blazed mountain, bald mountain).&lt;ref name=dosapn&gt;{{cite book|last=Raper|first=Peter E.|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names|url=https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n80/mode/2up|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=28 August 2013|page=80|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Moroka II, chief of the Boo-Seleka section of the Barolong, [[human migration|migrated]] here in 1833. A decade earlier, his clan was driven from their land of origin, over the [[Vaal River|Vaal]], by [[Mzilikazi]], and sojourned at Motlhanapitse, in what is now the western [[Free State (province)|Free State]]. Upon reaching an agreement with king [[Moshoeshoe I]], they settled at Thaba 'Nchu, where their numbers were augmented by other Barolong scattered by Mzilikazi.&lt;ref name = Plaatje&gt;{{Cite book| last = Plaatje | first = Sol T. | authorlink = | title = Native Life in South Africa | chapter= Chapter VIII, At Thaba Ncho: A Secretarial Fiasco| publisher = | location = | year = 1916 | page = | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1452/pg1452.html | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Batswana people accepted the [[Voortrekkers]] as allies. The first Voortrekkers to stay here on their northward journeys were [[Louis Tregardt]] and [[Lang Hans van Rensburg|Hans van Rensburg]]. Thaba 'Nchu subsequently became a safe meeting place for leaders such as [[Hendrik Potgieter]], [[Piet Uys]] and [[Gerrit Maritz]].

After Potgieter's trek was attacked and plundered at [[Battle of Vegkop|Vegkop]], Moroka II swiftly assisted him with draught oxen and a liberal provision of supplies.&lt;ref name = Plaatje/&gt; The [[Boer]] party was also assisted in returning to a refugee camp at Thaba 'Nchu, named "Moroka's Hoek". The Boer leader held a war council with the Barolong chiefs, Moroka and Tauana, where a Boer-Barolong-Griqua allegiance was formed, which shortly routed Mzilikazi, who then founded the kingdom of [[Matabeleland]].&lt;ref name = Plaatje/&gt;  

Thaba 'Nchu was considered a friendly native state of the boer-governed [[Orange Free State]], established in 1854. It, however, became an insular territory during the [[Free State–Basotho War|Basotho Wars]], during which the Basotho were expelled from its vicinity.&lt;ref name = Plaatje/&gt; 

In the [[apartheid]] era, it formed part of the area set aside for the [[bantustan]] of [[Bophuthatswana]], nominally ruled by the then President [[Lucas Mangope]]. It was then a trading centre. Following the establishment of a hotel and casino by [[Sun International]] during that time, it has become a major tourist attraction in the Free State, due to its proximity to [[Bloemfontein]].

==Geography==
Geographical features include the promontories of the [[Lesotho]] mountains, suitable for large lands with ample game, wherein a game reserve, the [[Maria Moroka Nature Reserve]], has been maintained. A variety of wildlife and bird species are found here, besides a hiking trail, a traditional Tswana site, and amenities for various activities and adventures in the reserve. The reserve has been named after the political town hero Dr. Maria Moroka. Much of the surrounding land is arable, which has been employed for large scale farming of both commercial and domestic nature. The town is also known for the Aran hand-knitted woolen garments made by local craftspeople.

'''''The Oil Factor''''', alternatively known as '''Behind the War on Terror''', is an approximately 90 minute 2004 movie written and directed by [[Gerard Ungerman]] and [[Audrey Brohy]], narrated by [[Ed Asner]]. The documentary analyzes the development of some global events since the beginning of the century (especially after the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]]) from the perspective of [[oil]] and oil-abundant regions.

The documentary aspires to bring an untraditional point of view over the reasons, aspects and motives of this war and the direction of current US foreign policy.

==Interviews==
Respondents, featuring in the ''Oil Factor'', include:
*[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], former US [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] adviser
*[[Noam Chomsky]], professor at [[MIT]]
*[[Gary Schmitt]], executive director of the [[Project for a New American Century]]
*[[Paul Bremer]], temporary ([[Iraq]]i) coalition leader
*[[Karen Kwiatkowski]], retired military adviser in [[The Pentagon]]
*[[Azees Al-Hakim]], member of current Iraqi government
*Michael C. Ruppert, author of ''From the Wilderness'', studying the [[peak oil]] issue (among others)
*[[Randa Habib]], director of the [[France|French]] [[press agency]] in [[Jordan]]
*Gen. Piérre-Marie Gallois, energy-strategy analyst
*David Mulholland, editor of magazine focused on military technology
*[[Ahmed Rashid]], author of ''The Taliban'' book

==Locations==
The filmmakers were shooting in several locations of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Iraq]] (besides the United States), interviewing local people or local authorities mostly on the influences and ramifications of the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and president [[George Walker Bush|Bush's]] 'spreading of [[democracy]]' in the respective regions.

==Introductory presupposition==
During the film, spectator is given some prepositions and [[axiom]]s that become a basis for film authors' argumentation, such as:
*[[Oil]] is indispensable in every aspect of our modern-way lives.
*World [[food production]] is 95% dependent on [[hydro-carbon]] [[energy]].
*Demand for oil is and will be growing as new markets (e.g. India and China) gains in strength and local consumers start to demand higher life standard.
*3/4 are the world's oil discoveries located in [[Middle East]], as well as the ratio of the volume of oil needed to be imported to the United States.
*From 2010 on, economies of some continents or world regions will run out of oil and that will make them utterly dependent on foreign oil supply. The film says: "The reality is, however, that major conflicts are likely to erupt before any of these players actually runs out of oil."

==Argumentation==
On the basis of these presuppositions, the film tries to seek a step taken in the name of US foreign policy from this point of view. It relies to the motives of the United States of 2000 to build new military bases in the Middle East for the sake of increase of their strategical power. It comes to conclusion that the best candidate to this was [[Iraq]] as the country with second biggest storages of oil and its military paralyzed by dozen years of bombing on a weekly basis. The possibility to potentially stop oil export from this country equals the political power in the region (according to David Mulholland).

Oil Factor is also skeptical about consequences of all current war both on local inhabitants and American soldiers.

==Iraq==
The documentary first analyzes the development of support of Iraqi citizens that showed exacerbation approximately year and half after the invasion. It also touches the issue of 320+ [[ton]]s of American munition made of [[depleted uranium]] since the first [[Gulf War]] and its consequences to local inhabitants, as well as the discrepancy of [[Paul Bremer]]'s pledge to provide truly democratic elections with choosing representatives with pro-American who represent neither the [[Shiites]] majority nor [[Islam]]ists as such. According to [[Shiites]] (present in neighboring [[Iran]], current economic US enemy) it mentions the [[Iran-Contra affair]] of 1979 and Shiite support of the [[Hezbollah]] as an aspect the United States "will not tolerate".

==Afghanistan==
[[Image:Oil-factor-afghanistan.png|thumb|315px]]
The part dedicated to the invasion to [[Afghanistan]] ([[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]), introduced by the film as a "war virtually forgotten by media" begins with a rhetoric question of why the coalition units invaded the "extremely poor and desolated country" and why this military operation, allegedly waged for capturing [[Osama bin Laden]] and other [[Al Qaeda]] members, involves such vast concentration of American military technologies and building big permanent military bases, supposing this [[search and destroy]] mission would last for decades.

The documentary answers this question via [[Ahmed Rashid]] - according to his reasoning the clandestine reason is upcoming struggle for dwindling energy sources like oil and natural gas, abundantly present in the area of [[Central Asia|Central-Asian]] states - [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] a [[Kazakhstan]]. The players of this struggle are Russia, China and the [[United States of America]]. While both China and Russia neighbors with at least some of the mentioned countries, USA do not and if they want to import Central-Asian oil or gas, they have to establish a pipeline to the [[Indian ocean]]. Such pipeline would have to run over [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. While Pakistani authorities would not object the construction, Afghan [[Taliban]] members and local warlords embody a peril of the intact existence of the pipeline.

==American presence in oil-rich regions==
In the last part of Oil Factor, the filmmakers go in for coalition (and especially US) soldiers, negatively acknowledge media campaigns to aid to recruit another young American men to join [[US Army]] and object that clandestine agents are best known and verified way to fight [[terrorism]], instead of huge conventional waging of war.
[[Karen Kwiatkowski]] concludes: "If you draw a map that connects the dots between all of the bases that we have done since the [[Cold War]] ended, what You see is American military [[hegemony]] - covering 90 per cent of global energy resources."

{{hatnote|"Tipline" redirects here. For the infrastructure project, see [[Trans-Israel pipeline]].}}
A '''tip''', in [[law enforcement]], is a piece of information regarding a [[crime]] or other activity of interest to law enforcement, usually by a source outside of the law enforcement agency. A tip might provide law enforcement personnel with a direction to pursue in the investigation of a crime, and it might be made [[Anonymity|anonymously]], or by a known source whom the recipient might have reason to trust or distrust. In [[United States law]], by itself, a tip generally does not provide [[probable cause]] to make an arrest or perform a search of someone's property, but it may be a factor contributing to probable cause if [[corroborating evidence]] can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Kären Hess, Christine Hess Orthmann, ''Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice'' (2011), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many law enforcement agencies maintain a '''tip line''' to enable citizens to report suspicious activities generally, or to provide information about a particular crime currently under investigation.

'''Uttar Pradesh NRHM Scam''' is an alleged corruption scandal in the [[India]]n state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in which top politicians and bureaucrats are alleged to have siphoned off a massive sum estimated at {{INRConvert|100|b}}&lt;ref name=nie320874&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article320874.ece | title=Mayawati misused funds for rural health: PM | newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] | date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[National Rural Health Mission]], a central government program meant to improve [[health care delivery]] in rural areas. At least five people are said to have been murdered in an attempt to coverup large-scale irregularities.&lt;ref name=nie320874/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv176980&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/fifth-man-dead-in-ups-rural-health-fund-scam-176980 | title=Fifth man dead in UP's rural health fund scam | website=[[NDTV]] | date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several former ministers of then ruling party, [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] have been investigated by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]&lt;ref name=ie892257&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/nrhm-scam-2-former-up-ministers-to-appear-before-cbi/892257/ | title=NRHM scam: 2 former UP ministers to appear before CBI | newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] | date=26 December 2011 | location=NewDelhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRHM scam came to light after two [[Chief Medical Officer]]s (the top health functionary of the district) were successively murdered in wealthier localities of the state capital, [[Lucknow]]. Dr. Vinod Arya (Oct 2010) and Dr. B. P. Singh (April 2011) were shot dead in broad daylight outside their homes, by motorcycle assassins, using the same weapon.&lt;ref&gt;

==People accused of involvement==
On 3 April 2012 [[Central Bureau of Investigation|Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)]] filed its first [[chargesheet]] against PK Jain (former general manager of Construction and Design Services), subhash chaudhari (project manager), Kataar Singh (resident engineer), BN Ram (project engineer), JK Singh (accountant), Naresh Grover (managing director of a private firm) and R K Singh (managing director of a private firm)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/nrhm-scam-cbi-files-first-chargesheet_768024.html | title=NRHM scam: CBI files first chargesheet | newspaper=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBI has alleged that these accused caused a loss of {{INRConvert|54.6|m}} while carrying out the upgrading work of 134 district hospitals. To carry out the upgrade of 134 district hospitals {{INRConvert|134|m}} was granted to Construction and Design Services,a unit of UP Jal Nigam, which outsourced the job to a Ghaziabad based firm which had obtained the tender on the basis of bogus and forged documents.

'''Vote Compass''' is an interactive, online application developed by political scientists and run during election campaigns. It surveys users about their political views and, based on their responses, calculates the individual alignment of each user with the parties or candidates running in a given election contest.

To date, Vote Compass has been used by millions of people across more than two dozen elections worldwide. It is operated by a [[social enterprise]] called [http://www.voxpoplabs.com Vox Pop Labs] in partnership with leading, locale-specific news organizations, including the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Vox Media]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]s, [[Television New Zealand]], [[France24]], and [[RTL Group]].

Vote Compass also operates under the trademarks [[:fr:Boussole électorale|Boussole électorale]] and [[:de:Wahl-Navi|Wahl-Navi]] for French- and German-language iterations, respectively.

==Background==
Vote Compass was developed by Clifton van der Linden, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Toronto]]. It is presently run by van der Linden along with a team of social and statistical scientists from [http://www.voxpoplabs.com Vox Pop Labs].

Although inspired by European [[Voting Advice Application]]s, van der Linden explicitly rejects this terminology, arguing that Vote Compass was “never intended to account for every variable that influences voter choice and its results should not be interpreted as voting advice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Vote Turnout: Thinking Outside the (Ballot) Box | url = http://ca.news.yahoo.com/voter-turnout-thinking-outside-ballot-box-070054524.html | publisher = The Mark News | date = 2011-12-14 | accessdate = 2011-12-22 | author = Clifton van der Linden and Kelly Hinton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Using a [[Likert scale]], users indicate their responses to a series of policy propositions designed to discriminate between candidates' policies on prominent issues relevant to the election. Propositions are crafted in collaboration with political scientists local to each jurisdiction in which Vote Compass is run.

Based on a candidate or political party's public disclosures (i.e. party manifestos, policy proposals, official websites, speeches, media releases, statements made in the legislature, etc.) they are calibrated on the same propositions and scales as are users. A series of aggregation algorithms calculate the overall distance between the user and the candidates or parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://voxpoplabs.com/votecompass/methodology.pdf | title = Vote Compass Methodology | publisher = Vox Pop Labs | accessdate = 2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Journal of Elections, Public Opinion, and Politics | title = The curse of dimensionality in Voting Advice Applications: reliability and validity in algorithm design | author = Clifton van der Linden and Yannick Dufresne | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 9–30 | doi = 10.1080/17457289.2016.1268144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''war memorial''' is a building, monument, statue or other edifice to celebrate a war or victory, or (predominating in modern times) to commemorate those who died or were injured in a war.

==Symbolism==

===Historical usage===

The oldest war memorial in the United Kingdom is Oxford University's [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. It was founded in 1438 with the provision that its fellows should pray for those killed in the [[Hundred Years' War|long wars with France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/history-of-the-college|title=History of the College|website=All Soul's College, University of Oxford|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War memorials for the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870&amp;ndash;71) were the first in Europe to have rank-and-file soldiers commemorated by name.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, Karine. ''Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870-71 in French Memory''. Palgrave 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Every soldier that was killed was granted a permanent resting-place as part of the terms of the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)]].

To commemorate the millions who died in [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]], war memorials became commonplace in communities large and small around the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Modern usage===
In modern times the main intent of war memorials is not to glorify war, but to honor those who have died. Sometimes, as in the case of the [[Warschauer Kniefall|Warsaw Genuflection]] of [[Willy Brandt]], they may also serve as focal points of increasing understanding between previous enemies.

Using modern technology an international project is currently archiving all post-1914 Commonwealth war graves and [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] memorials to create a virtual memorial (see [[The War Graves Photographic Project]] for further details).

==History==

===World War I===
{{main|World War I memorials}}
During the [[First World War]], many nations saw massive devastation and loss of life. More people lost their lives in the east than in the west, but the outcome was different.  In the west, and in response to the victory there obtained, most of the cities in the countries involved in the conflict erected memorials, with the memorials in smaller villages and towns often listing the names of each local soldier who had been killed in addition (so far as the decision by the French and British in 1916 to construct governmentally designed cemeteries was concerned) to their names being recorded on military headstones, often against the will of those directly involved, and without any opportunity of choice in the British Empire ([[Imperial War Graves Commission]]). Massive British monuments commemorating thousands of dead with no identified [[war grave]], such as the [[Menin Gate Memorial|Menin Gate]] at [[Ypres]] and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme|Thiepval memorial]] on the Somme, were also constructed.

The [[Liberty Memorial]], located in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in the Great War. For various reasons connected with their character, the same may be said to apply to certain governmental memorials in the United Kingdom (the [[Cenotaph]] in London, relating to the Empire in general, and the [[Scottish National War Memorial]] in Edinburgh, also with a reference to the Empire, but with particular connections to the United Kingdom, having been opened by the Prince of Wales in 1927 and with the King and the Queen the first visitors and contributors of a casket of the Scottish names for addition within the Shrine). In [[Maryland]], in the center of the city of [[Baltimore]] facing the [[Baltimore City Hall]] to the west is a geometric paved tree-lined [[War Memorial Plaza|plaza]] with the [[War Memorial Building (Baltimore, Maryland)|War Memorial Building]] to the east with a large marble decorated civic auditorium and historical and veterans museum below, designed by [[Laurence Hall Fowler]], dedicated 1925.

===Pacifist war memorials and those relating to war and peace===
After World War I, some towns in France set up pacifist war memorials. Instead of commemorating the glorious dead, these memorials denounce war with figures of grieving widows and children rather than soldiers. Such memorials provoked anger among veterans and the military in general. The most famous is at [[Gentioux-Pigerolles]] in the department of [[Creuse]]. Below the column which lists the name of the fallen stands an orphan in bronze pointing to an inscription 'Maudite soit la guerre' (Cursed be war). Feelings ran so high that the memorial was not officially inaugurated until 1990 and soldiers at the nearby army camp were under orders to turn their heads when they walked past. Another such memorial is in the small town of [[Équeurdreville-Hainneville]] (formerly Équeurdreville) in the department of [[Manche]]. Here the statue is of a grieving widow with two small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coëpel | first = Philippe | title = Que maudite soit la guerre | publisher=Editions des champs | year = 1997 | location = Bricqueboscq | pages = 204 | isbn = 2-910138-08-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For pictures of the pacifist memorials at Gentioux-Pigerolles and at Équeurdreville-Hainneville and elsewhere see [[:fr:Monument aux morts pacifiste]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to be no exact equivalent form of a pacifist memorial within the United Kingdom but evidently sentiments were in many cases identical. Thus, and although it seems that this has never been generally recognized, it can be argued that there was throughout the United Kingdom a construction of war memorials with reference to the concept of peace (e.g. [[West Hartlepool War Memorial]] in what is now known as [[West Hartlepool War Memorial|Hartlepool]] (previously [[West Hartlepool]]) with the inscription 'Thine O Lord is the Victory' relating to amongst other architecture the [[Royal Albert Hall|1871 Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences]] with a frieze including the same words and concluding 'Glory be to God on high and on earth peace').

===World War II and later===
In many cases, World War I memorials were later extended to show the names of locals who died in the [[World War II]] in addition.

Since that time memorials to the dead in other conflicts such as the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] have also noted individual contributions, at least in the West.

In relation to actions which may well in point of fact be historically connected with the world wars even if this happens, for whatever reason, not to be a matter of general discussion (e.g. occupation by Western forces in the 1920s of Palestine and other areas being the homelands of Arabs in the Near East and followed eighty years later in 2001 by the '9/11' raid on New York and elsewhere in the United States) similar historically and architecturally significant memorials are also designed and constructed (vide [[National September 11 Memorial]]).

==Types==
* War memorials can differ significantly in type and composition.  Many war memorials often take the form of a traditional monument or [[statue]], while others consist of entire buildings, often containing a museum, while yet others are simple plaques.  War memorials can take a variety of other forms, including, but not limited to, commemorative gardens, stadiums, eternal flames, urban plazas, stained glass windows, gateways, fountains and/or pools of water, military equipment, and parks.
* War memorials often serve as a meeting place for commemorative services. As such, they are often found near the centre of town, or contained in a park or plaza to allow easy public access.
* Many war memorials bear plaques listing the names of those that died in battle. Sometimes these lists can be very long. Some war memorials are dedicated to a specific battle, while others are more general in nature and bear inscriptions listing various theatres of war.
* Many war memorials have [[epitaph]]s relating to the unit, battle or war they commemorate. For example, an epitaph which adorns numerous memorials in Commonwealth countries is "The Ode" by [[Laurence Binyon]]:
:''They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.''
:''Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.''
:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning''
:''We will remember them.''

* The [[Memorial Arch]] at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], which remembers ex-cadets who died on military service includes lines of [[Rupert Brooke]]'s poem, The Dead:

:''Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead.''
:''There are none of these so lonely and poor of old,''
:''But dying has made us rarer gifts than gold.''

*In the years following the end of World War I a heated debate occurred in the United States as to whether memorials should be the standard sort that were created after the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] or a more progressive sort of "living memorials." These consisted of bridges, parks, libraries, playgrounds, community centers, civic auditoriums and athletic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Piehler, G. Kurt ‘’Remembering War the American Way’’,  Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 1995 pp. 105–109&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Soldier Field]] and [[Veterans Stadium]].

===Tank monument===
A '''tank monument''' or '''armoured memorial''' is a [[tank]] withdrawn from military service and displayed to commemorate a [[battle]] or a military unit.  Obsolete tanks may also be displayed as [[gate guard]]s outside military bases.

Immediately following the First World War, a number of obsolete tanks were presented to towns and cities throughout Britain for display and for use as memorials: most were scrapped in the 1920s and 1930s, but one that survives is a [[Ashford, Kent#Landmarks|Mark IV Female tank]] at [[Ashford, Kent]].

Several Second World War tanks are preserved as memorials to major armoured offensives in the [[Ardennes]], such as the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Battle of Sedan]] and the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Ardennes Area Battlefield |title=World War II |page=318 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn=9781405335201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an [[17pdr SP Achilles|Achilles]] tank destroyer in [[La Roche-en-Ardenne|La Roche]]
* a [[Panther tank|Panther]] tank in the village [[Celles, Houyet|Celles]]
* a [[Sherman tank|Sherman]] tank in the town square of [[Bastogne]]
* a [[Tiger II]] tank in the village of [[La Gleize]]

A plinth-mounted [[T-35/85]] tank commemorates the soldiers of the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], at [[Znamianka]] in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shukach.com/uk/node/1402|title=Шукач - dombrovskii_a посетил(а) "5-я гвардейская танковая армия. Памятник освободителям Знаменки."|author=|date=|website=www.shukach.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cemeteries==
Many cemeteries tended by the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|War Graves Commission]] have an identical war memorial called the [[Cross of Sacrifice]] designed by Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]] that varies in height from 18&amp;nbsp;ft to 32&amp;nbsp;ft depending on the size of the cemetery. If there are one thousand or more burials, a Commonwealth cemetery will contain a [[Stone of Remembrance]], designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] with words from the [[Wisdom of Sirach]]: "[[Their name liveth for evermore]]"; all the Stones of Remembrance are 11&amp;nbsp;ft 6 ins long and 5&amp;nbsp;ft high with three steps leading up to them.

[[Arlington National Cemetery]] has a Canadian Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during the [[Korean War]] and two World Wars.

==Controversy==
War memorials can sometimes be politically controversial. A notable case is that of the [[controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine|Yasukuni Shrine]] in Japan, where a number of convicted [[World War II]] [[war criminal]]s are interred. Chinese and Korean representatives have often protested against the visits of Japanese politicians to the shrine. The visits have in the past led to severe diplomatic conflicts between the nations, and Japanese businesses were attacked in China after a visit by former Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] to the shrine was widely reported and criticized in Chinese and Korean media.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/connectasia/stories/s1849512.htm Japan: Chinese foreign minister on fence-mending visit]'' – ''[[Radio Australia]]'' program transcript, date unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar case, former German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] was criticised by writers [[Günter Grass]] and [[Elie Wiesel]] for visiting the war cemetery at Bitburg (in the company of [[Ronald Reagan]]) which also contained the bodies of [[Schutzstaffel|SS troops]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/06/international/europe/06REAG.html Reagan Joins Kohl in Brief Memorial at Bitburg Graves]'' – ''[[New York Times]]'', Monday 6 May 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the case of the Yasukuni Shrine, there was no element of intentional disregard of international opinion involved, as is often claimed for the politician visits to the Japanese shrine.

Soviet World War II memorials included quotes of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s texts, frequently replaced after his death. Such memorials were often constructed in city centres and now are sometimes regarded as symbols of Soviet occupation and removed, which in turn may spark protests (see [[Bronze Soldier of Tallinn]]).

The [[Fusiliers' Arch|Fusiliers' memorial arch]] to the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] who fought in the [[Boer War]], erected at 1907 in [[St. Stephen's Green]], Dublin, was called "Traitors' Gate" by the [[John Redmond|Redmondites]] and later [[Irish Republicans]], from whose point of view Irish soldiers going off to fight the [[British Empire]]'s wars were traitors to Ireland. The sharpness of the controversy gradually faded, and while the term "Traitors' Gate" is still in occasional colloquial use in Dublin daily life, it has mostly lost its pejorative meaning.

In Australia, in 1981, historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] raised the issue of whether war memorials should be erected to [[Indigenous Australians]] who had died fighting against British invaders on their lands.
&lt;blockquote&gt;How, then, do we deal with the Aboriginal dead? White Australians frequently say that 'all that' should be forgotten. But it will not be. It cannot be. Black memories are too deeply, too recently scarred. And forgetfulness is a strange prescription coming from a community which has revered the fallen warrior and emblazoned the phrase 'Lest We Forget' on monuments throughout the land. [...] [D]o we make room for the Aboriginal dead on our memorials, cenotaphs, boards of honour and even in the pantheon of national heroes? If we are to continue to celebrate the sacrifice of men and women who died for their country can we deny admission to fallen tribesmen? There is much in their story that Australians have traditionally admired. They were ever the underdogs, were always outgunned, yet frequently faced death without flinching. If they did not die for Australia as such they fell defending their homelands, their sacred sites, their way of life. What is more the blacks bled on their own soil and not [[Battle of Gallipoli|half a world away]] furthering the strategic objectives of [[United Kingdom|a distant Motherland]] whose influence must increasingly be seen as of transient importance in the history of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reynolds' suggestion proved controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Henry, ''Why Weren't We Told?'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-14-027842-7}}, chapter 12: "Lest We Forget", pp.169–184&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional memorials have been erected to commemorate Aboriginal people's resistance to colonisation, or to commemorate [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|white massacres of Indigenous Australians]]. These memorials have often generated controversy. For example, a 1984 memorial to the [[Kalkadoon]] people's "resistance against the paramilitary force of European settlers and the Queensland Native Mounted Police" was "frequently shot at" and "eventually blown up".&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', pp.177–8&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of long war, some memorials are constructed before the conflict is over, leaving space for extra names of the dead.  For instance, the [[Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial]] in [[Irvine, California|Irvine, CA]], memorializes an ongoing pair of US wars, and has space to inscribe the names of approximately 8,000 fallen servicemembers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ihsLW9amV1E/S4R1kx2Z-vI/AAAAAAAAAhs/F0gIKTbHiTs/s1600-h/northwood_memorial.jpg|title=northwood_memorial.jpg (image)|author=|date=|website=3.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the UK [[National Memorial Arboretum]] near [[Lichfield]] in England hosts the UK's [[National Armed Forces Memorial]] which displays the names of the more than 16,000 people who have already died on active service in the UK armed forces since World War Two, with more space available for future fatalities.
