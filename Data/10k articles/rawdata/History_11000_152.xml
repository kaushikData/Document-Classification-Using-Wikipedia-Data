The '''1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine''', later came to be known as "'''The Great Revolt'''", was a nationalist uprising by Palestinian Arabs in [[Mandatory Palestine]] against the British administration of the Palestine Mandate, demanding Arab independence and the end of the policy of open-ended Jewish immigration and land purchases with the stated goal of establishing a "Jewish National Home".{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=2}} The dissent was directly influenced by the Qassamite rebellion, following the killing of Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] in 1935, as well as the declaration by Hajj [[Amin al-Husseini]] of 16 May 1936 as 'Palestine Day' and calling for a [[Arab general strike (Mandatory Palestine)|General Strike]]. The revolt was branded by many in the Jewish [[Yishuv]] as "immoral and terroristic", often comparing it to fascism and nazism.&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 136"/&gt; Ben Gurion however described Arab causes as fear of growing Jewish economic power, opposition to mass [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] and fear of the English identification with Zionism.&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 136"&gt;Morris, 1999, p.  136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab general strike (Mandatory Palestine)|general strike]] lasted from April to October 1936, initiating the violent revolt. The revolt consisted of two distinct phases.&lt;ref name=norris2008&gt;Norris, 2008, pp. 25, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase was directed primarily by the urban and elitist [[Arab Higher Committee|Higher Arab Committee]] (HAC) and was focused mainly on strikes and other forms of political protest.&lt;ref name=norris2008/&gt; By October 1936, this phase had been defeated by the British [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|civil administration]] using a combination of [[concession (politics)|political concessions]], international diplomacy (involving the rulers of [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemen]]&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;) and the threat of [[martial law]].&lt;ref name=norris2008/&gt; The second phase, which began late in 1937, was a violent and peasant-led resistance movement provoked by British repression in 1936{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=5}} that increasingly targeted British forces.&lt;ref name=norris2008/&gt; During this phase, the rebellion was brutally suppressed by the [[British Army]] and the [[Palestine Police Force]] using repressive measures that were intended to intimidate the Arab population and undermine popular support for the revolt.&lt;ref name=norris2008/&gt; During this phase, a more dominant role on the Arab side was taken by the [[Nashashibi clan]], whose [[National Defense Party (Mandatory Palestine)|NDP party]] quickly withdrew from the rebel [[Arab Higher Committee]], led by the radical [[Palestine Arab Party|faction]] of Amin al-Husseini, and instead sided with the British – dispatching "Fasail al-Salam" (the "Peace Bands") in coordination with the British Army against nationalist and Jihadist Arab "Fasail" units (literally "bands").

According to official British figures covering the whole revolt, the army and police killed more than 2,000 Arabs in combat, 108 were [[Hanging|hanged]],&lt;ref name=levenberg/&gt; and 961 died because of what they described as "gang and terrorist activities".&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; In an analysis of the British statistics, [[Walid Khalidi]] estimates 19,792 casualties for the Arabs, with 5,032 dead: 3,832 killed by the British and 1,200 dead because of "terrorism", and 14,760 wounded.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Over ten percent of the adult male [[Palestinian Arab]] population between 20 and 60 was killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, 2002, pp. 21, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the number of [[Palestinian Jews]] killed range from 91&lt;ref&gt;Patai, 1971, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; to several hundred.&lt;ref name=morris160&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab revolt in Mandatory Palestine was unsuccessful, and its consequences affected the outcome of the [[1948 Palestine war]].&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 159"&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; It caused the British Mandate to give crucial support to pre-state Zionist militias like the [[Haganah]], whereas on the Palestinian Arab side, the revolt forced the flight into exile of the main Palestinian Arab leader of the period, the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] – [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]].{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

{{Further|Cement Incident|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12857 Events in Israel.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral of Jews from [[Givat Ada]]  that were killed in 1936.]]

In 1930 Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] organized and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], an [[anti-Zionist]] and anti-British militant organization. He recruited and arranged military training for peasants and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. They were engaged in a campaign of vandalizing trees planted by farmers and British-constructed rail lines.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=978-0-8050-4848-3 |pages=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1935, two of his men engaged in a firefight with the [[Palestine Police]] patrol hunting fruit thieves and a policeman was killed. Following the incident, the police launched a manhunt and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near [[Ya'bad]]. In the ensuing battle, al-Qassam was killed.&lt;ref name=segev/&gt;

The death of al-Qassam generated widespread outrage among Palestinian Arabs. Huge crowds accompanied Qassam's body to his grave in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1998, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissent in Palestine was influenced also by the discovery in October 1935 at the port of [[Jaffa]] of a large [[Cement Incident|arms shipment]] destined for the [[Haganah]], sparking Arab fears of a Jewish military takeover of Palestine,&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;Matthews, 2006, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kramer263&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish immigration also peaked in 1935, just months before Palestinian Arabs began a full-scale, nationwide revolt.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; In the four years between 1933 and 1936
more than 164,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine, and between 1931 and 1936 the Jewish population more than doubled from 175,000 to 370,000 people, increasing the Jewish population share from 17% to 27%, and bringing about a significant deterioration in relations between Palestinian Arabs and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The uprising began with the [[1936 Anabta shooting]], a 15 April 1936 roadblock that stopped a convoy of trucks on the [[Nablus]] to [[Tulkarm]] road during which the (probably Qassamite)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/17&amp;EntityId=Ar00100&amp;PageLabelPrint=1 'Nablus Bandits Seen as Izz ed Din's followers'], ''Palestine Post'', Friday, 17 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; assailants shot two Jewish drivers, Israel Khazan, who was killed instantly, and Zvi Dannenberg, who died five days later.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/30&amp;EntityId=Ar00700&amp;PageLabelPrint=7 'Yesterday in Palestine'], ''Palestine Post'', Thursday, 30 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/21&amp;EntityId=Ar00506&amp;PageLabelPrint=5 Highwaymen's Second Victim Dead'], ''Palestine Post,'' Tuesday, 21 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/16&amp;EntityId=Ar00105&amp;PageLabelPrint=1 'Turk Killed by Hold-up Men'], ''Palestine Post'', Thursday, 16 April 1936&lt;/ref&gt; The next day members of the militant Jewish faction, the [[Irgun]], shot and killed two Arab workers sleeping in a hut near [[Petah Tikva]] in a revenge attack.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert80&gt;Gilbert, 1998, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the funeral for Khazan in [[Tel Aviv]] on 17 April attracted a huge crowd, and some Jews beat up Arab bystanders and destroyed property.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-On, 2004, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[the Bloody Day in Jaffa]], in which an Arab mob rampaged through a residential area killing Jews and destroying property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/23&amp;EntityId=Ar00102&amp;PageLabelPrint=1 'Little Change in Situation'], ''Palestine Post'', Thursday, 23 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; An Arab general strike and revolt ensued that lasted until October 1936.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

During the summer of that year, thousands of Jewish-farmed acres and orchards were destroyed, Jewish civilians were attacked and murdered, and some Jewish communities, such as those in [[Beisan]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], fled to safer areas.&lt;ref name=gilbert80/&gt;

===Economic background===
{{Further|Association for Palestinian Products}}
Economic factors played a major role in the outbreak of the Arab revolt.&lt;ref name=yazbak&gt;Yazbak, M. (2000). From Poverty to Revolt: Economic Factors in the Outbreak of the 1936 Rebellion in Palestine. ''Middle Eastern Studies'', 36(3), pp. 93–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestine's [[fellahin]], the country's peasant farmers, comprised over two-thirds of the indigenous Arab population and from the 1920s onwards they were pushed off the land in increasingly large numbers into urban environments where they often encountered only poverty and social marginalisation.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; Many were crowded into [[shanty town]]s in Jaffa and Haifa where they found succor and encouragement in the teachings of the charismatic preacher Izz ad-Din al-Qassam who worked among the poor in Haifa.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The revolt was thus a popular uprising that produced its own leaders and developed into a national revolt.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt;

World War I left Palestine, especially the countryside, deeply impoverished.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and then the Mandate authorities levied high taxes on farming and agricultural produce and during the 1920s and 1930s this together with a fall in prices, cheap imports, natural disasters and paltry harvests all contributed to the increasing indebtedness of the fellahin.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The rents paid by tenant fellah increased sharply, owing to increased population density, and transfer of land from Arabs to the Jewish settlement agencies, such as the [[Jewish National Fund]], increased the number of fellahin evicted while also removing the land as a future source of livelihood.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; By 1931 the 106,400 [[dunam|dunums]] of low-lying Category A farming land in Arab possession supported a farming population of 590,000 whereas the 102,000 dunums of such land in Jewish possession supported a farming population of only 50,000.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The problem of 'landless' Arabs grew particularly grave after 1931, causing [[Arthur Grenfell Wauchope|High Commissioner Wauchope]] to warn that this 'social peril&amp;nbsp;... would serve as a focus of discontent and might even result in serious disorders.'&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt;

Although the Mandatory government introduced measures to limit the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews these were easily circumvented by willing buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The failure of the authorities to invest in economic growth and healthcare and the Zionist policy of ensuring that their investments were directed only to facilitate expansion of the [[Yishuv]] further compounded matters.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; The government did, however, set the minimum wage for Arab workers below that for Jewish workers, which meant that those making capital investments in the Yishuv's economic infrastructure, such as Haifa's electricity plant, the Shemen oil and soap factory, the Grands Moulins flour mills and the Nesher cement factory, could take advantage of cheap Arab labour pouring in from the countryside.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; After 1935 the slump in the construction boom and further concentration by the Yishuv on an exclusivist Hebrew labour programme removed most of the sources of employment for rural migrants.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt; By 1935 only 12,000 Arabs (5% of the workforce) worked in the Jewish sector, half of these in agriculture, whereas 32,000 worked for the Mandate authorities and 211,000 were either self-employed or worked for Arab employers.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing disruption of agrarian life in Palestine, which had been continuing since Ottoman times, thus created a large population of landless peasant farmers who subsequently became mobile wage workers who were increasingly marginalised and impoverished; these became willing participants in nationalist rebellion.&lt;ref name=yazbak/&gt;

Initially, the conflict with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs because people were highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation.&lt;ref name=kramer239&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but not a real leadership.&lt;ref name=kramer239/&gt; Both of these things changed over the course of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=kramer239/&gt; During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.&lt;ref name=kramer254&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth organisations proliferated at this time; these included the [[Young Men's Muslim Association]], which from 1931 agitated for armed resistance against the Zionists, the [[Youth Congress Party]], which expressed pan-Arab sentiments, and the [[Palestinian Scout Association|Palestinian Boy Scout Movement]], founded early in 1936, which became active in the general strike.&lt;ref name=kramer254/&gt;

Women's organisations, which had been active in social matters, became politically involved from the end of the 1920s, with an Arab Women's Congress held in Jerusalem in 1929 attracting 200 participants, and an Arab Women's Association (later Arab Women's Union) being established at the same time, both organised by feminist [[Tarab Abdul Hadi]].&lt;ref name=kramer254/&gt;&lt;ref name=PASSIApub&gt;{{cite web |title=Jerusalem Women's Organizations During the British Mandate, 1920s–1930s |author=Ellen Fleischmann |date=March 1995 |url=http://www.passia.org/jerusalem/publications/J_wom_org_british_man_txt.htm |publisher=PASSIA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604202131/http://www.passia.org/jerusalem/publications/J_wom_org_british_man_txt.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 1930s new political parties began to appear, including the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Independence Party]], which called for an [[Indian National Congress|Indian Congress Party]]-style boycott of the British,&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, 2001, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the pro-[[Nashashibi]] [[National Defence Party (Palestine)|National Defence Party]], the pro-[[Husayni]] [[Palestinian Arab Party]] the pro-Khalidi [[Reform Party (Palestine)|Arab-Palestinian Reform Party]], and the [[National Bloc (Palestine)|National Bloc]], based mainly around Nablus.&lt;ref name=kramer259&gt;Krämer, 2008, pp. 256–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few militant secret societies, which advocated armed struggle were formed; these included the Green Hand, which was active in the hills around [[Safad]], but eliminated by the British in 1931, the Organization for Holy Struggle, led by [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] and active in the Hebron area, which was later to play an important role in the [[1948 Palestine War]], and the Young Rebels or Avenging Youth, active in the [[Tulkarm]] and [[Qalqilyah]] area from 1935.&lt;ref name=kramer259/&gt;

Traditional feasts such as [[Nebi Musa]] began to acquire a political and nationalist dimension and new national memorial days were introduced or gained new significance; among them Balfour Day (2 November, marking the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]), the anniversary of the [[Battle of Hattin]] (4 July, marking [[Saladin]]'s recapture of Jerusalem), and beginning in 1930 May 16 was celebrated as Palestine Day.&lt;ref name="kramer259"/&gt;

The expansion of education, the development of [[civil society]] and of transportation, communications, and especially of broadcasting and other media, all facilitated these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, pp. 2656–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional political background===
A number of political changes in neighbouring Arab countries illustrated to the Palestinian Arabs what could be achieved in a Western colony through political pressure and negotiating skill.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Syria a general strike took place from 20 January to 6 March 1936 spreading to all the major towns, and political demonstrations held throughout the country gave fresh momentum to the Syrian national movement. Although French reprisals were harsh the government agreed on 2 March to the formation of a Syrian delegation to travel to Paris to negotiate a [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Commins, 2004, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrated that determined economic and political pressure could challenge a fragile imperial administration.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2007, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]] on 2 March 1936 a series of formal negotiations between the United Kingdom and Egypt began leading to the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which granted independence to Egypt, but allowed the British to keep forces in the [[Suez Canal|Suez Canal Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1937/6 |title=Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 |publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924110414/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1937/6 |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morewood, 2004, pp. 86–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq a general strike in July 1931, accompanied by organised demonstrations in the streets, led to independence for the former British mandate territory under prime minister [[Nuri as-Said]], and full membership of the [[League of Nations]] in October 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, 2002, pp. 71–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khalil Sakakini.jpg|thumb|left|[[Khalil al-Sakakini]] called the revolt a "life-and-death struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The strike began on 19 April in Nablus, where an Arab National Committee was formed,&lt;ref&gt;Horne, 2003, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peel96&gt;Peel Commission Report Cmd. 5479, 1937, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the month National Committees had been formed in all of the towns and some of the larger villages.&lt;ref name=peel96/&gt; On 21 April the leaders of the five main parties accepted the decision at Nablus and called for a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping for the following day.&lt;ref name=peel96/&gt;

While the strike was initially organised by workers and local committees, under pressure from below, political leaders became involved to help with co-ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation on 25 April 1936 of the [[Arab Higher Committee]] (AHC).&lt;ref name=peel96/&gt; The Committee resolved "to continue the general strike until the British Government changes its present policy in a fundamental manner"; the demands were threefold: (1) the prohibition of Jewish immigration; (2) the prohibition of the transfer of Arab land to Jews; (3) the establishment of a National Government responsible to a representative council.&lt;ref&gt;Peel Commission Report Cmd. 5479, 1937, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David BG.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Ben-Gurion]] told mourners at a funeral held on 20 April 1936 for nine victims of rioting in [[Jaffa]] the previous day that Jews would only be safe "in communities which are 100% Jewish and built on Jewish land."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/21&amp;EntityId=Ar00807&amp;PageLabelPrint=8 'The Funeral], ''Palestine Post'', Tuesday, 21 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1936/04/21&amp;EntityId=Ar00103&amp;PageLabelPrint=1 'Funeral of Nine Jewish Dead'], ''Palestine Post'', Tuesday, 21 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
About one month after the general strike started, the leadership group declared a general non-payment of taxes in explicit opposition to Jewish immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyālī, 1978, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the countryside, armed insurrection started sporadically, becoming more organised with time.&lt;ref&gt;Peel Commission Report Cmd. 5479, 1937, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; One particular target of the rebels was the [[Mosul–Haifa oil pipeline]] of the Iraq Petroleum Company constructed only a few years earlier to Haifa from a point on the [[Jordan River]] south of [[Lake Tiberias]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Townshend, The defence of Palestine: insurrection and public security, 1936–1939. ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 103 (1988) 917–949.&lt;/ref&gt; This was repeatedly bombed at various points along its length. Other attacks were on railways (including trains) and on civilian targets such as Jewish settlements, secluded Jewish neighbourhoods in the mixed cities, and Jews, both individually and in groups.&lt;ref name=peel100&gt;Peel Commission Report Cmd. 5479, 1937, pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures taken against the strike were harsh at the beginning and grew harsher as it went along involving house searches without warrants, night raids, preventive detention, caning, flogging, deportation, confiscation of property, and torture.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as May 1936 the British formed armed Jewish units equipped with armoured vehicles to serve as auxiliary police.&lt;ref name="Krämer, 2008, p. 291"&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arab strike 1936. Car with brooms to sweep away tacks thrown by strikers.jpg|thumb|Arab strike 1936. Car with brooms to sweep away tacks thrown by strikers.]]
The British government in Palestine was convinced that the strike had the full support of the Palestinian Arabs and they could see "no weakening in the will and spirit of the Arab people."&lt;ref name=kay196&gt;Kayyālī, 1978, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Air Vice-Marshall]] [[Richard Peirse]], commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan from 1933 to 1936, reported that because the rebel armed bands were supported by villagers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It was quickly evident that the only way to regain the initiative from the rebels was by initiating measures against the villagers from which the rebels and saboteurs came&amp;nbsp;... I therefore initiated, in co-operation with the Inspector-General of Police R. G. B. Spicer, village searches. Ostensibly, these searches were undertaken to find arms and wanted persons, actually the measures adopted by the Police on the lines of similar Turkish methods, were punitive and effective.&lt;ref name=kay196/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In reality the measures created a sense of solidarity between the villagers and the rebels.&lt;ref name=kay196/&gt; The pro-Government Mayor of Nablus complained to the High Commissioner that, "During the last searches effected in villages properties were destroyed, jewels stolen, and the Holy [[Qur'an]] torn, and this has increased the excitement of the fellahin."&lt;ref name=kay196/&gt; However, Moshe Shertok of the Jewish Agency even suggested that all villages in the area of an incident should be punished.&lt;ref name="Segev, 2000, p. 423"&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June, an attempt by rebels to derail a train bringing the 2nd Battalion [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment]] from Egypt led to the railways being put under guard, placing a great strain on the security forces.&lt;ref name=horne213&gt;Horne, 2003, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this situation on 4 June the government rounded up a large number of Palestinian leaders and sent them to a detention camp at [[Auja al-Hafir]] in the [[Negev]] desert.&lt;ref name=horne213/&gt;

The [[Battle of Nur Shams]] on 21 June marked an escalation with the largest engagement of British troops against Arab militants so far in this Revolt.&lt;ref name=HeaviestFighting&gt;{{cite news |title=Troops Amhushed On Road, Heaviest Engagement Of Palestine Revolt Follows (p. 9) |publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=22 June 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During July, Arab volunteers from Syria and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], led by [[Fawzi al-Qawukji]], helped the rebels to divide their formations into four fronts, each led by a District Commander who had armed platoons of 150–200 fighters, each commanded by a platoon leader.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyālī, 1978, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Statement of Policy issued by the Colonial Office in London on 7 September declared the situation a: "direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in Palestine" and announced the appointment of Lieutenant-General [[John Dill]] as supreme military commander.&lt;ref name=peel100/&gt; By the end of September {{formatnum:20000}} British troops in Palestine were deployed to "round up Arab bands".&lt;ref name=peel100/&gt;

In June 1936 the British involved their clients in Transjordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to pacify the Palestinian Arabs and on 9 October the rulers made an appeal for the strike to be ended.&lt;ref name=kramer278&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; A more pressing concern may have been the approaching citrus harvest and the soaring prices that were available because of the disruption caused to the Spanish citrus harvest by the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=kramer278/&gt;

===Peel commission===
The strike was called off on 11 October 1936&lt;ref name=peel100/&gt; and the violence abated for about a year while the [[Peel Commission]] deliberated. The Royal Commission was announced on 18 May 1936 and its members were appointed on 29 July, but the Commission did not arrive in Palestine until 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 210, 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission, which concluded that 1,000 Arab rebels had been killed during the strike, later described the disturbances as "an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs, assisted by fellow-Arabs from other countries, against Mandatory rule" and noted two unprecedented features of the revolt: the support of all senior Arab officials in the political and technical departments in the Palestine administration (including all of the Arab judges) and the "interest and sympathy of the neighbouring Arab peoples", which had resulted in support for the rebellion in the form of volunteers from [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Peel Commission Report Cmd. 5479, 1937, pp. 99, 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lord Peel arrives.jpg|right|thumb|[[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]] arrives in Mandatory Palestine 11 November 1936. Privately, Peel believed that most Jews would remain in the Diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the early 1920s the first High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Herbert Samuel]], failed to create a unified political structure embracing both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews in constitutional government with joint political institutions.&lt;ref name=wasserstein&gt;Wasserstein, 2004, pp. 106–114&lt;/ref&gt; This failure facilitated internal institutional partition in which the Jewish Agency exercised a degree of autonomous control over the Jewish settlement and the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] performed a comparable role for Muslims.&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt; Thus, well before Lord Peel arrived in Palestine on 11 November 1936, the groundwork for territorial partition as proposed by the [[Royal Commission]] in its report on 7 July 1937 had already been done.&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt;
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 297 Kibutz Gan-Shmuel sk1- 38 גן-שמואל - אש בשדות 1936-9.jpg|thumb|Fields on fire at the [[Gan Shmuel|Gan-Shmuel]] Kibbutz. Picture taken between 1936 and 1939.]]
Peel's main recommendation was for partition of Palestine into a small Jewish state (based on current Jewish land ownership population and incorporating the country's most productive agricultural land), a residual Mandatory area, and a larger Arab state linked to [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt; A second and more radical proposal was for transfer of 225,000 Palestinian Arabs from the Jewish state to the Arab state and Transjordan.&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt; It is likely that Zionist leaders played a role in persuading Peel to accept the notion of transfer, which had been a strand of Zionist ideology from its inception.&lt;ref name=morrispeel&gt;Morris, 1999, pp. 138–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Higher Committee rejected the recommendations immediately,&lt;ref name=morrispeel/&gt; as did the Jewish [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]]. Initially, the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|religious Zionists]], some of the [[General Zionists]], and sections of the [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]] movement opposed the recommendations.&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt; Ben-Gurion was delighted by the Peel Commission's support for transfer, which he viewed as the foundation of "national consolidation in a free homeland."&lt;ref name=morrispeel/&gt; Subsequently, the 2 main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]] had convinced the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation,&lt;ref name=wasserstein/&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis2006p391"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2004p11"/&gt; and to negotiate a modified Peel proposal with the British.&lt;ref name="RaiderSarna2012"/&gt;

The British government initially accepted the Peel report in principle. However, with war clouds looming over Europe, they realized that to attempt to implement it against the will of the Palestinian Arab majority would rouse up the entire Arab world against Britain.&lt;ref name="Wasserstein2012p339"/&gt; The [[Woodhead Commission]] considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November 1938. {{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resumed Revolt (September 1937 – August 1939)===
{{further|1938 Tiberias massacre}}
With the failure of the Peel Commission's proposals the revolt resumed during the autumn of 1937 marked by the assassination on 26 September of Acting District Commissioner of the Galilee [[Lewis Yelland Andrews|Lewis Andrews]] by Arab gunmen in Nazareth.&lt;ref name="Cohen, 2009, p. 125"&gt;Cohen, 2009, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September, regulations were issued allowing the Government to detain political deportees in any part of the British Empire, and authorizing the High Commissioner to outlaw associations whose objectives he regarded as contrary to public policy. [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] was removed from the leadership of the Supreme Moslem Council and the General Waqf Committee, the local National Committees and the [[Arab Higher Committee]] were disbanded; five Arab leaders were arrested  and deported to the [[Seychelles]]; and in fear of arrest Jamal el-Husseini fled to Syria and Haj Amin el-Husseini to Lebanon;&lt;ref name=avalon&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry – Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=horne222/&gt; all frontiers with Palestine were closed, telephone connections to neighbouring countries were withdrawn, press censorship was introduced and a special [[concentration camp]] was opened near Acre.&lt;ref name=horne222&gt;Horne, 2003, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1937, the [[Irgun]] formally rejected the policy of [[Havlagah]] and [[Black Sunday, 1937|embarked on a series of indiscriminate attacks]] against Arab civilians as a form of what the group called "active defense" against Arab attacks on Jewish civilians. The British authorities set up military courts, which were established for the trial of offenses connected with the carrying and discharge of firearms, sabotage and intimidation. Despite this, however, the Arab campaign of murder and sabotage continued and Arab gangs in the hills took on the appearance of organized guerrilla fighters.&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;

Violence continued throughout 1938.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; In July 1938, when the Palestine Government seemed to have largely lost control of the situation, the garrison was strengthened from Egypt, and in September it was further reinforced from England. The police were placed under the operational control of the army commander, and military officials superseded the civil authorities in the enforcement of order. In October the Old City of Jerusalem, which had become a rebel stronghold, was reoccupied by the troops. By the end of the year a semblance of order had been restored in the towns, but terrorism continued in rural areas until the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;

Despite cooperation of the Yishuv with the British to quell the revolt, some incidents towards the end of the conflict indicated a coming change in relations. On 12 June 1939, A British explosives expert was killed trying to defuse an Irgun bomb near a [[Jerusalem]] post office. On 26 August, two British police officers, Inspector Ronald Barker and Inspector [[Ralph Cairns]], commander of the Jewish Department of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|C.I.D.]], were killed by an Irgun mine in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-1166-7 |last=Ben-Yehuda |first=Hahman |title=Political Assassinations by Jews |year=1993 |pages=155–157 |url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1949-political-assassinations-by-jew.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In the final fifteen months of the revolt alone there were 936 murders and 351 attempted murders; 2,125 incidents of sniping; 472 bombs thrown and detonated; 364 cases of armed robbery; 1,453 cases of sabotage against government and commercial property; 323 people abducted; 72 cases of intimidation; 236 Jews killed by Arabs and 435 Arabs killed by Jews; 1,200 rebels killed by the police and military and 535 wounded.&lt;ref name=horne&gt;Horne, 2003, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military law allowed swift prison sentences to be passed.&lt;ref name=segev417&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Arabs were held in [[administrative detention]], without trial, and without proper [[sanitation]], in overcrowded prison camps.&lt;ref name=segev417/&gt;

The British had already formalised the principle of collective punishment in Palestine in the 1924–1925 Collective Responsibility and Punishment Ordinances and updated these ordinances in 1936 with the Collective Fines Ordinance.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; These collective fines (amounting to £1,000,000 over the revolt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=776442&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;SearchType=6&amp;CATREF=CAB+128/6 Cabinet Papers, 30 July 1946, CAB 128/6].&lt;/ref&gt;) eventually became a heavy burden for poor Palestinian villagers, especially when the army also confiscated livestock, destroyed properties, imposed long curfews and established police posts, demolished houses and detained some or all of the Arab men in distant detention camps.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

Full [[martial law]] was not introduced but in a series of [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] and [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|Emergency Regulations]], 1936–37 'statutory' martial law, a stage between semi-military rule under civil powers and full martial law under military powers, and one in which the army and not the civil High Commissioner was pre-eminent was put in place.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also WO 32/9618 Emergency Regulations 1936. Palestine Martial Law (Defence) Order in Council 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Arab capture of the Old City of Jerusalem in October 1938, the army effectively took over Jerusalem and then all of Palestine.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

The main form of collective punishment employed by the British forces was destruction of property. Sometimes entire villages were reduced to rubble, as happened to [[Mi'ar]] in October 1938; more often several prominent houses were blown up and others were trashed inside.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Segev, 2000, p. 423"/&gt; The biggest single act of destruction occurred in [[Jaffa]] on 16 June 1936, when large [[gelignite]] charges were used to cut long pathways through the old city, destroying 220–240 buildings and rendering up to 6,000 Arabs homeless.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Scathing criticism for this action from Palestine [[Chief Justice]] Sir [[Michael McDonnell]] was not well received by the administration and the judge was soon removed from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; Villages were also frequently punished by fines and confiscation of livestock.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; The British even used sea mines from the battleship [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']] to destroy houses.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

In addition to actions against property, a large amount of brutality by the British forces occurred, including beatings, torture and extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; A surprisingly large number of prisoners were "shot while trying to escape".&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Several incidents involved serious atrocities, such as massacres at [[al-Bassa]] and [[Halhul]].&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Desmond Woods, an officer of the [[Royal Ulster Rifles]], described the massacre at al-Bassa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Now I will never forget this incident&amp;nbsp;... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other frontier base and word came through about 6 o'clock in the morning that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [the dead officer] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [Lieutenant-Colonel G.H.P. Whitfeld, the battalion commander] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village to the scene of the mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I will never forget arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car|Rolls Royce armoured cars]] of the [[11th Hussars]] peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20&amp;nbsp;minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground&amp;nbsp;... Monty had him [the battalion commander] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said "Sir, I have warned the [[mukhtar]]s in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Monty]] said "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future."&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As well as destroying the village the RUR and men from the [[Royal Engineers]] collected around fifty men from al-Bassa and blew some of them up with explosion under a bus. Harry Arrigonie, a policeman who was present said that about twenty men were put onto a bus; those who tried to escape were shot and then the driver of the bus was forced to drive over a powerful land mine buried by the soldiers which completely destroyed the bus, scattering the mutilated bodies of the prisoners everywhere. The other villagers were then forced to bury the bodies in a pit.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

Despite these measures Lieutenant-General Haining, the General Officer Commanding, reported secretly to the Cabinet on 1 December 1938 that "practically every village in the country harbours and supports the rebels and will assist in concealing their identity from the Government Forces."&lt;ref name=haining&gt;Palestine, 1938 Allegations Against British Troops, [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=775828&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;SearchType=6&amp;CATREF=CAB+24/282#summary CAB 24/282], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Haining reported the method for searching villages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A cordon round the area to be searched is first established either by troops or aircraft and the inhabitants are warned that anybody trying to break through the cordon is likely to be shot. As literally hundreds of villages have been searched, in some cases more than once, during the past six months this procedure is well-known and it can be safely assumed that cordon-breakers have good reasons for wishing to avoid the troops. A number of such cordon-breakers have been shot during searches and it is probable that such cases form the basis of the propaganda that Arab prisoners are shot in cold blood and reported as "killed while trying to escape". After the cordon is established the troops enter the village and all male inhabitants are collected for identification and interrogation.&lt;ref name=haining/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report was issued in response to growing concern at the severity of the military measures amongst the general public in Great Britain, among members of the British Government, and among governments in countries neighbouring Palestine.&lt;ref name=haining/&gt;

In addition to actions against villages the British Army also conducted punitive actions in the cities. In [[Nablus]] in August 1938 almost 5,000 men were held in a cage for two days and interrogated one after another.&lt;ref name=segev424&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During their detention the city was searched and then each of the detainees was marked with a rubber stamp on his release.&lt;ref name=segev424/&gt; At one point a night curfew was imposed on most of the cities.&lt;ref name=segev424/&gt;

It was common British army practice to make local Arabs ride with military convoys to prevent mine attacks and sniping incidents: soldiers would tie the hostages to the bonnets of lorries, or put them on small flatbeds on the front of trains.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; The army told the hostages that any of them who tried to run away would be shot. On the lorries, some soldiers would brake hard at the end of a journey and then casually drive over the hostage, killing or maiming him, as Arthur Lane, a [[Manchester Regiment]] private recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;... when you'd finished your duty you would come away nothing had happened no bombs or anything and the driver would switch his wheel back and to make the truck waver and the poor wog on the front would roll off into the deck. Well if he was lucky he'd get away with a broken leg but if he was unlucky the truck behind coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right&amp;nbsp;... Well you know you don't want him any more. He's fulfilled his job. And that's when Bill Usher [the commanding officer] said that it had to stop because before long they'd be running out of bloody rebels to sit on the bonnet.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British troops also left Arab wounded on the battlefield to die and maltreated Arab fighters taken in battle, so much so that the rebels tried to remove their wounded or dead from the field of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Sometimes, soldiers would occupy villages, expel all of the inhabitants and remain for months.&lt;ref name="Segev, 2000, p. 423"/&gt; The Army even burned the bodies of "terrorists" to prevent their funerals becoming the focus of protests.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it has been argued that British behaviour overall was good compared to most other examples where a foreign army suppressed a popular insurgency.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

===Tegart forts===
[[File:Latrun-Police-Building.jpg|right|thumb|A surviving police [[Tegart fort]] at [[Latrun]] devised by Sir [[Charles Tegart]], who also introduced border fences and [[Arab Investigation Centres]]. ]]

Sir [[Charles Tegart]] was a senior police officer brought into Palestine from the colonial force of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]]&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; on 21 October 1937.&lt;ref name=horne235-6&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tegart and his deputy [[David Petrie]] (later head of [[MI5]]) advised a greater emphasis on foreign intelligence gathering and closure of Palestine's borders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2008, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of those enrolled in the Palestinian gendarmerie, Tegart had served in Great Britain's repression of the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the security proposals he introduced exceeded measures adopted down to this time elsewhere in the British Empire. 70 fortresses were erected throughout the country at strategic choke points and near Palestinian villages which, if assessed as "bad", were subjected to [[collective punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin-Grob-Fitzgibbon,'Britain's small wars: the challenge to Empire,' in Randall D. Law, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZCsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181 ''The Routledge History of Terrorism,''] Routledge, 2015, pp. 177–189, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Anonymous Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel, 1917–1947,'' Knopf, 2015, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;   Accordingly, from 1938 [[Gilbert Mackereth]], the British Consul in Damascus, corresponded with Syrian and Transjordan authorities regarding border control and security to counteract arms smuggling and "terrorist" infiltration and produced a report for Tegart on the activities of the Palestine Defence Committee in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/mec/MEChandlists/GB165-0281-Tegart-Collection.pdf |title=File And Item Level Description of the Sir Charles Tegart Collection |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegart recommended the construction of a frontier road with a barbed wire fence, which became known as Tegart's wall, along the borders with [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] to help prevent the flow of insurgents, goods and weapons.&lt;ref name=horne235-6/&gt; Tegart encouraged close co-operation with the Jewish Agency.&lt;ref name=segev428&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by the [[Histadrut]] construction company [[Solel Boneh]].&lt;ref name=segev428/&gt; The total cost was £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=segev428/&gt; The Army forced the fellahin to work on the roads without pay.&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 150"&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Almog IL15 Pillboxgoren.jpg|right|thumb|Pillbox built along the route of [[Tegart's wall]], still standing today near [[Goren]] industrial zone, northern [[Israel]]]]
Tegart introduced [[Arab Investigation Centres]] where prisoners were subjected to beatings, [[foot whipping]], electric shocks, [[denailing]] and what is now known as "[[waterboarding]]".&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Tegart also imported [[Doberman Pinscher]]s from South Africa and set up a special centre in Jerusalem to train interrogators in torture.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Royal Air Force===
The [[Royal Air Force]] developed [[close air support]] into its then most refined form during the Arab Revolt.&lt;ref name=omissi&gt;Omissi, 1990, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Air patrols had been found effective in keeping convoys and trains free from attack, but this did not help to expose insurgents to battle conditions likely to cause their defeat.&lt;ref name=omissi/&gt; From the middle of June 1936 wireless vehicles accompanied all convoys and patrols.&lt;ref name=omissi/&gt; During rebel attacks these vehicles could issue emergency "XX calls" (XX with a coded location), which were given priority over all other radio traffic, to summon aerial reinforcements.&lt;ref name=omissi/&gt; Bombers, which were usually airborne within five minutes, could then either attack insurgents directly or "fix" their position for infantry troops. Forty-seven such XX calls were issued during the revolt, causing heavy losses to the rebels.&lt;ref name=omissi/&gt; In the June 1936 [[Battle of Nur Shams]] British planes attacked Arab irregulars with machine gun fire.

This use of air power was so successful that the British were able to reduce the regular garrison.&lt;ref name=omissi/&gt;

In 1936 an Air Staff Officer in [[Middle East Command]] based in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], known as an advocate of "air policing",&lt;ref&gt;Rotter, 2008, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; commented on the revolt saying that "one 250&amp;nbsp;lb. or 500&amp;nbsp;lb. bomb in each village that speaks out of turn" would satisfactorily solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, Ian and Andrew. "Terrorism Review." ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Volume 17, Issue 2, 1988, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Harris was promoted to [[Air Commodore]] and in 1938 he was posted to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Trans-Jordan]] as [[Air Officer Commanding]] the RAF contingent in the region until September 1939. "Limited" bombing attacks on Arab villages were carried out by the RAF,&lt;ref&gt;Omissi, 1990, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; although at times this involved razing whole villages.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris described the system by which recalcitrant villages were kept under control by [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombardment]] as "Air-Pin".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft of the RAF were also used to drop propaganda leaflets over Palestinian towns and villages telling the fellahin that they were the main sufferers of the rebellion and threatening an increase in taxes.&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 150"/&gt;

Low flying RAF squadrons were able to produce detailed intelligence on the location of [[Roadblock (barrier)|road blocks]], sabotaged bridges, railways and pipelines.&lt;ref name=empires&gt;Thomas, 2008, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; RAF aerial photographs were also used to build up a detailed map of Arab population distribution.&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;

Although the British Army was responsible for setting up the Arab counter-insurgent forces (known as the peace bands) and supplying them with arms and money these were operated by [[RAF Intelligence]], commanded by [[Patrick Domville]].&lt;ref&gt;Black and Morris, 1991, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harouvi, 1999, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the revolt RAF assets in the region comprised a bomber flight at RAF Ramleh, an [[RAF Regiment|RAF armoured car flight]] at Ramleh, fourteen bomber squadrons at RAF Amman, and a RAF armoured car company at [[Ma'an]].&lt;ref name="Millman 1998 22"/&gt;

===Role of the Royal Navy===
[[File:HMS Malaya.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Navy]] used naval mines from [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']] to destroy Palestinian houses.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;]]
At the beginning of the Revolt crew from the Haifa Naval Force's two [[cruiser]]s were used to carry out tasks ashore, manning two [[howitzer]]s and naval lorries equipped with [[QF 2 pounder naval gun]]s and searchlights used to disperse Arab snipers.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;Stewart, 2002, pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of June two [[destroyer]]s were used to patrol the coast of Palestine in a bid to prevent [[gun running]].&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; These searched as many as 150 vessels per week and were an effective preventive measure.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; At the request of the Army additional naval platoons landed in July to help protect Haifa and Jewish settlements in the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; The Navy also relieved the Army of duties in Haifa by using nine naval platoons to form the ''Haifa Town Force'' and in August three naval platoons were landed to support the police.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

Following publication of the Peel Commission's report in July 1937 [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] sailed to Haifa where landing parties were put ashore to maintain calm.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Various other naval vessels continued with this role until the end of the revolt.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

Following the Irgun's detonation of a large bomb in a market in Haifa on 6 July 1938 the High Commissioner signalled the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], Admiral Sir [[Dudley Pound]], requesting the assistance of naval vessels capable of providing landing parties.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Pound dispatched HMS ''Repulse'' and diverted [[HMS Emerald (D66)|HMS ''Emerald'']] to Haifa, which arrived the same day and landed five platoons, one to each police district.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; HMS ''Repulse'' relieved HMS ''Emerald'' the following day and after another bomb was detonated on 10 July five platoons from the ship, made up of sailors and [[Royal Marines]], dispersed mobs and patrolled the city.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

On 11 July provision of three platoons from ''Repulse'' released men of the [[The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|West Kent Regiment]] for a punitive mission against Arabs who had attacked a Jewish colony near Haifa.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; By 17 July the ''Repulse'' established a Company Headquarters where seamen and Royal Marines manned a 3.7-inch howitzer.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Sailors, Royal Marines, and men of the [[Suffolk Regiment]], who had embarked on the ''Repulse'', accompanied foot patrols of the [[Palestine Police Force]].&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

The ''Repulse'', {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']] provided howitzer crews which were sent ashore to combat gun running near the border with [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Detained Arabs were used to build [[Fortification|emplacements]] and the howitzers were moved quickly between these positions by day and night to confuse bandits as to the likely direction of fire.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; Periodically, the guns were used to fire warning rounds close to the vicinity of villages believed to have rebel sympathies.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;

====Strategic importance of Haifa====
Britain had completed the modern deep-sea port in Haifa in 1933 and finished laying a pipeline from the Iraqi [[oilfield]]s to Haifa in 1935,&lt;ref name="kramer293"&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the outbreak of the revolt. A refinery for processing oil from the pipeline was completed by Consolidated Refineries Ltd, a company jointly owned by [[British Petroleum]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]], in December 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrier and Bamberg, 1994, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

These facilities enhanced the strategic importance of Palestine and of Haifa in particular in Britain's control of the eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="kramer293"/&gt; The threat to British control of the region posed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] in October 1935 and the deteriorating situation in Europe toward the end of the 1930s probably made British policy makers more willing to make concessions to Arab governments on the Palestine issue following the furore over the recommendations of the Peel Commission.&lt;ref name="kramer293"/&gt;

===Role of the British intelligence services===
[[File:Reuven Shiloah.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reuven Shiloah|Reuven Zaslany]] (Shiloah), later first director of [[Mossad]], worked closely with British intelligence during the Arab Revolt. ]]
The Arab Revolt was the last major test of Britain's security services in the Middle East before World War II.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6&gt;Thomas, 2008, pp. 244–246.&lt;/ref&gt; The development and deployment of intelligence-led counterinsurgency strategies was integral to the restoration of British [[British Empire|imperial]] control in Palestine as the revolt had demonstrated to the British authorities how a [[revolution|popular rebellion]] could undermine intelligence gathering operations and thereby impair their ability to predict and respond to inter-communal disorder.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; The rebellion had brought together urban nationalism and peasant economic grievances arising from rural poverty and landlessness, which was blamed on British misrule.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; Accordingly, the Palestinian revolt targeted the political and economic apparatus of the British [[colony|colonial state]], including the communications network, pipelines, police stations, army outposts and British personnel.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; It was this aspect of the revolt, rather than attacks on Jews or violence between rivals for leadership of the national movement, that most concerned the high commissioner.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; The mandate authorities were further disturbed by the unity of purpose displayed during the six-month [[Palestinian general strike|general strike]] and by the resurgence of [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] nationalism as evidenced by the rise of the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Istiqlal Party]].&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt;

In response to these challenges the British army command ("I" Branch) and battalion headquarters across Palestine issued a daily intelligence bulletin every afternoon detailing political developments.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; Special Service Officers (SSOs) assigned to intelligence gathering reported directly to their local command headquarters and their cars were equipped with wireless transmitters so that high grade intelligence could be reported directly to "I" Branch immediately.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt; These sources of intelligence gradually became more important than those of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|C.I.D.]] in Palestine, which had been dependent on Arab informers, and which were no longer reliable.&lt;ref name=thomas244-6/&gt;

In September 1937, the Jewish Agency appointed [[Reuven Shiloah|Reuven Zaslany]] liaison officer for intelligence and security affairs between the Political Department of the Jewish Agency and the intelligence arms of the Royal Air Force and the C.I.D.&lt;ref name=harouvi32&gt;Harouvi, 1999, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Zaslany sifted through intelligence collected by Jewish-controlled field operatives and forwarded it to the British military.&lt;ref name=harouvi32/&gt; He was a frequent visitor at the headquarters of British intelligence and the army, the police and C.I.D. and he also travelled to [[Damascus]] to liaise with the Arab opposition's peace bands and with the [[Consul (representative)|British Consul]] in Iraq.&lt;ref name=harouvi32/&gt; Colonel [[Frederick Kisch]], a British army officer and Zionist leader, was appointed chief liaison officer between the British army and the Jewish Agency Executive with Zaslany as his deputy.&lt;ref name=harouvi32/&gt; Zaslany also worked as interpreter for Patrick Domville, head of [[RAF Intelligence]] in Palestine (who was described by Haganah leader Dov Hos as the "best Zionist informer on the English"), until the latter was posted to Iraq in 1938, and through him became acquainted with many of the British intelligence officers.&lt;ref&gt;Frilling, 2005, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the Jewish Agency's intelligence groups were responsible for bugging the Peel Commission hearings in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, 2008, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Arab Revolt convinced the Agency that a central intelligence service was required and this led to the formation of a counter-intelligence agency known as the ''[[Ran (Haganah unit)|Ran]]'' (headed by [[Yehuda Arazi]], who also helped to smuggle rifles, machine guns and ammunition from Poland to Palestine) and thereafter in 1940 to the creation of [[Shai (Haganah unit)|SHAI]], the forerunner of [[Mossad]].&lt;ref&gt;Frilling, 2005, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaniuk, 2001, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laffin, 1979, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British and Jewish co-operation===
{{Further|Notrim}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6918 Wingates Special Night.jpg|thumb|right|Men of Captain [[Orde Wingate]]'s [[Special Night Squads]], possibly in [[Kfar Tavor]].]]
[[File:Ghaffis in Nesher 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Notrim|Ghaffirs]]'' watching a settlement  in [[Nesher]] near [[Haifa]]. British authorities provided the guns and uniforms.]]
The ''[[Haganah]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "defence"), a Jewish paramilitary organisation, actively supported British efforts to suppress the uprising, which reached 10,000 Arab fighters at their peak during the summer and fall of 1938. Although the British administration did not officially recognise the ''Haganah'', the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the [[Jewish Settlement Police]], [[Jewish Supernumerary Police]], and [[Special Night Squads]]. The Special Night Squads engaged in activities described by colonial administrator [[Hugh Mackintosh Foot, Baron Caradon|Sir Hugh Foot]], as 'extreme and cruel' involving torture, whipping, abuse and execution of Arabs.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

The British authorities maintained, financed and armed the Jewish police from this point onward until the end of the Mandate,&lt;ref&gt;Kimmerling, 1989, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of September 1939 around 20,000 Jewish policeman, supernumeraries and settlement guards had been authorised to carry arms by the government,&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, 2003, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; which also distributed weapons to outlying Jewish settlements,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed the Haganah to acquire arms.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, 2000, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Independently of the British, ''[[Ta'as]]'', the Haganah's clandestine munitions industry, developed an 81-mm mortar and manufactured mines and grenades, 17,500 of the latter being produced for use during the revolt.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacharov, 2004, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, 2008, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1937, the British imposed the death penalty for unauthorised possession of weapons, ammunition, and explosives, but since many Jews had permission to carry weapons and store ammunition for defence this order was directed primarily against Palestinian Arabs and most of the 112 executed in [[Acre Prison]] were hanged for illegal possession of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle all of the joint units functioned as part of the British administration, but in practice they were under the command of the Jewish Agency and "intended to form the backbone of a Jewish military force set up under British sponsorship in preparation for the inevitable clash with the Arabs."&lt;ref name=segev427&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency and the Mandate authorities shared the costs of the new units equally.&lt;ref name=segev428/&gt; The administration also provided security services to Jewish commercial concerns at cost.&lt;ref name=segev428/&gt;

Jewish and British officials worked together to co-ordinate manhunts and collective actions against villages and also discussed the imposition of penalties and sentences.&lt;ref name=segev427/&gt; Overall, the Jewish Agency was successful in making "the point that the Zionist movement and the [[British Empire]] were standing shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy, in a war in which they had common goals."&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion also inspired the Jewish Agency to expand the intelligence-gathering of its Political Department and especially of its Arab Division, with the focus changing from political to military intelligence.&lt;ref name=morris149&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Division set up a network of Jewish controllers and Arab agents around the country.&lt;ref name=morris149/&gt; Some of the intelligence gathered was shared with the British administration, the exchange of information sometimes being conducted by [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]], then head of the Jewish Agency, directly with the high commissioner himself.&lt;ref name=segev427/&gt; Shertok also advised the administration on political affairs, on one occasion convincing the high commissioner not to arrest Professor [[Joseph Klausner]], a [[Revisionist Maximalism|Revisionist Maximalist]] activist who had played a key role in the [[Pro-Wailing Wall Committee|riots of 1929]], because of the likely negative consequences.&lt;ref name="segev427"/&gt;

'''†''' Ta'as and Rekhesh were developed and expanded during the Arab Revolt but already existed before 1936 and of course the Haganah had been in operation from the earliest days of the Mandate.

====Haganah intelligence services====
There was no single body within the Jewish settlement capable of co-ordinating intelligence gathering before 1939.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Johnson, 2010, p. 807.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then there were four separate organisations without any regular or formal liaison.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; These were an underground militia, forerunner of the first official information service, ''Sherut Yediot'' ([[Shai (Haganah unit)|Shai]]); the ''Arab Platoon'' of the [[Palmach]], which was staffed by Jews who were Arab-speaking and Arab-looking; ''Rekhesh'', the arms procurement service, which had its own intelligence gathering capabilities, and likewise the ''[[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]]'', the illegal immigration service.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; In mid-1939 the effort to co-ordinate the activities of these groups was led by [[Shaul Avigur]] and [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]].&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

In 1931, a [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] underground splinter group broke off from Haganah, calling itself the ''[[Irgun]]'' organisation (or ''Etzel'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac02.htm |title=THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE IRGUN |website=www.etzel.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation took its orders from Revisionist leader [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] who was at odds with the dominant [[Mapai|Labour Zionist]] movement led by David Ben-Gurion.&lt;ref name=kramer242&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The rift between the two Zionist movements further deteriorated in 1933 when two Revisionists were blamed for the murder of [[Haim Arlosoroff]], who had negotiated the [[Haavara Agreement]] between the Jewish Agency and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=kramer242/&gt; The agreement brought 52,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939, and generated $30,000,000 for the then almost bankrupt Jewish Agency, but in addition to the difficulties with the Revisionists, who advocated a boycott of Germany, it caused the Yishuv to be isolated from the rest of world Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Bajohr, 2002, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 1991, pp. 22, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia, 2008, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the events of the Arab Revolt blurred the differences between the gradualist approach of Ben-Gurion and the Maximalist [[Iron Wall (essay)|Iron Wall]] approach of Jabotinsky and turned militarist patriotism into a bipartisan philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, 2005, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ben-Gurion's own [[Peulot Meyuhadot|Special Operations Squads]] conducted a punitive operation in the Arab village of [[Lubya]] firing weapons into a room through a window killing two men and one woman and injuring three people, including two children.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, pp. 386–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1937 the Irgun instituted a wave of bombings against Arab crowds and buses.&lt;ref name=morris147&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in the conflict massive bombs were placed in crowded Arab public places, killing and maiming dozens.&lt;ref name=morris147/&gt; These attacks substantially increased Arab casualties and sowed terror among the population.&lt;ref name=morris147/&gt; The first attack was on 11 November 1937, killing two Arabs at the bus depot near [[Jaffa Road|Jaffa Street]] in Jerusalem and then on 14 November, a day later commemorated as the "Day of the Breaking of the ''[[Havlagah]]'' (restraint)," Arabs were killed in simultaneous attacks around Palestine.&lt;ref name=morris147/&gt; More deadly attacks followed: on 6 July 1938 21 Arabs were killed and 52 wounded by a bomb in a Haifa market; on 25 July a second market bomb in Haifa killed at least 39 Arabs and injured 70; a bomb in Jaffa's vegetable market on 26 August killed 24 Arabs and wounded 39.&lt;ref name=morris147/&gt; The attacks were condemned by the Jewish Agency.&lt;ref name=morris147/&gt;

The Arab leader Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and his associates also received funding from Fascist Italy during the revolt as the Italians were in dispute with the United Kingdom over [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and wished not only to disrupt the British rear&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; but also to extend Italian influence in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Arielli, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Files seized at the German High Command in Flansburg reveal that the Arab riots "only through funds made available by Germany to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was it possible to carry out the revolt in Palestine."

===Role of the "Peace bands"===

The "peace bands" (''fasa'il al-salam'') or "[[Nashashibi]] units" were made up of disaffected Arab peasants recruited by the British administration and the Nashashibis in late 1938 to battle against Arab rebels during the revolt.&lt;ref name="Krämer, 2008, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref name=reader181&gt;Gettleman and Schaar, 2003, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their peasant origins the bands were representative mainly of the interests of landlords and rural notables.&lt;ref name=reader181/&gt; Some peace bands also sprang up in the Nablus area, on [[Mount Carmel]] (a stronghold of the [[Druze]] who largely opposed the rebellion after 1937), and around [[Nazareth]] without connection to the Nashashibi-[[al-Husayni|Husayni]] power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1937 the main opposition figures among the Arabs approached the Jewish Agency for funding and assistance,&lt;ref name=morris154&gt;Morris, 1999, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; motivated by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008p146"/&gt; In October 1937, shortly after [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the leader of the Arab Higher Committee, had fled from Palestine to escape British retribution, [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]] had written to Moshe Shertok stating his full willingness to co-operate with the Jewish Agency and to agree with whatever policy it proposed.&lt;ref name="Cohen, 2009, p. 125"/&gt; From early in 1938 the Nashashibis received funding specifically to conduct anti-rebel operations, with Raghib al-Nashashibi himself receiving £5,000.&lt;ref name=morris154/&gt; The British also supplied funding to the peace bands and sometimes directed their operations.&lt;ref name=morris154/&gt;

Fakhri Nashashibi was particularly successful in recruiting peace bands in the [[Mount Hebron|Hebron hills]], on one occasion in December 1938 gathering 3,000 villagers for a rally in [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]], also attended by the British military commander of the Jerusalem District General [[Richard O'Connor]].&lt;ref name=morris154/&gt;

Just two months earlier, on 15 October 1938, rebels had seized the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] and barricaded the gates.&lt;ref name=horne237&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor had planned the operation by which men of the [[Coldstream Guards]], [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] and [[Black Watch]] recaptured the Old City, killing 19 rebels.&lt;ref name=morris154/&gt; He was later to win fame as the field commander for [[Operation Compass|Operation ''Compass'']] in World War II, in which his forces completely destroyed a much larger Italian army—a victory which nearly drove the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] from Africa, and in turn, led [[Adolf Hitler]] to send the [[Deutsches Afrika Korps|German Africa Corps]] under [[Erwin Rommel]] to try to reverse the situation.

Towards the end of the revolt in May 1939 the authorities dissolved the peace bands and confiscated their arms.&lt;ref name=morris154/&gt; However, because members of the bands had become tainted in the eyes of the Palestinian Arabs, and some were under sentence of death, they had little choice but to continue the battle against the national movement's leadership, which they did with the continuing help of the Zionist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 2009, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of rebel leaders===

[[File:Abd al-Rahim Hajj Muhammad portrait, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad]] was designated the "General Commander of the Revolt" by the [[Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine]]]]

[[File:Farhan Sa'di arrested by British.jpg|thumb|right|[[Farhan al-Sa'di]] following his arrest by [[Palestine Police|British Mandatory police]], 1937. He was later executed. Al-Sa'di was a key actor in setting off the revolt with his April 1936 attack on a bus, which left two Jewish passengers dead.]]

At least 282 rebel leaders took part in the Arab Revolt, including four Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 2009, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel forces consisted of loosely organized bands known as ''fasa'il''&lt;ref name="Swedenberg125"&gt;Swedenberg, 2003, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayigh, p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; (sing: ''fasil'').&lt;ref name="Swedenberg125"/&gt; The leader of a ''fasil'' was known as a ''qa'id al-fasil'' (pl. ''quwwa'id al-fasa'il''), which means "band commander".&lt;ref&gt;Swedenberg, 2003, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish press often referred to them as "brigands", while the British authorities and media called them "bandits", "terrorists", "rebels" or "insurgents", but never "nationalists".&lt;ref name=horne228&gt;Horne, 2003 p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ursabat'' (meaning "gangs") was another Arabic term used for the rebels,&lt;ref name="Anglim9"/&gt; and it spawned the British soldiers' nickname for all rebels, which was ''Oozlebart''.&lt;ref name=horne228/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anglim9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788283,00.html |title=PALESTINE: Oozlebarts and Cantor |date=15 August 1938 |publisher= |via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Simon Anglim, the rebel groups were divided into general categories: ''mujahadeen'' and ''fedayeen''. The former were guerrillas who engaged in armed confrontations, while the latter committed acts of sabotage.&lt;ref name="Anglim9"&gt;Anglim, 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to later accounts of some surviving rebel leaders from the Galilee, the ''mujahideen'' maintained little coordination with the nominal hierarchy of the revolt. Most ambushes were the result of a local initiative undertaken by a ''qa'id'' or a group of ''quwwa'id'' from the same area.&lt;ref name="Swedenberg125"/&gt;

====Galilee====
Abdul Khallik was an effective peasant leader appointed by [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]] who caused great damage and loss of life in the [[Nazareth District]] and was thus a significant adversary of the Mandate and Jewish settlement authorities.&lt;ref name="hornefah"&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 224, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; He was trapped by British troops in a major engagement on 2 October 1938 and was killed whilst trying to lead his men to safety.&lt;ref name="hornefah"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUEn&amp;Source=MyColl&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;AppName=2&amp;BaseHref=PLS/1938/10/03&amp;EntityId=Ar00100&amp;PageLabelPrint=1 'Situation in Brief: Official Reports'], ''Palestine Post'', Monday, 3 October 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir]] was the main Qassamite rebel leader in the [[Upper Galilee]] and was the only active rebel leader on the ground who was a member of the Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad.&lt;ref name="KedourieQassamite"&gt;{{Citation |first=Elie |last=Kedourie |title=Zionism and Arabism in Palestine and Israe |chapter=Qassamites in the Arab Revolt, 1936–39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tD-sCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT119&amp;dq=Farhan+Qassam+Tulkarm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qt5sVbL4NovXsAX4-4DYBw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Farhan%20Qassam%20Tulkarm&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=9781317442721}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdallah al-Asbah]] was a prominent commander active in the [[Safad]] region of northeastern Galilee. He was killed by British forces who besieged him and his comrades near the border with [[Lebanon]] in early 1937.&lt;ref name="Ghandour"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ghandour |first=Zeina B. |title=A Discourse on Domination in Mandate Palestine: Imperialism, Property and Insurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Dd6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT186&amp;lpg=PT186&amp;dq=Safad+Asbah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G2tU8fGU0o&amp;sig=LtHqLswkWweLmscGn-R9iMlIleY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mriaVdnNH4KiNsPMgfgL&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Asbah&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jabal Nablus area====
[[Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad]] from the [[Tulkarm]] area was a deeply religious, intellectual man and as a fervent anti-Zionist, he was deeply committed to the revolt.&lt;ref name=hornehajj&gt;Horne, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;224–226, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded second to Qawukji in terms of leadership ability and maintained his independence from the exiled rebel leadership in Damascus.&lt;ref name=hornehajj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, 2003, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He personally led his  ''fasa'il'' and carried out nighttime attacks against British targets in the revolt's early stage in 1936. When the revolt was renewed in April 1937, he established a more organised command hierarchy consisting of four main brigades who operated in the north-central highlands (Tulkarm-Nablus-Jenin area).&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, 2012, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He competed for the position of General Commander of the Revolt with Aref Abdul Razzik, and the two served the post in rotation from September 1938 to February 1939, when al-Hajj Muhammad was confirmed as the sole General Commander.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, 2012, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hajj Muhammad refused to carry out political assassinations at the behest of political factions, including al-Husayni, once stating "I don't work for Husayniya ('Husanyni-ism'), but for wataniya ('nationalism')."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, 2003, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He is still known by Palestinians as a hero and martyr and is regarded as a [[metonym]] "for a national movement that was popular, honourable, religious, and lofty in its aims and actions."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, 2003, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot dead in a firefight with British forces outside the village of [[Sanur, Jenin|Sanur]] on 27 March 1939, after Farid Irsheid's peace band informed the authorities of his location.&lt;ref name=hornehajj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frisch, 2008, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, 2009, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, 2012, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yusuf Abu Durra]], a Qassamite leader in the [[Jenin]] area, was born in [[Silat al-Harithiya]] and before becoming a rebel worked as a Gazoz vendor.&lt;ref name=horneysad&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 224, 226, 228, 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to be a narrow-minded man who thrived on extortion and cruelty and thus became greatly feared.&lt;ref name=horneysad/&gt; [[Yusuf Hamdan]] was Durra's more respected lieutenant and later a leader of his own unit; he was killed by an army patrol in 1939 and buried in [[al-Lajjun]].&lt;ref name=horneysad/&gt; Durra himself was apprehended by the [[Arab Legion]] in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] on 25 July 1939 and subsequently hanged.&lt;ref name=horneysad/&gt;

Fakhri Abdul Hadi of [[Arraba, Jenin|Arrabah]] worked closely with Fawzi al-Qawukji in 1936, but later defected to the British authorities.&lt;ref name="hornefah"/&gt; He bargained for a pardon by offering to collaborate with the British on countering rebel propaganda.&lt;ref name=hornefah/&gt; Once on the payroll of the British consul in Damascus, [[Gilbert Mackereth]], he carried out many attacks against the rebels in 1938–1939 as leader of his own "peace band".&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, 2003, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, MacKereth &amp; Rabinovich, 1985, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|''Aref had a little mare&lt;br /&gt;Its coat as white as snow&lt;br /&gt;And where that mare and Aref went&lt;br /&gt;We're jiggered if we know.'' – British Army verse.}}
Aref Abdul Razzik of [[Tayibe]] was responsible for the area south of Tulkarm and was known for evading capture whilst being pursued by the security forces.&lt;ref name=horneaar&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 225, 228–230.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed his bulletins as 'The Ghost of Sheikh Qassam'.&lt;ref name=horneaar/&gt; Razzik assumed a place in British army folklore and the troops sang a song about him.&lt;ref name=horneaar/&gt; Razzik was capable and daring and gained a reputation as one of the army's problem heroes.&lt;ref name=horneaar/&gt;

====Jerusalem area====
[[Issa Battat]] was a peasant leader in the southern hills below Jerusalem who caused enormous damage to security patrols in his area.&lt;ref name=horneib&gt;Horne, 2003, pp. 225, 235, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed by a patrol of armed police in a battle near Hebron in 1937.&lt;ref name=horneib/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Spectator'', 1937, Volume 3, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab volunteers====
In the first phase of the revolt, around 300 volunteers, mostly veterans of the [[Ottoman Army]] and/or rebels from the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] (1925–27), deployed in northern Palestine. Their overall commander was Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his deputies were [[Said al-As]] and [[Muhammad al-Ashmar]]. Qawuqji also led the volunteer force's Iraqi and Transjordanian battalions, and al-Ashmar was commander of the Syrian battalion, which largely consisted of volunteers from Damascus's [[al-Midan|al-Midan Quarter]], [[Hama]] and [[Homs]]. The Druze ex-Ottoman officer, [[Hamad Sa'ab]], commanded the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ed. Schayegh, 2015, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==

===Casualties===

[[File:WhitePaper1939Poster.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish protest demonstrations against the 1939 Palestine White Paper. One of the big posters displayed the previous day.]]
Despite the intervention of up to 50,000 British troops and 15,000 Haganah men, the uprising continued for over three years. By the time it concluded in September 1939, more than 5,000 Arabs, over 300 Jews, and 262 Britons had been killed and at least 15,000 Arabs were wounded.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

===Impact on the Jewish Yishuv===
{{Further|Tower and stockade}}
In the overall context of the Jewish settlement's development in the 1930s the physical losses endured during the revolt were relatively insignificant.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; Although hundreds were killed and property was damaged no Jewish settlement was captured or destroyed and several dozen new ones were established.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; Over 50,000 new Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; In 1936 Jews made up about one-third of the population.&lt;ref name=kramer295&gt;Krämer, 2008, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostilities contributed to further disengagement of the Jewish and Arab economies in Palestine, which were intertwined to some extent until that time. Development of the economy and infrastructure accelerated.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; For example, whereas the Jewish city of [[Tel Aviv]] relied on the nearby Arab seaport of [[Jaffa]], hostilities dictated the construction of a separate Jewish-run seaport for Tel Aviv,&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; inspiring the delighted Ben-Gurion to note in his diary "we ought to reward the Arabs for giving us the impetus for this great creation."&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Metal works were established to produce armoured sheeting for vehicles and a rudimentary arms industry was founded.&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; The settlement's [[Egged (company)|transportation capabilities]] were enhanced and Jewish unemployment was relieved owing to the employment of police officers,&lt;ref name=morris160/&gt; and replacement of striking Arab labourers, employees, craftsman and farmers by Jewish workers.&lt;ref name=kramer295/&gt; Most of the important industries in Palestine were owned by Jews and in trade and the banking sector they were much better placed than the Arabs.&lt;ref name=kramer295/&gt;

As a result of collaboration with the British colonial authorities and security forces many thousands of young men had their first experience of military training, which [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]] and Haganah leader [[Eliyahu Golomb]] cited as one of the fruits of the [[Haganah]]'s policy of [[havlagah]] (restraint).&lt;ref name=shapira&gt;Shapira, 1999, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Jewish settlement in Palestine was dismayed by the publication of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, David Ben-Gurion remained undeterred, believing that the policy would not be implemented, and in fact Neville Chamberlain had told him that the policy would last at the very most only for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event the White Paper quotas were exhausted only in December 1944, over five and a half years later, and in the same period the United Kingdom absorbed 50,000 Jewish refugees and the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada and South Africa) took many thousands more.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 439; 459.&lt;/ref&gt; During the War over 30,000 Jews joined the British forces and even the Irgun ceased operations against the British until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, pp. 450–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the Palestinian Arabs===
The revolt weakened the military strength of Palestinian Arabs in advance of their ultimate confrontation with the Jewish settlement in the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] and was thus counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1999, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprising, British authorities attempted to confiscate all weapons from the Arab population. This, and the destruction of the main Arab political leadership in the revolt, greatly hindered their military efforts in the [[1948 Palestine war]],&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 159"/&gt; where imbalances between the Jewish and Arab economic performance, social cohesion, political organisation and military capability became apparent.&lt;ref name=kramer295/&gt;

The Mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini and his supporters directed a Jihad against any person who did not obey the Mufti. Their national struggle was a religious holy war, and the incarnation of both the Palestinian Arab nation and Islam was Hajj Amin al-Husseini. Anyone who rejected his leadership was a heretic and his life was forfeit.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008p128"/&gt; After the Peel report publication, the murders of Arabs leaders who opposed the Mufti were accelerated.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008p122"/&gt; Pressed by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership, the opposition had a security cooperation with the Jews.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008p146"/&gt; The flight of wealthy Arabs, which occurred during the revolt, was also replicated in 1947–49.&lt;ref name="Krämer, 2008, p. 291"/&gt;

Thousands of Palestinian houses were destroyed, and massive financial costs were incurred because of the general strike and the devastation of fields, crops and orchards. The economic boycott further damaged the fragile Palestinian Arab economy through loss of sales and goods and increased unemployment.&lt;ref name=morrisrv159-160/&gt;

Clearly, the revolt did not achieve its goals, although it is "credited with signifying the birth of the Arab Palestinian identity."&lt;ref&gt;Nashif, 2008, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally credited with forcing the issuance of the [[White Paper of 1939]] in which Britain retreated from the partition arrangements proposed by the Peel Commission in favour of the creation of a [[one-state solution|binational state]] within ten years, although The League of Nations commission held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past.&lt;ref name="avalon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011p159"&gt;{{cite book |author=Benny Morris |title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-78805-4 |page=159 |chapter=chp. 4 |quote="Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Paper of 1939]] was regarded by many as incompatible with the commitment to a Jewish National Home in Palestine, as proclaimed in the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. Al-Husseini rejected the new policy, although it seems that the ordinary Palestinian Arab accepted the [[White Paper of 1939]]. His biographer, [[Philip Mattar]] wrote that in that case, the Mufti preferred his personal interests and the ideology rather than the practical considerations.&lt;ref name="Morris2011p159"/&gt;

===Impact on the British Empire===
As the inevitable war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] approached, British policy makers concluded that although they could rely on the support of the Jewish population in Palestine, who had no alternative but to support Britain, the support of Arab governments and populations in an area of great strategic importance for the [[British Empire]] was not assured.&lt;ref name=segev437&gt;Segev, 2000, pp. 436–441.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] concluded "if we must offend one side, let us offend the Jews rather than the Arabs."&lt;ref name=segev437/&gt;

In February 1939 Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs [[Malcolm MacDonald]] called together a conference of Arab and Zionist leaders on the future of Palestine at [[St. James's Palace]] in London but the discussions ended without agreement on 27 March.&lt;ref name="kramer293"/&gt; The government's new policy as published in White Paper of 17 May had been determined already and despite Jewish protests and Irgun attacks the British remained resolute.&lt;ref name=segev437/&gt;

There was a growing feeling among British officials that there was nothing left for them to do in Palestine.&lt;ref name=segev437/&gt;
Perhaps the ultimate achievement of the Arab Revolt was to make the British sick of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Major-General Bernard "Monty" Montgomery concluded, "the Jew murders the Arab and the Arab murders the Jew. This is what is going on in Palestine now. And it will go on for the next 50 years in all probability."&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1936–39 Arab Revolt has been and still is marginalized in both Western and [[Israel]]i historiography on Palestine, and even progressive Western scholars have little to say about the [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] struggle of the Palestinian Arab rebels against the British Empire.&lt;ref name=ts&gt;Swedenberg, 2003, pp. xxii, 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenberg's analysis, for instance, the Zionist version of Israeli history acknowledges only one authentic national movement: the struggle for Jewish [[self-determination]] that resulted in the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] in May 1948.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt; Swedenberg writes that the Zionist narrative has no room for an anticolonial and anti-British Palestinian national revolt.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;  Zionists often describe the revolt as a series of "events" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מאורעות תרצ"ו-תרצ"ט) "riots", or "happenings".&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;

The appropriate description was debated by Jewish Agency officials, who were keen not to give a negative impression of Palestine to prospective immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2000, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; In private, however, [[David Ben-Gurion]] was unequivocal: the Arabs, he said, were "fighting dispossession&amp;nbsp;... The fear is not of losing land, but of losing the homeland of the Arab people, which others want to turn into the homeland of the Jewish people."&lt;ref name="Morris, 1999, p. 136"/&gt;

'''Antonio María Pérez de Olaguer Feliu''' (1907–1968) was a Spanish writer and a [[Carlist]] militant. As a man of letters he was recognized by his contemporaries for [[travel literature]], [[novel]] and [[drama]], gaining much popularity in the 1940s and 1950s. Today he is considered mostly a typical representative of early [[Francoist]] culture and his works are denied major value. As a Carlist he remained in the back row, though enjoyed enormous prestige among the [[Catalans|Catalan]] rank and file. For decades he worked to bridge the gap between two groups of Catalan Carlists, the [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Javieristas]] and the [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Sivattistas]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Escolta Street.JPG|thumb|left|[[Manila]], [[First United Building|former Pérez Samanillo department store]] (back, right)]]
Antonio Pérez de Olaguer descended from distinguished families both along the paternal and the maternal line. The ancestors of his father originated from [[Andalusia]]; his grandfather, [[Manuel Pérez Marqueti]] (1829-1889),&lt;ref&gt;''Manuel Joseph Valerio María de los Dolores Marcos Pérez Maqueti'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=luis&amp;n=perez+samanillo here]&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Cádiz]].&lt;ref&gt;and married Augustina Samanillo Fragoso, also from Cádiz, Antonio Pérez de Olaguer, ''Mi padre, un hombre de bien'', Sevilla 1967, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; A physician serving in the navy, in the mid-19th century he engaged in trade with the [[Philippines]], then managed state contracts in the islands, and eventually developed own retail and real estate business in [[Manila]]. He became one of the Philippine tycoons and left a fortune.&lt;ref&gt;his wealth was estimated at 2m pesos, ''El Día'' 02.08.89, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002262238&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The business was inherited by his sons: Antonio’s father [[:es:Luis Pérez Samanillo|Luis Pérez Samanillo]] (1868–1936) and Rafael, who enlarged it further on managing two family-owned companies, R. Pérez Samanillo y Cía and Pérez Samanillo Hermanos.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Filipinas Photo Collection'', [in:] ''Skyscrapercity'' forum (link unavailable as blacklisted by Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; They contributed to urbanization of Manila; the brothers owned much of the [[Paco, Manila|Paco district]], dried the area and commenced residential development; a street in the city still bears their name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hotel de Oriente: the hotel that became a library'', [in:] ''The Crafty Historian'' blog 01.09.14, available [https://jardinsolei.wordpress.com/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; One of few [[Art Deco|art-decó]] buildings in Manila used to be their [[department store]].&lt;ref&gt;designed by Andres Luna de San Pedro and built in 1928, it was known as Edificio Perez-Samanillo. Now it is known as First United Building, see ''wikimapia'' service, available [http://wikimapia.org/#lang=pl&amp;lat=14.598854&amp;lon=120.979208&amp;z=19&amp;m=b&amp;show=/4046143/First-United-Building&amp;search=escolta%20street here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio’s maternal ascendants were related to overseas; his great-great-grandfather [[:es:Antonio Olaguer Feliú|Antonio Olaguer Feliu Heredia]] served as [[:es:Virrey del Río de la Plata|virrey del Rio de la Plata]], his son and Antonio’s great-grandfather [[:es:José Olaguer Feliú y Azcuénaga|José Olaguer Feliu Azcuenaga]] opted for [[Argentina|Argentine]] nationality;&lt;ref&gt;''Francisca de Olaguer-Feliu Ramirez'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=francisca&amp;n=de+olaguer+feliu+ramirez here]. Some other online services provide wrong data, see e.g. ''NN de Olaguer Feliú y Ramirez'' entry, [in:] ''Geni'' genealogical service, available [https://www.geni.com/people/NN-de-Olaguer-Feli%C3%BA-y-Ram%C3%ADrez/6000000035729092458 here]&lt;/ref&gt; his son and Antonio’s grandfather José María Olaguer Feliu Dubonet (1827-1881) was born and lived in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;birth and death dates are quoted after ''José María de Olaguer-Feliu y Dubonet'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=jose+maria&amp;n=de+olaguer+feliu+y+dubonet here], which seemes to be a well-informed source. Information about his birth place – somewhat odd compared to itinerary of his father, related to Spain and Argentina, though still possible – is repeated after Tomás Makintach Calaza, ''Memorial genealogico, histórico, y heraldico de la casa de Azcuenaga'', [in:] ''Genealogia. Revista del Instituto Argentino de Ciencias Genealogicas'' 17 (1977), p. 157, the source which wrongly quotes his death date as 1857&lt;/ref&gt; His son and Antonio’s maternal uncle general [[José Olaguer Feliú|José Olaguer Feliú Ramirez]] became the minister of war in 1922 and later remained active as a [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|primoderiverista]] politician. His daughter and Antonio’s mother, Francisca de Olaguer Feliú Ramirez (1865–1908),&lt;ref&gt;''Francisca de Olaguer-Feliu Ramirez'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=francisca&amp;n=de+olaguer+feliu+ramirez here], Perez de Olaguer 1967, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; also born and raised in the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Pérez de Olaguer Feliu himself provides a different maternal ancestry line. According to his own account, the virrey Antonio Olaguer Feliu Heredia was his great-grandfather (not great-great-grandfather); his son was a „José Olaguer Feliu” (grandfather, no closer information provided) who married Ladislaa Ramirez; their daughter was Francisca Olaguer Feliu Ramirez (mother), see Pérez de Olaguer 1967, p. 88. It would be odd not to trust a first-hand account, yet the dates seem incompatible. The birth date of Antonio Olaguer Feliu Heredia (1742) and this of his alleged granddaughter Francisca (1865) would have been separated by some 120 years&lt;/ref&gt; married Luis Pérez; the couple settled in Manila.
[[File:Casa Pérez Samanillo P1400726.JPG|thumb|160px|[[:ca:Casa Pérez Samanillo|Casa Pérez Samanillo]], Barcelona]]
The [[Spanish–American War|collapse of Spanish rule in 1898]] did not affected the Pérez business much. However, Luis started to invest in Spain, mostly in [[Catalonia]]. In the early 20th century the family permanently settled in a [[:ca:Casa Pérez Samanillo|luxury Barcelona residence]],&lt;ref&gt;''Caras y Caretas'' 20.01.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004407113&amp;page=16 here]&lt;/ref&gt; managing their overseas economy remotely.&lt;ref&gt;he was animating Cámara de Comercio Española de Filipinas, ''Vida Marítima'' 30.01.21, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002917414&amp;page=9 here]&lt;/ref&gt; They had 9 children, some of them born in the Philippines; Antonio was the youngest one.&lt;ref&gt;''Luis Pérez Samanillo'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=luis&amp;n=perez+samanillo here]&lt;/ref&gt; There is almost no information on his childhood and early teenage years, except that he was raised in [[Barcelona]] and very early orphaned by his mother. As in 1911 his father remarried with Asunción Lladó (1884-1963),&lt;ref&gt;''Asunción Lladó Rarmírez'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?n=llado+ramirez&amp;oc=&amp;p=asuncion here]. Asuncion was a step-sister of his late wife Francisca. Francisca's father died early and the widowed Francisca's mother re-married with Isidro Lado. Their daughter was Asuncion, Perez de Olaguer 1967, pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio was brought up by his [[step-mother]]. He studied commerce in an unidentified [[Jesuit]] institution;&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana, Suplemento Annual 1967-1968'', Madrid 1968, p. 392, referred after ''Antonio Pérez de Olaguer y Feliu'', [in:] ''La Tradicio de Catalunya'' service, available [http://latradiciodecatalunya.blogspot.com/2016/07/antonio-perez-de-olaguer-y-feliu.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled heavily, accompanying his father during voyages to the Philippines. Later he inherited at least part of the overseas business.&lt;ref&gt;with income from the Philippine business Perez did not depend on his literary production. It is not clear when the family shut down the overseas enagements; the iconic Manila building, Edificio Perez-Samanillo, was sold to the Americans in the early 1960s&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s or very early 1930s&lt;ref&gt;in 1928 the future wife was already very close with the Perez family, ''La Vanguardia'' 04.11.28, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1907/07/26/pagina-13/33201902/pdf.html here]; their 3rd child was baptised in December 1934, ''ABC'' 11.12.34, available [http://hemeroteca.abcdesevilla.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1934/12/11/031.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio married Sara Moreno Calvo y Ortega (1905-1968).&lt;ref&gt;she passed away 2 months after her husband, ''La Vanguardia'' 25.04.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-31/34322446/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of an Andalusian winegrower&lt;ref&gt;Josep Armengol i Segú, ''El poder de la influencia: geografía del caciquismo en España (1875-1923)'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|9788425911521}}, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberal]] cacique Guillermo Moreno Calvo;&lt;ref&gt;he was the civil governor of the Huelva province in 1911 and later joined the Canalejista faction, María Antonia Peña Guerrero, ''Clientelismo Político y Poderes Periféricos Durante la Restauración: Huelva, 1974-1923'', Huelva 1998, {{ISBN|9788495089175}}, pp. 94, 314, 423. In 1910-1923 he served in the Cortes, see his entry on the official Cortes site, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-125&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2876500%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; he passed into history when later sub-secretary of the [[Alejandro Lerroux|Lerroux]] cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.12.34, available [http://hemeroteca.abcdesevilla.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1934/12/11/031.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the key protagonist of the 1935 [[:es:Asunto Nombela|Nombela affair]].&lt;ref&gt;for details see Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo, ''Guinea durante la II República. El „escandalo Nombela”'', [in:] ''Endoxa'' 37 (2016), pp. 101-119&lt;/ref&gt; The couple settled at calle Muntaner in Barcelona;&lt;ref&gt;César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte.

However, a well-informed genealogical service claims he had also one daughter, see ''Antonio Maria Pérez de Olaguer Feliu'' entry, [in:] ''Geneanet'' service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/martinarriola?lang=es&amp;pz=luis+martin+luisito&amp;nz=arriola+merino&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=antonio+maria&amp;n=perez+de+olaguer+feliu here]&lt;/ref&gt; and all cultivating literary interest of their father in editorial, publishing, theatrical and librarian fields.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 14.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/06/14/pagina-27/34363126/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of them, [[:ca:Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer|Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer Moreno]], became an iconic personality of the Catalan theatre and drama. Antonio lived&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Olaguer was of rather good health, as certified by his constant travelling. His death came entirely unexpected and is attributed to a sudden heart attack, ''La Vanguardia'' 30.03.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-32/34337133/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; to see 17 grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 14.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/06/14/pagina-27/34363126/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer==
[[File:Benedicto Torralba de Damas.jpeg|thumb|160px|left|[[:es:Benedicto Torralba de Damas|Torralba de Damas]]]]
Pérez de Olaguer was a prolific writer and claimed fathering some 50 books.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 14.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/06/14/pagina-27/34363126/pdf.html here]. Only some 30 books have been identified here; perhaps he meant also re-editions&lt;/ref&gt; The genre which prevails is non-fiction; it may be subdivided into 4 sub-genres. Pérez de Olaguer commenced literary career in 1926 with travel literature,&lt;ref&gt;''Ensayos literarios'', a set of juvenile reflections on his global journeys, ''La Vanguardia'' 15.01.26, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1923/10/21/pagina-13/33245480/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; followed – as he travelled around the world 6 times&lt;ref&gt;the last time in the early 1960s; ''La Vanguardia'' 12.05.60, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1960/03/08/pagina-31/32723942/pdf.html here]; needless to say he had many adventures, including sinking of a ship he travelled on, ''La Vanguardia'' 16.12.60, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1960/09/14/pagina-31/32726466/pdf.html here]. Perhaps the most dramatic story occurred in relation to a domestic flight from Madrid to Barcelona; the flight was fully booked and at the airport Pérez de Olaguer ceded his place to someone who urgently wanted to fly but had not ticket. The plane crashed, killing all those on board. An unsourced story referred after Alcalá 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; – with subsequent volumes in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;''De Occidente á Oriente por Suez''&lt;/ref&gt; 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''Mi vuelta al mundo''&lt;/ref&gt; 1941&lt;ref&gt;''Novelista que vio las estrellas'', an account of Pérez de Olaguer meeting the Hollywood stars in the US&lt;/ref&gt; and 1944;&lt;ref&gt;''Mi segunda vuelta al mundo''&lt;/ref&gt; the last one is an account of truly amazing tour around the world in the midst of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;his voyage, apparently undertook between 1942 and 1944, took him across many frontlines. First from neutral Spain Pérez de Olaguer travelled to Fascist Italy, where he visited the Carlist sanctuary in Trieste. Then he crossed to the British-held Egypt, along the Asian coast made it to India and then, also by sea, to the Japanese-held Philippines. Next he crossed the Pacific and the United States (already in war), and in the midst of U-boot warfare crossed the Atlantic to return to Spain. This incredible voyage climaxed during his stay in the Philippines. The Japanese were initially very corteous towards the Spanish colony on the islands and the rupture occurred in wake of the Laurel affair, details of Spanish-Japanese relations in the occupied Philippines in Florentino Rodao, ''La ocupación japonesa en Filipinas y etnicidad hispana (1941-1945)'', [in:] ''Gerónimo de Uztariz'' 25 (2009), pp. 12-18&lt;/ref&gt; Historiography is about three volumes featuring Catholic personalities from the recent past (1933-1940)&lt;ref&gt;''El canonigo Collell'' (1933), ''Piedras vivas'' (1939) and ''El padre Pro precursor'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; and a book on his own father (1967).&lt;ref&gt;''Mi padre, un hombre de bien'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Four volumes of essays anchored in daily life (1950-1953)&lt;ref&gt;S''on mis humores reales'' (1950), ''El mundo por montera'' (1950), ''Al leer será el reír Aventura de amor y de viaje'' (1950), ''Hospital de San Lazaro'' (1953). The last one, sub-titled "Autobiografía novelesca", was a set of stories integrated by the personality of their protagonist, the author&lt;/ref&gt; were written "to cheer up in the dark times". However, Pérez de Olaguer became best known for his works intended to document [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] horror and [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] heroism during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He issued 3 volumes discussing Republican atrocities&lt;ref&gt;''El terror rojo en Cataluña'' (1937), ''El terror rojo en Andalucía'' (1938), ''El terror rojo en la Montaña'' (1939). Later he also used to write biographies of some of the executed – e.g .Melquiades Alvarez - for ''Enciclopedia Espasa'', Josefina Cuesta Bustillo, ''Tiempo y recuerdo: dimensiones temporales de la memorisa política (España 1936-2000)'', [in:] Carlos Navajas Zubeldía (ed.), ''Actas del III Simposio de Historia Actual'', vol. 2, Logroño 2002, {{ISBN|8495747227}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 volumes honoring the Carlist volunteers (1937-1939).&lt;ref&gt;''Los de siempre'' (1937) and ''Lágrimas y sonrisas'' (1938). Later he added also ''Estampas carlistas'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; The work falling into the same testimonial literature which gained him international recognition was a 1947 work documenting the [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese barbarity in the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;''El terror amarillo en Filipinas'' (1947); its abridged English translation, titled ''Terror in Manila'', was published in Manila in 1945. The oldest brother of Antonio, Luis, was killed "a manos de la soldatesca nipona", Perez de Olaguer 1967, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Another genre favored by Pérez de Olaguer was novels. They form two distinctly different groups. Four works are marked by [[grotesque]] style; except one case&lt;ref&gt;''¡Paso al rey!'' (1931) shares the same style yet is set in a fantastic background; it features a story of two cities/peoples in Africa, Alfenia and Tosaca&lt;/ref&gt; the plot is set in contemporary times and the protagonists are involved in twisted intrigues which seem to underline absurdities of daily life, all told in a farcical, optimistic, amusing manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Españolas de Londres'' (1928), ''La ciudad que no tenia mujeres'' (1932) and ''Memorias de un recién casado'' (1939). The last one was reportedly written in the early 1930s and based on personal experiences of the author, ''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 21.08.39, available. [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000223828&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. It was perhaps Pérez de Olaguer’s most successful novel, re-published 4 times, ''La Vanguardia'' 14.06. 67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/06/14/pagina-27/34363126/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content they are benevolent reflections on human confused nature.&lt;ref&gt;though ''¡Paso al rey!'' seems to advance a veiled Traditionalist message. Of two fantastic cities/peoples depicted one was tranquil and ordered, while another criminal and violent. The latter invaded the former and apparently succeeded in overcoming resistance, but there was hope that fortune might change, ''La Hormiga de Oro'' 24.12.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012118668&amp;page=27 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Entirely different are three novels written during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''El romance de Ana María'' (1937), ''Amor y sangre'' (1938) and ''Elvira, Tomás Rúfalo y yo'' (1939), all partially set in Barcelona after the failed 1936 coup. The last one features the most complex plot; Tomás is an emotionally unstable marxist, half-good (hides the protagonist in red Barcelona) and half-bad (murders a priest). The two meet later on the battleground and Tomás is mortally wounded. He confesses, though only to comfort his mother, and suddenly finds peace of mind before passing away, referred after Piotr Sawicki, ''La narrativa española de la Guerra Civil (1936-1975). Propaganda, testimonio y memoria creativa'', Alicante 2010, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; Light message gave way to moralizing objectives related to promotion of the Nationalist cause and grotesque gave way to the horror of wartime setting; what remained was author’s optimism and a penchant for a plot anchored in relations between males and females.
[[File:Más leal que galante.jpg|thumb|160px]]
In terms of drama Pérez de Olaguer underwent internship period in the early 1930s; working for [[:ca:Enrique Rambal Sacía|Enrique Rambal]] he co-adapted novels for stage performance, tasked with providing intriguing episodic dramas which merged high action with musical interludes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Malcolm Batley, David Bradby, ''Morality and Justice: The Challenge of European Theatre'', Amsterdam 2001, {{ISBN|9789042013988}}, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise he adapted his own novel into a 3-act play (1933),&lt;ref&gt;''La ciudad que no tenía mujeres'', ''La Libertad'' 12.07.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000201069&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; which was actually staged.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 09.07.33, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/01/01/pagina-16/33183793/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest success as a playwright came with ''Más leal que galante'' (1935), written together with [[:es:Benedicto Torralba de Damas|Benedicto Torralba de Damas]]. Set in the [[Third Carlist War]] and written in a light verse, the comedy featured a complex romance intrigue with clear Carlist message in the background;&lt;ref&gt;a Carlist officer falls in love with a mysterious beauty who in fact is a Liberal spy, which leads to military disaster. He is to be executed but another female Marta begs for his life. The king allows Andrés to redeem his guilt on the battlefield, which he does by capturing the enemy standard&lt;/ref&gt; its popularity stemmed from smart and pacy intrigue, well-written rhymed dialogues and a blend of romantic and patriotic features. The play was performed countlessly especially in the Nationalist zone&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Palencia, see ''El Día de Palencia'' 07.01.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2199538&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], or in Valladolid, see ''El Día de Palencia'' 20.01.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2199549&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the Francoist Spain;&lt;ref&gt;the last identified year the play was staged was 1965, ''La Vanguardia'' 28.03.65, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1964/11/18/pagina-58/33556875/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; there were great Spanish actors like [[:es:Carmen Díaz|Carmen Díaz]] starring&lt;ref&gt;''El Pensamiento Alaves'' 05.07.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000035811&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and great political personalities like [[Queipo de Llano]] attending.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 21.04.37, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1937/04/21/014.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Another comedy followed in 1935;&lt;ref&gt;''En los mares de Oriente'', also co-authored with Torralba de Damas. It was set in the Philippines, ''Ilustración Católica'' 02.04.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012124010&amp;page=22 here]. It was a played in amateur theatres, ''La Vanguardia'' 29.02.36, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/01/01/pagina-9/33123009/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; it failed to repeat the success, though it was later performed in the Philippines and attended by [[Elpidio Quirino|president Quirino]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 28.02.36, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1948/01/25/pagina-1/34361578/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s Pérez de Olaguer kept adapting novels for Rambal&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he co-scripted ''Otra vez Pimpinella'', adaptation of ''Adventures of Scarlet Pimpernel'', Maria M. Delgado, ''"Other" Spanish Theatres: Erasure and Inscription on the Twentieth Century Spanish Stage'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9780719059766}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote libretto for a [[zarzuela]].&lt;ref&gt;''Entre viñedos'' (1955), ''La Vanguardia'' 01.02.55, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1954/10/03/pagina-18/32783174/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of his own late plays was performed commercially;&lt;ref&gt;''Eva accepta la manzana'' (1953), played in Teatro Barcelona, ''La Vanguardia'' 22.04.53, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1953/02/20/pagina-22/32794132/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; others were one-act dramas performed at amateur or religious stages.&lt;ref&gt;in 1961 Pérez de Olaguer penned ''Occurió en Fátima'', one-act play, performed at amateur and religious stages like [[:es:teatro CAPSA|teatro CAPSA]], later managed by his son, ''La Vanguardia'' 18.05.61, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1961/04/21/pagina-27/32701724/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publisher, manager, ''periodista''==
[[File:La Vanguardia El poeta y el pueblo Antonio Machado.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''[[La Vanguardia]]'' (1930s)]]
For some 35 years Pérez de Olaguer remained active in a broadly defined culture; perhaps his most important role was this of a publisher, who animated a number of Catholic cultural initiatives. The key one was ''[[La Familia (Barcelona review)|La Familia]]'', a Barcelona-based review set up by his father in 1908&lt;ref&gt;Juan María Roma (ed.), ''Album historico del Carlismo'', Barcelona 1933, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and following some periods of lesser activity still issued in the early 1930s. It was at this time that the young Antonio assumed management of the weekly;&lt;ref&gt;in 1933 he was already listed as its director, Roma 1933, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; following the Civil War ''La Familia'', already as his own property,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 30.03.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-32/34337133/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; was re-launched and enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 27.10.55, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1955/10/02/pagina-15/32790981/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez de Olaguer kept running the review as its director&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 28.02.57, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1956/10/03/pagina-16/32763132/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; until the late 1960s;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 12.06.66, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1966/06/12/pagina-31/32654856/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; at some stage he tried to build a satellite infrastructure, launching periodical veladas literarias.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 08.03.59, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1959/03/08/pagina-25/32727898/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death ''La Familia'' was one of key platforms of popular Catholic culture in Catalonia, though its importance declined as secularization and consumer lifestyles advanced. Other of Pérez de Olaguer’s editorial activities were less successful: [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] weekly ''Alta Veu''&lt;ref&gt;together with Juan Soler Janer, [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'' vol. XXX/2, Seville 1979, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; and humorous reviews ''Don Fantasma''&lt;ref&gt;''Don Fantasma'', sub-titled "Afirmación-Humorismo-Lucha", was managed jointly with Torralba de Damas, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 19.02.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000521842&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Guirigay'',&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1979, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; launched in the mid-1930s, proved short-lived, though ''Momento''&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 22.04.53, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1953/02/20/pagina-22/32794132/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; kept appearing in 1951-1954.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 30.03.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-32/34337133/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pérez de Olaguer himself started contributing to press titles in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;compare his 1930 piece on Japan, ''La Esfera'' 15.02.30, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=4053962&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=32&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon commenced co-operation with ''[[La Vanguardia]]''&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 19.01.30, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1929/10/15/pagina-18/33213093/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the board was dubbed "nuestro collaborador".&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 07.12.34, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1934/07/14/pagina-21/33163779/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting 1933 he kept supplying pieces to established Barcelona reviews ''La Cruz''&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 17.08.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3050442&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and especially to ''[[:es:La Hormiga de Oro|Hormiga de Oro]]''&lt;ref&gt;in 1934-36 he published 22 articles, Raquel Arias Durá, ''La revista "La Hormiga de Oro". Análisis de contenido y estudio documental del fondo fotográfico'' [PhD thesis Universidad Complutense], Madrid 2013, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; though also to minor titles.&lt;ref&gt;like a Barcelona satiric journal ''Gutiérrez''&lt;/ref&gt; Initially his contributions were related to his experience as a traveler and later focused also on theatre;&lt;ref&gt;see his piece in ''La Ilustración Católica'' 16.07.36, the last one identified before outbreak of the civil war, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012124429&amp;page=10 here]&lt;/ref&gt; starting 1933 they were increasingly flavored with Catholic and Traditionalist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;his first identified piece published after outbreak of the war appeared in ''La Unión'' of 28.10.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0030009967&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; This thread climaxed during the Civil War; once Pérez de Olaguer resumed writing in October 1936&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión'' 31.10.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0030010009&amp;page=35 here]&lt;/ref&gt; his light and humorous style gave way to serious if not pathetic tone.&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión'' 05.11.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0030010113&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He kept publishing especially in ''[[:es:Pensamiento Alavés|El Pensamiento Alavés]]'' and a Carlist infantile weekly ''[[:es:Pelayos|Pelayos]]''; after 1937 his activity decreased. Following the war Pérez de Olaguer contributed to [[Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana]],&lt;ref&gt;where he wrote the biographies of several prominent figures, among them Carlists like [[:es:José María de Alvear|José María de Alvear]], [[:es:Joaquín Beunza|Joaquín Beunza]], [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma]], [[:es:Alfonso María de Borbón y Pintó|Alfonso María de Borbón y Pintó]], Luis Carpio Moraga, [[Tomàs Caylà i Grau|Tomás Caylá]], [[Jesús Comín Sagüés|Jesús Comín]], [[:es:Servando Conejero Sotos|Servando Conejero Sotos]], [[José Díez de la Cortina y Olaeta]], [[:es:Ángel Elizalde Sainz de Robles|Ángel Elizalde Sainz de Robles]], [[Manuel Fal Conde]], [[:es:Aurelio José González de Gregorio|Aurelio José González de Gregorio]], [[:es:Manuel González-Quevedo|Manuel González-Quevedo]], [[:es:Miguel Junyent|Miguel Junyent]], Francisco Javier Larrú y Sierra, [[:es:Antonio Molle Lazo|Antonio Molle Lazo]], [[:es:Mario Muslera|Mario Muslera]], [[:es:Juan Pérez Nájera|Juan Pérez Nájera]], [[Juan Olazábal Ramery|Juan de Olazábal Ramery]], Ángel Prados Parejo, Juan Carlos de la Quadra Salcedo, Abelardo da Riva y de Angulo, [[:ca:Estanislao Rico Ariza|Estanislao Rico Ariza]], [[:es:José Roca y Ponsa|José Roca y Ponsa]], [[:es:Emilio Ruiz Muñoz|Emilio Ruiz Muñoz]], [[:es:Manuel Sánchez Cuesta (periodista)|Manuel Sánchez Cuesta]], [[:es:Casimiro de Sangenís Bertrand|Casimiro de Sangenís]], [[:es:Antonio Sanz Cerrada|Antonio Sanz Cerrada]], [[:es:Domingo Tejera de Quesada|Domingo Tejera de Quesada]], [[:es:Benedicto Torralba de Damas|Benedicto Torralba de Damas]] and [[:ca:Lluís-Carles Viada i Lluch|Luis Carlos Viada y Lluch]], as well as other right wing politicians like [[José Calvo Sotelo]] (8 pages) or [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu|Corneliu Codreanu]], and writers like [[Ramiro de Maeztu]] or [[Pedro Muñoz Seca]], most of whom were killed during the war, ''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'' (Espasa), 1936-1939 supplement, vol. 1, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; and to Catholic reviews; the popular ones were intended for ''La Familia'', more sophisticated ones were published in ''Cristiandad''; his credo was laid out in a 1957 essay ''Ante la supuesta inexistencia del escritor católico''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ante la supuesta inexistencia del escritor católico'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 315 (1957), pp. 141-142. It was sort of a follow up to his much earlier ''La tragedia de escritor'' (1934), an 8 page leaflet in defense of Catholic writing&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edifici que va acollir el Teatre CAPSA, Barcelona.jpg|thumb|[[:ca:teatre CAPSA|Teatre CAPSA]] (current view)]]
In the Francoist era Pérez de Olaguer remained engaged in numerous Catalan Catholic cultural initiatives, those flavored by Traditionalism rather than those advancing a [[Christian democracy|Christian-Democratic]] outlook. He was the moving spirit behind 1954-co-founded Asociación de San Francisco de Sales,&lt;ref&gt;its declared objective was promotion, edition and dissemination of Catholic press&lt;/ref&gt; acted in Amigos de Sagrada Familia&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 28.02.57, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1956/10/03/pagina-16/32763132/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Congregaciones Marianas,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 25.06.58, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1958/04/24/pagina-19/32751931/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; lectured at Schola Cordis Iesu&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.04.59, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1959/03/08/pagina-22/32744177/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and galvanized Patronato O.F.O.R.S.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 11.12.63, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1963/11/02/pagina-38/32675596/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of literature he presided over Agrupación Literaria Ibero-Americana;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 06.11.59, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1959/11/04/pagina-25/32739681/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of theatre headed Fomento del Espectáculo Selecto y del Teatro Asociación,&lt;ref&gt;in 1961 he was vice-president and member of junta directiva of FESTA, ''La Vanguardia'' 18.07.61, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1961/04/21/pagina-25/32701216/pdf.html here], in the mid-1960s growing to its president, ''La Vanguardia'' 19.04.66, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1966/03/10/pagina-34/32651529/pdf.html here], but stepping down to honorary membership in 1967, ''La Vanguardia'' 24.01.67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1966/12/03/pagina-20/34335745/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to Congreso Regional de Teatro de Aficionados&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 30.06.59, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1959/03/08/pagina-38/32743725/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[:es:teatro CAPSA|CAPSA amateur theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 18.01.61, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1961/04/21/pagina-27/32701724/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of charity he animated Asociación de Amigos de San Lázaro&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 28.02.57, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1956/10/03/pagina-16/32763132/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and especially supported Leprocomio de Fontillas,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 30.03.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-32/34337133/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; apart from countless other involvements in educational&lt;ref&gt;for his 1953 lecture on educational topics see ''La Vanguardia'' 19.02.53, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1952/06/12/pagina-11/32799411/pdf.html here], for a 1964 lecture on theatre and morality see ''La Vanguardia'' 28.01.64, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1963/12/13/pagina-33/33548274/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; or religious events.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''La Vanguardia'' 31.01.63, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1962/05/23/pagina-25/33531088/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist: early decades==
[[File:Кольцов На Сарагосу Барселона 9авг17 1936.JPG|thumb|left|[[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|1936 coup in Barcelona]]]]
Pérez de Olaguer’s ancestors lived mostly overseas and seemed detached from daily Spanish politics; the only information on their preferences available&lt;ref&gt;apart that his family was not Carlist, Alcalá 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; is that his father was a fervent Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;which cost him life; having seen the Republican crowd vandalising a Barcelona church Luis Pérez jumped out of his house to protest; he was last seen alive dragged away by militiamen. His corpse was found later, his hands handcuffed and his skull deformed, referred after ''Filipinas Photo Collection'', [in:] ''Skyscrapercity'' forum, (link unavailable as blacklisted by Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; The young Antonio initially did not reveal any penchant; it is only in the early 1930s that his writings got saturated with Traditionalism. Exact mechanism of his access to Carlism is not known,&lt;ref&gt;perhaps he followed in the footsteps of his oldest brother Manuel, 17 years Antonio’s senior; Manuel was engaged in [[requeté]] structures&lt;/ref&gt; yet in 1933 it seemed apparent,&lt;ref&gt;as director of ''La Familia'' he advertised in a luxurious publication celebrating the centennary of Carlism, Roma 1933, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps confirmed in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;one press note contains a Carlist reference to a "Pérez de Olaguer", which might refer to him or to another member of the family, e.g. his oldest brother Manuel, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 08.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000520128&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His writings and publications aside&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1934 Pérez de Olaguer was poking fun at Manuel Azaña, ''Gutierrez'' 01.09.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005449449&amp;page=14 here]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no confirmation of his engagement in Carlist structures. It is not clear whether Antonio joined [[requeté]] military gear-up and whether on July 19 he engaged in the [[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|coup]].&lt;ref&gt;according to a source his oldest brother as Carlist requeté took part in the coup in Barcelona and died fighting for the university premises, ''El Progreso'' 06.11.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?posicion=4&amp;path=3100486&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. However, another source claims that he was not killed in combat but assassinated by the Republicans, and not during July 19-20th fightings but on July 26, 1936, César Alcalá, ''La represion politica en Catalunya (1936-1939)'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|8496281310}}, p. 135. According to Alcalá, the reason was a personal revenge of a former servant whose husband was killed in Asturias, ''La Razón'' 21.03.2009, available [http://www.larazon.es/historico/perez-de-olaguer-i-MLLA_RAZON_109624 here]. Another Antonio's brother, Pepe, died in a traffic accident shortly before the end of the civil war, when in ranks of the Nationalist army, Perez de Olaguer 1967, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In the mayhem that followed he left Barcelona for [[Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;it is not clear whether his pregnant wife and two young children fled with him or whether they had left Spain earlier. Anyway, his third son was born in 1936 in Genoa&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the Nationalist zone some time before November 1936 and offered his services to Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra; Pérez de Olaguer was seconded to its Prensa y Propaganda section, touring the area controlled and gathering information on the fallen requetés.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 06.11.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?posicion=4&amp;path=3100486&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept advancing the Carlist cause in numerous books and press publications. His position versus the [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Unification Decree]] and buildup of the Francoist regime is not clear; after 1937 his activity as author declined sharply, yet in 1939 Franco watched the victory parade in Barcelona from the balcony of Casa Pérez Samanillo.&lt;ref&gt;''Filipinas Photo Collection'', [in:] ''Skyscrapercity'' forum (link unavailable as blacklisted by Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RequeteViladot.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]], Carlist press]]
Pérez de Olaguer spent part of the early 1940s overseas and there is no information on his Carlist activities, except hosting [[Manuel Fal Conde|Fal Conde]] during the 1942 [[Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]] festivities.&lt;ref&gt;the feast turned into a Carlist v. Falangist street fights and Fal Conde has to seek refuge in Pérez de Olaguer’s house, Alcalá 2001, p. 52, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; During growing bewilderment of Carlism Pérez de Olaguer did not engage in the daily party business&lt;ref&gt;though he "realized a number of works for Junta Regional", Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; yet due to his standing as a writer, though also thanks to his easy-going, serene,&lt;ref&gt;some noted that serenity is the best word to describe his usual state of mind, ''La Vanguardia'' 30.03.68, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1968/03/30/pagina-32/34337133/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and modest conduct he enjoyed great prestige among the Catalan party rank and file.&lt;ref&gt;he is described as "afable i comprensiu", Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 127, "de actitud intachable",” Alcalá 2001, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; He remained loyal to leadership of Fal and to sovereignty of [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]]; the regent appreciated him personally. Taking advantage of his position in the mid-1940s Pérez de Olaguer tried to mediate between two increasingly hostile fractions of Catalan Carlists: cautious supporters of Fal Conde, who stuck to the regentialist solution, and activist supporters of regional leader [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Maurici de Sivatte]], who demanded that Don Javier openly challenges [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and declares his own reign. In 1947 he addressed the claimant with a letter, asking to take action and prevent forthcoming breakup.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Himself he tended to side with the Sivattistas,&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; noting that Spain needed "legitimate chief of state".&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Olaguer wrote: "lo que fundamentalmente necesita hoy España y la Comunión, o sea, un Jefé de Estado legitimo. fuerte, con continuidad institucional, bondad personal y institucional, y favorable situación internacional, y un caudillo monárquico y carlista que lleve al Carlismo a la lucha y, si Díos quiere, al triunfo", quoted after Alcalá 2001, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; Don Javier took notice but did not take action and the conflict escalated. In early 1949 Fal travelled to Barcelona seeking last-minute reconciliation, but Pérez de Olaguer informed him that "por aquel camino el carlismo no podía continuar".&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Few months later in another letter he advocated more open anti-Francoist stand and noted that caudillo’s fate might be this of [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;in his May 1949 letter to Don Javier Pérez de Olaguer noted that Franco remains in power "por legítimo espíritu de conservación; porque sabe que en el momento que claudique y que ceda un palmo de terreno le espera la suerte de Hítler, de Mussolini, de Laval o de Quisling, sin que quiera por ello compararle con nadie, que es otra cosa", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fal’s strategy prevailed and Sivatte was dismissed from the Catalan jefatura.

==Carlist: late decades==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|left|Carlist standard]]
Pérez de Olaguer remained embittered about Sivatte’s dismissal and protested to Fal;&lt;ref&gt;he crafted the letter in his usual amicable manner, noting however that "los que con toda disciplina y lealtad, con absoluto desinterés y sacrificio, habíamos formado en las filas de Mauricio no merecíamos la patada", quoted after Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 115. The attempt was to no avail. Fal responded to him that dismissal was not premature but overdue, based on facts not calumnies, and so on, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; however, while Sivatte soon distanced himself from the party, for Pérez de Olaguer obedience towards Don Javier remained an untouchable principle.&lt;ref&gt;obedience to the claimant was the point of no-discussion for him, Vallverdú i Martí 2014, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan Carlists held him in high esteem and suggested that it is Pérez de Olaguer who becomes the regional jefe;&lt;ref&gt;once Sivatte was dismissed his post went to Santiago Julia, who was from the onset appointed as a provisional caretaker, Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; however, despite insistence on part of the regent Pérez declined the offer, pledging instead that he would work to unite all Catalan Carlists.&lt;ref&gt;eventually the Catalan jefatura went to Josep Puig i Pellicer. Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, he did, and the early 1950s are marked by his efforts to this end. Unwavering in his loyalty to Don Javier he kept challenging the [[regency]] formula. The campaign produced success in 1953; Don Javier issued a vague document, hailed by Consejo de [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]] as claim of monarchic rights; their communiqué was co-signed by Pérez de Olaguer.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The move triggered what looked like rapprochement between Javieristas and Sivattistas; it climaxed when two groups, since 1949 staging 2 separate Montserrat feasts, agreed to have one, very much the result of Pérez de Olaguer’s conciliatory work.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 Pérez de Olaguer together with Sivatte&lt;ref&gt;and Francesco Puig and Eduardo Conde; the meeting took place in April 1956&lt;/ref&gt; met Don Javier in [[Perpignan]] to discuss further alignment and prevent would-be dynastic accord with [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan]]; the Carlist king signed appropriate statement but insisted it is kept private. The document was to be stored by Sivatte but Don Javier soon developed second thoughts and demanded it is to be in custody of Pérez de Olaguer, the king’s trusted man in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Olaguer was "personal friend of Don Javier and his host when in Barcelona", Alcalá 2001, p. 115. Don Javier argued that when corresponding with Pérez de Olaguer he enjoyed "facilidad de correspondencia que non tengo con los otros", Alcalá 2001, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; To his great surprise, Sivatte made the Perpignan pledge public during the meeting of Carlist executive in [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]],&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El nuevo rumbo político del carlismo hacia la colaboración con el régimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 69 (2009), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; which heavily damaged Don Javier’s relations with Pérez de Olaguer.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 120, Vázquez de Prada 2009, p. 194, Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, when in 1957 Sivatte launched an openly rebellious Carlist grouping known as RENACE Pérez de Olaguer did not join, in the late 1950s limiting himself to maintaining friendly relations with Sivatte and his collaborators, like Carles Feliu de Travy.&lt;ref&gt;compare case of 1958 homage to Pérez de Olaguer, attended by Sivatte, ''La Vanguardia'' 25.06.58, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1958/04/24/pagina-19/32751931/pdf.html here], ''La Vanguardia'' 28.06.58, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1958/04/24/pagina-25/32752511/pdf.html here], or the case of a common 1959 radio broadcast with Carlos Feliu de Travy, ''La Vanguardia'' 25.01.59, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1958/10/15/pagina-12/32732021/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; His general stand seemed constant; basking in prestige among Catalan Carlists he did not engage in any party activity yet did engage in common, mostly religion-flavored initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;he either steered clear of or maintained low profile during evidently Carlist events, e.g. he is not listed as attending homage to Antonio Domingo, whom he supported in municipal elections, ''La Vanguardia'' 04.12.63, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1963/11/02/pagina-39/32673875/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Foto Mauricio de Sivatte.tif|thumb|160px|[[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Mauricio de Sivatte]]]]
Pérez de Olaguer avoided entanglements in Francoist structures though he used to meet high regional officials of the regime, be it provincial [[:es:Gobernador civil|civil governor]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 16.06.45, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1945/06/12/pagina-9/33093253/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Capitán general|capitán general]]&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 14.12.45, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1945/06/12/pagina-12/33102646/pdf.html here], ''La Vanguardia'' 20.01.55, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1954/10/03/pagina-15/32781977/pdf.html here], ''La Vanguardia'' 27.05.56, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1956/04/15/pagina-25/32768909/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[alcalde]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 08.11.49, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1948/12/15/pagina-9/32825167/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these meetings is not clear; it seems he represented various non-political institutions seeking assistance.&lt;ref&gt;like Comisión de Fiestas de la Sagrada Familia, ''La Vanguardia'' 24.06.45, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1945/06/12/pagina-13/33093375/pdf.html here], or Organización de Refugiados Arabes de Tierra Santa, ''La Vanguardia'' 08.11.49, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1948/12/15/pagina-9/32825167/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the early 1960s Pérez de Olaguer started to demonstrate that also politically he sort of acknowledged the stability of Francoist setting. During [[Municipal electoral regime during Francoism|local elections of 1963]] he lent his support to one Carlist candidate&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Domingo Francas, ''La Vanguardia'' 30.10.63, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1963/10/04/pagina-30/32667646/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] elections of 1967 to another.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan. It is also revealing that when commending Rodón for his stand during a press interview, Pérez de Olaguer noted that "el Carlismo puede estar orgullose de usted". Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Following 30 years of the regime his trust in instauration of the Traditionalist monarchy decayed; in a 1966 letter to Don Javier he diagnosed that "el Carlismo, más dividido que nunca, más lleno de rencor que en otras ocasiones, languidece, y por paradoja sólo diríase alimentado, vivificado, por los antiguos partidarios de Sivatte".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Jesús García Riol, ''La resistencia tradicionalista a la renovación ideológica del carlismo (1965-1973)'' [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2015, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He repaired relations with the house of Borbón-Parma and hosted [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]] and his wife [[Princess Irene of the Netherlands|Irene]] in his house during their mid-1960s interview with Sivatte; it is not clear whether he shared Sivatte’s damning opinion about the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 166. Pérez de Olaguer was however conscious of enthusiasm that Don Carlos Hugo generated among the youth, acknowleding in a letter to Don Javier the crowds with "lealtad y de entusiasmo, singularmente por vuestro hijo Don Carlos Hugo, pero también por Vos", García Riol 2015, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Jacinto Benavente.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacinto Benavente]]]]
Pérez de Olaguer’s early attempts were acknowledged with patronizing tone; critics admitted potential, unbiased fresh look and writing ease yet stayed cautious and some alluded to a premature debut,&lt;ref&gt;''Ensayos literarios'' were praised as written by a good observer but also by an author who lacked master command of the language, ''La Hormiga de Oro'' 07.01.26, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012111128&amp;page=25 here]. Commenting on ''De Occidente á Oriente por Suez'' the critics noted ease of writing and natural, jolly style, good prospective writer – ''Nuevo Mundo'' 01.03.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002143158&amp;page=10 here]. More than one reviewer noted that not many people of such a young age had the opportunity to travel that much, which produced an interesting literary blend, ''ABC'' 16.12.34, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1934/12/16/007.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Jacinto Benavente]] approvingly prologued his 1934 volume.&lt;ref&gt;''La Hormiga de Oro'' 12.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012121759&amp;page=22 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez de Olaguer gained some attention due to his grotesque novels and plays; commended for gracious style,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 20.08.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1933/08/20/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; original humor&lt;ref&gt;"unas peripecias novelescas, nos brinda tipos, de una moalculablo fuerza expresiva, que se agitan, conducen y manifiestan con ágil dinamismo y líneas morales caricaturescas de fresca originalidad", ''El Sol'' 15.04.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000471860&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and optimistic humanism&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporanea'' 9/III (1933), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005138608&amp;page=81 here]&lt;/ref&gt; they were placed in the farcical tradition of [[Rabelais]]&lt;ref&gt;''El Sol'' 15.04.32m available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000471860&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Hormiga de Oro'' 24.12.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012118668&amp;page=27 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s his works started to collect praise in conservative realm, which noted Christian spirit&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.08.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000528455&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Traditionalist vision.&lt;ref&gt;in case of ''El canonigo Collell'' some noted that "puede decirse que toda la Cataluña de medio siglo XIX surge de nuevo a la vida", ''ABC'' 20.08.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1933/08/20/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Más leal que galante'' earned Pérez de Olaguer great popularity among the Carlists;&lt;ref&gt;though some complained about indulgence in dialogue and loose scenes, ''La Libertad'' 12.07.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000201069&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La Vanguardia'' 09.07.33, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/01/01/pagina-16/33183793/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1935 he was already invited as a literary arbiter&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.10.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000561601&amp;page=20 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and received homages.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.12.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000568478&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil War and early Francoism Pérez de Olaguer emerged among more popular writers; some of his works were re-printed 4 times,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 14.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/06/14/pagina-27/34363126/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Más leal'' was continuously staged commercially and occasionally he kept attending literary juries.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 23.05.51, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1951/01/17/pagina-13/32807541/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained an author catering to popular taste and was rewarded by the public rather than by critics and awards.&lt;ref&gt;three volumes he published in 1950 were – according to the author – written to cheer people up, ''ABC'' 31.05.50, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1950/05/31/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting mid-1950s his literary production declined as he focused on Catholic Barcelona reviews instead. Since their circulation remains unknown also their impact remains to be gauged, yet it seems that ''La Familia'' counted among key platforms of popular Catalan Catholicism.

After his death Pérez de Olaguer went into oblivion; none of his works has been re-published. In the post-Francoist era the skyrocketing popularity of Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer – never referred to as the son of Antonio&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. Nuria Sabat, ''Pérez de Olaguer, una vida per al teatre'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 254 (2008), available [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/RevistaGirona/article/download/135210/185409 here], ''Fons Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer'', [in:] ''Insitut del Teatre'' service, available [http://www.cdmae.cat/fons-gonzalo-perez-olaguer/ here], Marcos Ordónez, ''En la muerte de Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer, crítico teatral'', [in:] ''El País'' 04.06.08, available [https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/04/necrologicas/1212530402_850215.html here], ''Mestre de teatre'', [in:] ''El Punt Avui'' 03.06.08, available [http://www.elpuntavui.cat/cultura/article/19-cultura/291983-mestre-de-teatre.html?cca=1 here], Joan Anton Benach, ''Decano de la critica teatral'', [in:] ''La Vanguardia'' 03.07.08. available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2008/06/03/pagina-31/71291750/pdf.html here], ''Gonzalo Pérez de Olaguer'', [in:] ''ABC'' 04.06.08, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2008/06/04/072.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; – has entirely eclipsed the memory of his father. Pérez de Olaguer has not made it to history of the Spanish literature and is disregarded not only in synthetic accounts&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. Santos Sanz Villanueva, ''Historia y crítica de la literatura española'', vol. 8/1 (''Epoca contemporanea 1939-1975''), Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|8474237815}}, Domingo Yndurain, ''Historia y critica de la literatura española 1939-1980'', vol. 8 (''Epoca contemporanea 1939-1980''), Barcelona 1981, Jordi Gracia, Domingo Ródenas, ''Derrota y restitución de la modernidad: literatura contemporánea, 1939-2009'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|9788498921229}}, Jean Canavaggio, ''Historia de la literatura española'', vol. 6 (''El siglo XX''), Barcelona 1995, {{ISBN|843447459X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also ignored&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Ignacio Soldevila Durante, ''Historia de la novela española 1936-2000'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8437619114}}&lt;/ref&gt; or barely mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Santos Sanz Villanueva, ''La novela española durante el franquismo'', Madrid 2010, {{ISBN|9788424904180}}, p. 316, Julio Rodríguez-Puértola, ''Historia de la literatura fascista española'', vol. 2, Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788446029304}}, p. 1177, Piotr Sawicki, ''La narrativa española de la Guerra Civil (1936-1975). Propaganda, testimonio y memoria creativa'', Alicante 2010, pp. 64, 138&lt;/ref&gt; in detailed studies. If referred, he merits scholarly attention as a representative of cultural outlook of early Francoism rather than as an individual. Scholars quote his name when presenting typical features, clichés and traits of Francoist culture, and if admitted importance it is only because some counted him among key contributors&lt;ref&gt;Hugo García, ''Relatos para una guerra.

Even centuries have passed. The wheel of the Crusades keeps turning. There is now a heroic Crusade against unbridled communism. When the moment of truth came, Spain could not fail and the same is true of the land that produced Saturnino . . . and his small home town", quoted and translated after Francisco Javier Caspistegui, ''Spain’s Vendee’: Carlist identity in Navarre as a mobilising model'', [in:] Chris Ealham, Michael Richards (eds.), ''The Splintering of Spain'', Cambridge 2005, {{ISBN|9780511132636}}, pp. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; building a myth of Traditionalist [[Navarre]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in ''Estampas Carlistas'' Pérez de Olaguer presented as typical a case of a village of which all males between 16 and 70 volunteered to requeté, Caspistegui 2005, pp. 187-188, see also Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas, ''La España regional en ermas y el nacionalismo de guerra franquista (1936-1939)'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 64/4 (2006), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; bending historical truth to serve own political preferences&lt;ref&gt;''Más leal que galante'' is according to one scholar "un acercamiento al pasado histórico, imperial, católico y hasta carlista, de España desde diferentes perspectivas, no sólo como recuperación de repertorio artístico, que fue, por lo general bastante deficiente, y esto en los casos en los que fue retomado, sino desde un punto de vista ideológico, esta vez totalmente divergente", Pablo García Blanco, ''Contra la placidez del pantano: teoría, crítica y práctica dramática de Gonzalo Torrente Ballester'' [PhD thesis, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid], Getafe 2008, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and cultivating sex stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;women were not supposed to fight and were reduced to auxiliary roles "because their fragile, delicate, loving fingers are not made for firing guns, but for weaving gentleness, applying honeyed gauzes to the wounds of those brave, heroic, marvellous Navarrese men", comments on ''Los de siempre'' by Caspistegui 2005, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; His individual literary contribution is dismissed as "cuentos escritos en un tono didáctico-moralizante".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Los de siempre'' is dismissed as "una antologia de cuentos escritos en un tono didáctico-moralizante que idealizan hasta los últimos extremos a los soldados carlistas y el sacrificio de la población de Navarra", Sawicki 2010, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carlins al santuari del Collell4.jpg|thumb|Catalan Carlists, 1986]]
In the Carlist realm Pérez de Olaguer is occasionally recorded on private blogs&lt;ref&gt;compare ''La Tradició de Catalunya'' service, available [http://latradiciodecatalunya.blogspot.com/2016/07/antonio-perez-de-olaguer-y-feliu.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and official Comunión Tradicionalista sites.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''Carlismo'' service, available [http://carlismo.es/lecturas-electronicas-estivales/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; His testimonial literature on Republican terror was widely quoted during the Francoist era. As a documentary it has not been proven incorrect until today; at times it remains quoted by scholars though they usually&lt;ref&gt;there are exceptions; some scholars when quoting Perez de Olaguer refer simply to a "historiador", compare Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española, 1936-1939'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, pp. 685, 708, 726, 750&lt;/ref&gt; stigmatize Pérez de Olaguer as a Nationalist partisan,&lt;ref&gt;Óscar J.

The '''Atlantic World''' is the history of the interactions among the peoples and empires bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] rim from the beginning of the [[Age of Discovery]] to the early 21st  century.
Atlantic history is split between three different contexts. transatlantic history, meaning the international history of the atlantic world, circus-atlantic history meaning the transnational history of the atlantic world, and cis-atlantic history within an atlantic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armitage|first1=David|title=The British Atlantic World 1500 1800|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Atlantic slave trade]] continued into the 19th century, but the international trade was largely outlawed in 1807 by Britain. Slavery ended in 1865 in the United States and in the 1880s in Brazil (1888) and Cuba (1886).&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis, et al. '' Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways the history of the "Atlantic world" culminates in the "[[Atlantic Revolutions]]" of the late 18th century and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiography of the Atlantic World, known as [[Atlantic history]], has grown enormously since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Games and Adam Rothman, eds., ''Major Problems in Atlantic History: Documents and Essays'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The Atlantic World comprises the histories of [[History of Europe|Europe]], [[History of Africa|Africa]], and the [[History of the Americas|Americas]]. Travel over land was difficult and expensive, so settlements were made along the coast, especially where rivers allowed small boats to travel inland.  Distant settlements were linked by elaborate sea-based trading networks. Since the easiest and cheapest way of long-distance travel was by sea, international trading networks emerged in the Atlantic world, with major hubs at [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Boston]], and [[Havana]]. Time was a factor, as sailing ships averaged about 2 knots speed (50 miles a day). Navigators had to rely on maps of currents or they would be becalmed for days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy K. Liss, ''Atlantic Empires: The Network of Trade and Revolution, 1713-1826'' (Johns Hopkins Studies in Atlantic History and Culture) (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; These maps were not only for navigational purposes however, but also as a way to give insight in regards to power and ownership of lands that had already been claimed, essentially creating a greater desire to finding new routes and land.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Schmidt, "Mapping an Empire: Cartographic and Colonial Rivalry in Seventeenth-Century Dutch and English North America" in the William and Mary Quarterly (Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;   One major goal for centuries was finding the [[Northwest Passage]] (through what is now Canada) from Europe to [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Arctic Grail: The Quest for the Northwest Passage and The North Pole, 1818-1909'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
Following Columbus and the earliest European voyages to [[New World|the New World]] and the west African coast [[Africa]] and the division of the Americas between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]] was effected by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The West Coast of Africa played a special role as the source of slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;John Kelly Thornton, ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1680'' (2nd ed. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;   There emerged an elaborate network of economic, geopolitical and cultural exchange—an "Atlantic World" comparable to  "Mediterranean World." It linked the nations and peoples that inhabited the Atlantic litoral of North and South America, Africa and Western Europe.

The main empires that built the Atlantic world were the British,&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Bowen,  et al. ''Britain's Oceanic Empire: Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds, c.1550-1850'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Britains-Oceanic-Empire-Atlantic-c-1550-1850/dp/110702014X/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Banks, ''Chasing Empire Across the Sea: Communications And the State in the French Atlantic, 1713-1763'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Kagan and Geoffrey Parker, eds. ''Spain, Europe and the Atlantic'' (2003), specialized essays [https://www.amazon.com/Spain-Europe-Atlantic-Essays-Elliott/dp/052152511X/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
, Portuguese&lt;ref&gt;Daviken Studnicki-Gizbert, ''A Nation upon the Ocean Sea: Portugal's Atlantic Diaspora and the Crisis of the Spanish Empire, 1492-1640'' (2007) [https://www.amazon.com/Nation-upon-Ocean-Sea-Portugals/dp/0195175697/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dutch;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce D. Goodfriend, et al. eds. ''Going Dutch: The Dutch Presence in America 1609-2009''  (Atlantic World) (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; entrepreneurs from the United States played a role as well after 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould and Peter S. Onuf, eds. ''Empire and Nation: The American Revolution in the Atlantic World'' (Anglo-America in the Transatlantic World) (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Nation-Revolution-Anglo-America-Transatlantic/dp/0801879124/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, were active on a smaller scale.

==Environmental history==

The beginning of extensive contact between Europe, Africa, and the Americas had sweeping implications for the environmental and demographic history of all the regions involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163–188 |jstor=25703506 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the process known as the [[Columbian exchange]], numerous plants, animals, and diseases were transplanted—both deliberately and inadvertently—from one continent to another. The epidemiological impact of this exchange on the indigenous peoples of the Americas was profound, causing very high death rates and population declines of 50% to 90% or even 100%. European and African immigrants also had very high death rates on their arrival, but they could be and were replaced by new shipments of immigrants (see the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples]]). Many foods that are common in present-day Europe, including corn (maize) and [[potato]]es, originated in the New World and were unknown in Europe before the sixteenth century.  Similarly, some staple crops of present-day West Africa, including [[cassava]] and [[peanut]]s, originated in the New World.  Some of the staple crops of Latin America, such as [[coffee]] and [[sugarcane]], were introduced by European settlers in the course of the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Silver, ''A New Face on the Countryside: Indians, Colonists, and Slaves in South Atlantic Forests, 1500-1800'' (Studies in Environment and History) (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery and other labor systems==
The slave trade played a role in the history of the Atlantic world almost from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''The slave trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/slave-trade-history-Atlantic-1440-1870/dp/0753820560/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  As European powers began to conquer and claim large territories in the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the role of [[chattel slavery]] and other forced labor systems in the development of the Atlantic world expanded.  European powers typically had vast territories that they wished to exploit through agriculture, mining, or other extractive industries, but they lacked the work force that they needed to exploit their lands effectively.  Consequently, they turned to a variety of coercive labor systems to meet their needs.   At first the goal was to use native workers. Native Americans were employed through [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slavery]] and through the Spanish system of [[encomienda]]. The Indians too often preferred to die of starvation rather than be slaves, so the plantation owners turned to African slaves via the [[Atlantic slave trade]].  European workers arrived as [[indentured servant]]s or [[penal labour|transported felons]] who went free after a term of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Morgan, ''Slavery, Atlantic Trade and the British Economy, 1660-1800'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trans-Atlantic Slave trade played a massive role in shaping the demographics of the Americas, especially in areas where huge plantations were the norm, such as in South America and the Caribbean. Roughly three quarters of immigrants to the Americas before 1820 were African, and more than half of these Africans were originally from West or Central Africa. In Brazil, the population percentage of Africans was even higher, with about seven African to every one Portuguese immigrant.&lt;ref name = sweetnd&gt;Sweet, James. "The Evolution of Ritual in the African Diaspora." (n.d.): 64-80. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Because there was such a large population of Africans, it is unsurprising that African slaves aided in shaping the culture of these regions. In the early colonial period, there was a high prevalence of African spiritual practices, such as spirit possessions and healing practices. Presumably, these practices served as a point of connection and as an identity hold for slaves hailing from the same African origin.&lt;ref name = sweet2009&gt;Sweet, James H. "Mutual Misunderstandings: Gester, Gender, and Healing in the African Portuguese World." Past and Present 4th ser. (2009): 128-43. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Such cultural practices allowed, at least to an extent, African slaves to maintain kinship structures similar to those that they might have seen in their homeland. In many cases, European authorities viewed spiritual positions that were highly esteemed in African societies to be socially unacceptable, morally corrupt, and heretical. This led to the disappearance or transformation of most African religious practices. For example, the practice of consulting kilundu, or Angolan spirits, was seen as homosexual by Portuguese authorities,&lt;ref name = sweet2009/&gt; a clear example of Eurocentrism in colonial societies, as European ideas of religion often did not match African ones. Unfortunately, there is a lack of documents written from the African point of view, so almost all information from this time period in these colonial societies is subject to cross-cultural misinterpretation, omission of facts, or other such changes that could affect the quality of description of African spiritual practices. Maintaining the integrity of cultural practices was difficult due to disagreement with European propriety and European tendency to generalize the African demographic makeup to merely “Central African,” rather than acknowledging individual cultures. Eventually, most African traditions such as Kilundu, which was ultimately reduced to the popular Brazilian dance “Lundu,” were either absorbed into other African traditions or reduced to a ritual simply resembling the original tradition.&lt;ref name = sweetnd/&gt;
The extent of voluntary [[immigration]] to the Atlantic world varied considerably by region, nationality, and time period.  Many European nations, particularly the Netherlands and France, only managed to send a few thousand voluntary immigrants. Though 15,000 or so who came to New France multiplied rapidly. In [[New Netherland]], the Dutch coped by recruiting immigrants of other nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Jacobs, ''New Netherland: A Dutch Colony in Seventeenth-Century America'' (The Atlantic World) (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[New England]], the massive [[Puritan]] migration of the first half of the seventeenth century created a large free workforce and thus obviated the need to use unfree labor on a large scale.  Colonial New England's reliance on the labor of free men, women, and children, organized in individual farm households, is called the family labor system.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Bremer, ''First Founders: American Puritans and Puritanism in an Atlantic World'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] was one of the first American jurisdictions to end slavery, in 1794.  Brazil was last nation in the Western Hemisphere to end slavery, in 1888.

==Governance==

The Spanish [[conquistador]]es conquered the [[Aztec]] empire in present-day [[History of Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[Inca]] empire in present-day Peru with ease, assisted by horses, guns, and above all by the devastating mortality inflicted by newly introduced diseases such as [[smallpox]].  To some extent the prior emergence of the Inca and Aztec empires as regional powers aided the transfer of governance to the Spanish, since these native empires had already established road systems, state bureaucracies and systems of taxation and intensive agriculture that were in some cases inherited wholesale by the Spanish. The early Spanish conquerors of these empires were also aided by political instability and internal conflict within the Aztec and Incan regimes, which they successfully exploited to their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;John Huxtable Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems that most European governments faced in the Americas was how to exercise authority over vast expanses of territory.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies'' (1993) vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Spain, which colonized Mexico, Central America, and the greater part of South America, established a network of powerful viceroyalties to administer different regions of its New World holdings: the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535), the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542), the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (1717/1739), and the [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] (1776).  The result was strong government that became even stronger during the Bourbon reforms of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain approached the task of governing its New World territories in less centralized manner, establishing about twenty distinct colonies in North America and the Caribbean from 1585 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first =Daniel |editor-last = Vickers|title = A Companion to Colonial America|date = 2003|series = Wiley Blackwell Companions to American History|isbn = 978-0631210115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each British colony had its own governor and an assembly.  The North American [[Thirteen Colonies]] developed a system of home rule and democratic self-government.  Usually only property owners could vote but since so many free men owned property a majority could and did vote.  It was the British threat against home rule, and its demand for control of taxation, that led to the American Revolution in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds.. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (Blackwell, 2003) [https://www.amazon.com/Companion-American-Revolution-Blackwell-Companions/dp/1405116749/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atlantic revolutions==
A wave of revolutions shook the Atlantic world, 1770s-1820s, including the United States (1775–1783), France  and French-controlled Europe (1789–1814), Haiti (1791–1804), and Spanish America (1810–1825).&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; There were smaller upheavals in Switzerland, Russia, and Brazil.   The revolutionaries in each country knew of the others and to some degree were inspired or emulated them.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Dubois and Richard Rabinowitz, eds. ''Revolution!: The Atlantic World Reborn'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence movements in the New World began with the [[American Revolution]], 1775-1783, in which France, the Netherlands and Spain assisted the new United States of America as it secured independence from Britain. In the 1790s the [[Haitian Revolution]] broke out, with large-scale killings. With Spain tied down in European wars, the mainland Spanish colonies secured independence around 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Jaime E.|last = Rodríguez O.|title = The Independence of Spanish America|date = 1998|publisher = Cambridge University Press|url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-independence-of-spanish-america/A5A743C3D04C086F0C1924A430B7F5F8|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In long-term perspective, the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of [[republicanism]], the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of [[The Enlightenment]], such as the equality of all men. They emphasized equal justice under law by disinterested courts, as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble.  They showed that the modern notion of revolution, of starting fresh with a radically new government, could actually work in practice.  Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800.'' (2 vol, 1959–1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a historical concept==
{{main|Atlantic history}}
Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] traces the concept of the Atlantic world to an editorial published by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Atlantic History,'' 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The alliance of the United States and Great Britain in World War II, and the subsequent creation of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]], heightened historians' interest in the history of interaction between societies on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Atlantic History,'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American and British universities, Atlantic World history is supplementing (and possibly supplanting) the study of specific European colonial societies in the Americas, e.g. British North America or Spanish America.  Atlantic world history differs from traditional approaches to the history of colonization in its emphasis on inter-regional and international comparisons and its attention to events and trends that transcended national borders.  Atlantic world history also emphasizes how the colonization of the Americas reshaped Africa and Europe.

Sheikh '''Bakri Sapalo''' (born '''Abubakar Garad Usman'''; November 1895 - 5 April 1980) was an [[Oromo people|Oromo]] scholar, poet and religious teacher. He is best known as the inventor of a writing system for the [[Oromo language]].

==Life==
Bakri Sapalo was the son of Garad Usman Oda, a landowner in the area of the [[Sapalo River]] who was among those who were carried over into Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]]'s regime after the conquest of [[Harar]]. His son Abubakar was born eight years after the conquest of Harar, and probably some sixteen years after Garad Usman had embraced Islam; Abubakar had three brothers and four sisters.  Although reputed to have been a good [[Muslim]] and remembered to this day for his skill in oratory and command of the Oromo language, Garad Usman remained illiterate. R. J. Hayward and Mohammed Hassan speculate, based on her name, that his mother Kadiga was also a Muslim. After receiving his elementary education, Abubakar went to [[Chercher, Ethiopia|Chercher]] where he studied under the [[Islamic]] teacher Sheikh Umar Aliyye Balbaletti, and afterwards went to Harar to study with Sheikh Yusuf Adam for a number of years there. Although he also studied under other Islamic teachers, these were the only ones he wrote biographies about.&lt;ref name=HH-551&gt;Hayward and Hassan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/616613 "The Oromo Orthography of Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies''], 44 (1981), p. 551&lt;/ref&gt;

After devoting 20 years of his life to his studies, he returned to his home village of Sapalo, where he began to teach. Besides religion, subjects he taught included geography, history, mathematics, astronomy, Arabic, and the composition of writings in the Oromo language. He also began to compose poetry in the Oromo language, which not only brought him fame but the name he afterwards was known by, Sheikh Bakri Sapalo: "Bakri" is the popular form of "Abubakar" and Sapalo after his village.&lt;ref name=HH-551/&gt; Sheikh Bakri eventually left Sapalo and taught in a number of places, of which the three best known are Hortu, near [[Dire Dawa]], the city of Dire Dawa itself, and Addelle, a place some 25 kilometers from Dire Dawa, on the road to Harar. It was at Addelle where he built a school and what came to be known as his mosque. He is said to have married a local woman at every place he stayed, at least 11 of whom are known. He had eighteen children by three of his wives, thirteen sons and five daughters. Despite the large number of wives, he carefully obeyed the Muslim commandments on polygamy, for he is said never to have had more than two wives at once, and towards the end of his life he had only one wife. During this time he also wrote prolifically both in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and Oromo.&lt;ref name=HH-552&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 552&lt;/ref&gt;

He is believed to have invented his writing system for Oromo in 1956 at the village of Hagi Qome. Neither Hayward nor Hassan offer a reason why Sheikh Bakri returned to his home area to work on his system, "unless it was for the purpose of keeping the thing secret, for the authorities would certainly have been adamantly opposed to the idea of Oromo being written in any form, let alone in a script other than Ethiopic."&lt;ref name=HH-553&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 553&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was initially met with great enthusiasm and found a number of users in his province of [[Hararghe]], the Ethiopian authorities predictably reacted with fear that he was "inciting the Oromo to too great an ethnic consciousness and thus endangering the national unity." Local officials moved quickly to suppress its use, and in 1965 Sheikh Bakri was placed under [[house arrest]] in Dire Dawa but allowed to continue his teaching. In 1968, he was given permission to visit Addelle two or three times a week. It was during these years that he wrote ''Shalda'', a twenty-page pamphlet which purported to be a work of religious instruction, but was actually from beginning to end a caustically worded indictment of Amhara colonial oppression and an account of the suffering of the Oromo under the rule of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. Hayward and Hassan further note that "''Shalda'' is of interest in that it is really both the first and the last major writing in Shaykh Bakri Sapalo's alphabet."&lt;ref name=HH-554&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, after Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed and the [[Derg]] gained power, Sheikh Bakri and his wife fled the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]] and fled to [[Somalia]] where they were admitted to a refugee camp in [[Hiraan]]. Sheikh Bakri had hoped he would be allowed to proceed further to [[Mogadishu]] where he could work and have his writings published, but he never received permission to leave the camp. Conditions there proved too much for a man in his eighties, and he died in the camp after a prolonged illness.&lt;ref name=HH-554/&gt;

==Works==
Although Sheikh Bakri wrote many works both on religious and secular topics, except for a few distributed in [[mimeograph]] form all of his writings remained in manuscript form during his lifetime, and were distributed amongst his students.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward and Hassan note that at the time of their writing, Sheikh Bakri's most outstanding disciple, Sheikh [[Mohammed Rashad]], was at work on publishing a collection of his teacher's writings.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward and Hassan list eight of his writings in Arabic, which at the time could be consulted in Mogadishu: ''Dirdsa fi al-mantiqa 1-Harariyya jughrafiyyan wa bashariyyan'', a study of the geography and demography of the Harar region of about 200 pages; two works on history, ''Janaza shamarikh min hadayiz al-tawarikh'' 95 pages in length, and ''Kitab irsal al-sawarikh ila sama' al-tawarikh'' a history of the Oromo in 56 pages; three religious writings ''Al-mawahib al-madadiyyah fi l-'awf al-'adadiyya'', ''Muqaddamat taysir al-zari'a'' (48 pages long), and ''Taysir al-zari'a ila fuquhiyy fi ahkam al-shari'a''; and the two biographies of his teachers mentioned above.&lt;ref name=HH-552/&gt;

Mohammed Hassan made use of Sheikh Bakri's ''Kitab irsal al-sawarikh ila sama' al-tawarikh'' in writing his ''The Oromo of Ethiopia, a History: 1570-1860'', describing the manuscript in the bibliography as sketching "an overall panorama of Oromo history from early times to the present. Although it is not free from major limitations on early Oromo history, it contains much useful data on the [[gadaa|gada]] system."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oromo of Ethiopia, a History: 1570-1860'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1994), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan relies on it heavily in his discussion on the gaada system.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Oromo'', pp. 43-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
As noted above, Sheikh Bakri was also a renowned Oromo poet. "Shaykh Bakri, write Hayward and Hassan, "stirred the imagination and captured the love of the Oromo masses by means of his poems, which were composed in their language and were short enough for the people to learn by heart."&lt;ref name=HH-553/&gt;

Sheikh Bakri Sapalo's chief accomplishment is his writing system.&lt;ref&gt;A copy of a page in his script, as well as a table of values are provided in Hayward and Hassan's article.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Oromo has been transcribed using two writing systems Sheikh Sapalo was familiar with, the [[Ge'ez script]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]], both are "far from adequate" in Hayward and Hassan's opinion, for reasons they set forth. (Most important being that Amhara has only seven vowels while Oromo has 10.)&lt;ref name=HH-556&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; While they "have no reason whatsoever to entertain the belief that Shaykh Bakri had ever studied modern linguistics, or was acquainted with the concept of the [[phoneme]], it is nevertheless the case that his writing system is almost entirely phonemic; that is to say, it is a system achieving the ideal of just one graphic symbol for each phonologically distinctive sound of the language."&lt;ref&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; They further describe his writing system as a combination of a syllabary and an alphabet in that while the Ge'ez script builds on a consonantal base, the base character never appears without a modification to show the paired vowel. However, although the symbols Sheikh Bakri adopted are not cursive, which suggests a connection with Ge'ez over Arabic, none of them can be traced to either writing system; "they are a complete novelty."&lt;ref&gt;Hayward and Hassan, "Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Collection==
The Latin American holdings at the University of Texas have increased since the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lcn02&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Carlos E. Castañeda]] wrote a history of the collection to 1940, detailing deals for some acquisitions that he observed.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos E. Castañeda, "The Human Side of a Great Collection" ''Books Abroad'', vol. 14. No. 2 (Spring 1940), pp. 116-121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Distinguished Latin American historian [[Charles W. Hackett]], along with three other University of Texas professors went to the 1920 inauguration of revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] as president of Mexico.  Hackett learned that the library of historian and bibliophile Genaro García was for sale following his death. Hackett arranged for an appraisal by University of Texas and the deal was negotiated.  The collection was enormously rich, 25,000 printed items, newspapers, personal papers of [[Vicente Guerrero]], [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], [[Lucas Alamán]], [[Vicente Riva Palacio]] and others were part of the collection that was transported to Austin by a special train. The expansion of University of Texas's role in Latin American studies dates to this acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Castañeda, "The Human Side of a Great Collection," pp. 116-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's Latin American collection was further enriched by a number of acquisitions, including a donation of volumes by the [[Hispanic Society of America]] and papers of U.S. historian [[Justin H. Smith]], the collection of Chilean historian Diego Muñoz, which included many works by or about [[José Toribio Medina]]. In addition, the library acquired the private collection of Paraguayan historian Manuel Gondra.  A huge addition to the library was the acquisition of virtually all the collection of Mexican historian  [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]] that deal with sixteenth-century Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Castañeda, "The Human Side of a Great Collection," pp. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The García Icazbalceta collection included rare and important sixteenth-century printed works, including Bishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]]'s 1544 ''Doctrina'', Fray [[Pedro de Gante]]'s ''Doctrina'', writings of [[Francisco Cervantes de Salazar]]. Manuscripts include an autograph letter by [[Hernán Cortés]], a memorial by Fray [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], the ''residencia'' of the first [[viceroy of Mexico]], [[Antonio de Mendoza]], and the manuscript of Fray [[Gerónimo de Mendieta]]'s history of the Franciscans in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Castañeda, ''The Human Side of a Great Collection'', p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettie Lee Benson, for whom the Latin American collection is named, devoted the greatest part of her career to expanding the library's holdings by traveling to Latin America to acquire materials&lt;ref&gt;Josefina Zoraida Vázquez, "Nettie Lee Benson (1905-1993), [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 76, no. 2, (May 1996), pp. 313-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and she "developed an innovative acquisition methodology adapted to the conditions in the Latin-American book-publishing trade."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Gutiérrez-Witt, "Nettie Lee Benson," ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed June 16, 2016. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbene&lt;/ref&gt; In a taped interview, Benson discusses the collection and her role in helping build it.&lt;ref&gt;Latin American Collection: Interview with Nettie Lee Benson (videocassette, Austin: Communication Center, University of Texas, 1977).

'''Carl Frederik Bricka''' (July 10, 1845 &amp;ndash; August 23, 1903) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] archivist, historian, and biographer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Carl  Bricka was born in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. His father, Frederik Vilhelm Theodor Bricka (1809-79),  was a medical doctor. He attended [[Metropolitanskolen]] and   earned his [[Magister degree]] from the [[University of Copenhagen]] (1870). He became an assistant at the [[Danish Royal Library]] in 1871. During the period 1883-97, he was employed in the [[Danish National Archives]], after which he became the department head  (''Rigsarkivar''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://runeberg.org/dbl/3/0060.html |title=  Bricka, Frederik Vilhelm Theodor, 1809-79|publisher =  	Dansk biografisk Lexikon |author=   Carl Frederik Bricka

Bricka became a member of the board of the Danish Historical Society and edited the historical magazine published by the association (1878-97).
He also served as  editor of ''Danske Magazin'' (1883-1901). From 1885 until his death in 1903, he was the publisher of the ''[[Dansk biografisk lexikon]]: tillige omfattende Norge for Tidsrummet 1537–1814''. The first edition of this Danish biographic encyclopedia was published by [[Gyldendal]] in 19 volumes between 1887 to 1905.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">The first '''United Nations Conference on Indians in the Americas''' was held in [[Geneva]] in 1977. 

It was organised by [[Jimmie Durham]], head of the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], with [[Mapuche]] leaders exiled from [[Chile under Pinochet]] and supported by the American activist [[Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hylton|first=Forrest|title=A Revolutionary Identity|url=http://monthlyreview.org/2008/05/01/a-revolutionary-identity|work=''Review of Dunbar-Ortiz' ''Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra Years|publisher=Monthly Review|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lobbyists went on to set up a formal working group, but the [[United Nations]] widened its scope from [[the Americas]] to [[indigenous peoples]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Arthur|title=Indigenous poor still exploited, but now at least they are heard|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n14_v30/ai_14818792/|accessdate=July 20, 2011|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=Feb 4, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was therefore seen as the first UN conference on Indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rahman|first=Khan Ferdousour|title=Rights of indigenous people|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=7218|work=The Financial Express|publisher=International Publications Limited, [[Dhaka]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treatycouncil/&gt;

'''Eduard Georg Seler''' (December 5, 1849 &amp;ndash; November 23, 1922) was a prominent German [[anthropologist]], [[ethnohistorian]], [[linguist]], [[epigrapher]], academic and Americanist scholar, who made extensive contributions in these fields towards the study of [[pre-Columbian era]] cultures in [[the Americas]]. He is most renowned for his foundational studies concerning the ethnography, documents and history of [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, for which he is regarded as one of the most influential Mesoamericanist scholars active around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1973, p. 348)&lt;/ref&gt; Seler laid many fundamentals in understanding and deciphering the aztec pictorial script. A main contribution was the re-discovery and analysis of the basic  aztec calendar system: the existence of two aztec calendars, a 365-day solar profane (everyday use) resp. a 263-day lunar religious calendar.
He also noted from the sources, that the ceremonial killing victim figures alleged by Spanish priests and military (10.000s or even 100.000s, repeatedly) in their chronicles were most probably vastly exaggerated propaganda. Much later, that was confirmed by  excavations end of the 20th century.

Being poor and of ailing health, he was helped and supported for decades by his wife [[Caecilie Seler-Sachs|Cäcilie (Cecilia) Seler-Sachs]] (1855–1935, financially (she was the daughter of Dr Sachs, a wealthy MD), physically (during their long, hard, and insecure travels), and intellectually. Her photos of Aztec temples and pyramids are still useful to scientists, and after her husband's death she went on verifying his works, and publishing them. On the spot, the Selers were helped by Mexican scholar and historian Antonio Peñafiel.&lt;ref&gt;Two films : 1/ « ''Eduard Seler und Cäcilie Seler-Sachs, Pionere der Altamerikanistik'' » (Freie Universität, Berlin 2006) - 2/ « ''Der Geheime Code der Azteken''" , ''ein Dokumentarfilm von Saskia Weisheit, Deutschland 2009'' (released on TV channel ''Arte'' on August 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shuttle with bobin.jpg|thumb|Flying shuttle showing metal capped ends, wheels, and a [[pirn]] of weft thread|100px]]
The '''flying [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]''' was one of the key developments in the [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] of [[weaving]] during the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. It allowed a single [[weaving|weaver]] to weave much wider fabrics, and it could be mechanized, allowing for automatic machine [[loom]]s. The flying shuttle, which was [[patent]]ed by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] (1704–[[John Kay (flying shuttle)#Old age|c. 1779]]) in 1733, greatly sped up the previous hand process and halved the labour force. Where a broad-cloth loom previously required a weaver on each side, it could now be worked by a single operator. Until this point the textile industry had required four spinners to service one weaver. Kay's innovation, in wide use by the 1750s, greatly increased this disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of technology|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1233&amp;HistoryID=ab11&amp;gtrack=pthc#ixzz4ZpkXsrFG|website=www.historyworld.net|accessdate=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
In a typical frame loom, as used previous to the invention of the flying shuttle, the operator sat with the newly woven cloth before him or her, using treadles or some other mechanism to raise and lower the [[heddle]]s, which opened the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] in the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads. The operator then had to reach forward while holding the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] in one hand and pass this through the shed; the shuttle carried a [[bobbin]] for the [[weft]]. The shuttle then had to be caught in the other hand, the shed closed, and the [[beater (weaving)|beater]] pulled forward to push the weft into place. This action (called a "pick") required regularly bending forward over the fabric; more importantly, the coordination between the throwing and catching of the shuttle required multiple operators if the width of the fabric exceeded that which could be reasonably reached across (typically {{convert|60|in|cm}} or less).

The flying shuttle employs a board, called the "race," which runs, side to side, along the front of the beater, forming a track on which the shuttle runs. The lower threads of the shed rest on the track and the shuttle slides over them. At each end of the race, there is a box which catches the shuttle at the end of its journey, and which contains a mechanism for propelling the shuttle on its return trip.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The shuttle itself has some subtle differences from the older form. The ends of the shuttle are bullet-shaped and metal-capped, and the shuttle generally has rollers to reduce friction. The weft thread is made to exit from the end rather than the side, and the thread is stored on a [[pirn]] (a long, conical, one-ended, non-turning bobbin) to allow it to feed more easily. Finally, the flying shuttle is generally somewhat heavier, so as to have sufficient momentum to carry it all the way through the shed. 

==Social effects==
The increase in production due to the flying shuttle exceeded the capacity of the spinning industry of the day, and prompted development of powered spinning machines, beginning with the [[spinning jenny]] and the [[waterframe]], and culminating in the [[spinning mule]], which could produce strong, fine thread in the quantities needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

All were [[Luddite|attacked]] as threats to the livelihood of spinners and weavers, and Kay's patent was largely ignored. It is often incorrectly written that Kay was attacked and fled to France, but in fact he simply moved there to attempt to rent out his looms, a business model that had failed him in England.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The flying shuttle produced a new source of injuries to the weaving process; if deflected from its path, it could be shot clear of the machine, potentially striking workers. Turn-of-the-century [[Industrial accident|injury reports]] abound with instances in which eyes were lost or other injuries sustained and, in several instances (for example, an extended exchange in 1901), the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] was moved to take up the issue of installing guards and other contrivances to reduce these injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Factories and workshops: Annual report for 1900 |journal=  Sessional Papers  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3zpBAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=%22flying+shuttle%22+injury+-space  |pages= 289–290 |quote= During the past year I have investigated many shuttle accidents, and on no occasion where serious injury had resulted, has the shuttle guard been placed in that position for which it was intended. |publisher= [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|H. M. Stationery Off.]] |date=January–August 1901 |volume= X |author= [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] |oclc= 4689281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obsolescence==
The flying shuttle dominated commercial weaving through the middle of the twentieth century. By that time, other systems had begun to supplant it. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used to throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the speed of the loom. Projectile and [[rapier loom]]s eliminated the need to take the bobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms reduced the weight of moving parts further. Flying shuttle looms are still used for some purposes, and old models remain in use.

The '''Fédération International des Véhicules Anciens''' or '''FIVA''' (English: international federation of ancient vehicles) is the worldwide federative association of historic automobile clubs, be they for [[Antique car|veteran]], [[Vintage car|vintage]], pre- or post-war [[classic car]]s, at least thirty years old.&lt;br&gt;
FIVA statutes define it as: ''"a non-profit international association of clubs, federations and other organisations concerned with the preservation, restoration, use and culture of mechanically propelled road vehicles."'' &lt;ref name=Statutes16&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/wp-content/uploads/3-FIVA-STATUTES-2016-EN-ZG.pdf FIVA Statutes – 2016 – Paris (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

FIVA member clubs represent more than 1.5 million oldtimer enthusiasts in 64 countries,&lt;ref name=Lobbyfacts/&gt; through more than 85 member organizations.&lt;ref name=FIVAorg&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=189 The FIVA Organisation – FIVA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIVA's executive board bestows so-called ANF-Status (''Autorité Nationale de la FIVA''), or national FIVA authoritative status, upon one member organization per country, with the American [[Historic Vehicle Association]] (HVA) as the designated North American representative of FIVA – both for the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicvehicle.org/about-us/ About the HVA – Historic Vehicle Association (HVA)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=208 Global Members – FIVA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 all 61 national member organizations of FIVA ratified and enacted the so-called ''"Turin Charter"'', set forth by [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (TICCIH) ''"to preserve and safeguard the history of vehicles including their engineering, form, functions and documented histories and their many and diverse relationships with society and social environments, .."'' &lt;ref name=TICCIHturin/&gt;

==Founding and objectives==
The “Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens” was founded in 1966, when several historic vehicle associations and classic car clubs in a number of different countries felt a need for a worldwide body to promote and direct the interests of a historic vehicle movement internationally.&lt;ref name=TICCIHturin/&gt;

FIVA’s primary objective was to: ''"encourage the safe use of self-propelled, mechanical vehicles, more than thirty years old, on the roads for the benefit of both their owners, dedicated enthusiasts and the general public."'' &lt;ref name=FIVAmission/&gt;

The FIVA’s three main goals and objectives include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=48 About FIVA – Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protecting responsible use of historic vehicles, through policies and legislation, specific supportive actions relations with authorities
* [[Preservation and restoration of automobiles|Preserving historic vehicles]], related artifacts and records, including research and cataloguing
* Promoting historic vehicle culture, including international events, forums, and seminars

==Methods, activities and collaborations==
FIVA's ''Culture Commission'' works to achieve recognition of historic vehicles and related objects, as culturally significant artifacts, by legal and political authorities and other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=TICCIHturin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ticcih.org/turin-charter-ratified-by-fiva-federation-internationale-des-vehicules-anciens/ |title=Turin Charter ratified by FIVA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311151521/http://ticcih.org/turin-charter-ratified-by-fiva-federation-internationale-des-vehicules-anciens/ |archive-date=2018-03-11 |dead-url=no |last=Jerina |first=Nataša G. |date=May 2014 |website= |publisher=[[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] |access-date=2018-03-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIVA's ''Events Commission'' collaborated with the [[European Commission]] to create a freely downloadable Driver's Code for general guidance of historic vehicle users, and also has devised a code for the safe promotion of rallies or mildly competitive events. The ''Technical Commission'' works to support the preservation of as many historic vehicles as possible, by cataloguing them with FIVA's ''Vehicle ID-card''. FIVA has forged links with [[UNESCO]] and has persuaded the European Commission to accept that historic vehicles represent an important part of industrial heritage. FIVA has further linked up with the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), to promote the interest of historic cars in more sporting arenas, and with the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM), to help achieve similar objectives for motorcycles. FIVA's ''Legislation Commission'' works to address legislation that (threatens to) limit(s) the continued use of historic vehicles. Sofar this has primarily been concentrated on European countries and the [[European Union]], but legislation pressures on motor transport are ever increasing generally.&lt;ref name=FIVAmission&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=30 Our Mission – FIVA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions==
FIVA has Ambassadors, and a number of dedicated commissions working on its (members') national and international goals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiva.org/?page_id=118 The Commissions – FIVA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legislation Commission
* Culture Commission
* Technical Commission
* Trade, Skill &amp; Youth Commission
* Events Commission
* Motorcycle Commission
* Utilitarian Commission

==Definitions and classifications==
According to FIVA, a historic vehicle is "a mechanically propelled road vehicle:
* which is at least 30 years old,
* which is preserved and maintained in a historically correct condition,
* which is not used as a means of daily transport
* and which is therefore a part of our technical and cultural heritage." &lt;ref&gt;This part copied from German Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundy was educated at Risley School and then at Lichfield Grammar School. He began teaching at age 16. At age 27 he matriculated at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rudmin, Floyd W.|title=G. B.

According to his autobiography he states that his surname is [[Armenians|Armenian]] (Torossian), while his maternal grandmother was German and his maternal grandfather was of mixed [[Georgian people|Georgian]] and Armenian descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://henrytroyat.info/anri-truajya Henry Troyat Notes]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family fled Russia after the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]]. After a long exodus taking them to the Caucasus on to Crimea and later by sea to Istanbul and then Venice, the family finally settled in Paris in 1920, where young Troyat was schooled and later earned a law degree. The stirring and tragic events of this flight across half of Europe are vividly recounted by Troyat in ''Tant que la terre durera''. His first marriage produced a son before ending in divorce. He later married the love of his life, a widow with a young daughter whom he raised as his own.

Troyat received his first literary award, ''Le prix du roman populaire'', at the age of twenty-four, and by twenty-seven, he was awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]]. He published more than 100 books, novels and biographies, among them those of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Catherine the Great]], [[Rasputin]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Troyat's best-known work is ''[[La neige en deuil]]'', which was adapted as an English-language film in 1956 under the title ''[[The Mountain (1956 film)|The Mountain]]''.

Troyat was elected as a member of the [[Académie française]] in 1959. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving member.

{{History of Uganda}}
The '''history of Uganda between 1971 and 1979''' comprises the [[history of Uganda]] during [[Idi Amin]]'s [[military dictatorship]] over [[Uganda]].

The [[Economy of Uganda|Ugandan economy]] was devastated by Idi Amin's policies, including the [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expulsion of Asians]], the [[nationalisation]] of businesses and industry, and the expansion of the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside rebellion: the politics of insurgent violence|author=Jeremy M. Weinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real value of salaries and wages collapsed by 90% in less than a decade.&lt;ref name="Rick Stapenhurst, Sahr John Kpundeh"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curbing corruption: toward a model for building national integrity|author=Rick Stapenhurst, Sahr John Kpundeh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people killed as a result of his regime is unknown; estimates from international observers and human rights groups range from 100,000 to 500,000.

==Taking power==
From Uganda's independence from Great Britain in 1962 to early 1971, [[Milton Obote]]'s regime had terrorized, harassed, and tortured people.&lt;ref name="mutibwa"/&gt; Frequent food shortages had blasted food prices through the ceiling. Obote's persecution of [[Indians in Uganda|Indian traders]] had contributed to this.&lt;ref name="mutibwa"&gt;Mukasa Mutibwa: Uganda since independence: a story of unfulfilled hopes. p. 65-70&lt;/ref&gt; During Obote's regime, flagrant and widespread [[political corruption|corruption]] had emerged. The regime was disliked, particularly in [[Buganda]] where people had suffered the most.&lt;ref name="mutibwa"/&gt;

By January 1971, [[Milton Obote]], then [[President of Uganda]], was prepared to rid himself of the potential threat posed by Idi Amin. Departing for the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|1971 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] at [[Singapore]], he relayed orders to loyal [[Langi people|Langi]] officers that Amin and his supporters in the army were to be arrested. Various versions emerged of the way this news was leaked to Amin. Also, the role of the foreign powers in the coup had been debated until recently. Documents declassified by the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] reveal that, contrary to earlier speculations, it was not directly facilitated by Great Britain but benefited from covert support by Israel which saw [[Idi Amin]] as an agent to de-stabilise Islamic [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/revealed-how-israel-helped-amin-to-take-power-536162.html "Revealed: how Israel helped Amin to take power"], ''The Independent'', 17 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowden Richard ''Africa. Altered States, Ordinary Miracles'', 2008, p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;
The documents however unveil an outrightly positive assessment of Amin's personality by the British authorities as well as recommendations of support and the sale of arms to the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/News2002/uga004_amin_uk.htm Documents on Idi Amin's 1971 coup released]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Amin decided to forestall Obote and strike first. In the early morning hours of 25 January 1971, mechanized army units loyal to him attacked strategic targets in [[Kampala]] and the airport at [[Entebbe]], where the first shell fired by a pro-Amin tank commander killed two [[Roman Catholic]] priests in the airport waiting room. Amin's troops easily overcame the disorganized opposition to the [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|coup]], and Amin almost immediately initiated mass executions of [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Lango people|Langi]] troops, whom he believed to be pro-Obote.

The Amin coup was warmly welcomed by most of the people of the [[Buganda]] kingdom, which Obote had attempted to dismantle. They seemed willing to forget that their new president, Idi Amin, had been the tool of that military suppression. Amin made the usual statements about his government's intent to play a mere "caretaker role" until the country could recover sufficiently for civilian rule. Amin repudiated Obote's non-aligned foreign policy, and his government was quickly recognized by Israel, Britain, and the United States. By contrast, presidents [[Julius Nyerere]] of Tanzania, [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of Zambia, [[Jomo Kenyatta]] of Kenya, and the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) initially refused to accept the legitimacy of the new military government. Nyerere, in particular, opposed Amin's regime, and he offered hospitality to the exiled Obote, facilitating his attempts to raise a force and return to power.

==Once in power==
[[File:Idi Amin -Archives New Zealand AAWV 23583, KIRK1, 5(B), R23930288.jpg|thumb|upright|Amin, 1973]]
Amin's military experience, which was virtually his only experience, determined the character of his rule. He renamed Government House "the [[Command post|Command Post]]", instituted an advisory defence council composed of military commanders, placed military tribunals above the system of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], appointed soldiers to top government posts and [[parastatal]] agencies, and even informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military discipline.

Uganda then became a military dictatorship which was, in effect, governed from a collection of military barracks scattered across the country, where battalion commanders, acting like local warlords, represented the coercive arm of the government. The Ugandan General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, was disbanded and replaced by the Ugandan State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at [[Nakasero]] became the scene of torture and executions over the next couple of years.

Despite its outward display of a military chain of command, Amin's government was arguably more consumed with rivalries, regional divisions, and ethnic politics than the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC) coalition that it had replaced. The army itself was an arena of lethal competition, in which losers were usually eliminated. Within the officer corps, those trained in Britain opposed those trained in Israel, and both stood against the untrained, who soon eliminated many of the army's most experienced officers. In 1966, well before the Amin era, northerners in the army had assaulted and harassed soldiers from the south. In 1971 and 1972, the [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] and [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]] (Amin's ethnic group) from the West Nile were slaughtering northern [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Lango people|Langi]], who were identified with Obote. Then the Kakwa fought the Lugbara. Amin came to rely on [[Nubians]] and on former [[Anyanya]] rebels from southern [[Sudan]].

Amin recruited his followers from his own tribe, the Kakwas, along with Sudanese and Nubians. By 1977, these three groups formed 60% of the 22 top generals and 75% of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80% and 87.5% of these groups even though they were only 5% of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Lindemann, The ethnic politics of coup avoidance, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ugandan army grew from 10,000 to over 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army was largely a mercenary force. Half the soldiers were Sudanese, 26% Congolese, only 24% were Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield "Military Diversion in the 1978 Uganda-Tanzania War" page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 1973, Idi Amin decreed Swahili was to be Uganda's official language. 12 out of the 20 districts had chosen this, the other 8 wanted Luganda.&lt;ref&gt;Swahili State and Society: The Political Economy of an African Language, Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The army, which had been progressivelyy expanded under Obote, was further doubled and redoubled under Amin. Recruitment was largely, but not entirely, in the north. There were periodic [[purge]]s, when various battalion commanders were viewed as potential problems or became real threats. Each purge provided new opportunities for promotions from the ranks. The commander of the Uganda Air Force, Smuts Guweddeko, had previously worked as a telephone operator; the unofficial executioner for the regime, Major Malyamungu, had formerly been a nightwatch officer. By the mid-1970s, only the most trustworthy military units were allowed ammunition, although this prohibition did not prevent a series of mutinies and murders. An attempt by an American [[journalist]], Nicholas Stroh, and his colleague, Robert Siedle, to investigate one of these barracks outbreaks in 1971 at the Simba battalion in [[Mbarara]] led to their disappearances and, later, deaths. Several army officers who were suspected of having been involved in the murder of Stroh and Siedle were later appointed to high-ranking positions: Among these were Military Tribunal chairman [[Juma Butabika]], chief technical officer of the airforce Captain Taban, Minister of Transport Juma Sabuni, and Minister of Regional administration Fadur Ali.{{sfnp|Amnesty International|1978|pp=15–16}}

===Muammar Gaddafi and the Soviet Union===

Amin never forgot the source of his power. He spent much of his time rewarding, promoting, and manipulating the officers and soldiers of the Ugandan army. Financing his ever-increasing military expenditures was a continuing concern. Early in 1972, he reversed [[Foreign relations of Uganda|foreign policy]] — never a major issue for Amin — to secure financial and military aid from [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]]. Amin expelled the remaining Israeli advisers, to whom he was much indebted, and became [[Criticism of the Israeli government|anti-Israel]]. To induce foreign aid from [[Saudi Arabia]], he rediscovered his previously neglected [[Islam]]ic heritage. He also commissioned the construction of a great [[Uganda National Mosque|mosque]] on [[Kampala Hill]] in the capital city, but it was never completed during his rule because much of the money intended for it was [[Embezzlement|embezzled]]. In 2008 Amin's dream of building one of Africa's largest mosques came true, and construction was finally completed more than 30 years after it initially began.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7305641.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his foreign policy reversal in 1972, the [[Soviet Union]] became Amin's largest arms supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who influenced whom?|author=Dale C. Tatum|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Germany]] helped to build Amin's secret police. During the Tanzanian invasion in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence about its involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth M. Winrow: The foreign policy of the GDR in Africa, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion of Asians and nationalisations===
{{main|Expulsion of Asians from Uganda}}
In August 1972, Amin gave most of Uganda's 80,000 Asians 90 days to leave the country, and seized their property, homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jørgensen|first=Jan Jelmert|title=Uganda: a modern history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09MNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA288|accessdate=12 August 2010|year=1981|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-85664-643-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Patel"/&gt; Although the latter were ultimately exempted from the expulsion, many chose to leave voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"/&gt; The expulsion took place against a backdrop of Indophobia in Uganda, with Amin accusing a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=Hasu H.|year=1972|title=General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda|journal=Issue: A Journal of Opinion|volume=2|issue=4|pages=12–22|doi=10.2307/1166488|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to the ethnic Ugandan.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"/&gt;

Many of the expellees were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 refugees ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"/&gt; In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"/&gt; Although Amin proclaimed that the "common man" was the beneficiary of this drastic act — which proved immensely popular in Uganda and most of Africa — it was actually the Ugandan army that emerged with the houses, cars, and businesses of the departing Asian minority. This [[Confiscation|expropriation]] of foreign property proved disastrous for the already declining economy. With the economy now run by Ugandan army officers and supporters (many of whom had no experience in how to run a business), all of the local businesses and stores were soon run into the ground from mismanagement and abuse of power, cement factories at [[Tororo]] and [[Fort Portal]] collapsed from lack of maintenance and neglect, and sugar production ground to a halt as unmaintained machinery jammed permanently.

Uganda's export crops were sold by government parastatals, but most of the foreign currency they earned went for purchasing weapons and imports for the army. The most famous example of this was the so-called "whisky runs" to [[Stansted Airport]] in England, where planeloads of expensive [[Scotch whisky]], [[transistor radios]], gold Rolex wristwatches, and other luxury items were purchased for Amin to distribute among his officers and soldiers. Amin later justified his rewarding and doting on the Ugandan army by quoting an old African proverb, which summed up to Amin's treatment of his army: "A dog with a bone in its mouth can't bite."

With the Ugandan economy faltering, the rural African producers and farmers, particularly of [[coffee]], turned to [[smuggling]], especially to [[Kenya]]. The smuggling problem became an obsession with Amin; toward the end of his rule, he appointed his mercenary and political adviser, the former British citizen [[Bob Astles]], to take all necessary steps to eliminate the problem. These steps included orders to the Ugandan police and army to shoot smugglers on sight.

===Terror===
Another near-obsession for Amin was the threat of a counter-attack by former president Obote. Shortly after the expulsion of Asians in 1972, Obote did launch such an attempt across the Tanzanian border into south-western Uganda. His small army contingent in twenty-seven trucks set out to capture the southern Ugandan military post at Masaka but instead settled down to await a general uprising against Amin, which did not occur. A planned seizure of the airport at Entebbe by soldiers in an allegedly hijacked [[East African Airways]] passenger aircraft was aborted when Obote's pilot blew out the aircraft's tires and it remained in Tanzania. Amin was able to mobilize his more reliable Malire Mechanical Regiment and expel the invaders.

Although jubilant at his success, Amin realized that Obote, with Nyerere's aid, might try again. He had the SRB and the newly formed Public Safety Unit (PSU) redouble their efforts to uncover subversives and other imagined enemies of the state. General fear and insecurity became a way of life for the populace, as thousands of people disappeared. In an ominous twist, people sometimes learned by listening to the radio that they were "about to disappear."

State terrorism was evidenced in a series of spectacular incidents; for example, High Court Judge [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]], former head of government and leader of the banned DP, was seized directly from his courtroom. Like many other victims, he was forced to remove his shoes and then bundled into the trunk of a car, never to be seen alive again. Whether calculated or not, the symbolism of a pair of shoes by the roadside to mark the passing of a human life was a bizarre yet piercing form of state terrorism.

===Environment===
During the eight years under Amin's rule, the Ugandan environment and ecological system was subjected to abuse and destruction by widespread poaching and deforesting committed by both smugglers and Ugandan army soldiers. It is reported that Uganda lost 75% of its elephants, 98% of its rhinos, 90% of its crocodiles, 80% of its lions and leopards, in addition to numerous species of bird.&lt;ref name="Rick Stapenhurst, Sahr John Kpundeh"/&gt;

===Palestinian hijackers of Air France Flight 139===
{{main|Operation Entebbe}}
Amin attempted to establish ties with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations]] in June 1976, when he offered the Palestinian hijackers of an Air France flight from Tel Aviv a protected base at the old airport at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe]], from which to press their demands in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The dramatic [[Operation Entebbe|rescue]] of the hostages by Israeli commandos was a severe blow to Amin. Humiliated, he retaliated against an elderly hostage—75-year-old Dora Bloch— who was hospitalized in poor health at the time of the raid and was left behind. Bloch was kidnapped from her hospital bed and killed on Amin's orders, along with the entire civilian staff of Entebbe airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html Entebbe's unsung hero], Israel News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Amin's government, conducted by often erratic personal proclamation, continued on. Because he was illiterate his entire life — a disability shared with most of his fellow military officers and soldiers — Amin relayed orders and policy decisions orally by telephone, over the radio, and in long rambling speeches to which civil servants were told to pay close attention. The bureaucracy soon became paralysed as government administrators feared to make what might prove to be a wrong decision that would displease or anger Amin in the slightest which would result in their immediate arrest and imprisonment or summary execution.

Shortly after Amin seized power, the Minister of Defence demanded, and was given, command of the Ministry of Education office building, but then the decision was reversed by Amin for no clear reason. Important education files were lost during their transfer back and forth by wheelbarrow. In many respects, Amin's government in the 1970s resembled the governments of nineteenth-century African monarchs, with the same problems of enforcing orders at a distance, controlling rival factions at court, and rewarding loyal followers with plunder. Amin's regime was possibly less efficient than those of the pre-colonial monarchs.

Religious conflict was another characteristic of the Amin regime that had its origins in the nineteenth century. After rediscovering his Islamic allegiance in the effort to gain foreign aid from [[Libya]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], Amin began to pay more attention to the formerly deprived Muslims in Uganda, a move which turned out to be a mixed blessing for them. Muslims began to do well in what economic opportunities yet remained, the more so if they had relatives in the army. Construction work began on Kibuli Hill, the site of Kampala's most prominent mosque. Many Ugandan Muslims with a sense of history believed that the Muslim defeat by Christians in 1889 was finally being redressed. Christians, in turn, perceived that they were under siege as a religious group; it was clear that Amin viewed the churches as potential centres of opposition. A number of priests and ministers disappeared in the course of the 1970s, but the matter reached a climax with the formal protest against army terrorism in 1977 by [[Church of Uganda]] ministers, led by Archbishop [[Janani Luwum]]. Although Luwum's body was subsequently recovered from a clumsily contrived "car accident", subsequent investigations revealed that Luwum had been shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918762,00.html Amin:The Wild Man of Africa], ''Time Magazine'', 7 March 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

This latest in a long line of atrocities was greeted with international condemnation, but apart from the continued trade [[boycott]] initiated by the United States in July 1978, verbal condemnation was not accompanied by action. In September 1978, Amin banned nearly all Christian Church activities for their subversiveness.&lt;ref&gt;An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996 ed. John E. Jessup page 23&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1978 Amin's circle of close associates had shrunk significantly — the result of defections and executions. Because of his violent temper as well as his erratic and unpredictable behaviour, it was increasingly risky to be too close to Amin, as his vice president and formerly trusted associate, General [[Mustafa Adrisi]], discovered. When Adrisi was injured in a suspicious auto accident, troops loyal to him became restive. The once reliable Malire Mechanized Regiment mutinied, as did other units.

In October 1978, Amin sent troops still loyal to him against the mutineers, some of whom fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin then claimed that Tanzanian President Nyerere, his perennial enemy, had been at the root of his troubles. Amin accused Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, and, hoping to divert attention from his internal troubles and rally Uganda against the foreign adversary, Amin invaded Tanzanian territory and formally annexed a section across the Kagera River boundary on 1 November 1978.

===Uganda–Tanzania War===
{{Main|Uganda–Tanzania War}}
[[Declaration of war|Declaring a formal state of war]] against Uganda, Nyerere mobilized his citizen army reserves and counter-attacked, joined by Ugandan exiles united as the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] (UNLA). The Ugandan Army retreated steadily, expending much of its energy by looting along the way. Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] sent 3,000 troops to aid Amin, but the Libyans soon found themselves on the front line, while behind them Ugandan Army units were using supply trucks to carry their newly plundered wealth in the opposite direction. Tanzania and the UNLA [[Fall of Kampala|took]] [[Kampala]] on 11 April 1979, and Amin fled by air, first to Libya and later to a permanent exile at [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Though pro-Amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital, combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the Sudanese border and eliminated the last resistance.{{sfn|Anderson|Rolandsen|2017|p=163}}

The hypothetical state of '''Hwanguk''' (환국, 桓國) is the first mythical state of [[Korea]] described in [[Hwandan Gogi]].  According to Hwandan Gogi, Hwanguk existed long before [[Gojoseon]].  However, mainstream Korean historians reject the existence of Hwanguk for lack of credible evidence.

== Claim of Hwanguk ==

In some editions of [[Samguk Yusa]], one of the oldest surviving Korean history books, the name [[Hwanin]] (桓因), the mythical grandfather of Gojoseon's founder [[Dangun]], appears as if it is instead written ''Hwanguk'' (桓國), which would mean "The Hwan nation." Some people{{says who|date=October 2012}} argue that this is an evidence that the original manuscript of Samguk Yusa wrote ''Hwanguk'' instead of ''Hwanin.''

'''Justin McCarthy''' (22 November 1830 – 24 April 1912) was an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] and Liberal historian, novelist and politician. He was a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1879 to 1900, taking his seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

==Early life==
McCarthy was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork City, Cork]], and was educated there. He began his career as a journalist, aged 18, in Cork. From 1853 to 1859 he was in [[Liverpool]], on the staff of the ''[[Northern Daily Times]]''. In March 1855, he married Charlotte Ailman. In 1860 he moved to London, as parliamentary reporter to ''[[The Morning Star (19th century U.K. newspaper)|The Morning Star]]'', of which he became editor in 1864. He gave up his post in 1868, and, after a lecturing tour in the United States, joined the staff of the ''[[The_Daily_News_(UK)|Daily News]]'' as leader-writer in 1870. In this capacity he became one of the most useful and respected upholders of the liberal politics of the time. He lectured again in America in 1870–71, and again in 1886–87. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Political career==
[[File:Justin McCarthy Vanity Fair 1885-05-23.jpg|left|thumb|160px|McCarthy caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1885]]
McCarthy was first elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at a by-election on 4 April 1879, when he was returned unopposed as a [[Home Rule League]] MP for [[Longford (UK Parliament constituency)|County Longford]].&lt;ref name="walker-1801-1922"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parliamentary election results in Ireland 1801–1922|editor=Brian M. Walker|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|location=Dublin|year=1978|isbn=0-901714-12-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected unopposed as a Parnellite Home Ruler in [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, op. cit., page 125&lt;/ref&gt; and when the two-seat Longford constituency was split into two divisions under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act]], he was elected as an [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] member for the new single-seat [[North Longford (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern division of Longford]]. His sole opponent, a Conservative, won only 6% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, op. cit., pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 general election]], he was returned unopposed in North Longford,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, op. cit., page 140&lt;/ref&gt; but had also stood in [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]], where he was declared to have lost to the [[Irish Unionist Alliance|Unionist]] candidate by the narrow margin of 1778 votes to 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, op. cit., pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However, the result was later overturned on peition, and McCarthy opted to sit for Derry City. During the divorce controversy surrounding [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in November 1890, the British Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] expressed a warning, given to Justin McCarthy as intermediary, that if Parnell retained leadership of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] it would mean the loss of the next election, the end of their alliance and Home Rule. When the annual party leadership election meeting was called later that month, this threat was somehow not conveyed to the members, who re-elected Parnell leader of the Party. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

After a further historical meeting of the Irish Party MPs early December, Parnell refused to retire, and the Party divided. McCarthy became chairman of the Anti-Parnellite group, or the [[Irish National Federation]] for a year in 1891–1892; but his nationalism was of a temperate and orderly kind, and though his personal distinction singled him out for the chairmanship during the party dissensions of this period, he was in no active sense the political leader. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]], McCarthy again stood both in North Longford and in Derry City. In each seat there was a two-way contest between the [[Anti-Parnellite]] McCarthy and a Unionist candidate, but the narrow Unionist victory in Derry (by 1986 votes to 1960) was not overturned, and McCarthy sat for North Longford, where he had won over 93% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, op. cit., page 147&lt;/ref&gt; He was returned unopposed for North Longford in [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895]], and stood down from Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]].

==Writing==
It has been claimed that McCarthy's true vocation was literature.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation|first=George|last=Wilman|title=Sketches of living celebrities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68|year=1882|publisher=Griffith and Farran|location=London|pages=68–76|chapter=Justin McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest publications were novels, some of which, such as ''A Fair Saxon'' (1873), ''Dear Lady Disdain'' (1875), ''Miss Misanthrope'' (1878), ''Donna Quixote'' (1879), attained considerable popularity. His most important work is his ''History of Our Own Times'' (vols. i.iv., 1879–1880; vol. v., 1897), which treats of the period between [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s accession and her [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCarthy |first= Justin |author-link= Justin_McCarthy_(1830–1912) |title= A History of Our Own Times: From the Accession of Queen Victoria to the General Elections of 1880 |publisher=  Chatto &amp; Windus |place= London  |year= 1880 |volume = I |page= |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210308 |accessdate= 15 March 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}; {{cite book |last=McCarthy |first= Justin |author-link= Justin_McCarthy_(1830–1912) |title= A History of Our Own Times: From the Accession of Queen Victoria to the General Elections of 1880 |publisher=  Chatto &amp; Windus |place= London  |year= 1881 |volume = II |page= |url= https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.210309/2015.210309.A-History#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate= 15 March 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}; {{cite book |last=McCarthy |first= Justin |author-link= Justin_McCarthy_(1830–1912) |title= A History of Our Own Times: From the Accession of Queen Victoria to the General Elections of 1880 |publisher=  Chatto &amp; Windus |place= London  |year= 1881 |volume = III |page= |url= https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.210310/2015.210310.A-History#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate= 15 March 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}; {{cite book |last=McCarthy |first= Justin |author-link= Justin_McCarthy_(1830–1912) |title= A History of Our Own Times: From the Accession of Queen Victoria to the General Elections of 1880 |publisher=  Chatto &amp; Windus |place= London  |year= 1881 |volume = IV |page= |url= https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.210311/2015.210311.A-History#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate= 15 March 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a ''History of the Four Georges'' (1884–1901); the latter half was written by his son, [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He also collaborated on three novels with [[Rosa Campbell Praed]]: ''The Right Honourable'' (1886), ''The Rebel Rose'' (issued anonymously in 1888 but appeared in their joint names in two later editions under the title, ''The Rival Princess''), and ''The Ladies' Gallery'' (1888). They also collaborated on ''The Grey River'', a book on the Thames, which was illustrated with etchings by [[Mortimer Menpes]]. He wrote ''The Story of Gladstone'' (1904), a somewhat uncritical biography of William Ewart Gladstone. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Family life==
McCarthy married in 1855, they had a son [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] born in 1859 who also became a Member of Parliament, and they had a daughter Charlotte born in 1872. McCarthy died in Folkestone, Kent, England on 24 April 1912, aged 81.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mr. Justin McCarthy |journal= Times |place=London, England |date= 26 April 1912 |volume= 11 |publisher=The Times Digital Archive|accessdate= 31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Coin of Leopold I 3 Kreuzer 1670.jpg|thumb|3 Kreuzer coin of 1670, similar to coins struck by Konrad Bethmann]]
'''Konrad Bethmann''' or '''Conrad Bethmann''' (1652–1701) was a German administrator and entrepreneur serving secular and ecclesiastical authorities.

==Life==
He was born in [[Goslar]] as the seventh child of the merchant ''Andreas Bethmann'', four years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Much of Germany then was a patchwork of small to medium-sized jurisdictions. While this factor impeded development towards a nation-state, it ensured plentiful opportunities for ambitious bureaucrats and entrepreneurs.

After leaving his hometown, he first became [[Münzwardein]] in [[Dömitz]] (Mecklenburg), then was appointed in 1683 [[Münzmeister]] to the Princess of [[House of Nassau|Nassau-Holzappel]] in [[Cramberg]] on the [[Lahn]] river, followed by his appointment in 1687 as ''Münzmeister'' (Master of the Mint) to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]], and in 1692 as ''Münzmeister'' for the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishopric/Electorate of Mainz]] in [[Aschaffenburg]].

Among the oldest items pertaining to the Bethmann family in the (online) archives of the city of Frankfurt is the file of a criminal complaint brought by Konrad in 1685 while he was in the employ of the [[House of Nassau]]. Under the rubric "Jew ''v.'' Out-of-towner", the archive summarizes the case as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Conrad Bethmann, master of the mint for the Princely House of Nassau-Schaumburg, ''versus'' Mencke and Abraham zum Hecht (father and son), for theft of Schaumburg [[Heller (money)|hellers]] in Schwalbach near Königstein and resale of stolen property. Defendants claim to have acquired the stolen coins in good faith. Arrest of Abraham, release on posting of 304&amp;nbsp; [[Reichsthaler]]s bond. Out-of-court settlement of Abraham with bursars of Nassau-Schaumburg.&lt;br /&gt;
Contains:   	Medical opinion on state of health of arrestee Abraham zum Hecht; Legal opinion of the jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Website of ''Institut für Stadtgeschichte''. The ISG website does not give [[URL]]s to individual items. To verify the item in the original German language, start [http://www.ifaust.de/isg/ here], then click on ''Personen II (Sammlungen)''. On the next page, click on the blue button labeled ''Suche'', in the search mask enter "Conrad Bethmann" (without inverted commas) next to ''Stichworte''. Leave ''Laufzeit'' empty and click on ''Start''. The first hit will be the complaint file.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He bequeathed a substantial fortune on his widow [[Anna Elisabeth]] (1654–1727).

As a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Anna Elisabeth and her children left the [[Archbishop]]ric behind for Lutheran Frankfurt am Main; there she found it easier to comply with her religious obligations and benefited from the presence of relatives. Three of Konrad and Anna Elisabeth's daughters married citizens of Frankfurt. Their son [[Simon Moritz Bethmann]] (1687–1725) was appointed an ''[[Amtmann]]'' ("chief administrator") in [[Nassau, Germany|Bergnassau]] on the river [[Lahn]].

Another son lies buried in the St. Lazarus cemetery of [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Helbing, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on his tombstone reads:

{{cquote|Reader! &lt;br /&gt;Here you may seek what you do not find and find what you sought not. You sought a Coin and found more than a Coin: Dust, Earth and Ashes of a Well-Behaved Christian, namely the Former Well-born and Highly Educated Balthasar Johann Bethmann; having served as most meritorious Mining Counselor to His Princely Excellency the Governing [[Landgrave]] of Hessen-Darmstadt and as Minting Counsellor and General-[[Münzwardein|Wardein]] to the most praiseworthy Upper-Rhenish district; born in the year of our Lord 1679 on the 12th of August in Braunschweig, having served with distinction as [[Münzmeister|Müntz-Meister]] in [[Darmstadt]] from A.D. 1706 for 28 years, there elevated to Mining Counselor in A.D. 1734, co-opted by the Upper-Rhenish district to the office of Minting Commissioner ad comitia in A.D. 1737, and died blissfully in A.D. 1738 on the 26th of June, his age ripe with merit in his 59th year. &lt;br /&gt;Now you know what Coin lieth in this Grave, what its content, value, face and lettering be. True, now it doth not shine: but go ye now and dwell happily in God.}}

The '''Lancashire Loom''' was a semi-automatic [[power loom]] invented by James Bullough and William Kenworthy in 1842.  Although it is self-acting, it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the Lancashire cotton industry for a century.
 &lt;!-- British English--&gt;

==John Bullough==

John Bullough (1800–68) was from [[Accrington]], often described as a simple-minded [[Westhoughton]] weaver. Originally a handloom weaver, unlike others of his trade Bullough embraced new developments such as [[Edmund Cartwright]]'s [[power loom]] (1785). While colleagues were busy rejecting new devices such as in the [[power-loom riots]] that broke out in Lancashire in 1826, Bullough improved his own loom by inventing various components, including the "self-acting temple" that kept the woven cloth at its correct width, and a loose [[reed (weaving)|reed]] that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time a warp thread broke on his loom. Bullough moved to [[Blackburn]] and worked with William Kenworthy at [[Brookhouse Mill]]s, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that later became known as the "Lancashire Loom".&lt;ref name="Spinning the Web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=62&amp;sub=factory&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Inventions+%26amp%3B+inventors|title=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to quit Blackburn, for fear of angry [[handloom weaver]]s. He later settled in [[Accrington]] to form [[Howard &amp; Bullough]] in partnership with John Howard at Globe Works, &lt;!--Atlas--&gt; alongside the [[Leeds-Liverpool Canal]] in Accrington. Here he invented the slasher, which founded the company's success. He was one of the country's largest manufacturers. At the height of the business the Globe works employed almost 6000 workers and covered {{convert|52|acre|m2}}. 75% of production was exported.
&lt;ref name="MUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/engineers4.html|title=Manchester Engineers &amp; Inventors|publisher=Manchester UK A Virtual Encyclopaedia of Greater Manchester in the Third Millennium |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Howard and Bullough became part of the Textile Machinery Makers Limited group, which were bought out by Platt, and in 1991 the company name changed to Platt Saco Lowell. The Globe works closed in 1993. 
&lt;ref name="Lily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lily-elsie.com/howard.htm|title=Howard and Bullough, Cotton Machinery Manufacturers|accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Loom==
[[File:Modern Loose Reed Power Loom-marsden.png|thumb|Marsdens:1892 diagram]]
[[File:Weaving shed, Queen Street Mill - geograph.org.uk - 680867.jpg|thumb|1894 Lancashire Looms (Harling &amp; Todd) still in use at [[Queen Street Mill]], Burnley.]]
From 1830 there had been a series of incremental improvements to the basic [[Roberts Loom]].
* [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] 1830, Roberts Loom. These improvements were a geared take up wheel and tappets to operate multiple heddles&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|pp=70,71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stanford, Pritchard and Wilkinson – patented a method to stop on the break of weft or warp. It was not used.
* William Dickinson of Blackburn [[Blackburn Loom]] the modern overpick loom
There now appear a series of useful improvements that are contained in patents for useless devices
* Hornby, Kenworthy and Bullough of Blackburn 1834 – the vibrating or fly reed
* John Ramsden and Richard Holt of Todmorden 1834 – a new automatic weft stopping motion
* John Bullough of Blackburn 1835 – improved automatic weft stopping motion and taking up and letting off arrangements
* Andrew Parkinson 1836 – improved stretcher ([[Temple (Weaving)|temple]]).
* William Kenworthy and James Bullough 1841 – trough and roller [[Temple (Weaving)|temple]] (became the standard), A simple stop-motion.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|pp=88–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At this point the loom has become fully automatic, this is the Kenworthy and Bullough Lancashire Loom. The Cartwight loom weaver could work one loom at 120–130 picks per minute- with a Kenworthy and Bullough's Lancashire Loom, a weaver can run up to six looms working at 220–260 picks per minute- thus giving 12 times more throughput. The power loom is now referred to  as "a perfect machine", it produced textile of a better quality than the hand weaver for less cost. An economic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other improvements were the 
* John Bullough 1842 – the loose reed, which doubled the operating speed
* John Sellers 1845 – [[Burnley]] Brake, a loom brake
* Blackburn 1852 – [[Dickinson Loom]]  Modern overpick- or side pick using the cone and bowl that substituted the lever pick. Invented in Dickinson's mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movements===
The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up. &lt;!-- Needs refining--&gt;
:*''Shedding'': The operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds: "open" and "closed". Open Shed-The warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick.
:*''Picking'': The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms.
:*''Beating-up'': The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Shed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed, the term ''A [[Four Loom Weaver]]'' was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms,&lt;ref name="QuarryBank"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rose|1986|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that was governed by the thread being used. By 1900, the loom was challenged by the [[Northrop Loom]], which was fully automatic and could be worked in larger numbers. The Northrop was suitable for coarse thread but for fine cotton, the Lancashire loom was still preferred. By 1914, Northop looms made up 40% of looms in American mills, but in the United Kingdom labour costs were not as significant and they only supplied 2% of the British market.

A '''leotard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ə|t|ɑːr|d}}) is a unisex [[skin-tight]] one-piece garment that covers the [[body]] from the crotch to the shoulder.  The garment was first made famous by the French acrobatic performer [[Jules Léotard]] (1838–1870). There are sleeveless, short-sleeved and long-sleeved leotards. A variation is the [[unitard]], which also covers the legs. 

Leotards are worn by [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[gymnast]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[figure skaters]], [[sportsperson|athletes]], [[actor]]s, [[wrestler]]s, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]] performers both as practice garments and performance [[costume]]s. They are often worn together with ballet skirts on top and [[tights]]&lt;ref name=tights&gt;{{cite web|last=Dance.net|title=tights ARE underwear|url=http://www.dance.net/topic/9260948/1/Ask-a-Teacher/one-kid-just-doesn-t-get-it-tights-ARE-underwear-Help.html|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes [[bike shorts]] as underwear. As a casual garment, a leotard can be worn with a belt; it can also be worn under overalls or short skirts.

Leotards are entered by stepping into the legs and pulling the sleeves over the shoulders. Scoop-necked leotards have wide neck openings and are held in place by the elasticity of the garment. Others are [[crew neck]]ed or [[polo neck]]ed and close at the back of the neck with a [[zipper]] or snaps.

==Use==
Leotards are used for a variety of purposes, including [[yoga]], cardiovascular exercise, dance (particularly for ballet and/or modern), as [[pajamas]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} for additional layered warmth under clothing, and for recreational and casual wear. They may form a part of children's dressing up and play outfits and can also be worn as a top.

Leotards are commonly worn in figure skating, postwar modern dance, traditional ballet and gymnastics, especially by young children.  Practice leotards are usually sleeveless. Female competition garments for gymnastics and skating are almost always long-sleeved, while male competition leotards may be sleeved or sleeveless, the latter more common in gymnastics, the former in figure skating.

Many leotards are cut high enough above the legs that they expose underwear.  For this reason, underwear is often omitted, or special underwear, cut high on the waist, is worn. Many dance studios forbid underwear.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Gymnastics judges can deduct points for visible underwear.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  For example, in the movie ''[[Stick It]]'', a competitor had her score deducted for a technicality of showing a [[Brassiere|bra]] strap.

==History==
[[Image:Taylor Dayne Australian Tour.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Singer [[Taylor Dayne]] wears a sparkly leotard-inspired costume during her 2011 Australian tour]]
The first known use of the name ''leotard'' came only in 1886, many years after Léotard's death. Léotard himself called the garment a ''[[wiktionary:fr:maillot|maillot]]'', which is a general French word for different types of tight-fitting shirts or sports shirts. In the early 20th century, leotards were mainly confined to [[circus]] and [[acrobatic]] shows, worn by the specialists who performed these acts.

The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards influencing the style of [[swimsuit]]s, with women's [[one-piece swimsuit]]s today still being similar in appearance to leotards.

Leotards are worn by professional dancers such as the [[showgirl]]s of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Stage use of the leotard typically coordinates the garment with [[stockings]] or tights.

In the 1950s, traditionally-styled leotards continued to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors, but leotards began to be used as simple and functional exercise garments, often in institutional settings like schools and in fitness training. These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 1970s, with more colorful leotards appearing on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.

During the 1970s and 1980s, leotards were extensively used as clothing for [[aerobic exercise]]s, eventually displaced in the 1990s by Lycra pants similar to those used in cycling uniforms and in the 2000s they were replaced completely by trousers and leggings (tight clothing which cover the legs made of spandex and denim). It continues to be also worn by women cyclists and athletes in competitions.

==Crossover to fashion activewear==
[[File:Aerobic exercise - public demonstration12.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Typical aerobic exercise wear of the 1980s]]

By the late 1970s leotards had become common both as exercise and street wear, popularized by the [[disco]] craze, and [[aerobics]] [[1980s in fashion#Dancewear|fashion craze]] of the time. These leotards were produced in a variety of [[nylon]] and [[spandex]] materials, as well as the more traditional cotton previously used for uni-colored leotards and tights. Exercise videos by celebrities such as [[Jane Fonda]] also did much to popularize the garment. The dancewear company Danskin flourished during this period, producing a wide variety of leotards for both dance and street wear. Other companies, such as [[Gilda Marx]], produced leotards during this time period then ceased production when they ceased to be in fashion. By the late 1980s leotards for exercise wear had become little more than bikini bottoms with straps over the shoulders, generally worn with cropped shirts. From the mid 1980s to mid 90s leotards were popularly worn as tops with jeans especially skinny jeans as part of everyday wear. By the mid 1990s leotards had been almost completely replaced for exercise wear by the [[sports bra]] and [[shorts]].

Leotards are a versatile garment that can either be dressed up or dressed down. The illustration of Taylor Dayne shows a stage costume that has been heavily embellished with sequins and sparkles; it is matched with striped tights and a cropped cardigan to create an extremely eye-catching costume.

Among exercise garments, leotards may be seen along with other types of garments, such as T-shirts, [[crop top]]s and tights.

==Gymnastics attire==

===Women===
[[File:Erika Fasana, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Erika Fasana]] wearing a leotard, 2010]]
For females, the standard gymnastic competition uniform is a leotard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniqueleotards.wordpress.com/|title=About Gymnastics and Leotards|website=About Gymnastics and Leotards|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, competition leotards have always had long sleeves; however, half-length sleeved and sleeveless garments are now permitted under the ''Code of Points'' and have been worn by teams at the [[World Gymnastics Championships]] and other major events. Practice leotards and those worn in podium training sessions are generally sleeveless. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Leotards may not ride too high on the hip or be cut too low; in rare instances, gymnasts and teams have been penalized with score deductions for their attire. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the 1970s leotards were typically made from [[polyester]] and related fabrics. Since the 1980s, however, they have been made from [[spandex|lycra or spandex]]. Since the 1990s, leotards have become more elaborate and have employed a variety of textiles, including velvet, velour, mesh, metallic fabrics, foils and iridescent "hologram" fabric. They can also be decorated with [[rhinestone]]s, and metallic jewels that are heat-set onto the garments and will not fall or wash off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Leotards cannot be cut above hip height or be cut past the shoulder blades, back or front. Any leotard that is somewhat see-through is also against the rules. Usage of white tights is not standard. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Men===
[[Image:Ivan ivankov - pommel horse - 2000.jpg|thumb|right|A male gymnastics uniform]]
For competitions, male gymnasts wear two layers of clothing. The first, a [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]] (or comp shirt, short for competition shirt) is a sleeveless leotard. For floor and vault, gymnasts wear a pair of very short shorts over the singlet. For their other events, they wear a pair of long pants, attached to the bottom of the feet with stirrups.

Men's uniforms are usually less ornate than those of their female counterparts and are usually matte-colored, while women's uniforms generally employ metallic or iridescent fabrics. Singlets usually employ one or more of the national team colors, but there are no restrictions on design. Shorts and pants are generally a solid color, usually white, blue, red or black.

===History===
Olympic gymnastics team leotards have dramatically changed from their first memorable designs. Over time, the emphasis on what leotards are intended to do has changed. Originally, the intent was to cover as much of a woman’s body as possible, while today, leotards must breathe, improve aerodynamics and seamlessly re-shape as female athletes bend, twist and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympicleotards.com|title=Olympic Leotards - The History of Leotards, and Leotards in the 2012 Olympics|website=www.olympicleotards.com|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's leotards==
When [[Jules Léotard]] created the ''maillot'', it was intended for men. This style of leotard can be seen in early 20th century photos of the [[circus]] '[[Strongman (strength athlete)|strong man]]'. Men's leotards evolved along with the women's style, eventually resembling it, except that the men's version had a slightly lower-cut leg opening and a lower-cut front.

Unlike their female counterparts, however, men's leotards come in two styles — either with a full seated bottom or as a [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]. The reason for this is apparent when worn with tights such as in ballet, where lines created by the garment underneath the tights would [[panty line|look unsightly]]. In such instances, a [[dance belt]] is also worn.

Leotards are commonly worn by male dancers (particularly for ballet) and gymnasts. Leotard-like garments (often of the "biketard" or [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]] type) are also often worn by men in sports such as rowing, wrestling, cycling and running, to maintain a tight fit and stop the upper part of the clothing running up.

'''Lionel Arthur Gilbert [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]]''' (8 December 1924 – 28 January 2015) was an Australian [[historian]], [[author]], [[curator]], [[lecturer]], and [[biography|biographer]], specializing in [[applied history|applied]], [[natural history|natural]], and [[local history]].  Born in [[Burwood, New South Wales]], he studied at [[Sydney Teachers College]] and, beginning in 1946, worked as a teacher and later a headmaster in state schools in various locations around New South Wales until 1961.  In 1963 Gilbert graduated from the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in History.  That same year, he was appointed a lecturer and curator at the [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] Teachers' College Museum of Education, in which capacity he served until his retirement in 1984, overseeing several expansions of the museum and establishment of a historical research centre.

During his time with the college, Gilbert published a number of articles, papers, and books, many of them focusing on local history of New South Wales, including the state's [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] area.  He attained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D) in [[History of botany|Botanical History]] from the University of New England in 1972.  After retirement, Gilbert authored several books on Australian natural history, including biographies of three Australian botanists and a history of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens]].  In recognition of his work in education and history, he was selected as a [[fellow]] by several historical organizations.  In 1995 he was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]], a [[Centenary Medal]] in 2001, and in 2007 with an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] by the University of New England.

==Early life and career with state schools==
Gilbert was born in [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], a suburb of Sydney, on 8 December 1924.  His primary and secondary education took place at Burwood Primary School, [[Homebush Boys High School]], and [[Fort Street High School]], receiving a [[leaving certificate]] from the latter.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;  After graduation, Gilbert took temporary employment at [[Gowings|Gowings Men's Store]] in Sydney.  In 1942, he received a Teacher's Scholarship to [[Sydney Teachers College]], where he trained for one year to be a school teacher.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Address"/&gt;

In 1943, Gilbert enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], joining 570 other Teachers College students who served in the armed forces during [[World War II]], 68 of whom were killed during the conflict.  Assigned as a [[radar]] operator in [[Arnhem Land]], Gilbert served until 1946.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Address"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAE"/&gt;

After his discharge from the military, Gilbert was employed as secondary school teacher at [[Nabiac, New South Wales|Nabiac]] Central School from 1946 until 1954.  In 1955, he was appointed Deputy Headmaster of [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]] Primary School, and served in that capacity until 1960.  That year, he accepted an appointment as headmaster of Rocky River Primary School near [[Uralla, New South Wales]], a position he held until 1961.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;

While at Nabiac, Gilbert met Margaret Roberts and the two married in 1949.  Their daughter Anne was born in 1960.&lt;ref name="TAE"/&gt;

==Academia and curator career==
In 1955, Gilbert enrolled as an external student at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] in the first class of the university's external studies program.  In 1961, he was appointed by the university as a Research and Information Officer in the Department of External Studies.  In this capacity, Gilbert taught weekend classes on the methodology of local history for the university's [[adult education]] department throughout the northwest area of New South Wales.  In 1963, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in History with [[Bachelor's degree#Australia|First Class Honors]], submitting his thesis on the history of botanical knowledge of the eastern seaboard of Australia for the years 1788-1815.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

In July 1963, Gilbert accepted an appointment as lecturer in applied history and curator with the [[Armidale Teachers' College]] (later [[College of Advanced Education]]) Museum of Education.  Holding the position for 21 years, he guided expansion of the facility to better present the history of education in Australia.  Between 1976 and 1980 he supervised the relocation to the museum of three historic school buildings from Armidale High School and [[Armidale Dumaresq Shire|Dumaresq]] Public School.  In addition, Gilbert designed courses in applied and local history for internal and external students of the college, which became the Armidale College of Advanced Education in 1971.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Address"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

In 1974, Gilbert successfully requested an Innovations Grant from the Schools Commission to establish a Historical Resources Centre at the college.  Opened in 1976 with Gilbert as its first director, the centre's goal was to provide education on the history of New England to primary, secondary, tertiary, and postgraduate students, and community groups.&lt;ref name="Elphick"/&gt;

Gilbert recalled in 2008 that between 1975 and 1978, 5,758 primary or secondary pupils toured the museum on field trips.  A further 1,653 adults visited during that time to conduct historical or genealogical research at the museum or the Historical Resources Centre.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Address"/&gt;  In 1981 the [[Museums Association]] of Australia recognised the museum with a certificate of merit for its, "authenticity and detail in building, display and education."&lt;ref name="Elphick"/&gt;

In 1972, Gilbert was named chair of the school's newly formed Department of History.&lt;ref name="Elphick"/&gt;  He attained the position of Acting Deputy Principal for the college before retiring in June 1984.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

In 1967, Gilbert assisted the [[National Trust of Australia]] and the [[Australian National University]]'s Department of Adult Education with a series of lectures and exhibits on local history of the New England area.  Held in Armidale, the series helped establish a local chapter of the National Trust and the subsequent preservation of several historical colonial buildings in the area.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

While at the college, Gilbert pursued post-graduate studies at New England and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D) in [[History of botany|Botanical History]] in 1972, with his thesis titled ''Botanical investigation of New South Wales, 1811-1880''.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD"/&gt;  Also in 1972, he was awarded a [[Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts|Churchill Fellowship]] to the U.K. for four weeks to study how museums in the U.K. contributed to general education.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

==Other work==
In 1962, Gilbert succeeded Eric Dunlop as Honorary Curator of the Armidale City Council's Folk Museum, serving in the position until 1982.  When the museum reached capacity in its original facility, he joined the Armidale town clerk in a successful petition to the Department of Education for New South Wales to relocate the museum into the nearby [[Hillgrove, New South Wales|Hillgrove]] School.  Opened in 1977, the new facility is known as the [[Museum of Rural Life and Industry]].&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;  Beginning in 1975, he served on the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales|New South Wales State Archives Authority]].&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archives"/&gt;

During his career at the college, Gilbert authored or co-authored a number of papers and books, particularly on Australian biographical, genealogical, and local history.  In 1974, Gilbert joined William Patrick Driscoll, Alan Sutherland, and David Rose in publishing ''History Around Us:  An Enquiry Approach to Local History'', a book on historical research targeted at younger readers.  The book was re-issued in 1984.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;  In 1978, Gilbert and co-author Elwyn Sydney Elphick wrote a book titled of ''Forty-three and Seven:  A Short Illustrated History of the First Fifty Years of Teacher Education in Armidale : Armidale Teachers' College, 1928-1971 and Armidale College of Advanced Education 1971-1978'' to commemorate the school's 50-year jubilee celebration.&lt;ref name="Elphick"/&gt;  In 1980, two books by Gilbert were published:  ''A Grave Look at History:  Glimpses of a Vanishing Form of Folk Art'' and ''New England from Old Photographs''.  The former studied graveyard monuments and was representative of Gilbert's lifelong interest in studying and documenting [[epitaph]]s.  The latter book focused on local history of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lives"/&gt;  From 1966, he contributed a series of articles to the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]''.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

==Post retirement work, professional associations, and honors==
Gilbert continued to write in retirement, often focusing on natural history.  In 1985, 1992, and 2001, he respectively authored books on botanists [[William Woolls]], [[Herman Rupp]], and [[Joseph Maiden]].&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;  In 1986, his book on the history of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens]] was published.  Two years after its publication, Gilbert was appointed an Honorary Research Associate of the gardens.  He was also a patron of the [[Australian National Museum of Education]] and a member of [[National Trust of Australia|Australia's National Trust]].&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

Gilbert was named a Fellow of the [[Society of Australian Genealogists]] in 1955, an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Australian Historical Society]] in 1997, and a Fellow of the [[Federation of Australian Historical Societies]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="RAHS"/&gt;  On 12 June 1995 he was recognised with the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] (OAM), "In recognition of service to the community as a researcher and curator of local history in the New England region."&lt;ref name="DP1"/&gt;  On 1 January 2001 he was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]], "For service to the community through education and local history."&lt;ref name="DP2"/&gt;  The University of New England presented Gilbert with an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] (Hon. D. Litt.) in 2008.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;  Also in 2008, he contributed a historical essay on the Auchinleck-Ross family of New England to the biographical compendium, ''New England Lives III''.  Gilbert served as president of the Armidale and District Historical Society and has been honored with [[Freedom of the City]] of Armidale.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lives"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Gilbert and his wife, Margaret, resided in Armidale, New South Wales from 1961.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;  He died in Armidale on 28 January 2015 and was survived by his wife, daughter Anne, son-in-law Tony Bennett, and grandson Alexei.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;

}}'''Louis O. Mink Jr.''' (September 3, 1921 – January 19, 1983) was a [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]] whose works challenged early philosopher of history [[R. G. Collingwood]] and were part of a [[postmodern]] dialogue on history and historical narrative with other philosophers of history, like [[Hayden White]] and [[Georg Lukács]]. Mink and White were responsible for what would later be called the "linguistic turn" in philosophy of history.&lt;ref name = Stanford&gt;{{cite web| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/| title= Philosophy of History|  work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| date = Apr 19, 2011| accessdate = February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mink received his bachelor's degree from [[Hiram College]], then served in the United States Army during World War II.&lt;ref name = Toledo&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper = Toledo Blade| date = January 21, 1983| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_k5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=louis-mink&amp;pg=3595%2C5867830 | accessdate = February 12, 2012| title = Louis Mink| author = AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he received a masters and doctorate from [[Yale]]. He became a member of the faculty at [[Wesleyan University]] in 1952 and remained in the department until he died of a heart attack on  January 19, 1983. While at Wesleyan he was chair of the philosophy department from 1967 to 1976, the Kenan Professor of Humanities and director of the Center for Humanities. He had a wife named Helen Patterson, two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/obituaries/dr-louis-o-mink-jr-61-dies-taught-philosophy-at-wesleyan.html | date = January 21, 1983| accessdate = February 12, 2012| title = Dr. Louis O.

Mink's largest contribution to history and philosophy of history was to emphasize the need for history to think of its published narratives as very similar to other narrative forms, such as fiction.&lt;ref name = Philips&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Louis%20Mink%22&amp;pg=PR14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louis%20Mink%22&amp;f=false | page = xiv| title =Society and sentiment: genres of historical writing in Britain, 1740-1820 | first = Mark| last = Phillips|  publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 2000| isbn = 1400823625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mink's also asserts that thinking about history as "a true representation of the past" gives rise to a great deal of assumptions amongst historians that pose serious problems for history by misrepresenting it and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Louis O. “Narrative Form as a Cognitive Instrument.” Historical Understanding. Ed. Brian Fay, Eugene O. Golob and Richard T. Vann (Cornell, 1987). 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Mink was also important in studying [[James Joyce]]'s fiction; most notably, his "A Finnegans Wake Gazetteer" (1978) documents all the place names in Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref name = Toledo/&gt;  

The interest in Joyce was not tangential.   Finnegans Wake had embedded in it a cyclical structure of time and history, influenced by Giambattista Vico's (1668–1744) ''[["La Scienza Nuova" (The New Science)]]''. Mink also ran seminars on Finnegans Wake that drew both faculty and students in interactive examinations of Joyce's work and was known for both the range of his knowledge and his wit, which could be self-deprecating. When a student informed that he was dropping out of the seminar because he was not ready for ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', Mink replied, "Brian, if you are ever ready for Finnegans Wake," pausing to draw on his pipe, "it is a pretty good indication that you have wasted your life."&lt;ref&gt;Personal Recollection, Brian Ford, Wesleayan Class of 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People''' ({{lang-crh|Къырымтатар Миллий Меджлиси}}, ''Qırımtatar Milliy Meclisi''; {{lang-uk|Меджлiс Кримськотатарського Народу}}, ''Medzhlis Krims'kotatars'koho Narodu''; {{lang-ru|Меджлис
крымскотатарского народа}}, ''Medzhlis Krimskotatarskogo Naroda'') is the single highest executive-representative body of the [[Crimean Tatars]] in period between sessions of the [[Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People]].

The Mejlis is a member institution of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

The Mejlis was outlawed by [[Russia]] in 2016 (for "the use of propaganda of aggression and hatred towards Russia, inciting [[ethnic nationalism]] and extremism in society"&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"/&gt;) and listed as an extremist organization{{#tag:ref|see [[List of extremist organisations (Russia)]]|group=nb}} after Russia had gained full control of [[Crimea]] after the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]].&lt;ref name="rfemb29916"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Since the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], the status of the Crimea and of the city of Sevastopol is [[Political status of Crimea|under dispute between Russia and Ukraine]]; Ukraine and the majority of the international community considers the Crimea and Sevastopol an integral part of Ukraine, while Russia, on the other hand, considers the Crimea and Sevastopol an integral part of Russia, with Sevastopol functioning as a [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] (Russian authorities are in control of both).&lt;ref name=UsntRa&gt;[http://europe.newsweek.com/ukraine-reports-russian-military-activity-crimea-border-armored-column-488283 UKRAINE REPORTS RUSSIAN MILITARY ACTIVITY ON CRIMEA BORDER], [[Newsweek]] (8 August 2016)&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutterman |first=Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140318 |title=Putin signs Crimea treaty, will not seize other Ukraine regions |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;br&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26248275 Ukraine crisis timeline], [[BBC News]]&lt;br&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/2014/03/28/ARTI1395947928472439.shtml UN General Assembly adopts resolution affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity], [[China Central Television]] (28 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

==History==
The current Mejlis was founded in 1991, to act as a representative body for the Crimean Tatars which could address grievances to the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian central]] government, the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean government]], and international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0220/p09s02-coop.html |title=A lesson in stifling violent extremism |accessdate=March 26, 2007 |last=Ziad |first=Waleed |author2=Laryssa Chomiak |date=February 20, 2007 |work=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2014}} In its activities Mejlis is subordinated to Qurultai, guided by its decisions, current regulations, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people statute, norms of international law and legislative acts of Ukraine not contradicting with these standards. The main goal of the Mejlis is the liquidation of consequences of genocide conducted by the Soviet state in regard to the Crimean Tatars ([[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Surgun of 1944]]), reinstatement of national and political rights of the Crimean Tatar people and realization of their rights on the free national state self-determination on its national territory. Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people consists of 33 members including the Mejlis chair person. [[Simferopol]] is the location of Mejlis.

On June 30, 1991, the Mejlis declared its sovereignty over the Crimean Tatars, and adopted the Crimean Tatar's national anthem and [[Flag of Crimea#Ethnic flags of Crimean Tatars|national flag]].&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/krfacts.html |title=Crimean Tatar Fact Sheet: Chronology |accessdate=March 26, 2007 |last=Altan |first=Mubeyyin Batu |date= December 1994 |work=Euronet Internet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204135457/http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/krfacts.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Crimean Tatars elected 14 Crimean Tatar Deputies to the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea]]. These 14 deputies were the first Crimean Tatar representatives in the Crimean Parliament in over 50 years.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt;

During the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary elections]] members of the Mejlis joined the [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] election list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/oshevel.html |title=Crimean Tatars and the Ukrainian state: the challenge of politics, the use of law, and the meaning of rhetoric |publisher=Iccrimea.org |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2002, 2006, and 2007 parliamentary elections, members of the Mejlis joined the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] election list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ukraine |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2004/ukraine |title=Ukraine |publisher=Freedom House |date=2003-12-10 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2014}}

On April 6, 2010, several pro-Russian Crimean political leaders in Crimea demanded the disbanding and banning of the Mejlis and all other forms of political representation for the Crimean Tatars (including the Kurultai), claiming that they were "organized criminal groups and said their activities are unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ProRussia_Groups_Want_Crimean_Tatar_Bodies_Disbanded/2004234.html |title=Pro-Russia Groups Want Crimean Tatar Bodies Disbanded |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crimean Tatar organizations  urged [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to "protect Crimea's indigenous people from discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Crimean_Tatar_Groups_In_Germany_Appeal_To_Ukrainian_President/2041406.html |title=Crimean Tatar Groups In Germany Appeal To Ukrainian President |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary elections]], members of the Mejlis joined the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] election list.&lt;ref name=Mejlis&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/232476/ Mustafa Dzhemiliov is number 12 on the list of the United Opposition 'Fatherland'], ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'' (2 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, Mejlis is member of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

On 20 March 2014, two days after the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea|annexation of Crimea by Russia]], the [[Ukrainian parliament]] officially and explicitly recognized the Mejlis as the executive body of the [[Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People]], while the Qurultay was recognized as the higher representative body of the [[Crimean Tatar people]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Law of Ukraine]].

In May 2014, Crimean Tatar leader [[Mustafa Dzhemilev]] was prevented from entering Crimea, resulting in Crimean Tatars organizing large protests and a failed attempt to help Dzhemilev enter Crimea after Crimean Tatars broke through a border checkpoint. In response, Crimean authorities accused the Mejlis of extremist activity regarding "illegal" gatherings marked by "violence and threats of violence", warning that the Mejlis could be dissolved and outlawed across Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doloov|first=Anna|title=Authorities Threaten to 'Liquidate' Crimean Tatar Council|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/authorities-threaten-to-liquidate-crimean-tatar-council/499397.html|work=The Moscow Times|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Crimean Tatar Leader Expects Tensions To Rise|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-crimea-tatars-dzhemilev/25374059.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimean Tatar activists face "extremism" warning|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/crimean-tatar-activists/1095962.html|publisher=Agence-France Presse|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2014 it was announced that for the first time Mejlis would hold its session outside of Crimea in [[Henichesk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/07/3/7030826/ For the first time on Friday Mejlis will meet not in Crimea]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 3 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian law enforcement seized the Mejlis building in [[Simferopol]] on 20 September 2014.&lt;ref name="RpsMbS14"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/a/aksyonov-crimea-rights-mejlis-tatars-russia-ukraine/26599565.html Crimean Leader Says Mejlis Does Not Exist], [[Radio Free Europe]] (22 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mejlis was labeled an extremist organisation by [[Russia]]n authorities in Crimea and banned by the Russian-appointed supreme court there on 26 April 2016.&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2016/04/26/crimean-court-bans-tatar-ruling-body-in-blow-to-minority/ Crimean court bans Tatar ruling body in blow to minority], [[Thestar.com.my]] (26 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Regional Prosecutor General [[Natalia Poklonskaya]], it was banned because its leaders had sought to destabilise Crimea since the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia]] through the use of "propaganda of aggression and hatred towards Russia, inciting [[ethnic nationalism]] and extremism in society".&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"/&gt; The Mejlis was also said to be responsible for stopping all cargo traffic between (mainland) Ukraine and Crimea in the autumn of 2015 and a late November series of explosions that damaged voltage power lines leading to a massive Crimean [[power outage]].&lt;ref name=MiiCb&gt;[http://tass.ru/en/opinions/857074 Crimean Tatars’ Mejlis may be outlawed for extremism], [[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]] (16 February 2016)&lt;br&gt;[http://en.sobytiya.info/the-majlis-denies-its-implication-in-the-blockade-of-crimea.html The Mejlis denies its implication in the blockade of Crimea], [[News from Crimea]] (17 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mejlis denied involvement in these events.&lt;ref name=MiiCb/&gt; (Also on 26 April 2016) [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Nils Muižnieks]] urged the court to reverse the ban since he believed "Equating (the Mejlis) with extremism paves the way for stigmatisation and discrimination of a significant part of the Crimean Tatar community and sends a negative message to that community as a whole".&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"/&gt; Exiled in mainland Ukraine, Chairman of the Mejlis [[Refat Chubarov]] stated the court's decision was unjustifiable and that "The occupiers in Crimea are doing everything to crush Crimean Tatars and force everyone to be silent".&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] stated the ban "demolishes one of the few remaining rights of a minority that Russia must protect instead of persecute".&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416G"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/court-bans-extremist-crimean-tatar-governing-body-mejlis-russia Crimean court bans 'extremist' Tatar governing body], [[The Guardian]] (26 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis [[Nariman Dzhelal]] vowed that the organization would try to continue its work despite the ban, saying "it will continue working in Ukraine and other countries".&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416G"/&gt;

Deputy head of the Mejlis [[Ilmi Umerov]] was on 7 September 2016 released after a three weeks' involuntary detention for tests of his "mental capacity" in a psychiatric hospital in Simferopol (doctors ruled him entirely sane) after stating on TV that Crimea should be returned to Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Umerov21016"/&gt; Umerov was then charged with calling for Russia's borders to be changed, a charge punishable up to five years in jail.&lt;ref name="Umerov21016"&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-demands-loyalty-silence-crimeas-hounded-tatars-055526918.html Russia demands loyalty or silence, say Crimea's hounded Tatars], [[Yahoo! News]] (2 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Russia]] upheld the ban on 29 September 2016.&lt;ref name="rfemb29916"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-court-upholds-ban-crimean-tatar-mejlis/28022600.html Russia's Supreme Court Upholds Ban On Crimean Tatars' Mejlis], [[Radio Free Europe]] (29 September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mejlis is contesting this ban in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/373691.html Leader of Crimean Tatar Mejlis who lives in Ukraine confirms plans to go to ECHR], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (30 September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2016 (Russian-Crimean government) [[Head of the Republic of Crimea]] [[Sergei Aksyonov]] explained that Natalia Poklonskaya accused Mejlis in energy blockade through diversion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161001193336/https://ria.ru/politics/20161001/1478301178.html Aksyonov does not intend to get distracted by the US Department of States' quirks in relation to the Mejlis' matters (Аксенов не намерен отвлекаться на "выкрутасы" Госдепа в деле по меджлису)]. [[RIA Novosti]]. 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same day Aksyonov's Vice-Prime Minister Dmitry Polonsky claimed that Mejlis is a puppet organization of the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161001191442/https://ria.ru/society/20161001/1478288953.html Crimean authorities explained why the United States do not recognize ban on Mejlis in Russia (Власти Крыма объяснили, почему США не признают запрет меджлиса в России)].

'''Michael Borgolte''' (born 1948) is a German Historian. Besides the history of medieval [[Financial endowment|endowments]] he studies mainly the [[Comparative history]] of Europe and the [[World history|Global history]] of the Middle Ages.

== Career ==
Borgolte was educated at the [[University of Münster]], where he gained his doctorate in 1975. In 1981 he qualified as a professor at the [[University of Freiburg]], where he was assistant to the [[Palaeography|palaeographer]] Johanne Authenrieth from 1975 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/de/bereiche-und-lehrstuehle/migei/personen/borgolte|title=Prof. Dr. phil. Michael  Borgolte — Mittelalterliche Geschichte I|first=Marlon|last=Maschkiwitz|website=www.geschichte.hu-berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991 he was one of the first professors newly appointed to [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-University]] after the [[Berlin Wall]] came down. He held the chair for Medieval History until 2018. Since 2007 Borgolte is a member of the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] and as such delegated to the scientific board of the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgh.de/mgh/zentraldirektion/?sword_list[0]=borgolte|title=Members of the MGH Zentraldirektion|website=www.mgh.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Bernd Schneidmüller]] he was coordinator of the research program [http://www.spp1173.uni-hd.de/ SPP 1173] "Integration und Desintegration der Kulturen im europäischen Mittelalter", funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]]. In 2011 he was awarded with an [[European Research Council|ERC]] Advanced Grant for his research program "Foundations in Medieval Societies — Crosscultural Comparisons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/pr/nachrichten/archiv/nr1111/pm_111121_00|title=ERC Advanced Grant 2011 für Prof. Dr. Michael Borgolte — Presseportal|first=Hans-Christoph|last=Keller|website=www.hu-berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborating with the [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinist]] [[Zachary Chitwood]], the [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Annette Schmiedchen]], the medieval historian [[Tillmann Lohse]] and others he prepared a three volume encyclopedia on this topic which promptly stimulated scholarly discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-25586|title=Rezension zu: Enzyklopädie des Stiftungswesens|first=Hugener,|last=Rainer|website=H-Soz-Kult.

The '''Monk of Malmesbury''' is the supposed author of a chronicle among the [[Cotton library|Cottonian manuscripts]] in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Vesp. D. IV. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorship is uncertain, and the work in question is said by some to be only a copy of a chronicle written by [[Alfred of Beverley]] in the twelfth century, while others claim it is almost entirely based on that of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. It is a valueless compilation, describing English history from the invasion of the [[Saxons]] to the year 1129.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Monk of Malmesbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the manuscript bears the name ''Godridus de Malmesburg'', it was originally believed that it was written by [[Godfrey of Malmesburg]], a native of [[Jumièges]], who became Abbot of [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]] in 1081.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Monk of Malmesbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey was regarded as a man of literary tastes because he founded the abbey's library, but his authorship of the manuscript was disproved, apart from its identity with Alfred of Beverley, by the fact that his death took place in or before 1107, when [[Edulf]] became the abbot. Indeed, it is likely that the signature merely indicates ownership.

The '''Movietone sound system''' is an [[optical sound|optical]] [[sound-on-film]] method of recording sound for motion pictures that guarantees synchronization between sound and picture. It achieves this by recording the sound as a variable-density optical track on the same strip of film that records the pictures. The initial version was capable of a frequency response of 8500 Hz&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/motionpicture1.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Although sound films today use variable-area tracks, any modern motion picture theater (excluding those that have transitioned to [[digital cinema]]) can play a Movietone film without modification to the projector (though if the projector's sound unit has been fitted with red LED or laser light sources, the reproduction quality from a variable density track will be significantly impaired). Movietone was one of four motion picture sound systems under development in the U.S. during the 1920s, the others being DeForest [[Phonofilm]], [[Warner Brothers]]' [[Vitaphone]], and [[RCA Photophone]], though Phonofilm was primarily an early version of Movietone.

[[File:Optical-film-soundtrack.svg|right|thumb|Left: Movietone track with variable density. Right: Variable area track.]]

==History==
As a student, [[Theodore Case]] became interested in the use of modulated light to carry speech, and in 1916 set up a laboratory to study the photo-electric properties of materials.  He developed the ''Thalofide cell'', a sensitive photocell, which was used as part of an infra-red communication system by the U.S. Navy during, and for some years after WW1.

In 1922 Case and his assistant Earl I. Sponable turned their attention to "talking pictures". In that same year Case was approached by [[Lee de Forest]] who had been attempting since 1919 to create an optical soundtrack for motion picture film in a system he called ''[[Phonofilm]]''. De Forest was having little success and turned to Case for help, so from 1922 until 1925 Case and de Forest collaborated in the development of the Phonofilm system. Amongst other Case inventions Case contributed the Thalofide photocell and also the ''Aeo-light'', a light source that could be readily modulated by audio signals and was used to expose the soundtrack in sound cameras.

In 1925, however, Case ended his relationship with de Forest due in the main to de Forest's tendency to claim the entire credit for the Phonofilm system for himself despite the fact that most of the critical inventions had come from Case. Documents supporting this, including a signed letter by De Forest that states that Phonofilms are only possible because of the inventions of Case Research Lab, are located at the Case Research Lab Museum in [[Auburn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cayugamuseum.org/ Case Lab Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, therefore, Case and Sponable continued the development of their own system, now called "Movietone".

From 1924 onwards Sponable had turned his attention to the design of single-system cameras, in which the sound and picture are recorded on the same negative. He asked [[Bell &amp; Howell]] to modify one of their cameras to his design, but the results were unsatisfactory. Consequently, the Wall machine shop in [[Syracuse, New York]] was asked to rebuild this camera and the results were much improved.

Subsequently, many single-system 35mm cameras were produced by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film [[Cinerama]] cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell &amp; Howell [[Design 2709]] cameras to single-system, but most were Wall designed and produced. Single-system cameras were also produced by [[Mitchell Camera]] Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these cameras were quite rare.

Partly as a result of the single system experiments, the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of approximately 1.19:1 that is created by printing an optical soundtrack on top of the 35mm full aperture became known colloquially as the "Movietone ratio".  It was used extensively by Hollywood and European studios (apart from those that adopted sound-on-disc) between the late 1920s and May 1932, when the [[Academy Ratio]] of 1.37:1 was introduced to restore the effective shape of the silent frame.

The 1950s brought the first 35mm kinescope camera with sound-on-film rather than separate, from Photo-Sonics, with a Davis Loop Drive mechanism built within the camera box. This camera was essential for TV network time-shifting in the years before Videotape. The sound galvanometer was made by RCA and was designed for good to excellent results when the kinescope negative was projected, thereby avoiding making a print before the delayed replay. The Davis mechanism was a Western Electric development.

After the split with de Forest, Case adopted a revised position for the projector soundhead, which was now placed below the picture head, with a sound-picture offset of 14 ½ inches (368&amp;nbsp;mm) (which is close to the present day standard), rather than being placed above the picture head as had been the phonofilm practice. Case also adopted the 24 frames/sec speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for the Western Electric [[Vitaphone]] sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames/sec as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film. With a few exceptions, this has remained the standard speed for professional sound films ever since.&lt;ref name=HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms&gt;Earl I. Sponable, "Historical Development of Sound Films", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (April 1947), Vol. 48, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryofSoundFilms&gt;Edward Kellogg, "History of Sound Motion in Pictures", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (June 1955), Vol. 64, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the Movietone system was adopted by the [[AMPAS]] as the Academy's standard. It and the later RCA Photophone system were interchangeable in most respects. See [[RCA Photophone]] for technical details and lists of the industry adopters.

==Commercial use by William Fox==
Movietone entered commercial use when [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] of the [[Fox Film Corporation]] bought the entire system including the patents in July 1926. Although Fox owned the Case patents, the work of [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], and the American rights to the German [[Tri-Ergon]] patents, the Movietone sound film system uses only the inventions of Case Research Lab.

[[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] hired [[Earl I. Sponable]] (1895–1977) from Case Research Lab in 1926, when he purchased the sound-on-film patents from Case. The first feature film released using the Fox Movietone system was ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' (1927) directed by [[F. W. Murnau]]. It was the first professionally produced feature film with an optical sound track. The sound in the film included only music, sound effects, and very few unsynchronized words. The system was used for sound acting sequences in [[Mother Knows Best (1928 film)|Mother Knows Best]] (1928).

Less than two years after purchasing the system from Case, Fox bought out all of Case's interests in the Fox-Case company. All of Fox's sound feature films were made using the Movietone system until 1931 when it was superseded by a [[Western Electric]] recording system using the light-valve invented by Edward C. Wente in 1923. However, Fox [[Movietone News]] used the system until 1939, because of the ease of transporting the single-system's sound film equipment.

The Case Research Lab sound system influenced many industry standards, such as location of the [[optical sound]] 20 frames in advance of the image it accompanies.&lt;ref name="HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HistoryofSoundFilms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie J. Wheeler, ''Principles of Cinematography'' (4th edition), Fountain Press (1969), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  The current ''[[SMPTE]]'' standard for [[35mm film|35 mm sound film]] is +21 frames for optical, but a 46-foot theatre reduces this to +20 frames;&lt;ref&gt;Kodak Film Notes Issue # H-50-03: Projection practices and techniques&amp;nbsp;— see ''Manuals'' at http://www.film-tech.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' (Second Edition), Bloomsbury (1997)&amp;nbsp;— see Projector article.&lt;/ref&gt; this was originally done partly to ensure the film runs smoothly past the sound head, but also to ensure that no Phonofilm could again be played in theaters&amp;nbsp;— the Phonofilm system being incompatible with Case Research Lab specifications&amp;nbsp;— and also to ease the modification of projectors already widely in use.

Sponable worked at the [[Fox Film Corporation]] (later [[20th Century Fox]]) Movietone studios on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] and 10th Avenue in New York City until he retired in the 1960s, eventually winning an [[Academy Award]] for his technical work on the development of [[CinemaScope]]. Sponable had many contributions to film technology during his career, including the invention of the perforated motion-picture screen that allowed placing the speakers behind it to enhance the illusion of the sound emanating directly from the film action. During his years at Fox, Sponable also served for a time as an officer of the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]]. He published a concise history of sound film in the April 1947 issue of ''The SMPE Journal'' (''The SMPTE Journal'' after 1950).&lt;ref name="HistoricalDevelopmentofSoudFilms" /&gt;

The history of Case Research Lab has long been unheralded for numerous reasons. Theodore Case died in 1944, after donating his home and laboratory to be preserved as a museum to the inventions of Case Research Lab. The museum's first director, who oversaw the museum for 50 years, put the laboratory's contents into storage and converted the building into an art studio. The Case Research Lab sound studio was located on the second floor of the estate's carriage house and that was rented to the local model train club until the early 1990s.

Fox was seriously injured in a July 1929 car accident, lost his company in 1930 when his loans were called in and lost the 1936 lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court against the film industry for violating the Tri-Ergon patents he owned. Sponable did little to establish the record of Case Research Lab inventions, other than his April 1947 article in ''The Journal of the SMPE''.

Incredibly, it was also in 1947 that the Davis Loop Drive was first introduced to Western Electric licensees, including Twentieth Century-Fox (WECo RA-1231; and still made to this day by a successor company). {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Recently, Case Research Lab, the adjoining carriage house, and Case's home have been restored and research is ongoing with the collections of the lab that include all receipts, notebooks, correspondence, and much of the laboratory's original equipment, including the first recording device created to test the AEO light. In the collections are also letters from [[Thomas Edison]], an original copy of the Tri-Ergon patents, and an internal document from Fox Films written in the 1930s. This latter document says that once it became public knowledge that Sponable perfected the variable-area system of sound-on-film at the Fox Studios, that system became the standard and replaced the inventions of Case Research Lab.

A number of films owned by Case Research Lab and Museum and restored by [[George Eastman House]] in [[Rochester, New York]], are in the collections of both of those institutions. The Case Research Lab and Museum has additional sound-film footage of Theodore Case, and recently discovered copies of the same films at the Eastman House, are in a much higher state of preservation. Movietone News films are in the collections of 20th-Century Fox and the [[University of South Carolina]] at Columbia, including the only known footage of Earl I. Sponable talking. Sponable can also be seen in footage of the premiere of the film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''.

Phonofilms that were produced using Case Research Lab inventions are in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Film Institute]].

Variable density (VD) recording systems developed from Movietone gradually lost market share to variable area (VA) ones developed from Photophone from the 1940s onwards, a process that gathered pace as VA-related [[patent]]s expired.  Though both methods are theoretically capable of achieving similar standards of recording, duplication and reproduction, quality control in the [[Film laboratory|lab]] proved to be far more critical in the duplication of VD tracks than VA ones: slight errors in printer light settings and sensitometry and densitometry control will affect the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] far more on a VD track than on a VA one.  For this reason [[Film preservation|archives]] have tended to remaster original VD tracks to VA negatives for preservation and the creation of new [[Release print|prints]].

The '''National Museum of Ethnology''' is a [[museum]] about [[ethnology]] in the [[Netherlands]] is located in the university city of [[Leiden]].

==First ethnographic museum in Europe==
The institution which was at first called the "Museum Japonicum".  It was the first museum in Europe which was designed to demonstrate that collecting the artefacts of man could mean more than the mere accumulation of curiosities.  From the very outset, this innovative institution incorporated at least four basic principles: collecting, scientific research, presentation to the public, and educational guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer, W. (1989). ''Leiden Oriental Connections, 1850-1940,'' p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 the ''Koninklijk Kabinet van Zeldzaamheden'' was formed in the Hague as an attempt to start a museum of scientific artifacts from around the world, based on royal collections and a large group of Chinese artifacts from private collections. Thanks to the early efforts of this organization, in the early 1830s, when [[Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold]] abandoned the political turmoil of revolutionary Belgium for the relative calm of the [[University of Leiden]], he was inspired by the first museum director R.P. van de Kasteele to collect Japanese objects for his collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/boeken/rijksmuseum-voor-volkenkunde-.html Koninklijk Kabinet van Zeldzaamheden] on Leiden University webpage&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting gift of about 5,000 objects became the heart the new museum's holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Otterspeer, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siebold's home in Leiden—and the objects he brought to Europe after eight years in Japan—was opened to the public in the early 1830s (today his collection is preserved in the [[SieboldHuis]]).  The Dutch crown had previously purchased the smaller collections of [[Jan Cock Blomhoff]] in 1826 and [[Johannes Gerhard Frederik van Overmeer Fischer]] in 1832. These which were merged with what Siebold bestowed on [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]]; and they became crucial elements in the creation of what became the ''Museum voor Volkenkunde'', or Ethnographic Museum in Leiden in 1837.  This institution would later evolve into the National Museum of Ethnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmv.nl/index.aspx?lang=en RVM website: ''Home...&gt;Collectie...&gt;Collection History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104130226/http://www.rmv.nl/index.aspx?lang=en |date=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Siebold also encouraged other Europeans to create ethnographic institutions similar to what was developing in Leiden.  He urged "the importance of their creation in European states possessing colonies because these institutions could become a means for understanding the subject peoples and of awakening the interest of the public and of merchants -- all of which are necessary conditions for a lucrative trade which benefits all."&lt;ref&gt;Carbonell, Bettina. (2004). ''Museum Studies: An Anthology of Contexts,'' p. 134, citing Siebold, Philipp. (1843).  ''Lettre sur l'utilité des Musées Ethnographiques et sur l'importance de leur création dans états européens qui posèdents des Colonies,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum holdings==
[[File:Leiden Plate (Frontal Design Linework).svg|thumb|Design on the front of the Leiden Plate, a famous [[Maya belt plaques|Maya belt plaque]] made of [[jadeite]] from [[Guatemala]] held by the museum.]]
The collection today contains a large number of objects from Africa, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Latin America, North America, Oceania, and Asia.  In developing the collection, the museum has devoted significant attention to acquiring material which illustrates the historical development of world cultures; but the genesis of the museum's holdings began with material garnered during the years [[Japan]] was officially closed except for one small island in Nagasaki harbor -- [[Dejima]].

===Blomhoff collection===
As ''[[VOC Opperhoofden in Japan|Opperhoofd]]'' (or chief trader) for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or ''VOC'') at Dejima island in Nagasaki harbor from 1817 through 1823, Jan Cock Blomhoff was unique.  Despite the Japanese "closed door" policy for Westerners (''[[sakoku]]''), he did transport his wife, Titia, and children to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Bersma Rene. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=51KeAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Titia:+The+First+Western+Woman+in+Japan  ''Titia, the First Western Woman in Japan.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese predictably responded by ejecting both Blomhoff and his family; but that experience did broaden the range of household goods and other objects he accumulated across the span of his stay in Japan.

===Fischer collection===
Johannes Gerhard Frederik van Overmeer Fischer began as a clerk at Dejima and he was later promoted to "Package House Master" (''pakhuismeester'').  During the span of his stay in Japan, Fisher's access to Japanese culture was limited; but within his universe of contacts, he was able to amass a considerable collection of "ordinary" objects which were plausbily overlooked by others. This material was brought back to the Netherlands in 1829.  In 1833, he published ''Bijdrage tot de kennis van het Japansche rijk'' (''Contribution to the knowledge of the Japanese State'').&lt;ref&gt;Frederiks, Johannes. (1888).  ''Biographisch woordenboek der Noord-en Zuidnederlandsche letterkunde'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siebold collection===
As a physician practicing Western medicine in Nagasaki (1823-1829), [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] received payment in kind with a variety of objects and artifacts which would later gain unanticipated scholarly attention in Europe. These everyday objects later became the basis of his large [[ethnography|ethnographic]] collection, which consisted of everyday household goods, woodblock prints, tools and hand-crafted objects used by the Japanese people in the late [[Edo period]]. Further information relating to this material was published in Siebold's ''Nippon''.  His professional interest was especially drawn to implements used in the practice of traditional Japanese medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Alpen, Jan. (1995) ''Oriental Medicine: An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, a separate museum located in one of Siebold's former houses, the [[SieboldHuis]], houses part of the collection.

==Leiden plate==
The [[Leiden plate]] is a [[Maya belt plaques|Maya belt plaque]] and important historical artifact from [[Guatemala]]. It is depicted on the reverse of a one [[Guatemalan quetzal]] banknote.

[[File:pensee-ivr7.jpg|thumb|right|'''Pensée: Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered Vol.VII''' (Spring 1974) depicting a parody Immanuel Velikovsky by artist Robert Byrd that appeared in ''[[Philadelphia Magazine]]'', April, 1968]]

'''''Pensée'': Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered''' ("IVR") was a special series of ten issues of the magazine ''Pensée'' advancing the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]. It was produced to "encourage continuing critical analysis of all questions raised by Velikovsky's work",&lt;ref&gt;"A Look At the Evidence: Editor's Page", ''Pensée'' Vol. 2 No 2: (May 1972) "Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered I"&lt;/ref&gt; published between May 1972 and Winter 1974-75 by the Student Academic Freedom Forum, whose president was David N. Talbott, with the assistance and cooperation of Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon. Velikovsky -- "the man whose work was being examined 'objectively'" insinuated himself into the editing of the May 1972 issue,&lt;ref&gt;20 March 1978 letter from Tom Ferté to Jan Sammer, Velikovsky's then-assistant.&lt;/ref&gt; just as he had done earlier for the April 1967 "Velikovsky" issue of Yale Scientific Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Crowley, "Some Background on YSM's VELIKOVSKY Issue", 10 July 1984, sent to Henry H. Bauer.&lt;/ref&gt;

It achieved a circulation of between 10,000 - 20,000, with the first issue reprinted twice totalling 75,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;Henry H. Bauer, ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', Publ. 1999 University of Illinois Press, 354 pages
{{ISBN|0-252-06845-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a book, ''Velikovsky Reconsidered''&lt;ref&gt;''Velikovsky Reconsidered'' by the Editors of Pensée, 184 pages, Publ. Doubleday &amp; Co (1976), {{ISBN|0-283-98314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing selected articles, many of them partisan.&lt;ref&gt;"Velikovsky Reconsidered (book review)", ''New Scientist'', 22 Jul 1976, 52 pages, Vol. 71, No. 1010, ISSN 0262-4079 ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IKaAHRH5C4QC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22velikovsky%20reconsidered%22&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=%22velikovsky%20reconsidered%22&amp;f=false page 187])&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the final issue of ''Pensée IVR'', the publisher recalled that the original magazine was:

{{quote|Founded in 1966 and soon thereafter allowed to lapse for several years, it was revived in 1970 as an unofficial student magazine distributed on [[University of Oregon campus|Oregon campuses]] [..] Late in 1971 the editor and publisher, personally familiar with the work of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], conceived the idea of finding someone qualified to write a major article describing Velikovsky's theories, their implications, and their reception. Subsequent contact, first, with Velikovsky himself, and then with several persons knowledgeable about his work, led to the May, 1972 issue of ''Pensée''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'' Vol. 4 No 5: (Winter 1974-75) Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered X. "Why Pensee?"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Science'' magazine attributed the then increased support for Velikovsky's ideas, to ''Pensée''.&lt;ref name="gordin" /&gt;

==Staff==

The staff consisted of publisher David N. Talbott and his brother Stephen L. Talbott as editor, and built up to five associate editors: Lewis M. Greenberg, Ralph Juergens, William Mullen, C.J. Ransom, and Lynn E. Rose.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'' IVR X, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Social Theory, [[Alfred de Grazia]] noted that:

{{quote|... there came ''Pensée'', a production of the young Talbott brothers, Stephen and David, whose enthusiasm for his [Velikovsky's] work crystallized into a conversion of their small magazine on human rights into a forum on the ''Velikovsky Affair'', at least for ten issues. Stephen Talbott was a brilliant editor and organizer, bent upon opening the world to quantavolutionary ideas, but also to criticism of them. After spectacular successes, ''Pensée'' collapsed under a load of debt and overwork. As it was ending, it promised to broaden its interests beyond Velikovsky and to discuss ideas irreconcilable with his. Velikovsky would have no part of this, and several of his Eastern supporters -- with Lewis Greenberg and Warner Sizemore leading -- issued the first number of ''[[Kronos (journal)|Kronos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred de Grazia, ''Cosmic Heretics'' (1984), Metron Publ., Chapter 4. {{ISBN|0-940268-08-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Conferences==
The "Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered" period also included sponsoring two three-day symposia which were attended by Velikovsky. The first ever "Velikovsky Symposium" held 16–18 August 1972, at Lewis and Clark College (who was also co-sponsor) convened 50 invited scholars, many from the ranks of Velikovsky's supporters, with 200 attendees.&lt;ref name="gordin"&gt;Michael D. Gordin, ''The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe'', Publ. University of Chicago Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0226304426}}, 9780226304427, 291 pages ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=%22velikovsky%20reconsidered%22&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=pensee&amp;f=false pp. 185])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talbott, S. (Fall 1972). Compendium. ''Pensee II'', '''2''' (3), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1974, "Velikovsky and the Recent History of the Solar System" at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, convened 38 invited scholars with a generally higher and non-aligned profile than in 1972, including such mainstream scientists as David Morrison (Univ. of Hawaii), James Warwick (Univ. of Colorado), and Derek York (Univ. of Toronto), and registered over 350 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (Summer 1974). Report on the Symposium. ''Pensee VIII'', '''4''' (3), 37-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A number of magazine and journals refused to accept advertisements for ''Pensée'', including ''[[American Scientist]]'', ''[[Sky and Telescope]]'', and, ''[[Scientific American]] whose publishers wrote:

{{quote|We have not encountered a single scientist working in any of the many fields, from archaeology to astrophysics, on which Velikovsky touches who finds any interest whatever in anything he has to say. That is why you have not seen any account of Velikovsky in our pages. . . . The controversy seems to be generated wholly by Velikovsky and his sympathizers. They cry "foul" because he is ignored and attempt to make an academic freedom case of it. The controversy is thus quite secondary. As I see it, the threat to academic freedom comes the other way around: by such tactics the Velikovsky party tries to compel interest by scientists in work in which they can find no interest.&lt;ref&gt;Henry H. Bauer, ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', page 78-79, Publ. 1999 University of Illinois Press, 354 pages {{ISBN|0-252-06845-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, many magazines and journals did accept advertisements for ''Pensée'', including the ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'',&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', Jun 1972, Vol. 28, No. 6, ISSN 0096-3402 ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;dq=%22velikovsky%20reconsidered%22&amp;pg=PT1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22velikovsky%20reconsidered%22&amp;f=false page 58])&lt;/ref&gt; ''Science'', ''Science News'', and ''Physics Today''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'', Fall 1972; '''2'''(3), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
At the end of the ten issue Velikovsky feature, the subscribers were informed that "Pensee may not survive the future" in the back of tenth issue while soliciting subscription renewals for up to three years on the inside front cover&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (1974). Why Pensee? ''Pensee X'', '''4''' (5), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; while the magazine was "seriously encumbered with debts".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Talbott, Pensee Newsletter, February 26, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication ceased with the tenth issue and in early 1976 subscribers were informed "Pensée has discontinued publication indefinitely".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Talbott, ''Pensée Newsletter'', February 26, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Velikovsky himself noted "When ''Pensée'' (1972-1974) completed the planned ten issues on the theme 'Velikovsky Reconsidered' I made it clear that I would not continue my cooperation as a regular contributor, not only because of a lack of time, but also because of disagreement with certain aspects of their editorial policy."&lt;ref&gt;"Dear Professor Greenberg", ''Kronos''., Vol. II No. 2 (Nov 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gordin" /&gt;

==Successor==
The successor Research Communications Network with Stephen L. Talbott as coordinator, which was "committed to no man and no theory", sent a newsletter to its "more than 16,000 U.S. members" six months later.&lt;ref&gt;Research Communications Network ''Newsletter'' #1, 10 September 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The Network served as a clearinghouse for developments in and information about catastrophism, with special attention to [[Robert V. Gentry]]'s [[radiohalo]]s&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (1977). Mystery of the Radiohalos. ''Research Communications Network Newsletter'' #2, February 10, 1977, 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and David N. Talbott's "Saturn Thesis",&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, John (1977). Saturn's Age. ''Research Communications Network Newsletter'' #3, October 15, 1977, 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as offering a book service through its mailings of newsletters and resources fliers. The Network ceased operations in spring 1978 with a single sheet flier announcing a book close-out sale and an offering of Velikovsky's ''Ramses II and his Time''.&lt;ref&gt;RCN Mailings in C. Leroy Ellenberger Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presley Norton Yoder''' ([[Guayaquil]], February 26, 1932 &amp;ndash; May 8, 1993) was an [[Ecuadorian]] archeologist and entrepreneur.

He made excavations in the '70s and early '80s, in the province of Guayas, where he uncovered a number of vases and figurines of the [[Machalilla culture]], and also uncovered some from the [[Valdivia culture]] dating 3000 years BC.

==Biography==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Presley Norton Museum in Guayaquil Ecuador.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Presley Norton Museum]], Guayaquil, Ecuador, (located in the Avenue 9 de Octubre)]] --&gt;
Presley Norton Yoder was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador on February 26, 1932. His father was Presley Norton (1907-1944) of New York, and his mother was Blanche La Rose Yoder of Guayaquil.

Presley Norton's grandfather was [[Evermont Hope Norton]] (1873-1960) a business man from Richmond, VA, who was former president and chairman of the [[Ecuadorian Corporation, Ltd]]. and the International Products Corporation. Evermont went to South America in 1911 as president of the [[Guayaquil and Quito Railway Company]], after an early career as a stockbroker in New York. He developed the Ecuadorian Railroad, which rises from the Pacific Coast city of Guayaquil, over the Andes Mountains to Quito. Evermont graduated in 1895 from the University of Virginia. He started in Wall Street the following year, and until 1899 was senior partner in [[Norton &amp; Tunstall]]. He served in Naval Intelligence in World War I. He was married several times, one time to Lily Bouvier Morison of Saint Louis, MO who was a great aunt of [[Jackeline Bouvier Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopresleynorton.gob.ec/ Museo Presley Norton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202853/http://www.museopresleynorton.gob.ec/ |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley Norton's father died when he was about 12 years old. He inherited shares worth $600,000 which by the time he was of age in 1950 had become $5,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo8/n2.htm Complete Spanish biography of Presley Norton by Rodolfo Perez Pimentel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton had dual citizenship in Ecuador and the United States, because he was born in Ecuador and his father was born in New York. In 1950 he joined the American army which stationed him in Hawaii (1950-1952).

Between 1950-1953 he studied Literature and History at [[Brown University]] in Providence, Rhode Island. He then went to Paris and enrolled at the [[Sorbonne]] where he took courses in the history of French civilization and contemporary philosophy until 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo8/n2.htm Complete Spanish biography of Presley Norton by Rodolfo Perez Pimentel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Norton married Leonor Pérez Gómez with whom he had 4 children. After divorcing Leonor he married an English woman, Georgina Marten Sturt, in 1973. He divorced Georgina in 1978 and married María Isabel Fernández Salvador Eastman in 1982 with whom he had 2 children.

In 1962 he started the first television channel in Guayaquil, Ecuador, "Televisión Ecuatoriana Canal 4" (Ecuadorian TV Channel 4) with the help of ABC (American Broadcasting Inc) of New York who put up 1/3 of the money while he put up a 2/3 investment. Later he started Channel 6 in Quito.

He died on May 8, 1993 of a heart attack.

==History==
Experts suggest that the name Reşvan is a compound of ''reş'' ("black") and the Kurdish plural form ''-ân''.&lt;ref name="suatdede" /&gt;
The name of the tribe was recorded in the ''[[defter]]'' (tax register) back in 1519, when Sultan [[Selim I]] conquered Malatya and Kahta. The tribe was also mentioned in 1524 and 1536, although its numbers were not recorded. The tribe was like all other Kurdish tribes nomadic before the [[Ottoman Empire]] managed to sedentarize them, as part of the [[Tanzimat]]. The first attempt to sedentarize the tribe took place in 1830 and the process continued through [[Atatürk's Reforms]] (about 1923). During the sedentarization the Reşvan tribe was one of the biggest and most influential Kurdish tribes.&lt;ref name="suatdede" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dede|first1=Suat|title=From nomadism to sedentary life in Central Anatolia: The case of the Risvan tribe (1830 - 1932)|date=December 2011|pages=120|url=http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0005059.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, some Kurds from the tribe moved to or were deported to [[Central Anatolia]], where they today reside in many villages around [[Cihanbeyli]], [[Haymana]], [[Boztepe, Kırşehir|Boztepe]] and [[Kulu, Konya|Kulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cihanbeyli - Index Anatolicus|url=http://www.nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Cihanbeyli&amp;lv=1&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|publisher=Index Anatolicus|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haymana - Index Anatolicus|url=http://www.nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Haymana&amp;lv=1&amp;srt=x&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|publisher=Index Anatolicus|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boztepe - Index Anatolicus|url=http://www.nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Boztepe&amp;lv=1&amp;srt=x&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|publisher=Index Anatolicus|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kulu - Index Anatolicus|url=http://www.nisanyanmap.com/?y=&amp;t=Kulu&amp;lv=1&amp;srt=x&amp;u=1&amp;ua=0|publisher=Index Anatolicus|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1859 document shows that about 500 households of the tribe lived in Haymana, [[Ankara]], being sedentarized in 43 villages.&lt;ref name="suatdede" /&gt;

During the 1890s, the leader of the tribe Yakup Ragıp from [[Besni]] protected [[Armenians]] from Ottoman massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Şemsa Özar, Nesrin Uçarlar, Osman Aytar|title=From past to present a paramilitary organization in Turkey|date=December 2013|isbn=978-6055458195|page=26|url=http://dealingwiththepast.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disa-Paramilitary.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and elections==
The majority of the tribe are [[Sunni Muslims]] (and a minority [[Alevi]]), inhabiting [[Adıyaman]], [[Kahramanmaraş]] and [[Malatya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reswan-stammen fra Konya|url=http://jiyan.dk/2011/08/reswan-stammen-fra-konya-oprindeligt-alevi/|publisher=Jiyan.dk|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Danish|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to be conservative.

'''Rolf Peter Sieferle''' (1949–2016) was a German historian known for applying the methodology of the social sciences to contemporary topics including ecological sustainability and social capital. He was a pioneer scholar of German environmental history.  His work was wide ranging, addressing German conservatism around the period of the First World War, Karl Marx, and the fall of Communism. He was an advisor on climate change to the [[Angela Merkel]] government.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt;

Sieferle came of age with the generation of 1968 as a youthful Socialist.  By the 1990s, he was increasingly critical of what he viewed as naïve idealism. During the 2015 [[European migrant crisis]], Sieferle wrote, “A society that can no longer distinguish between itself and the forces that would dissolve it is living morally beyond its means,” causing the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' to  describe him as “embittered, humorless, ever more isolated”.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt; He committed suicide on 17 September 2016.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt;

His [[Finis Germania]] became a bestseller following his death despite the fact that it has been denounced as an "extremist tract" and deemed antisemitic by the literary establishment.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Caldwell |first1=Christopher |title=Germany’s Newest Intellectual Antihero |work=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170709033830/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/germanys-newest-intellectual-antihero.html |archive-date=July 9, 2017 |dead-url=no |date=July 8, 2017 |access-date=2017-07-08 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/germanys-newest-intellectual-antihero.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8176">'''Ross Hassig''' (born December 13, 1945)&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n83-194200|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American historical [[anthropologist]] specializing in [[Mesoamerica]]n studies, particularly the [[Aztec]] culture.  His focus is often on the description of practical infrastructure in Mesoamerican societies. He is the author of several influential{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} books, among them: ''Time, History, and Belief in Aztec and Colonial Mexico''; ''Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control''; and ''Trade, Tribute, and Transportation: The Sixteenth-Century Political Economy of the Valley of Mexico''.

==Career==
Hassig began his academic career as an undergraduate at [[Vanderbilt University]], where his studies initially focused on non-Western legal systems. He soon developed an interest in anthropology, later obtaining in 1974 his [[Master's degree]] from Vanderbilt in Law and Anthropology, with a thesis on political development among the [[Puebloan peoples]] at [[Acoma Pueblo]]. He then went on further his graduate studies at [[Stanford University]], obtaining his [[Ph.D]] from the Department of Anthropology there in 1980.&lt;ref name="Schoolfor"&gt;School for Advanced Research (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Stanford, Hassig's research agenda shifted to focus on the cultures of [[Mesoamerica]], where he investigated the economic and political foundations of pre- and post-conquest societies. Among the first of his studies was directed towards the underpinnings of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Tarascan state]].&lt;ref name="Schoolfor" /&gt;

For 1989&amp;ndash;90 he was a scholar-in-residence of Pre-Columbian Studies at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Research Library and Collection, with a research project entitled "Warfare and the Mesoamerican Past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=n.d. |title=Scholars in residence for 1989&amp;ndash;90 |url=http://www.doaks.org/fellows89-90.html |publisher=[[Dumbarton Oaks]] |accessdate=2008-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000608122742/http://www.doaks.org/fellows89-90.html |archivedate=2000-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997&amp;ndash;98 Hassig spent a year as Resident Scholar under the Weatherhead Fellowship program at the [[School of American Research]]&lt;ref&gt;Since renamed the ''School for Advanced Research'', in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], with a primary focus on researching the [[Aztec calendar]].&lt;ref name="Schoolfor" /&gt;

In the 1999 United Kingdom academic year, Hassig was awarded one of the two residential Visiting Fellowships offered annually by the [[Sainsbury Research Unit]] at the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]], [[University of East Anglia]], [[Norwich]], towards the study of 'Aztec thought and culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=n.d. |title=List of Former Fellows |url=http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/fellowships-former_fellows.php |work=Sainsbury Research Unit for the Arts of Africa, Oceania &amp; the Americas |publisher=University of East Anglia, Norwich |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313050142/http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/fellowships-former_fellows.php |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hassig held a chair as Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Oklahoma]], until 2003 when he relocated to [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=Fall 2003 |title=Good Luck to OU Anthro ambassadors |url=http://www.ou.edu/anthropology/Forms_Documents/Newsletters/vol1_iss1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901082417/http://www.ou.edu/anthropology/Forms_Documents/Newsletters/vol1_iss1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-01 |format=[[PDF]] online reproduction |journal=Ear to the Ground: Anthropology Department Newsletter |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3 |location=Norman |publisher=Anthropology Department, University of Oklahoma |accessdate=2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since leaving OU Hassig has remained an [[independent scholar]] and author, continuing his research into Mesoamerican cultures and state societies.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub (2007:x).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SylvOH.jpeg|200px|thumb|''Dr. Sylvester O'Halloran'']]
'''Sylvester O'Halloran''' (31 December 1728&amp;nbsp;– 11 August 1807) was an Irish [[surgery|surgeon]] with an abiding interest in [[Gaels|Gaelic]] poetry and history. For most of his life he lived and practised in [[Limerick]], and was later elected a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
O'Halloran was the third son of Michael O'Halloran, a prosperous farmer at [[Caherdavin]], [[County Limerick]], and his wife Mary McDonnell. He was named after [[Sylvester Lloyd]], the titular Catholic bishop of [[Diocese of Killaloe|Killaloe]] in 1728–39. His mother's cousin Sean Claragh McDonnell taught him much at an early age, including some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. He went on to a Limerick school run by Robert Cashin, a [[Protestant]] [[cleric|clergyman]], which was unusual at the time as the O'Hallorans were [[Roman Catholic]]s during the difficult time of the [[Penal Laws]].

Sylvester and his brothers engaged successfully in areas of life that worked around the restrictions of the Penal Laws. Joseph became a [[Jesuit]] and held chairs in rhetoric, philosophy and divinity at the Jesuit College at [[Bordeaux]] in France. George became a jeweller and in time a property-owner. Sylvester went to London to learn medicine at the age of 17, particularly studying the methods of [[Richard Mead]], as well as the [[oculist]]s Taylor and Hillmer. After further study at [[Leyden]], and in Paris under the [[anatomy|anatomist]] and [[Académie des sciences|academician]] [[Antoine Ferrein]], he set up practice as a surgeon in Limerick in early 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons J.B. "Sylvestor O'Halloran", essay in "Eighteenth Century Ireland" (Journal) ISSN 0790-7915, volume 4 (1989) p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as surgeon==
O'Halloran wrote several learned treatises on medical matters, and his fame was acknowledged by his membership of the RIA in 1787. He was a founder of the County Limerick Infirmary that started with 4 beds in 1761 before moving to larger premises at St Francis's Abbey in 1765. The foundation stone of the original infirmary is now preserved in the Sylvester O'Halloran Post Graduate Centre at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick.&lt;ref name=NIHS&gt;[http://www.nihs.ie/soh1/index.cfm National Institute of Health Sciences: About Sylvester O'Halloran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430092121/http://www.nihs.ie/soh1/index.cfm |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in France, he had been very impressed with the Académie Royale de Chirurgie, which had been founded in Paris in 1731 during the reign of [[Louis XV]].&lt;ref name=NIHS/&gt; He was subsequently instrumental in founding the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), by writing its blueprint, the ''Proposals for the Advancement of Surgery in Ireland'' in 1765.  In 1780 he was made an honorary member of the new "Dublin Society of Surgeons", and when the RCSI received its [[Royal charter|charter]] in 1784 he was again elected an honorary member, equivalent to a Fellowship today.

===Medical bibliography===
*''A New Philosophical and Medical Treatise on the Air'' ([[manuscript]]; before 1750).
*''A Treatise on the Glaucoma, or Cataract'' ([[Dublin]], 1750).
*''A New Method of Amputation'' (1763).
*''Gangrene and Sphacelus'' (1765).
*''A New Treatise on the Different Disorders arising from External Injuries to the Head'' (1793).

In his last work O'Halloran contributes to Irish social history, as the head injuries he treated were often caused by fights aggravated by alcohol abuse. On page 4 he commented:

:''"...for our people, invincibly brave, notwithstanding the cruel oppressions they have suffered for a century past, and highly irritable, soon catch fire; a slight offence is frequently followed by serious consequences; and sticks, stones, and every species of offence next to hand, are dealt out with great liberality! To this add the frequent abuse of spirituous liquors, particularly whiskey, which has, unhappily for the morals and constitutions of the people, found its way to every part of the kingdom."''

==Student of Gaelic poetry==
As well as his scientific knowledge, O'Halloran's interest in the arts began with his collection of Gaelic poetry manuscripts and this led on to an interest in Irish history. Given his background, he argued to validate the [[Gaelic Ireland|pre-Norman]] history of Ireland which had often been dismissed as a period of barbarism.

His correspondents included [[Edmund Burke]] on early history. With [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor of Belanagare]] he discussed [[James Macpherson|Macpherson's]] translated version of [[Ossian]], and advised him about an eye complaint.

In 1789 [[Charlotte Brooke]] published the first English-language compendium of Irish poetry, the seminal "Reliques of Irish Poetry", giving full due to O'Halloran for lending her his manuscript collection and for having written the essential history underlying her anthology.

===Critics===
As an early sympathetic historian of the Gaelic world in English, O'Halloran has faced criticism for being too sympathetic. In the 1770s a critic suggested he should: 
:''drop any more scribbling, and mind the Systole and Diastole of the human body, which I suppose you are more acquainted with than history.''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, op cit., page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian JC Beckett (1912–96) included O'Halloran among those aiming: ''to vindicate its claims by uncritical admiration for the achievements of pre-Norman Ireland.''&lt;ref&gt;A New History of Ireland vol. IV (Oxford, 1986) page lxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ierne Defended'' (1774)
*''A general history of Ireland'' (1778)

==Family life==
In 1752 Sylvester married Mary Casey and they had four sons and a daughter. Their homes were in Change Lane and then on Merchants' Quay; Mary died in 1782. O'Halloran was buried in 1807 at St. Munchin's graveyard, at Killeely which is now a suburb of Limerick. One of their sons was Major-General Sir [[Joseph O'Halloran]], the father of [[Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran|Thomas O'Halloran]], after whom the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O'Halloran Hill]] was named.

==Limerick public life==
[[Image:LimerickSunsetPotatoMarket.jpg|thumb|''Sylvester O'Halloran Bridge, Limerick'']]
Though politically restricted in his life by the Penal Laws, O'Halloran helped establish the county Infirmary (see above), was elected President of the city's Free Debating Society in 1772 and was elected to a committee in 1783 that examined the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] navigation. Appropriately a Limerick bridge over the Shannon has been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limerickslife.com/limerick-sylvester-ohalloran/|title=The life of the renowned surgeon Sylvester O’Halloran|work=Limerick's Life|author=Sharon Slater|date=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Telugu''' '''year''' is the calendar year for the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]  speaking people of . Each Yuga (Era) has a cycle of 60 years. Each year of [[Ugadi]] year has a specific name in [[Panchangam]] (Astrnomical calendar) based on astrological influences and the name of the year would represent the character of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kaavyaanjali.blogspot.com/2008/04/telugu-year-names.html |title=Telugu Year Names |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar includes 60 year names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telugucorner.com/samvathsaralu.php |title=Telugu Samvatsaramulu Perlu |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EBgm3OFY |archivedate=2013-02-04 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every 60 years one name cycle completes and the names repeat in the next cycle. For example, the Telugu name for 1954 is "jaya", repeated in 2014. [[Ugadi]] is the Telugu new year festival that comes in the spring season (usually March or April). These years always change on Ugadi.

Significance :

In ancient days Yogis (saints) interact directly with god , according to that, they have given information related to our Indian Kalachakra(time-cycle) by considering Lord Shiva(Destroyer of bad), Lord Vishnu(Manager of good and bad), Lord Bharmha(Creator of things) and Goddess Shakthi (Energy) life's span. Below is the Indian Kalachakra (time-cycle):

60 years                     =    Shashti Poorthi (For Reference : [[Shashti Poorthi]])

4,32,000 years           =    Kali yuga (Age of vice) (For Reference : [[Kali Yuga]])

8,64,000 years           =    Dwapar yuga (For Reference : [[Dvapara Yuga]])

12,96,000 years         =    Treta Yuga (For Reference : [[Treta Yuga]])

17,28,000 years         =    Sat Yuga or Krta Yuga or Krita Yuga (For Reference : [[Satya Yuga]])

Total 43,20,000 years =    1 Maha yuga (Total 4 yugas. For Reference : [[Yuga]])

71 Maha yugas           =    1 Manvantara or Manuvantara or Manvanter (For Reference : [[Manvantara]])

14 Manvantara           =     1 Kalpa (For Reference : [[Kalpa (aeon)]])

2 Kalpas                     =       Lord Bhrama 1 day

2000 Kalpas               =       Lord Bhrama's life span

200 Kalpas of Lord Vishnu = Lord Shiva 1 day

200 Kalpas of Lord Shiva   = 1 eye blink of Lord Shakthi (Energy).

This article lists the major violent and political incidents during the [[Troubles]], [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]], and a [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|dissident campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], from the late 1960s until the present day. The Troubles was a period of conflict in Northern Ireland involving [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]], the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British security forces]], and civil rights groups. The Troubles is usually dated from the riots of 1968 through the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch68.htm#Oct A Chronology of the Conflict – October 1968], ''CAIN Web Service''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aughey, Arthur.

"The troubles were over, but the killing continued. Some of the heirs to Ireland's violent traditions refused to give up their inheritance", ''Hope against History: The Course of Conflict in Northern Ireland''.

''Historical Dictionary of the Northern Ireland Conflict'', page 250; {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5583-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sporadic violence continued after this point. Those that continued violence past this point are referred to as [[Dissident republican]]s and Loyalists in the Dissident Irish Republican Campaign. The Troubles 1968-1998, claimed roughly 3500 lives while the Dissident Irish Republican Campaign 1998–present, has claimed around 150 lives.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke, Liam. [http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue08/is08artstadan.html Statistics Of Danger], volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to 1960==
Since [[Partition of Ireland|partition]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|IRA]] had started a number of military operations in [[Northern Ireland]] designed at bringing about their goal of a [[United Ireland]]. The intensity of this activity increased towards the end of 1941, where the IRA decided to step up its [[Northern Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|campaign of attacks in Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=cain1800&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch1800-1967.htm CAIN: Chronology of Key Events in Irish History, 1800 to 1967; section 1941 and onwards], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 13 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this activity the Unionist authorities under [[J. M. Andrews|John Miller Andrews]] introduced internment and using provisions of the [[Emergency Powers Act (Northern Ireland) 1926|Emergency Powers Act]], instituted increasingly restrictive policies in Northern Ireland. This pattern of paramilitary violence, followed by increasingly restrictive measures on the behalf of the authorities came to define the run-up to the Troubles.

==1960–1969==
Since 1964, [[Northern Ireland civil-rights movement (1960s)|civil rights activists]] had been protesting against the discrimination against [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] by the [[Ulster Protestant]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[government of Northern Ireland]]. The civil rights movement called for: '[[one man, one vote]]'; the end to [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] electoral boundaries; the end to discrimination in employment and in the allocation of public housing; repeal of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]]; and the disbanding of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]].&lt;ref name=cain1800/&gt;

|[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] led by [[Ian Paisley]], a Protestant preacher, founded the [[Ulster Constitution Defence Committee]] (UCDC) to oppose the civil rights movement. It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]] (UPV).&lt;ref name=cain1800/&gt;

In the second, a Catholic civilian (John Patrick Scullion) was shot dead as he walked home. In the third, the UVF opened fire on three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing one (Peter Ward, a native of the Republic of Ireland) and wounding the other two.&lt;ref name=cain1800/&gt;

An unmarried Protestant woman (the secretary of a local [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) politician) had been given the house ahead of Catholic families with children. The protesters were forcibly removed by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC).&lt;ref name=cain68&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch68.htm A Chronology of the Conflict – 1968].

|A People's Democracy march between Belfast and Derry was repeatedly attacked by loyalists. At [[Burntollet]] it was ambushed by 200 loyalists and off-duty police (RUC) officers armed with iron bars, bricks and bottles. The marchers claimed that police did little to protect them. When the march arrived in Derry it was broken up by the RUC, which sparked serious rioting between Irish nationalists and the RUC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm#Jan A Chronology of the Conflict – January 1969] ''CAIN Web Service''&lt;/ref&gt; That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the [[Bogside]] area of Derry; attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse.&lt;ref name=burntollet&gt;Bowes Egan and Vincent McCormack.

|The loyalists intended to bring down the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Terence O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of the Maine|Terence O'Neill]], who had promised some concessions to the civil rights movement. To this end, Members of the loyalist UVF and UPV bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, in deceitful [[false flag]] attacks, blaming them on the dormant IRA and on elements of the civil rights movement. There were six bombings and all were widely blamed on the IRA. As a response, British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Despite this, Loyalist-Unionist support for O'Neill continued to wane, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm#Apr A Chronology of the Conflict – April 1969] ''CAIN Web Service''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Egle''' was a physician, author and historian who served as the State Librarian of the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] from 1887 to 1889. A practicing physician at the dawn of the [[American Civil War]], he was initially commissioned as an assistant surgeon, and then served as a surgeon with several different [[Union Army]] regiments during the course of the conflict, including the [[116th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops|116th Regiment Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops (USCT)]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, Luther Reily. ''[http://genealogytrails.com/penn/dauphin/GenieMemories/Pages1-20.htm History of Dauphin County: Genealogical Memoirs]'', Vol. III. New York, New York and Chicago, Illinois: The Lewis Publishing Company, 1907, pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1901/02/20/archives/dr-william-h-egle.html Dr. William H. Egle]" (obituary). New York, New York: ''The New York Times''. February 10, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war, he garnered the respect of colleagues in his respective fields of endeavor, particularly so for his body of work which documented Pennsylvania's history from its founding through the late 19th century – excerpts of which continued to be reprinted in newspapers following his death in 1901 and are still cited as references by present-day historians and professional genealogists. His passing was "deeply mourned" by many, according to historian Luther Reily Kelker, who said of Egle, "few brighter, nobler types of manhood have ever adorned the generations of men in the Keystone State."&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County: Genealogical Memoirs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formative years ==
Born in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] on September 17, 1830, William Henry Egle was a son of Pennsylvania natives John Egle (1798–1834) and Elizabeth (von Treupel) Egle (1810–1841). Reared in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania]], he was compelled to relocate to the home of his paternal grandmother in 1834, following the sudden death of his father. Educated initially in the county's public schools, he then spent two years at the Harrisburg Military Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Egle, William Henry. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UmchH3gzLcC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=%22Elizabeth+(Von+Treupel%22+Egle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=icTozKOOHg&amp;sig=Dgg4KEeNqRYmcTvIapmV4PGtNZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj83MDv7cTcAhUIYK0KHU8iAnQQ6AEwAnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elizabeth%20(Von%20Treupel%22%20Egle%22&amp;f=false The Family of Egle]", in ''Pennsylvania: Genealogies Chiefly Scotch-Irish and German'', pp. 166–167. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (original publication date: 1886) and Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County: Genealogical Memoirs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 20-year-old during the summer of 1850, he was one of several young men working as a printer for, and living with, master printer Theophilus Ferne in Harrisburg's West Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Wm. H. Egle, in U.S. Census (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1850). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years with the ''Pennsylvania Telegraph'', he worked his way up to become foreman and then state printer. He then began his medical studies under the training of Harrisburg physician Charles D. Bombaugh, M.D. Supporting his training through employment as a teacher and mail clerk, he enrolled in 1857 for formal studies with the medical department at the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania]], graduating from there in March 1859. Once back home in Harrisburg, he opened a private medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, he wed Eliza Beatty (1833–1923).&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. William H. Egle", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County''.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, they welcomed the birth of a son, Beverly Waugh Egle (1861–1882).&lt;ref&gt;"William H. Egle, Eliza B. Egle, et. al., in U.S. Census (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1870, 1880, 1900). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil War ==
[[File:Battle of Fredericksburg, Dec 13, 1862.png|thumb|Union Army crossing the Rappahannock River prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862.]] On September 12, 1862, William H. Egle, M.D. enrolled for Civil War military service at Bakersville, Maryland, and was commissioned as an assistant surgeon with the field and staff officers' corps of the [[96th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]], a position he held until resigning his commission roughly six months later. Stationed in Virginia with his regiment throughout the fall of 1862, he experienced his first true taste of life as a combat surgeon with the 96th Pennsylvania's participation in the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Involved in engagements ranging from light skirmishes to intense battles under heavy rifle and artillery fire beginning on December 12, 1862, he and his fellow 96th Pennsylvanians finally found relief three days later when they were ordered back across the Rappahannock River and made camp near White Oak Church. Caring for men who were primarily assigned to fatigue duty from January through March 1863, he resigned his commission on March 9 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Egle, William H., F&amp;S – 96 I", in "Civil War Veterans' Card File, 1861–1866."

Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 1901–1920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then commissioned as a surgeon at the age of 32, and enrolled on July 10, 1863 with the field and staff officers' corps of the 47th Pennsylvania Militia, Emergency of 1863. (Not to be confused with the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry]], the 47th Pennsylvania Militia, Emergency of 1863 was one of a group of temporary volunteer militia units which were formed in response to the threatened invasion of Pennsylvania by Confederate troops during the summer of 1863. When the threat was deemed over by Pennsylvania's governor and senior military leaders, these units were disbanded, and their men were sent back to their respective communities.) A resident of [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] at the time of his enrollment, Egle officially mustered in at [[Camp Curtin]] in Harrisburg the next day, but remained in that position only until August 14 when the entire regiment honorably mustered out.&lt;ref&gt;"Egle, William H. (F&amp;S – 47 I Mil 63)", in "Civil War Veterans' Card File." Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase of service, the 47th Pennsylvania Militia, Emergency of 1863 was assigned to duty stations in Williamsport, Lycoming County; Reading, Berks County; and Schuylkill County, where it was ordered to dampen the rising tension between miners and Union Army recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Samuel P. ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aby3439.0005.001 History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5]'', Vol. 5, pp. 1222–1231, 1283–86. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: B.

[[File:William Henry Egle, Surgeon, 116th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops (Civil War Pension-Gen. Index).jpg|thumb|William Henry Egle's U.S. Civil War Pension Index data (U.S. National Archives/Fold3).]] He then enrolled for a third term of military service. Commissioned again as a surgeon, he mustered in at Camp Nelson, Kentucky on 12 July 1864 with Company S of the [[116th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops|116th Regiment Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops (USCT)]]. On August 12, 1864, he was promoted to the rank of major. Attached to the Military District of Kentucky, Department of Ohio until September 1864, he and the other members of his regiment then served with the U.S. Army's X Corps ([[Army of the James]]) until November of that same year when the regiment became part of the X Corps' 1st Brigade, 3rd Division.&lt;ref&gt;"Official Register of The Army Volunteer Force, 1861–65" (116th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops).

Transferred with his regiment to the U.S. Army's XXV Corps, 1st Brigade, 2nd Division in December 1864, he and his fellow 116th USCT members remained part of that command until April 1865, when the regiment was re-assigned to the XXV Corps' 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, and saw service with the Department of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;"Official Register of The Army Volunteer Force" (116th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops), U.S. National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

After mustering out of the 116th USCT on November 9, 1865, he was appointed as the executive medical officer for the U.S. Army’s XXIV Corps, serving under General William Birney at Petersburg and Appomattox before being transferred to General Jackson’s division and service near Roma, Texas from June through December 1865 when he again resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Official Register of The Army Volunteer Force" (116th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops), U.S. National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war life ==
Following his resignation from the military, Egle returned home to his wife and medical practice in Pennsylvania. He also embarked on what would become a prolific career as a chronicler of Pennsylvania history.&lt;ref&gt;Kelker, ''History of Dauphin County''.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decade was over, he and his wife welcomed the births of daughters, Sarah Beatty (1866–1939) and Catharine Irwin (1869–1943), on July 13, 1866 and January 19, 1869, respectively. A federal census taker in 1870 confirmed that Egle was employed as a physician, and noted that he had amassed real estate and personal property valued at $15,000, {{Inflation|US|15,000|1870|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}, while the 1880 federal census taker described him as a "druggist". The latter census also noted that the Egle household included son Beverly, a 19-year-old medical student; daughters "Sallie" and "Kittie", who were both still in school; and Mary Williams (aged 45) and Mary Jones (aged 30), who were employed as domestic workers in the Egle home.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census, 1870, 1880, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1870s and 1880s were productive for Egle, as he became increasingly known and respected for his historical research and writing. In 1878, Lafayette College presented him with an "honorary degree [an A.M.] for his service in American history."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dauphincountyhistory.org/backups/research/archives/mg/501 MG 501 - Egle, William Collection]." Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: The Historical Society of Dauphin County, retrieved online July 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This triumph was soon followed by tragedy, however, when Egle learned that his only son, Beverly, had died suddenly in Cook County, Illinois on June 21, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cookcountygenealogy.com/ Beverly H. Egle]", in Death Records (Cook County, Illinois). Chicago, Illinois: Office of the Cook County Clerk, June 21, 1882. (Registration needed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work as an author and historian during the early to mid-1880s, William Egle was also employed as the physician for Dauphin County's prison.&lt;ref&gt;December 31, 1883 letter from William H.
