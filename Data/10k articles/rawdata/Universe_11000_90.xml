The '''1997 April Fool's Day blizzard'''&lt;ref name=ithica/&gt;&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;&lt;ref name=noamain/&gt; was a  major winter storm in the [[Northeastern United States]] on March 31 and April 1, 1997.  The storm dumped rain, sleet, and snow from [[Maryland]] to [[Maine]] leaving hundreds of thousands without power and as much as three feet of snow on the ground.

Due to the [[April Fools' Day|date]] many people took warnings of the storm less than seriously.&lt;ref name=ithica&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://ccams.eas.cornell.edu/ithacation/ith_feb03.pdf|title= The Worst Central Massachusetts Nor’ Easters|editor-last1= Nunn|editor-first1= Katherine|editor-last2= MacIntyre|editor-first2= Grant|volume= 6|issue=3|work= The Ithacation|pages= 2–6|publisher= [[Cornell University Press]]|format= PDF|date=February 2003 |access-date= 16 September 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628063831/http://ccams.eas.cornell.edu/ithacation/ith_feb03.pdf|archive-date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plows had already begun to be put away for the summer and [[hardware store]]s had to sell [[snow shovel|shovels]] again even though they already had out [[Garden furniture|patio furniture]].&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; One [[Commuting|commuter]] called it "[[Mother Nature|Mother Nature's]] [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] Joke."&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;

==Life of the storm==

===Formation===
The storm started as a surface [[Low-pressure area|low pressure system]] over the [[Ohio River Valley]] that was generated by an area of strong jet stream energy carving out an active upper air low pressure trough on Sunday March 30. The low pressure system brought rain to much of the Ohio Valley.&lt;ref name=cbsny/&gt;

When the storm arrived in eastern New York and western New England the areas received light rain. The storm moved off the coast of New Jersey on March 31 and began rapidly strengthening.  As the storm intensified, air began rising around the storm at a very rapid rate which cooled in the atmosphere and caused the rain to change into heavy snow. The low moved very slowly along the coast gaining strength throughout the day, and with a continuous supply of moisture, this allowed for an extended period of heavy snow.&lt;ref name=cbsny/&gt;

===Boston===
Prior to the storm, [[Boston]] had received just {{Convert|26.5|in|cm}} of snow for the season.&lt;ref name=lance&gt;{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fqEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qk0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6748,188138&amp;dq=april+fool%27s+day+blizzard&amp;hl=en|title= One death blamed on spring snowstorm|publisher= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|date= 2 April 1997|page= 3A|first= Jon|last= Marcus|access-date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday March 30, Boston was sunny with a high temperature of 63&amp;nbsp;°F. A [[cold front]] passed early next day (Monday March 31), dropping the temperature into the 40s,&lt;ref name=10year/&gt; and just prior to dawn precipitation began to fall in the form of light rain.&lt;ref name="10year"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thebostonchannel.com/weather/11419918/detail.html|title= 10 Years Later, April's Biggest Storm Is Remembered|last= Leonard|first= Harvey|date= 28 March 2007|publisher= [[WCVB-TV]]|work= The Boston Channel|access-date= 10 February 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201200718/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/weather/11419918/detail.html|archive-date= 1 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston the rain began to mix with wet snow mid-morning and eventually turned to wet snow and became heavier just after 7 p.m. From 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the snow fell at a rate of at least {{Convert|1|in|cm}} per hour.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;

During the peak of the storm from about 11 p.m. March 31 to 3 a.m. April 1, snow fell in Boston at the rate of {{Convert|3|in|cm}} per hour. Numerous [[lightning|lightning strikes]] and [[thunder]]claps accompanied the extremely heavy snow, which accumulated one foot ({{Convert|12|in|cm}}) in just that four-hour period. Moderate to heavy snow continued through midmorning before tapering off.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;

==Impact==

===New England===

====Precipitation received====
The {{Convert|25.4|in|cm}} of snow that fell at Boston's [[Logan International Airport]] was the fourth-biggest snowstorm in Boston history (biggest in the month of April) behind the [[North American blizzard of 2003]] ({{Convert|27.5|in|cm}}), the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] ({{Convert|27.1|in|cm}}), and the [[February 1969 nor'easter]] ({{Convert|26.3|in|cm}}) and made April 1997 Boston's snowiest April on record (the previous record being a mere {{Convert|13.3|in|cm}}).&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;&lt;ref name=noamain/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs6albany.com/sections/weather/historical/paststorms/1997/Mar31-1997_Noreaster.htm|title=Major Nor'easter (Heavy Snow)|date=31 March 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224115129/http://www.cbs6albany.com/sections/weather/historical/paststorms/1997/Mar31-1997_Noreaster.htm|archive-date=24 February 2012|dead-url=yes|work=[[WRGB|CBS 6 Albany]]|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also set a record for Boston's greatest April 24-hour snowfall.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;&lt;ref name=noamain/&gt; Parts of New England received 50 to 70&amp;nbsp;mph wind gusts at the height of the storm.&lt;ref name=cbsny/&gt; Providence recorded {{Convert|18|in|cm}} of snow which was the fourth greatest on record at the time.&lt;ref name="noamain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/papers/blizzard78/mainblizzardof78.htm|title= The Great Northeast Blizzard of 1978 Remembered 30 Years Later in Southern New England|last=Strauss|first=Neal|website=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127113546/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/papers/blizzard78/mainblizzardof78.htm|archive-date=27 November 2015|dead-url=yes|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of [[New England]] reported more than {{Convert|30|in|cm}} and up to three feet with [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] receiving {{Convert|33|in|cm}}, the city's largest snowfall in history until 2015.&lt;ref name=tusc/&gt;&lt;ref name= Epstein2017 /&gt;

====Damage and travel disruptions====
A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Massachusetts Gov. [[Bill Weld|William F. Weld]].&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; The snow came down too fast for road crews to keep up with and roads became impassable and thousands of cars were stranded.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein2017/&gt; Commuter trolleys in Boston were closed for the first time in nearly twenty years,&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; public transportation was crippled, about 1,000 motorists spent the night stranded in their cars and 4,000 stayed in shelters.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; Some of the narrow side streets of Boston were completely buried&lt;ref name=10year/&gt; and portions of [[Interstate 95]] and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] were shut down because of the snow.&lt;ref name=whdh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.whdh.com/features/articles/specialreport/A300/|title=Ten Years of Weather|work=[[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]]|date= 16 June 2003|first= Todd|last= Gross|access-date=16 September 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20030623214522/http://www1.whdh.com/features/articles/specialreport/A300/|archive-date= 23 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main roads and highways were cleared within a couple of days but the secondary roads remained a mess making travel difficult.&lt;ref name=tusc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ij0dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V6YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3615,279724&amp;dq=april+fool%27s+day+blizzard&amp;hl=en|title=New England still digging out from April Fools Day snowfall|publisher=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date= 3 April 1997|page=2A|first=Jon|last=Marcus |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the storm, subways and commuter rails were still sluggish because of fallen trees and signal problems.&lt;ref name=tusc/&gt;

The wet and heavy snow caused tree limbs and even whole trees to fall.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt; Some fell on power lines, and many people were left without power.&lt;ref name=10year/&gt; Electricity was knocked out for nearly 700,000 people.&lt;ref name=Epstein2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/30/remembering-that-april-fool-day-blizzard-years-ago/QKa1LbQHk6ZxMlhHUaLI2I/story.html|title=Remembering that April Fool’s Day blizzard 20 years ago|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]|date= 30 March 2017|first=Dave|last=Epstein|access-date=20 May 2017|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 13% of [[New England]] lost power, mainly due to trees falling on  power lines and utility poles.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; Power crews from as far away as [[Canada]] came to help clean up the area.&lt;ref name=whdh/&gt;

Logan Airport was also shut down from 2 p.m. March 31 to 10 p.m. April 1.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic===
[[Upstate New York]] received {{Convert|32|in|cm}} &lt;ref name=tusc/&gt; and in some parts of [[New Jersey]] two feet of snow fell causing delays on commuter trains.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; A disaster was declared in eight northeast counties by [[Pennsylvania]] Gov. [[Tom Ridge]] and the [[National Guard of the United States]] was dispatched to dig out cars.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt; [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] had to be shut down because of a ten vehicle accident.&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;

===Injuries and deaths===
[[Hospital|Hospitals]] reported weather-related injuries including back sprains, [[pedestrian|pedestrians]] being hit by falling ice, and hand injuries including missing fingers from [[snow blower|snow blowers]].&lt;ref name=tusc/&gt; Three deaths were caused by the storm in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, all men who had [[heart attack|heart attacks]] while shoveling, with another traffic death in [[New York (state)|New York]] which may have been caused by the weather.&lt;ref name=tusc/&gt;&lt;ref name= Kelly2017&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/recalling_the_april_fools_day.html|title= Recalling the April Fools' Day blizzard of 1997|last= Kelly|first= Ray|date= 30 March 2017|website= Mass Live|access-date= 20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3430">'''Air-laid paper''' is a textile-like material categorized as a [[Nonwoven Fabric|nonwoven fabric]] made from [[fluff pulp]].&lt;ref name=PBG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 95–98 |chapter= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Compared with normal wet-laid [[paper]] and [[paper tissue|tissue]], air-laid paper is very bulky, porous and soft. It has good water absorption properties and is much stronger compared with normal tissue.

Main characteristics are:
* Soft, does not scratch.
* Non-linting, no dust, no static.
* Strong, even when wet, can be rinsed and reused.
* Clean, hygienic, can be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]].
* Textile-like surface and drape.
* Can be [[dye]]d, [[printing|printed]], [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]], coated and made solvent resistant.

==Manufacture==
Unlike the normal [[papermachine|papermaking process]], air-laid paper does not use water as the carrying medium for the fibre. Fibres are carried and formed to the structure of paper by air. The air-laid structure is [[isotropic]].

The raw material is long fibered softwood fluff pulp in roll form. The pulp are defibrized in a [[hammermill]]. Defibration is the process of freeing the fibres from each other before entering the papermachine. Important parameters for dry defibration are shredding energy and [[Knot (papermaking)|knot]] content. Normally an air-laid paper consists of about 85% fibre. A binder must be applied as a spray or foam. Alternatively, additional fibres or powders can be added to the pulp which can then be activated and cured by heat.

==History==
The Danish inventor [[Karl Krøyer]] is considered to be the first who commercialized air-formed paper in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nonwoven Technology Conference 2002 – Ottawa 13-16th May  | date =  | year =   | url = http://www.nonwoven.co.uk/2002_05_01_archive.html | accessdate = 2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others developed different processes independently at about the same time. A Finnish company United Paper Mills(now UPM-Kymmene Oyj) was one of the companies developing airlaid technology in the 1980s. In the 1980s UPM formed a new company called Walkisoft Oy and also built an airlaid factory to Kotka Finland which started in 1985. Walkisoft built several plants around the world (including the worlds largest airlaid-factory in Mt Holly, NC, USA) in the following 14 years before being sold to Buckeye Technologies Inc. The Walkisoft engineering team, which was responsible for the engineering and R&amp;D of the airlaid machines, became known as Buckeye Engineering Finland and then, from 2002, as [http://www.anpap.fi/ Anpap Oy], a private owned Finnish company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papermakerswiki.com/book/export/html/42&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.anpap.fi/company/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* Disposable [[diapers]] as part of the inner absorbent
* [[Feminine hygiene]]
* Industrial wipes
* [[Personal care products]]
* Table top
** [[napkin]]
** [[table cloth]]
* [[Wet wipes]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1241">The '''Bank of Natural Capital''' is an educational initiative associated with [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) to communicate [[natural capital]] investment and [[value theory]] related to what are sometimes called "[[Social capital|economic intangibles]]" to the global public, in particular the direct economic and financial value of [[ecosystem services]] to man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankofnaturalcapital.com|title=Bank of natural – Capital|website=bankofnaturalcapital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sustainableprosperityproject.com/article320 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170146/http://www.sustainableprosperityproject.com/article320 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It encapsulates the idea that the natural world is defined as capital and something to profit on through a capitalist society, saying 'we pay for things we find valuable'. The capitalist construction of nature as something with a value will lead to, as already apparent its over-abstraction and system collapse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">'''Cassie's law''' describes the effective [[contact angle]] [[theta|θ]]&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; for a liquid on a [[composite material|composite surface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/TF9444000546|title=Wettability of porous surfaces|year=1944|last1=Cassie|first1=A. B. D.|last2=Baxter|first2=S.|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume=40|pages=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law explains how simply roughing up a surface increases the apparent surface angle. The law is stated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_c = f_1 \cos \theta_1 + f_2 \cos \theta_2,&lt;/math&gt;

where [[theta|θ]]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the contact angle for component 1 with [[area]] fraction f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[theta|θ]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the contact angle for component 2 with area fraction f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present in the composite material. This equation takes on special meaning when in a 2-component system one component is [[air]] with a [[contact angle]] of 180[[Degree (angle)|°]]. With [[cosine]](180) = −1, the equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_c =\mathit{f}_1 ( \cos \theta_1 + 1) -1,&lt;/math&gt;
 
which implies that with a small ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a large [[theta|θ]]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it is possible to create surfaces with a very large contact angle. Cassie's research pointed out that the water-repelling quality of [[duck]]s is due to the nature of the composite formed between air and feather and not to other causes, such as the presence of exceptional proofing agents like oils. [[Water strider]]s also exploit this phenomenon. Artificial [[superhydrophobic material]]s such as [[nanopin film]] exist in the laboratory that also make use of this law.

'''Cephaloridine''' (or '''cefaloridine''') is a first generation semisynthetic derivative of [[cephalosporin C]]. It is unique among cephalosporins in that it exists as a [[zwitterion]].

==History==
Since the discovery of cephalosporins P, N and C in 1948 there have been many studies describing the antibiotic action of cephalosporins and the possibility to synthesize derivatives. Hydrolysis of cephalosporin C, isolation of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid and the addition of side chains opened the possibility to produce various semi-synthetic cephalosporins. In 1962, [[cephalothin]] and cephaloridine were introduced.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3164.1999.00183.x |title=Cephalosporins - pharmacological basis of clinical use in veterinary dermatology |journal=Veterinary Dermatology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=187–92 |year=1999 | vauthors = Mason IS, Kietzmann M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephaloridine was temporarily popular because it was better tolerated intramuscularly and attained in higher and more sustained levels in blood than cephalothin. However, it binds to proteins to a much lesser extent than [[cephalothin]]. Because it is also poorly absorbed after oral administration the use of this drug for humans declined rapidly, especially since the second generation of cephalosporins was introduced in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt; Today it is more commonly used in veterinary practice to treat mild to severe bacterial infections caused by [[penicillin]] resistant and penicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus sutbtilis, Klebsiella, Clostridium diptheriae, Salmonella and Shigella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudhary RK, Srivastava AK | title = Disposition and dosage regimen of cephaloridine in calves | journal = Veterinary Research Communications | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 325–9 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2781723 | doi = 10.1007/BF00420839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in studying cephalosporins was brought about by some unusual properties of cephaloridine. This antibiotic stands in sharp contrast to various other cephalosporins and to the structurally related penicillins in undergoing little or no net secretion by the mammalian kidney. Cephaloridine is, however, highly [[cytotoxic]] to the proximal renal tubule, the segment of the [[nephron]] responsible for the secretion of organic anions, including para-am-minohippurate (PAH), as well as the various penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The cytotoxicity of cephaloridine is completely prevented by [[probenecid]] and several other inhibitors of organic anion transport, including the nearly nontoxic cephalothin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tune BM, Fravert D | title = Mechanisms of cephalosporin nephrotoxicity: a comparison of cephaloridine and cephaloglycin | journal = Kidney International | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 591–600 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7463955 | doi = 10.1038/ki.1980.177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure &amp; reactivity==
Cephaloridine is a cephalosporin compound with pyridinium-1-ylmethyl and 2-thienylacetamido side groups. The molecular nucleus, of which all cephalosporins are derivatives, is A3-7-aminocephalosporanic acid. Conformations around the [[Beta-lactam|β-lactam rings]] are quite similar to the molecular nucleus of penicillin, while those at the carboxyl group exocyclic to the dihydrothiazine and thiazolidine rings respectively are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sweet RM, Dahl LF | title = The structure of cephaloridine hydrochloride monohydrate | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–6 | date = January 1969 | pmid = 5762455 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(69)90520-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Cephaloridine can be synthesised from Cephalotin and pyridine by deacetylation. This can be done by heating an aquous mixture of cephalotin, thiocyanate, pyridine and phosphoric acid for several hours. After cooling, diluting with water, and adjusting the pH with mineral acid, cephaloridine thiocyanate salt precipitates. This can be purified and converted to cephaloridine by pH adjustment or by interaction with ion-exchange resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Osol A, Hoover JE | title = Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences | edition = 15th | location = Easton, Pennsylvania | publisher = Mack Publishing Co. | date = 1975 | pages = 1120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical use of cephaloridine==
Before the 1970s, cephaloridine was used to treat patients with urinary tract infections. Besides the drugs has been used successfully in the treatment of various lower respiratory tract infections. Cephaloridine was very effective to cure pneumococcal pneumonia. It has a high clinical and bacteriological rate of success in staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.&lt;ref name='Owens'&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Owens DR | title = Advances in Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 13 | publisher = Academic Press, Inc. | pages = 83–170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinetics==

===Absorption===
Cephaloridine is easy absorbed after intramuscular injection and poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name='Charles'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nightingale CH, Greene DS, Quintiliani R | title = Pharmacokinetics and clinical use of cephalosporin antibiotics | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 12 | pages = 1899–926 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 1107514 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600641202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The minor pathway of elimination is biliary excretion. When the blood serum concentration is 24&amp;nbsp;µg/ml, the corresponding biliary concentration is 10&amp;nbsp;µg/ml. In the spinal fluid the concentration of cephaloridine is 6-12% of the concentration in the blood and serum.
Cephaloridine is distributed well into the liver, stomach wall, lung and spleen and is also found in fresh wounds one hour after injection. The concentration in the wound will decrease as the wound age increases. However, the drug is poorly penetrated into the cerebrospinal fluid and is found in a much smaller amount in the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref name='Charles'/&gt;

==== Pregnancy ====
When cephaloridine is administered to pregnant women, the drug crosses the placenta. Cephaloridine concentrations can be measured in the serum of the newborn up to 22 hours after labor, and can reach a level of 54% of the concentration in the maternal serum. When given an intramuscular dose of 1&amp;nbsp;g, a peak occurs in the [[cord blood]] after 4 hours. In [[amniotic fluid]], the concentration takes about 3 hours to reach its antibacterial effect.&lt;ref name='Owens'/&gt;

===Metabolism and Excretion===
Urine specimens showed that no other microbiologically active metabolites were present except cephaloridine and that cephaloridine is excreted unchanged. 
Renal clearances were reported to be 146-280 ml/min, a plasma clearance of 167 ml/min/1,73m2 and a renal clearance of 125 ml/min/1,73m2. A serum half-life of 1,1-1,5 hour and a volume of distribution of 16 liters were reported.&lt;ref name='Charles'/&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===
Pharmacokinetic analysis is not possible because appropriate data is not published. The physicochemical properties are almost the same as the other cephalosporins, therefore the pharmacokinetics are comparable.&lt;ref name='Charles'/&gt;

==Adverse effects==

===Toxicity===
Cephaloridine can cause kidney damage in humans, since it is actively taken up from the blood by the proximal tubular cells via an organic anion transporter (OAT) in the basolateral membrane. Organic anions are secreted through the proximal tubular cells via unidirectional transcellular transport. The organic anions are taken up from the blood into the cells across the basolateral membrane and extruded across the brush border membrane into the tubular fluid.&lt;ref name="Takeda"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takeda M, Tojo A, Sekine T, Hosoyamada M, Kanai Y, Endou H | title = Role of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) in cephaloridine (CER)-induced nephrotoxicity | journal = Kidney International | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 2128–36 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10594788 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1755.1999.00789.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cephaloridine is a substrate for [[OAT1]] and thus can be transported into the proximal tubular cells, which form the renal cortex.&lt;ref name="Timbrell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Timbrell|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles of Biochemical Toxicology|date=2008|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=978-0-8493-7302-2|edition=4th | pages = 332–335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs, however, cannot move readily across the luminal membrane since it is a zwitterion. The cationic group (pyridinium ring) of the compound probably inhibits the efflux through the membrane.&lt;ref name="Timbrell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schrier|first1=Robert W.|title=Diseases of the kidney &amp; urinary tract.|date=2007|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-7817-9307-0|edition=8th | pages = 1042 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ERqtOZMAiw0C&amp;pg=PA1041&amp;lpg=PA1041&amp;dq=Cephaloridine+reactivity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tZiGHvQKvZ&amp;sig=NBOP6rdDIOHJZ0bovIuCwZBkqVQ&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=mGpeTcTeLs-UOsPGyekN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Cephaloridine%20reactivity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an accumulation of cephaloridine in the renal cortex of the kidney, causing damage and necrosis of the S2 segment of the tubule.&lt;ref name="Takeda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Timbrell"/&gt; However, there are no adverse effects on renal function if serum levels of cephaloridine are maintained between 20 and 80 μg/ml.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winchester JF, Kennedy AC | title = Absence of nephrotoxicity during cephaloridine therapy for urinary-tract infection | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 7776 | pages = 514–6 | date = September 1972 | pmid = 4115572 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(72)91908-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
Cephaloridine is excreted in the urine without undergoing [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=pmid7178754&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turck M | title = Cephalosporins and related antibiotics: an overview | journal = Reviews of Infectious Diseases | volume = 4 Suppl | pages = S281-7 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7178754 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/4.Supplement_2.S281 | jstor = 4452882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It inhibits organic ion transport in the kidney. This process is preceded by the lipid peroxidation. Thereafter, probably a combination of events, such as formation of a reactive intermediate, a free radical and stimulation of lipid peroxidation, lead to peroxidative damage to cell membranes and mitochondria. It is not yet clear whether metabolic activation by [[cytochrome P450|cytochromes P-450]], chemical rearrangements, reductive activation or all these actions are involved.&lt;ref name="Timbrell"/&gt;

The hypotheses made about the mechanism of action causing the toxiciy of cephaloridine are: 
*	Reactive metabolites are formed by cytochromes P-450 or emerge from destabilization of the β –lactam ring. Metabolic activation of the drugs might take place via cytochromes P-450, producing reactive metabolites. This hypothesis is based on the behaviour of some inhibitors of CYP450, which decrease the toxicity, and some inducers of the monooxygenases which increase toxicity. It could also be possible that a reactive intermediate is formed due to the unstable β -lactam ring.&lt;ref name="Timbrell"/&gt; The pyridinium side-group of cephaloridine has unstable bonds to the core of the compound (in comparison with other cephalosporins). When this side-group leaves, the β –lactam ring is destabalized by intramolecular electron shifts.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tune BM | title = Nephrotoxicity of beta-lactam antibiotics: mechanisms and strategies for prevention | journal = Pediatric Nephrology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 768–72 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9438663 | doi = 10.1007/s004670050386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the leaving group creates a reactive product.
*	Both lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress can cause membrane damage. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress take place as lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde, have been detected. Reduced [[glutathione]] (GSH) and NADPH are both depleted. Consequently, GSSG cannot be reduced to GSH. This leads to an increased toxicity since oxidative stress cannot be reduced. In addition, nephrotoxicity is augmented by deficiency of [[selenium]] or [[tocopherol]].  The pyridinium side-group interacts with the reduced NADP in a redox cycle. It has been suggested that superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals may be formed and that lipid peroxidation could be responsible for the toxicity of cephaloridine.&lt;ref name="Timbrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt;
*	Damage to the mitochondria and intracellular respiratory processes and reduced mitochondrial respiration can cause nephrotoxicity. The previously mentioned damages have been detected after exposure to cephalosporins.&lt;ref name="Timbrell"/&gt; [[β-lactam antibiotics]] injure mitochondria by an attack on the metabolic substrate carriers of the inner membrane.&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt; Respiratory toxicity is caused by inactivation of mitochondrial anion substrate carriers.&lt;ref name="Takeda"/&gt;

===Symptoms of kidney damage caused by cephaloridine ===
Some symptoms caused by cephaloridine are: [[asymptomatic]], [[enzymuria]], [[proteinuria]], [[tubular necrosis]], increased urea level in blood, [[anemia]], increased hydrogen ion level in blood, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], increased blood pressure, increased blood electrolyte level, kidney dysfunction, kidney damage, impaired body water balance and impaired [[electrolyte]] balance.&lt;ref name="wrongdiagnosis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/k/kidney_damage_cephaloridine/intro.htm | title = Kidney damage -- Cephaloridine | work = RightDiagnosis | publisher = Health Grades Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications caused by cephaloridine===
Complications caused by the use of cephaloridine include seizures, coma, chronic kidney failure, acute kidney failure and death.&lt;ref name="wrongdiagnosis"/&gt;

===Treatment of kidney damage caused by cephaloridine===
The damage of the kidneys can be treated by removing the toxin from the body, monitoring and supporting kidney function (dialysis if necessary) and, in severe cases, kidney transplant. Supportive therapy in the acute phase can be done by fluid, electrolyte and hypertension management. Longer term management includes monitoring of renal function, close management of high blood pressure. Furthermore, dietary management may include protein and sodium management, adequate hydration and phosphate and potassium restriction. In case of chronic renal failure dietary management also includes erythropoietin agonists (since anaemia is associated with chronic renal failure), phosphate binders (in case of hyperphosphatemia), calcium supplements, Vitamin D supplements and sodium bicarbonate (to correct the acid-base disturbance).&lt;ref name="wrongdiagnosis"/&gt;

[[File:AR1520 and Shimmering Coronal Loops.ogv|thumb|Coronal loops.]]
[[File:Gradient Sun.ogv|thumb|Watch this movie to see how coronal loops on the Sun next to the more fuzzy areas in the lower solar atmosphere provide a dazzling show.]]
[[Image:Traceimage.jpg|thumb|Typical coronal loops observed by [[TRACE]].]]
[[File:4k video of the Sun's surface activity.ogv|thumb|This 4k video allows us a high-definition look at the complexity of activity occurring on the surface our parent star, the Sun. Coronal loops — linking areas of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere — enormous solar prominences and sunspots are all to be seen here.]]

'''Coronal loops''' form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the [[Sun]]. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic flux]] within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the [[solar cycle]]; it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with [[sunspots]] at their footpoints. The upwelling magnetic flux pushes through the [[photosphere]], exposing a cooler plasma in footpoints. This plasma is cooler because of the magnetic field radially directed which stop the convective process in these regions. Then heat can't be transported toward the surface by convection, and the contrast between the photosphere and this cooler plasma gives the impression of dark spots, or sunspots.

==Physical features==
[[Image:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A diagram showing the evolution of the solar magnetic flux over one solar cycle.]]
[[Image:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of the low [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], where many scales of coronal loops can be observed.]]

A coronal loop is magnetic [[flux]] fixed at both ends, threading through the solar body, protruding into the solar atmosphere. They are ideal structures to observe when trying to understand the transfer of energy from the solar body, through the transition region and into the corona.

Many scales of coronal loops exist, neighbouring open flux tubes that give way to the [[solar wind]] and reach far into the corona and heliosphere. Anchored in the photosphere (a rigid, [[magnetohydrodynamics|line-tied]], anchor is assumed where the high-β, external plasma holds the loop footpoints in place), coronal loops project through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], extending high into the [[corona]].

Also, coronal loops have a wide variety of temperatures along their lengths. Loops existing at temperatures below 1&amp;nbsp;MK are generally known as cool loops, those existing at around 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as warm loops, and those beyond 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as hot loops. Naturally, these different categories radiate at different wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Location===
Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface. Active regions on the solar surface take up small areas but produce the majority of activity and are often the source of flares and [[Coronal Mass Ejection]]s due to the [[Magnetic reconnection|intense magnetic field]] present. Active regions produce 82% of the total coronal heating energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The quiet Sun makes up the rest of the solar surface. The quiet Sun, although less active than active regions, is awash with [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] processes and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] events (bright points, [[nanoflares]] and jets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, the quiet Sun exists in regions of closed magnetic structures, and active regions are highly dynamic sources of explosive events. It is important to note that observations suggest the whole corona is massively populated by open and closed magnetic fieldlines.

===Coronal loops and the coronal heating problem===
[[Image:Energyfig.png|thumb|A modelled example of a quiescent coronal loop (energy contributions).]]

A closed fieldline does not constitute a coronal loop; however, closed flux must be ''filled with plasma'' before it can be called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000&amp;nbsp;K to well over 1&amp;nbsp;MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed by chromospheric plasma, protrude into the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.

The idea that the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating mechanism is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a ''chromospheric energization'' and ''coronal heating phenomenon'' possibly linked through a common mechanism.

==History of observations==

===1946–1975===
Many strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], MLSO, in [[Hawaii]]) and [[eclipse]] observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) [[Aerobee (rocket)|Aerobee]] rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, [[spectrogram]]s measured solar EUV and [[Lyman alpha|Lyman-α]] emissions. Basic [[X-ray]] observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The [[Skylark (rocket)|British Skylark rocket]] missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray [[spectrometer]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the period of 1962–1975, the satellite series [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, [[Skylab]] was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===1991–present day===
[[Image:Tracemosaic.jpg|thumb|Full-disk mosaic of the million-degree [[Sun]] by [[TRACE]].]]

The solar community was rocked by the launch of ''[[Yohkoh]]'' (Solar A) from [[Kagoshima Space Centre]] in August 1991. It was lost on 14 December 2001 due to battery failure but revolutionised X-ray observations in its decade of operations. ''Yohkoh'' (or ''Sunbeam'') orbited the Earth in an [[elliptical]] [[orbit]], observing X-ray and [[Gamma ray|γ-ray]] emissions from solar phenomena such as solar flares. ''Yohkoh'' carried four instruments. The Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), the Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS), the Soft X-Ray Telescope ([[Yohkoh|SXT]]) and the Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT) were operated by a consortium of scientists from Japan, the USA and the UK. Of particular interest is the [[Yohkoh|SXT]] instrument for observing X-ray-emitting coronal loops.

The SXT instrument observed X-rays in the 0.25–4.0&amp;nbsp;[[SI units|keV]] range, resolving solar features to 2.5 arc seconds with a temporal resolution of 0.5–2 seconds. SXT was sensitive to plasma in the 2–4&amp;nbsp;MK temperature range, making it an ideal observational platform to compare with data collected from [[TRACE]] coronal loops radiating in the EUV wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major step in solar physics came at the launch of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) in December 1995 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], USA. SOHO originally had an operational lifetime of two years. The mission was extended to March 2007 due to its resounding success, allowing SOHO to observe a complete 11-year solar cycle. SOHO continually faces the Sun holding a slow orbit around the First [[Lagrangian Point]] (L1), where the gravitational balance between the Sun and Earth provides a stable position for SOHO to orbit. SOHO is continually eclipsing the Sun from the Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometres.

SOHO is managed by scientists from the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and NASA. Containing more instruments than both TRACE and Yohkoh, this large solar mission was designed to look at the chain from the solar interior, the solar corona to the solar wind. SOHO has 12 instruments on board, including the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS), the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) and the UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS), which are all used extensively in the study of the transition region and corona.

The EIT instrument is used extensively in coronal loop observations. EIT images the transition region through to the inner corona by utilising four band passes, 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV and 304&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HeII, each corresponding to different EUV temperatures, probing the [[chromospheric network]] to the lower corona.

The [[TRACE|Transition Region And Coronal Explorer]] ([[TRACE]]) was launched in April 1998 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] as part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Small Explorer (SMEX) project. The small orbiting instrument has a 30×160&amp;nbsp;cm, 8.66&amp;nbsp;m focal length Cassegrain telescope with a 1200×1200px CCD detector. The timing of the launch was planned to coincide with the rising phase of the solar maximum. Observations of the transition region and lower corona could then be carried out in conjunction with SOHO to give an unprecedented view of the solar environment during this exciting phase of the solar cycle.

Due to the high spatial (1 arc second) and temporal resolution (1–5 seconds), TRACE has been able to capture highly detailed images of coronal structures, whilst SOHO provides the global (lower resolution) picture of the Sun. This campaign demonstrates the observatory's ability to track the evolution of steady-state (or [[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]) coronal loops. TRACE utilizes filters that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV, 1216&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HI, 1550&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;CIV and 1600&amp;nbsp;Å range. Of particular interest are the 171&amp;nbsp;Å, 195&amp;nbsp;Å and 284&amp;nbsp;Å band passes, as they are sensitive to the radiation emitted by quiescent coronal loops.

==Dynamic flows==
[[Image:SOLAR-B artists concept.jpg|thumb|The new solar observatory ''[[Hinode]]'' (Solar-B), launched September 2006, will observe the magnetic structure of the corona.]]

All of the above space missions have been highly successful in observing strong plasma flows and highly dynamic processes in coronal loops. For example, SUMER observations suggest flow velocities of 5–16&amp;nbsp;km/s in the solar disk, and other
joint SUMER/TRACE observations detect flows of 15–40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''The Dewey Loeffel Landfill''' is an [[Superfund|EPA superfund site]] located in [[Rensselaer County, New York]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the site was used as a disposal facility for more than 46,000 tons of industrial hazardous wastes, including solvents, waste oils, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), scrap materials, sludges and solids. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201218 |title=EPA Superfund Site Information |accessdate=2016-12-17 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hazardous substances, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PCBs, have migrated from the facility to underlying aquifers and downstream surface water bodies, resulting in contamination of groundwater, surface water, sediments and several species of fish. There is currently a ban on fish consumption in [[Nassau Lake]] and the impacted tributaries. Site investigations are underway to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and inform the development of permanent cleanup options for the site.

'''Direct Énergie''' is a [[France|French]] international [[electric utility]] company, which operates in the fields of [[electricity generation]] and [[electric distribution|distribution]], [[natural gas]], and [[renewable energy]]. Founded in France in 2003 as an alternative to the historic monopoly [[Électricité de France]], it is present in [[Belgium]] through the subsidiary Poweo.

The '''Energy Modeling Forum''' ('''EMF''') is a structured forum for discussing important issues in energy and the environment. The EMF was established in 1976 at [[Stanford University]]. The EMF works through a series of ad hoc working groups, each focussing on a particular corporate or policy decision. The EMF provides a non-partisan platform that ensures objective consideration of opposing views.  Participation is by invitation.

Since the late-1990s, the EMF has made contributions to the economics of [[climate change]], as witnessed in the reports of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and on [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment modeling]] more generally.

[[John Weyant]] is the current director of the EMF.

== Ethos ==

The EMF was convened in 1976 over concerns that the insights that large-scale [[energy modeling|energy models]] could provide [[policymaker]]s were being overshadowed by the "plethora of detailed quantitative results" being disseminated and discussed.&lt;ref name="huntington-etal-1982"/&gt;{{rp|449}}  As a result, the EMF sought to bring energy modelers together to provide a proper context for their work.  Indeed, the EMF was "formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis".&lt;ref name="huntington-etal-1982"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}  The EMF periodically establishes {{nowrap|ad hoc}} working groups to conduct studies on selected energy topics.  A working group then identifies relevant existing models and sets a series of tests to illuminate the basic structure and behavior of each model.  Results are compared and the strengths and weaknesses of each model is documented in a (as of 1982) freely available report.&lt;ref name="huntington-etal-1982"/&gt;

{{redirect2|Micro-erg|Ergs|the micro-electroretinogram|Electroretinography|other uses|Ergs (disambiguation)}}
The '''erg''' is a unit of [[energy]] and [[work (physics)|work]] equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s. It originated in the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) system of [[Units of measurement|unit]]s. It has the symbol ''erg''. The erg is not an [[SI unit]]. Its name is derived from ''ergon'' (’έργον), a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning ''work'' or ''task''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

An erg is the amount of work done by a force of one [[dyne]] exerted for a distance of one [[centimeter]]. In the CGS [[Unit of measurement#Base and derived units|base units]], it is equal to one [[gram]] centimeter-squared per [[second]]-squared (g·cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is thus equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s or 100 nanojoules ([[nanojoule|nJ]]) in [[SI]] units. An erg is approximately the amount of work done (or energy consumed) by one common house fly performing one "push up," the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up.&lt;ref name="Filippenko_2007"/&gt;

: 1 erg = 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Joule|J]] = 100 [[nanojoule|nJ]]
: 1 erg = 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;sn·m  = 100 psn·m = 100 pico[[sthène]]-metres
: 1 erg = 624.15 GeV = {{val|6.2415|e=11|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}}
: 1 erg = 1 [[dyne]] cm = 1 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==
In 1864, [[Rudolf Clausius]] proposed the Greek word (''{{lang|el|ἐργον}}'') ''ergon'' for the unit of energy, work and heat.&lt;ref name="Clausius_1867"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard_2002"/&gt; In 1873, a committee of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], including British physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] recommended the general adoption of the centimetre, the gramme, and the second as fundamental units ([[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|C.G.S. System of Units]]). To distinguish derived units, they recommended using the prefix "''C.G.S. unit of ...''" and requested that the word ''erg'' or ''ergon'' be strictly limited to refer to the ''C.G.S. unit of energy''.&lt;ref name="BSAS_1873"/&gt;

In 1922, chemist [[William Draper Harkins]] proposed the name [[micri-]]erg as a convenient unit to measure the [[surface energy]] of [[molecule]]s&lt;ref name="Jerrard_2012"/&gt; in [[surface chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Cardarelli_1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardarelli_2003"/&gt; It would equate to 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;erg,&lt;ref name="Jerrard_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harkins_1922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colloid_1925"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACh_1922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partington_1949"/&gt; the equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;joule.

The erg has not been a valid unit since 1 January 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6N68sMtqXSUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=1+January+1978,+erg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B9CAh-twZg&amp;sig=39mgg5AwR1hrUogLwhMk1nT-WuI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD88L4_rzdAhVIIsAKHeDCDskQ6AEwDXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1%20January%201978,%20erg&amp;f=false|title=Architects' Data|last=Neufert|first=Ernst|last2=Neufert|first2=Peter|last3=Kister|first3=Johannes|date=2012-03-26|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405192538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the EEC ratified a directive of 1971 which implemented the [[International System of Units|International System]] (SI) as agreed by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|General Conference of Weights and Measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=W.

{{infobox europium}}
'''Europium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Eu''' and [[atomic number]] 63. It was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Periodic Table: Europium |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a moderately hard, silvery [[metal]] which readily oxidizes in air and [[water]]. Being a typical member of the [[lanthanide]] series, europium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly [[redox|reducing]]. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe; only about {{val|5|e=-8}}% of all matter in the universe is europium.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

It crystallizes in a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] lattice.&lt;ref name=Holleman/&gt; Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled [[electron shell]]. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.&lt;ref name=Holleman/&gt;

Europium becomes a [[superconductor]] when it is cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.11.2836|title=Generalized phase diagram for the rare-earth elements: Calculations and correlations of bulk properties|date=1975|last1=Johansson|first1=Börje|last2=Rosengren|first2=Anders|journal=Physical Review B|volume=11|issue=8|pages=2836–2857|bibcode = 1975PhRvB..11.2836J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Pressure-Induced Superconducting State of Europium Metal at Low Temperatures| journal = Phys.

===Chemical properties===
Europium is the most reactive [[rare-earth element]]. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter-sized sample occurs within several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm|author=Hamric, David |date=November 2007 |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|work=elementsales.com|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of [[calcium]], and the reaction is
:2 Eu + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Eu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Because of the high reactivity, samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[europium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Eu + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Europium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form pale pink solutions of the hydrated Eu(III), which exist as a nonahydrate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/europium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Europium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Eu + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 18 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 [Eu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 {{chem|SO|4|2−}} + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Eu(II) vs. Eu(III)====
Although usually trivalent, europium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual to most [[lanthanide]]s, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an [[electron configuration]] 4''f''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; because the half-filled ''f''-shell gives more stability. In terms of size and [[coordination number]], europium(II) and [[barium]](II) are similar. For example, the sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/9780470132333.ch19|chapter = Europium(II) Salts|title = Inorganic Syntheses|date = 1946|last1 = Cooley|first1 = Robert A.|last2 = Yost|first2 = Don M.|last3 = Stone|first3 = Hosmer W.|isbn = 978-0-470-13233-3|volume = 2|pages = 69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the "negative [[europium anomaly]]", the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the [[chondrite|chondritic]] abundance. Bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other (trivalent) lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann|volume=31|page=199|last1=McGill|first1=Ian|contribution=Rare Earth Elements|doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_607}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of europium}}
Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu and &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, with &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu being the most abundant (52.2% [[natural abundance]]). While &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is stable, &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu was recently found to be unstable to [[alpha decay]] with [[half-life]] of {{val|5|+11|-3|e=18|ul=years}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Search for α decay of natural europium|author= Belli, P.|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2007.03.001|date=2007|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=789|pages=15–29|display-authors=1|last2=Bernabei|first2=R.|last3=Cappella|first3=F.|last4=Cerulli|first4=R.|last5=Dai|first5=C.|last6=Danevich|first6=F.|last7=Dangelo|first7=A.|last8=Incicchitti|first8=A.|last9=Kobychev|first9=V.|last10= Nagorny|first10= S.

S.|bibcode = 2007NuPhA.789...15B }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium. This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;150m&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=12.8 hours), &lt;sup&gt;152m1&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=9.3116 hours) and &lt;sup&gt;152m2&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=96 minutes).&lt;ref name="nucleonica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |author=Nucleonica |date=2007–2011 |work=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |publisher=Nucleonica |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary [[decay mode]] for isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is [[electron capture]], and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is [[beta minus decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu are isotopes of [[samarium]] (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of [[gadolinium]] (Gd).&lt;ref name="nucleonica" /&gt;

{{Medium-lived fission products}}
Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the [[fission product yield]]s of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for [[fission products]].

Like other [[lanthanide]]s, many isotopes, especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron-poor isotopes like &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, have high [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s for [[neutron capture]], often high enough to be [[neutron poison]]s.

&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is the [[beta decay]] product of [[samarium-151]], but since this has a long decay half-life and short mean time to neutron absorption, most &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Sm instead ends up as &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm.

&lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (half-life 13.516 years) and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (half-life 8.593 years) cannot be beta decay products because &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Sm are non-radioactive, but &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is the only long-lived "shielded" [[nuclide]], other than [[Caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]], to have a fission yield of more than 2.5 [[parts per million]] fissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/NuC/index.html Tables of Nuclear Data], Japan Atomic Energy Agency {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610213313/http://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/NuC/index.html |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger amount of &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is produced by [[neutron activation]] of a significant portion of the non-radioactive &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu; however, much of this is further converted to &lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu.

[[Eu-155|&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu]] (half-life 4.7612 years) has a fission yield of 330 parts per million (ppm) for [[uranium-235]] and [[thermal neutron]]s; most of it is transmuted to non-radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium-156 by the end of fuel [[burnup]].

Overall, europium is overshadowed by [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]] as a radiation hazard, and by samarium and others as a neutron poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.2172/759039|title = Neutron cross section evaluations of fission products below the fast energy region|date = 2000|last1 = Oh|first1 = S.

===Occurrence===
[[File:Monazit - Mosambik, O-Afrika.jpg|left|thumb|Monazite]]
Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being [[bastnäsite]], [[monazite]], [[xenotime]] and [[loparite-(Ce)]].&lt;ref name="Kirk"&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.120114201901021|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|volume = 14|chapter = Lanthanides|first1 = Patrick|last1 =Maestro|isbn = 978-0-471-23896-6|pages = 1096–1120}}&lt;/ref&gt; No europium-dominant minerals are known yet, despite of a single find of a tiny possible Eu–O or Eu–O–C system phase in the Moon's regolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare-earth elements is known as the [[europium anomaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OmUXW8pqUe8C&amp;pg=PA550|chapter = The Europium anomaly| pages = 550–553|title = Systematics and the properties of the lanthanides|isbn = 978-90-277-1613-2|last = Sinha|first= Shyama P.|author2 = Scientific Affairs Division, North Atlantic Treaty Organization|date = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in [[geochemistry]] and [[petrology]] to understand the processes that form [[igneous rocks]] (rocks that cooled from [[magma]] or [[lava]]). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.

Divalent europium (Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue [[fluorescence]] of some samples of the mineral [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The reduction from Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is induced by irradiation with energetic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00308116|title = Color centers, associated rare-earth ions and the origin of coloration in natural fluorites|date = 1978|last1 = Bill|first1 = H.|last2 = Calas|first2 = G.|journal = Physics and Chemistry of Minerals|volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 117–131|bibcode=1978PCM.....3..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most outstanding examples of this originated around [[Weardale]] and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that [[fluorescence]] was named after in 1852, although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Allen, Robert D. |url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM37/AM37_910.pdf|title=Variations in chemical and physical properties of fluorite|journal=Am.

==Production==
Europium is associated with the other [[rare-earth elements]] and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements is a step in the later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals [[bastnäsite]], [[loparite-(Ce)]], [[xenotime]], and [[monazite]] in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is a group of related fluorocarbonates, Ln(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(F,OH). Monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals {{chem|Ln|P|O|4}} (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except [[promethium]]), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is an orthophosphate (Y,Yb,Er,...)PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Monazite also contains [[thorium]] and [[yttrium]], which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by [[solvent extraction]]s or [[ion exchange chromatography]] yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of [[alkaline earth metal]]s and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate.&lt;ref name="GuptaL"&gt;{{cite journal| pages = 197–248|url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/imr/1992/00000037/00000001/art00015|title =Extractive metallurgy of rare earths|journal = International Materials Reviews|date = 1992|volume = 37|first1 = C.

Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the [[Mountain Pass rare earth mine]]. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.&lt;ref name="Kirk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0925-8388(96)02824-1| title = Loparite, a rare-earth ore (Ce, Na, Sr, Ca)(Ti, Nb, Ta, Fe+3)O3| date = 1997| last1 = Hedrick| first1 = J.| last2 = Sinha| first2 = S.| last3 = Kosynkin| first3 = V.| journal = Journal of Alloys and Compounds| volume = 250| pages = 467–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europium compounds tend to exist trivalent oxidation state under most conditions.  Commonly these compounds feature Eu(III) bound by 6–9 oxygenic ligands, typically water.  These compounds, the chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, are soluble in water or polar organic solvent.  Lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate-like ligands, e.g., [[Eufod]].

===Halides===
Europium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Eu + 3 X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 EuX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
This route gives white europium(III) fluoride (EuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), yellow [[europium(III) chloride]] (EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), gray [[europium(III) bromide]] (EuBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Europium also forms the corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), colorless europium(II) chloride (EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), colorless [[europium(II) bromide]] (EuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Holleman&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalcogenides and pnictides===
Europium forms stable compounds with all of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three [[oxide]]s are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), [[europium(III) oxide]] (Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[mixed-valency|mixed-valence]] oxide Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III).
Otherwise, the main chalcogenides are [[europium(II) sulfide]] (EuS), europium(II) selenide (EuSe) and europium(II) telluride (EuTe): all three of these are black solids. EuS is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/9780470132418.ch15|chapter = Europium (II) Sulfide|title = Inorganic Syntheses|date = 1967|last1 = Archer|first1 = R.

:Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 2 EuS + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + S
The main [[nitride]] is europium(III) nitride (EuN).

==History==
Although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late 1800s that the element was isolated. [[William Crookes]] observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 92772|pages = 411–414|last1 = Crookes|first1 = W.|authorlink=William Crookes|title = On the Phosphorescent Spectra of S δ  and Europium|volume = 76|issue = 511|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|date = 1905|bibcode = 1905RSPSA..76..411C|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1905.0043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europium was first found in 1892 by [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], who obtained basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or [[gadolinium]]. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Eugène-Anatole Demarçay]], who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it ''europium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30888/f1580.image| journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes rendus]]| first = Eugène-Anatole|last = Demarçay|title = Sur un nouvel élément l'europium|volume = 132|pages = 1484–1486|date = 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1751|title = The discovery of the elements.

When the europium-doped [[yttrium orthovanadate]] red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors,&lt;ref name="Sri1"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum03/IF6-03-Pages48-51.pdf | journal = The Electrochemical Society Interface | date = 2003 | pages = 48–51 | title =Phosphors | first1 =A. M. | last1= Srivastava | first2 = C. R. | last2=Ronda }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp [[bastnäsite]] deposit at the [[Mountain Pass rare earth mine]], [[California]], whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result.&lt;ref name="Sri1"/&gt; Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from [[Bayan Obo]], China, with an even "richer" europium content of 0.2%.

[[Frank Spedding]], celebrated for his development of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related the story of how&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1039/DF9490700214|title = Large-scale separation of rare-earth salts and the preparation of the pure metals|date = 1949|last1 = Spedding|first1 = Frank H.|journal = Discussions of the Faraday Society|volume = 7|pages = 214 | authorlink = Frank Spedding}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman had turned out to be [[Herbert Newby McCoy]], who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.&lt;ref name="McCoy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10269&amp;page=300–326|journal = Biographical Memoirs National Academy of Sciences|publisher = National Academy of Sciences|volume = 80|first = John D.|last = Corbett|title = Frank Harold Spedding|bibcode = 1986PhT....39e.106H|date = 1986|pages = 106|doi = 10.1063/1.2815016|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Aperture Grille.jpg|left|thumb|Europium is one of the elements involved in emitting red light in CRT televisions.]]
Relative to most other elements, commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized. Almost invariably, its phosphorescence is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.

It is a [[dopant]] in some types of [[glass]] in [[laser]]s and other optoelectronic devices. Europium oxide (Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is widely used as a red [[phosphor]] in [[Cathode ray tube|television sets]] and [[fluorescent lamps]], and as an activator for [[yttrium]]-based phosphors.&lt;ref name="Caro"&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=P4UCrfp_s0EC&amp;pg=PA323|pages = 323–325|chapter= Rare earths in luminescence|title =Rare earths|isbn =978-84-89784-33-8|last1 =Caro|first= Paul|date =1998-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aFbgmoyArYoC&amp;pg=PA159| pages = 159–171|chapter= Inorganic Phosphors|title = Chromic phenomena: technological applications of colour chemistry|isbn = 978-0-85404-474-0|author1 = Bamfield, Peter|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1&amp;nbsp;g of europium oxide.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ch. 1.7.10 Phosphors |url=http://vector.umd.edu/links_files/Extractive%20Metallurgy%20of%20Rare%20Earths%20(Gupta).pdf |title=Extractive metallurgy of rare earths |last1=Gupta |first1=C.

&lt;!--not an application: Due to its ability to absorb neutrons, it is also being studied for use in nuclear reactors.--&gt;

An application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes, such as [[Eufod|Eu(fod)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], as shift reagents in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectroscopy.

A recent (2015) application of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information for days at a time; these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk-like device and shipped around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-01-quantum-hard-breakthrough.html "Quantum hard drive breakthrough"].

There are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other [[heavy metals]].

In figure -a-, as the displacer moves from the cold compression space (2), to the hot expansion space (4) in figure -b-, the temperature of the gaseous working fluid is increased.

[[File:Liquid feedback fluidyne.svg|thumb|250px|schematic of a U-tube type Fluidyne engine.]][[File:Fluidyne3.svg|thumb|250px|A concentric-cylinder Fluidyne pumping engine. Topologically equivalent to a U-tube design.]]

A '''Fluidyne engine''' is an alpha or gamma type [[Stirling engine]] with one or more [[liquidpiston]]s. It contains a working [[gas]] (often [[air]]), and either two liquid pistons or one liquid piston and a displacer.

The engine was invented in 1969.&lt;ref name="orni_2011" /&gt;
The engine was patented in 1973 by the Atomic Energy Authority UK.&lt;ref name="GB1329567"&gt;[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19730912&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=1329567A&amp;KC=A# GB1329567 (A)  -  STIRLING CYCLE HEAT ENGINES]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orni_2011" /&gt;

== Engine operation ==
Working gas in the engine is heated, and this causes it to expand and push on the water column. This expansion cools the air which contracts, at the same time being pushed back by the weight of the displaced water column. The cycle then repeats.

The U-tube version has no moving parts in the engine other than the water and air, although there are two check valves in the pump. This engine operates at a natural resonance cycle that is "tuned" by adjusting the geometry, generally with a "tuning tube" of water.

== Engine as a pump ==
In the classic configuration, the work produced via the water pistons is integrated with a water pump. The simple pump is external to the engine, and consists of two [[check valve]]s, one on the intake and one on the outlet. In the engine, the loop of oscillating liquid can be thought of as acting as a displacer piston. The liquid in the single tube extending to the pump acts as the power piston. Traditionally the pump is open to the atmosphere, and the hydraulic head is small, so that the absolute engine pressure is close to [[atmospheric pressure]].&lt;ref name="orni_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/27113.pdf | title=Stirling Engines, and Irrigation Pumping | publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory | date=August 1987 | accessdate=August 6, 2011 | author=West,  C.

{{Story|date=October 2009}}

In [[materials science]], a '''Frank–Read source''' is a mechanism explaining the generation of multiple [[dislocation]]s in specific well-spaced [[Slip (materials science)|slip]] planes in [[crystal]]s when they are deformed. When a crystal is deformed, in order for slip to occur, dislocations must be generated in the material. This implies that, during deformation, dislocations must be primarily generated in these planes. [[Cold work]]ing of metal increases the number of dislocations by the Frank–Read mechanism. Higher dislocation density increases yield strength and causes [[work hardening]] of metals.

It was proposed by and named after British physicist [[Charles Frank (physicist)|Charles Frank]] and [[Thornton Read]].

==History==
Charles Frank detailed the history of the discovery from his perspective in ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=Frank1&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society A|Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |publisher=[[Royal Society|Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge]] |volume=371 |issue=1744 |title=The Beginnings of Solid State Physics |date=1980-06-10 |pages=136–138 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1980.0069|bibcode = 1980RSPSA.371..136. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950 [[Charles Frank (physicist)|Charles Frank]], who was then a research fellow in the physics department at the [[University of Bristol]], visited the United States to participate in a conference on crystal [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. Frank arrived in the United States well in advance of the conference to spend time at a naval laboratory and to give a lecture at [[Cornell University]]. When, during his travels in Pennsylvania, Frank visited Pittsburgh, he received a letter from fellow scientist [[John D. Eshelby|Jock Eshelby]] suggesting that he read a recent paper by [[Gunther Leibfried]].  Frank was supposed to board a train to Cornell to give his lecture at Cornell, but before departing for Cornell he went to the library at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] to obtain a copy of the paper. The library did not yet have the journal with Leibfried's paper, but the staff at the library believed that the journal could be in the recently arrived package from Germany.  Frank decided to wait for the library to open the package, which did indeed contain the journal. Upon reading the paper he took a train to Cornell, where he was told to pass the time until 5:00, as the faculty was in meeting. Frank decided to take a walk between 3:00 and 5:00. During those two hours, while considering the Leibfried paper, he formulated the theory for what was later named the Frank–Read source. A couple of days later, he traveled to the conference on crystal plasticity in Pittsburgh where he ran into [[Thorton Read]] in the hotel lobby. Upon encountering each other, the two scientists immediately discovered that they had come up with the same idea for dislocation generation almost simultaneously (Frank during his walk at Cornell, and Thornton Read during tea the previous Wednesday) and decided to write a joint paper on the topic. The mechanism for dislocation generation described in that paper&lt;ref name="FrankRead"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frank|first1=F. C.|first2=W. T.|last2= Read Jr|title=Multiplication Processes for Slow Moving Dislocations|journal=Physical Review|date=1950|volume=79|issue=4|pages=722-723|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.722|bibcode=1950PhRv...79..722F}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now known as the Frank–Read source.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Frank-Read Source.png|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Frank–Read source]]

The Frank–Read source is a mechanism based on dislocation multiplication in a slip plane under [[shear stress]].&lt;ref name=Hosford&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials
|first=William F. |last=Hosford |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-84670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;{{cite book |first=A. S. |last=Khan, A. S. |author2=Huang, S |title=Continuum Theory of Plasticity |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a straight dislocation in a crystal slip plane with its two ends, A and B, pinned. If a shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is exerted on the slip plane then a force &lt;math&gt;F=\tau \cdot bx &lt;/math&gt;, where ''b'' is the [[Burgers vector]] of the dislocation and ''x'' is the distance between the pinning sites A and B, is exerted on the dislocation line as a result of the shear stress. This force acts [[perpendicular]]ly to the line, inducing the dislocation to lengthen and curve into an arc. The bending force caused by the shear stress is opposed by the line [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the dislocation, which acts on each end of the dislocation along the direction of the dislocation line away from A and B with a magnitude of &lt;math&gt;Gb^2&lt;/math&gt;, where G is the [[shear modulus]]. If the dislocation bends, the ends of the dislocation make an angle with the horizontal between A and B, which gives the line tensions acting along the ends a [[Vertical direction|vertical]] [[Vector_component#Vector_components|component]] acting directly against the force induced by the shear stress. If sufficient shear stress is applied and the dislocation bends, the vertical component from the line tensions, which acts directly against the force caused by the shear stress, grows as the dislocation approaches a semicircular shape. When the dislocation becomes a semicircle, all of the line tension is acting against the bending force induced by the shear stress, because the line tension is perpendicular to the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] between A and B. For the dislocation to reach this point, it is thus evident that the equation:&lt;ref name=Hosford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F=\tau \cdot bx =2Gb^2&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied, and from this we can solve for the shear stress:&lt;ref name=Hosford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{2Gb} x &lt;/math&gt;

This is the stress required to generate dislocation from a Frank–Read source. If the shear stress increases any further and the dislocation passes the semicircular [[equilibrium state]], it will spontaneously continue to bend and grow, spiraling around the A and B pinning points, until the segments spiraling around the A and B pinning points collide and cancel. The process results in a dislocation loop around A and B in the slip plane which expands under continued shear stress, and also in a new dislocation line between A and B which, under renewed or continued shear, can continue to generate dislocation loops in the manner just described. A Frank–Read loop can thus generate many dislocations in a plane in a crystal under applied stress. The Frank–Read source mechanism explains why dislocations are primarily generated on certain slip planes; dislocations are primarily generated in just those planes with Frank–Read sources. It is important to note that if the shear stress does not exceed:&lt;ref name=Hosford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{2Gb} x &lt;/math&gt;

and the dislocation does not bend past the semicircular equilibrium state, it will not form a dislocation loop and instead revert to its original state.&lt;ref name=Hosford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

'''''Hellfighters''''' is a 1968 American [[action film]] starring [[John Wayne]] and featuring [[Katharine Ross]], [[Bruce Cabot]], [[Jim Hutton]], [[Jay C. Flippen]] and [[Vera Miles]]. The film, directed by [[Andrew V. McLaglen]], is about a group of [[oil well]] [[firefighter]]s, based loosely on the life of [[Red Adair]].  Adair, "Boots" Hansen, and "Coots" Matthews, who served as technical advisers on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/us/08matthews.html|newspaper=New York Times|title=Coots Matthews, Cantankerous Hellfighter, Dies at 86|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=7 April 2010|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hellfighters'' was for the most part negatively received.

==Plot==
Chance Buckman is the head of a [[Houston]]–based oil well firefighting outfit. With a team that includes Joe Horn, Greg Parker, and George Harris, Chance travels around the world putting out blazes at well heads from industrial accident, explosion or terrorist attack.  Chance enjoys the thrills, but longs for ex-wife Madelyn. She divorced him 20 years earlier, taking their daughter Letitia with her, because Madelyn could not bear to see her husband risk his life. Though they love each other, Madelyn could not deal with her terror that Chance might burn to death in a fire.

While extinguishing a burning wellhead, Chance suffers a near-fatal accident when he is crushed by a bulldozer blade. Against his wishes, his daughter Letitia (Tish) visits him in the hospital, summoned by his old friend and former firefighting partner Jack Lomax and fetched by Greg Parker in The Buckman Company's corporate jet. She also pursues Greg Parker to a well fire in Louisiana. (Greg has a notorious reputation for using fires to pick up women. Generally, any woman he takes to a fire ends up in bed with him.) In the case of Buckman's spitfire of a daughter, however, after considerable initial friction Greg and Tish fall in love and marry five days after their first meeting. In spite of Greg's reputation, Buckman comes to trust his daughter's choice and accepts Greg into the family. Madelyn, projecting her own fears onto her daughter, though gracious is rather less accepting, despite her liking for Greg.

Greg suspects that his new father-in-law is growing increasingly protective of him after the marriage in an effort to protect his daughter from heartbreak should her new husband be harmed or killed.  Tish wishes to see the fires that her husband and father fight, something that neither man encourages. Her father relents and allows her to accompany Greg into the field.

Chance, trying to re-unite with his ex-wife, leaves The Buckman Company to accept an executive position with his old friend Jack Lomax on the board of directors of Lomax Oil as a way to win her back. Chance gives his company to his son-in-law as a "wedding present", although Greg's pride compels him to tell Buckman he "doesn't want any gifts" and that he will "pay ''twice'' what it's worth." Greg and Tish begin traveling the world to put out oil fires. Soon the older couple announce that they will remarry, to the delight of Tish. Madelyn is happy to see her husband in a safe job, but before too long Chance becomes bored with corporate life and longs to be back in the field. As Jack Lomax earlier told Tish, "Your father is the best there is at what he does. No man can walk away from that."

Greg encounters problems with a fire in [[Venezuela]]:  five oil wells in a tight line burning all at once, further compounded by [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] who are trying to undermine the operation. He asks Chance to return and help fight the fire. Chance does so without hesitation. Buckman goes to Venezuela in an Texas Air National Guard transport full of firefighting gear, unaware that Madelyn and Tish have followed him to [[Caracas]]. Madelyn uses Jack Lomax's influence with the President of Venezuela to get herself and Tish to the oilfield where the fire is burning. Madelyn declares "This is it for me," in the sense that it will either make or break her ability to deal with the fires once and for all, fully aware that her relationship with Chance is on the line. 

The Hellfighters put out the fires with the help of the [[Venezuelan Army]] while under attack by rebel warplanes that strafe the oilfield. Madelyn explodes in anger at what she perceives as the Venezuelans' inability to protect the team from the unexpected air raid, railing at the Venezuelan army and civil officials for allowing the guerrillas to get close enough to attack. Chance pulls her away during her tirade.  She snaps, "Damned if I understand your attitude!", to which he replies, "It's very simple — you'll do." When Greg asks Tish for her take on it, she just smiles and says, "I think we ought to get her a tin hat," referring to the bright red hardhats with The Buckman Company logo worn by the Hellfighters.

==Production==
[[Red Adair]] had been fighting fires since 1946. He was well known in the industry but became more generally known in 1962 after extinguishing a Sahara Desert gas well fire called "the devil's cigarette lighter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Years of Tackling Oil Disasters: Red Adair: a 'Hellfighter' With Flair|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1 May 1977|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clair Huffaker wrote an original script which was bought by Universal in February 1967. Robert Arthur was assigned to produce. John Wayne agreed to star in November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petula to Play in 'Finian's Rainbow'|last=Martin|first= Betty|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=20 Feb 1967|page= d25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Hellfighters' for Wayne|last=Martin|first= Betty|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=29 Nov 1967|page= c29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wayne made the film after ''The Green Berets''. It reteamed him with Andrew McLaglen, with whom Wayne had made ''[[McLintock!]]'' (1963), and Jim Hutton, who had been in ''The Green Berets''.

This was the first film for which Wayne was paid $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holleran|first=Scott|title=Interview: Director Andrew V. McLaglen|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/features/?id=2317|website=boxofficemojo.com|date=23 May 2007|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of Wayne's films around this time it was not made for his own company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here Come The Duke|first=Norma Lee|last= Browning|newspaper= Chicago Tribune|date=13 Apr 1969|page= k20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much of the filming took place in Houston, Texas and the surrounding area; headquarters for the Red Adair Company, Inc.

During filming, a catering truck crashed into Wayne's trailer while the star was inside. However, he was not injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wayne Avoids Injury in Truck Crash|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1968|page= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Hellfighters'' received mostly negative reviews, garnering a 14% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hellfighters/ |title=Hellfighters (1968) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' described the film as a "slow moving, talkative, badly plotted bore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681227/REVIEWS/812270301/1023 |title=Hellfighters |last=Ebert |first=Robert |date=1968-12-27 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A. H. Weiler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that John Wayne made "actionful, if not stirringly meaningful, child's play of exotic disasters" and remarked that "the unrestrained cast and director maintain a welcome sense of humor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9904E3DC1E30EE3BBC4E53DFB4668382679EDE |title=Hellfighters (1968) |date=February 6, 1969 |last=Weiler |first=A.

A '''horse-drawn vehicle''' is a mechanized piece of equipment pulled by one [[horse]] or by a team of horses. These vehicles typically had two or four wheels and were used to carry passengers and/or a load. They were once common worldwide, but they have mostly been replaced by [[automobile]]s and other forms of self-propelled transport.

==General==
[[File:Carro a quattro ruote - Còren del Valento-Naquane R 62 - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|[[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Petroglyph]] of a chariot in ''Parco Nazionale Delle incision rupestri di Naquane'', [[Capo di Ponte]].]]
A two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle is a [[cart]] (see various types below, both for carrying people and for goods). Four-wheeled vehicles have many names – one for heavy loads is most commonly called a [[wagon]].

Very light carts and wagons can also be pulled by donkeys (much smaller than [[horse]]s), [[pony|ponies]] or [[mule]]s. Other smaller animals are occasionally used, such as large [[dog]]s, [[llama]]s and [[goat]]s (see [[draught animal]]s).

Heavy wagons, carts and agricultural implements can also be pulled by other large [[draught animal]]s such as [[ox]]en, [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[yak]]s or even [[camel]]s and [[elephant]]s.

Vehicles pulled by one animal (or by animals in a single file) have two ''shafts'' which attach either side of the rearmost animal (the ''wheel'' animal or ''wheeler'').  Two animals in single file are referred to as a ''[[tandem]]'' arrangement, and three as a ''randem''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/randem|title=Definition of RANDEM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Vehicles which are pulled by a [[2 (number)|pair]] (or by a [[team]] of several pairs) have a ''pole'' which attaches between the wheel pair. Other arrangements are also possible, for example, three or more abreast (a ''[[troika (driving)|troika]]''), a wheel pair with a single lead animal (a "unicorn"), or a wheel pair with three lead animals abreast (a "pickaxe"). Very heavy loads sometimes had an additional team behind to slow the vehicle down steep hills. Sometimes at a steep hill with frequent traffic, such a team would be hired to passing wagons to help them up or down the hill. Horse-drawn carriages have been in use for at least 3,500 years.

Two-wheeled vehicles are balanced by the distribution of weight of the load (driver, passengers, and goods) over the axle, and then held level by the animal – this means that the shafts (or sometimes a pole for two animals) must be fixed rigidly to the vehicle's body. Four-wheeled vehicles remain level on their own, and so the shafts or pole are hinged vertically, allowing them to rise and fall with the movement of the animals. A four-wheeled vehicle is also steered by the shafts or pole, which are attached to the front axle; this swivels on a ''turntable'' or "fifth wheel" beneath the vehicle.

From the 15th century drivers of carts were known as Carmen, and in London were represented by the [[Worshipful Company of Carmen]].

The '''Kahn system''' is an industrial construction technique for reinforcement of buildings that was engineered and patented by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn]]. The Kahn system is an industrial construction design using the Kahn Trussed Bar as the bases. This steel bar was a new type of reinforcing bar used in concrete and had unique engineered features to distribute stress.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|pp=31&amp;ndash;33}}

Kahn saw problems with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction at the end of the 19th century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would break adhesion. The main reinforcing bar had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the reinforcing bar beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength.&lt;ref name="KahnEngineer"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1q2nc2q9;NAAN=13030&amp;chunk.id=ss1.4 | title=The George H. Scripps Memorial Marine Biological Laboratory of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego | publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography | author=Shor, George G. | author2=Shor, Elizabeth Noble | author3=Spiess, Fred Noel | journal=SIO Reference | year=1979 | issue=79–26 | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A reinforced beam bar in the early 1900s consisted of a plain straight steel in the center of a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The plain straight steel was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced beam bar. But in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}}

Kahn discovered that concrete was much stronger in compression than tension, so devised the idea of distributing the stresses.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf | title=Engineering Industrial Architecture: Albert Kahn and the Trussed Concrete Steel Company | publisher=University of Michigan | date=June 24, 2013 | author=Sedlar, Frank | journal=2012–2013 MLibrary Undergraduate Research Award Maize Award for Single-Term  Projects | format=PDF | ref={{sfnRef|Sedlar|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did scientific engineering experiments and created the concept that if the steel beam edges were bent back at a 45-degree angle forming projecting tabs or "wings" before going into the molded form led to better stress distribution.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Skinner|2y=1997|2p=13}} The winged sheared members are cut and turned up to form an angle from the thin edge of the steel bar but are still permanently attached.{{sfn|Webb|Gibson|1916|p=48}} When the wet concrete mixture was poured and hardened there was no slippage of the steel beam because the tension stress is distributed throughout the beam.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=11}}

This new style constructed steel beam was called "the Kahn trussed bar", sometimes shortened to just "the Kahn bar".{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=31}} The trussed steel bar had bent-up "wings" on each side. The "wings" on the steel bar provided 20–30% additional strength to a reinforced concrete beam over the old technology of plain straight smooth steel bars or rods.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}} The primary concept of the Kahn bar was that it gave reinforcement in both the vertical and horizontal plane while it simplified construction.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Buel|2y=1904|2p=337}} The principal lines of shear stresses in a beam average a 45-degree angle, so the angled "wings" transmitted the tension down to the main reinforcing steel beam.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;

The Kahn bar is of high grade steel with an elastic limit of 42,000 pounds and tensile strength of 70,000 pounds per square inch.{{sfn|Trussed Concrete Steel Company|1910|p=8}} Kahn formed his own company in 1903 called [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]] (aka "Truscon Steel Company") located in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], to manufacture these special steel bars used in reinforced concrete beams.{{sfnm|1a1=Matuz|1y=2002|1p=47|2a1=Ferry|2y=1970|2p=10}}

Another new engineered innovation of Kahn was steel forms built with "ribs" instead of "wings". It was a derivative from Kahn's 1903 patent. This advanced technology was marketed by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company with the brand name of [[Hy-Rib]] products.{{sfn|Hughes|Allen|Hecht|2001|p=142}} The Kahn System of reinforced concrete is the first time an automobile factory was constructed; it was for [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard automobile factory plant building number 10]] designed in 1903–05.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31|ps=. "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete."}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=31|ps=. "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."}}&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-0420?rgn=main;view=text | title=Albert Kahn papers | publisher=University of Michigan | work=Bentley Historical Library | date=January 14, 2004 | accessdate=July 30, 2014 | author=Kahn, Albert | editor=Bund, Sally Linvill | quote=Kahn's first factory built of reinforced concrete in Detroit was Building Number 10 for the Packard Motor Company (1905).}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=10|ps=. "The first reinforced concrete factory in the country, designed by Albert Kahn, made its appearance in 1903."}} The Kahn system of reinforcement products had been used in over 1500 buildings in the United States by 1907.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=38}}

==Kahn trussed bar applications==
Kahn's patented invention is a steel bar of 45-degree diagonal "wings" as several minor members that are rigidly attached to the main member.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=37}} The idea of the "wing" technique is that the stresses are distributed throughout the main reinforced beam.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt; The steel then doesn't slip within the hardened concrete.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">[[File:Lasis.jpg|thumb|380px|Preparation of nanoparticles by Laser in Solution]]
'''Laser ablation synthesis in solution''' ('''LASiS''') is a commonly used method for obtaining [[colloid]]al solution of [[nanoparticle]]s in a variety of [[solvent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b900654k| pmid = 19440607| title = Laser ablation synthesis in solution and size manipulation of noble metal nanoparticles| journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics| volume = 11| issue = 20| pages = 3805-21| year = 2009| last1 = Amendola| first1 = Vincenzo| last2 = Meneghetti| first2 = Moreno| bibcode = 2009PCCP...11.3805A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jp0605092| pmid = 16599492| title = Laser Ablation Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles in Organic Solvents| journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B| volume = 110| issue = 14| pages = 7232-7| year = 2006| last1 = Amendola| first1 = Vincenzo| last2 = Polizzi| first2 = Stefano| last3 = Meneghetti| first3 = Moreno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the LASiS method, nanoparticles are produced during the condensation of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] plume formed by the [[laser ablation]] of a bulk metal plate dipped in a liquid solution. LASiS is usually considered a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] physical approach. In the past years, laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) emerged as a reliable alternative to traditional [[chemical reduction]] methods for obtaining [[noble metal]] nanoparticles (NMNp). 

LASiS is a technique for the synthesis of stable NMNp in water or in organic solvents, which does not need [[stabilizing molecule]]s or other [[chemical]]s. The so obtained NMNp are highly available for further functionalization or can be used wherever unprotected metal nanoparticles are desired. 

[[Surface functionalization]] of NMNp can be monitored in real time by [[UV-visible spectroscopy]] of the [[plasmon resonance]]. However, LASiS has some limitations in the size control of NMNp, which can be overcome by laser treatments of NMNp.

Plotted in principal stress space. The red plane represents a meridional plane and the yellow plane an octahedral plane.]]

'''Lode coordinates''' &lt;math&gt;(z,r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; or '''Haigh–Westergaard coordinates''' &lt;math&gt;(\xi,\rho,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="aci"&gt;Menetrey, P.H., Willam, K.J., 1995, ''Triaxial Failure Criterion for Concrete and Its Generalization'', ACI Structural Journal&lt;/ref&gt; are a set of [[Invariants of tensors|tensor invariants]] that span the space of [[Real number|real]], [[Symmetric tensor|symmetric]], second-order, 3-dimensional [[tensor]]s and are [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] with respect to [[Stress space|principal stress space]]. This [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]] [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] coordinate system is named in honor of the German scientist Dr. Walter Lode because of his seminal paper written in 1926 describing the effect of the middle principal stress on metal plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;Lode, W. (1926). '' Versuche über den Einfuss der mittleren Hauptspannung auf das Fliessen der Metalle Eisen Kupfer und Nickel''. Zeitung Phys., vol. 36, pp. 913–939.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of sets of tensor invariants are the set of principal stresses &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3)&lt;/math&gt; or the set of mechanics invariants &lt;math&gt;(I_1, J_2, J_3)&lt;/math&gt;. The Lode coordinate system can be described as a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] within principal stress space with a coincident origin and the z-axis parallel to the vector &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)=(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Mechanics invariants==
The Lode coordinates are most easily computed using the mechanics [[Invariants of tensors|invariants]]. These invariants are a mixture of the invariants of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|stress deviator]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt;, and are given by&lt;ref name="asaro2006"&gt;Asaro, R.J., Lubarda, V.A., 2006, ''Mechanics of Solids and Materials'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_1 = \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2) - \frac{1}{3}\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})^2\right] = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\lVert \boldsymbol{s} \rVert^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J_3 = \mathrm{det}(\boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{1}{3}\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written equivalently in [[Einstein notation]]

:&lt;math&gt; I_1 = \sigma_{kk} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2) - \frac{1}{3}\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})^2\right] = \frac{1}{2}s_{ij}s_{ji} = \frac{1}{2}s_{ij}s_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J_3 = \frac{1}{6}\epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{pqr}\sigma_{ip}\sigma_{jq}\sigma_{kr} = \frac{1}{3}s_{ij}s_{jk}s_{ki} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (or permutation symbol) and the last two forms for &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent because &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric (&lt;math&gt;s_{ij}=s_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;).

The gradients of these invariants&lt;ref name="kayenta"&gt;Brannon, R.M., 2009, ''KAYENTA: Theory and User's Guide'', Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial I_1}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \boldsymbol{I} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial J_2}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \boldsymbol{s} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \frac{\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\right)}{3}\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial J_3}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \boldsymbol{T} = \boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s} - \frac{2J_2}{3}\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the 3x3 [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}&lt;/math&gt; is called the Hill tensor.

==Axial coordinate &lt;math&gt;(z)&lt;/math&gt;==

The &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate is found by calculating the magnitude of the [[orthogonal projection]] of the stress state onto the [[Hydrostatic pressure#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic]] axis.

:&lt;math&gt;z =  \boldsymbol{E_z} \colon \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \frac{\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{I_1}{\sqrt{3}} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{E_z} = \frac{\boldsymbol{I}}{\lVert \boldsymbol{I}\rVert} = \frac{\boldsymbol{I}}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the unit normal in the direction of the hydrostatic axis.

==Radial coordinate &lt;math&gt;(r)&lt;/math&gt;==

The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate is found by calculating the magnitude of the stress deviator (the [[orthogonal projection]] of the stress state into the deviatoric plane).

:&lt;math&gt;r = \boldsymbol{E_r}\colon \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \lVert \boldsymbol{s} \rVert = \sqrt{2 J_2} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E_r} = \frac{\boldsymbol{s}}{\lVert \boldsymbol{s} \rVert}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="50%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation
|-
|The relation that &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{2J_2}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by expanding the relation

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{\boldsymbol{s}}{\lVert \boldsymbol{s} \rVert}\colon\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

and writing &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the isotropic and deviatoric parts while expanding the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{\boldsymbol{s}}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s}}} \colon \left( \boldsymbol{s} + z \boldsymbol{E_z} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s}}} \left( \boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s} + z \boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{E_z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E_z}&lt;/math&gt; is isotropic and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is deviatoric, their product is zero. Which leaves us with

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{\boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s}}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s}}} = \sqrt{\boldsymbol{s}\colon\boldsymbol{s}} &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the identity &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\colon\boldsymbol{B} = \mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{A}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{B}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and using the definition of &lt;math&gt;J_2=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{s}\cdot\boldsymbol{s}\right)} = \sqrt{2 J_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

is a unit tensor in the direction of the radial component.

==Lode angle – angular coordinate &lt;math&gt;(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;==
[[File:Lode Angle Approximation Comparison.svg|right|400px|thumb|This plot demonstrates that an intuitive approximation for the Lode angle is the relative position of the middle principal stress &lt;math&gt;\lambda_m&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the low and high principal stresses.]]

The Lode angle can be considered, rather loosely, a measure of loading type. The Lode angle varies with respect to the middle [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] of the stress. There are many definitions of Lode angle that each utilize different trigonometric functions: the positive sine,&lt;ref name=chak&gt;Chakrabarty, J., 2006, ''Theory of Plasticity: Third edition'', Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; negative sine,&lt;ref name="neto2008"&gt;de Souza Neto, E.A., Peric, D., Owen, D.R.J., 2008, ''Computational Methods for Plasticity'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; and positive cosine&lt;ref name="han1985"&gt;Han, D.J., Chen, W.F., 1985, ''A Nonuniform Hardening Plasticity Model for Concrete Materials'', Mechanics of Materials&lt;/ref&gt; (here denoted &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bar{\theta}_s&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_c&lt;/math&gt;, respectively)

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(3\theta_s) = -\sin(3\bar{\theta}_{s}) = \cos(3\theta_c) = \frac{J_3}{2}\left(\frac{3}{J_2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and are related by

:&lt;math&gt; \theta_s = \frac{\pi}{6} - \theta_c 
        \qquad \qquad
        \theta_s = -\bar{\theta}_s
&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="50%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation
|-
|The relation between &lt;math&gt;\theta_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; can be shown by applying a trigonometric identity relating sine and cosine by a shift

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(3\theta_c)=\sin(3\theta_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos(3\theta_c)=\sin\left(\left(3\theta_s - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos(3\theta_c) = \cos\left(3\theta_s - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

Because cosine is an [[Even and odd functions|even function]] and the range of the [[Arccosine|inverse cosine]] is usually &lt;math&gt;0\leq\cos^{-1}(\theta)\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; we take the negative possible value for the &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; term, thus ensuring that &lt;math&gt;\theta_c&lt;/math&gt; is positive.

:&lt;math&gt; 3\theta_c = \pm \left( 3\theta_s - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta_c = \frac{\pi}{6} - \theta_s &lt;/math&gt;
|}

These definitions are all defined for a range of &lt;math&gt;\pi/3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Meridional profile==

[[File:plasticity models meridional profile.svg|right|400px|thumb|This plot shows a typical meridional profile of several plasticity models: [[von Mises yield criterion|von Mises]], [[Drucker-Prager yield criterion|linear Drucker–Prager]], [[Mohr-Coulomb theory|Mohr–Coulomb]], [[Gurson yield criterion|Gurson]], and [[Yield surface#Bigoni.E2.80.93Piccolroaz yield surface|Bigoni–Piccolroaz]]. The upper portion of the plot depicts yield surface behavior in triaxial extension and the lower portion depicts yield surface behavior in triaxial compression.]]

The [[Zonal and meridional|meridional]] profile is a 2D plot of &lt;math&gt;(z,r)&lt;/math&gt; holding &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; constant and is sometimes plotted using scalar multiples of &lt;math&gt;(z,r)&lt;/math&gt;. It is commonly used to demonstrate the pressure dependence of a [[yield surface]] or the pressure-shear trajectory of a stress path. Because &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is [[Non-negative#non-negative and non-positive|non-negative]] the plot usually omits the negative portion of the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-axis, but can be included to illustrate effects at opposing Lode angles (usually triaxial extension and triaxial compression).

One of the benefits of plotting the meridional profile with &lt;math&gt;(z,r)&lt;/math&gt; is that it is a geometrically accurate depiction of the yield surface.&lt;ref name="brannon2007"/&gt; If a non-isomorphic pair is used for the meridional profile then the normal to the yield surface will not appear normal in the meridional profile. Any pair of coordinates that differ from &lt;math&gt;(z,r)&lt;/math&gt; by constant multiples of equal absolute value are also isomorphic with respect to principal stress space. As an example, pressure &lt;math&gt;p=-I1/3&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Von Mises stress]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v = \sqrt{3J_2}&lt;/math&gt; are not an isomorphic coordinate pair and, therefore, distort the yield surface because

:&lt;math&gt; p = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}z &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} r &lt;/math&gt;

and, finally, &lt;math&gt; |-1/\sqrt{3}| \neq |\sqrt{3/2}|&lt;/math&gt;.

==Octahedral profile==

[[File:plasticity models octahedral profile.svg|right|400px|thumb|This plot shows a typical octahedral profile of several plasticity models: [[von Mises yield criterion|von Mises]], [[Drucker-Prager yield criterion|linear Drucker–Prager]], [[Mohr-Coulomb theory|Mohr–Coulomb]], [[Gurson yield criterion|Gurson]], and [[Yield surface#Bigoni.E2.80.93Piccolroaz yield surface|Bigoni–Piccolroaz]]. This plot has omitted Lode angle values in favor of loading descriptions because of the preponderance of definitions of the Lode angle. The radial coordinate is &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{2J_2}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The octahedral profile is a 2D plot of &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; holding &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; constant. Plotting the yield surface in the octahedral plane demonstrates the level of Lode angle dependence. The octahedral plane is sometimes referred to as the 'pi plane'&lt;ref&gt;Lubliner, J., 1990, ''Plasticity Theory'', Pearson Education&lt;/ref&gt; or 'deviatoric plane'.&lt;ref&gt;Chaboche, J.L., 2008, ''A review of some plasticity and viscoplasticity theories'', Int. J. Plasticity&lt;/ref&gt;

The octahedral profile is not necessarily constant for different values of pressure with the notable exceptions of the [[von Mises yield criterion]] and the [[Tresca yield criterion#Tresca yield surface|Tresca yield criterion]] which are constant for all values of pressure.

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Quasiparticles}}
A '''magnon''' is a [[quasiparticle]], a [[collective excitation]] of the [[electron]]s' [[spin (physics)|spin]] structure in a [[crystal lattice]].  In the equivalent wave picture of quantum mechanics, a magnon can be viewed as a quantized [[spin wave]].  Magnons carry a fixed amount of [[energy]] and [[Crystal momentum|lattice momentum]], and are spin-1, indicating they obey [[boson]] behavior.

==Brief history==
The concept of a magnon was introduced in 1930 by [[Felix Bloch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloch|first=F.|title=Zur Theorie des Ferromagnetismus|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01339661|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|language=de|volume=61|issue=3-4|pages=206–219|doi=10.1007/BF01339661|issn=0044-3328|bibcode=1930ZPhy...61..206B}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to explain the reduction of the [[spontaneous magnetization]] in a [[ferromagnet]]. At [[absolute zero]] temperature (0 K), a [[Heisenberg ferromagnet]] reaches the state of lowest energy (so-called [[ground state]]), in which all of the atomic spins (and hence [[magnetic moment]]s) point in the same direction.  As the temperature increases, more and more spins deviate randomly from the alignment, increasing the internal energy and reducing the net magnetization.  If one views the perfectly magnetized state at zero temperature as the [[vacuum state]] of the ferromagnet, the low-temperature state with a few misaligned spins can be viewed as a gas of quasiparticles, in this case magnons. Each magnon reduces the total spin along the direction of magnetization by one unit of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (reduced Planck's constant) and the magnetization by &lt;math&gt;\gamma\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]].  This leads to Bloch's law for the temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization:

&lt;math&gt;M(T) = M_0 \left[1 - \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^{3/2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is the (material dependent) critical temperature, and &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the spontaneous magnetization.

The quantitative theory of magnons, quantized [[spin wave]]s, was developed further by [[Theodore Holstein]], [[Henry Primakoff]] (1940), and [[Freeman Dyson]] (1956). Using the [[second quantization]] formalism they showed that magnons behave as weakly interacting quasiparticles obeying [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] ([[bosons]]).  A comprehensive treatment can be found in the solid state textbook by [[Charles Kittel]] or the early review article by Van Kranendonk and Van Vleck.

Direct experimental detection of magnons by inelastic [[neutron scattering]] in ferrite was achieved in 1957 by [[Bertram Brockhouse]].  Since then magnons have been detected in [[ferromagnet]]s, [[ferrimagnet]]s, and [[antiferromagnet]]s.

The fact that magnons obey the Bose–Einstein statistics was confirmed by the light scattering experiments done during the 1960s through the 1980s.  Classical theory predicts equal intensity of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines. However, the scattering showed that if the magnon energy is comparable to or smaller than the thermal energy, or &lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega  &lt; k_B T&lt;/math&gt;, then the Stokes line becomes more intense, as follows from Bose–Einstein statistics. [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] of magnons was proven in an antiferromagnet at low temperatures by Nikuni ''et al.'' and in a ferrimagnet by Demokritov ''et al.'' at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bose–Einstein condensation of quasi-equilibrium magnons at room temperature under pumping|last = |first = |date = 28 September 2006|journal = Nature |doi = 10.1038/nature05117|pmid = 17006509|access-date = |bibcode = 2006Natur.443..430D |volume=443 |pages=430–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Uchida ''et al.'' reported the generation of spin currents by surface plasmon resonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Generation of spin currents by surface plasmon resonance|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150108/ncomms6910/full/ncomms6910.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = January 8, 2015|pmc = 4354158|pmid = 25569821|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms6910|first = K.|last = Uchida|first2 = H.|last2 = Adachi|first3 = D.|last3 = Kikuchi|first4 = S.|last4 = Ito|first5 = Z.|last5 = Qiu|first6 = S.|last6 = Maekawa|first7 = E.|last7 = Saitoh|arxiv = 1308.3532 |bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E5910U|pages=5910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramagnons==
Paramagnons are magnons in magnetic materials which are in their high temperature, disordered ([[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]]) phase. For low enough temperatures, the local atomic [[magnetic moment]]s (spins) in [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] (FM) or [[Antiferromagnetism|anti-ferromagnetic]] (AFM) compounds will become ordered. Small oscillations of the moments around their natural direction will propagate as [[wave]]s (magnons). At temperatures higher than the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical temperature]], long range order is lost, but spins will still align locally in patches, allowing for spin waves to propagate for short distances. These waves are known as a paramagnon, and undergo [[Diffusion|diffusive]] (instead of [[Ballistic conduction|ballistic]] or long range) transport.

The concept was first proposed based on the spin fluctuations in [[transition metal]]s, by Berk and Schrieffer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berk|first=N. F.|date=1966-01-01|title=Effect of Ferromagnetic Spin Correlations on Superconductivity|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.433|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=17|issue=8|pages=433–435|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.433|bibcode=1966PhRvL..17..433B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doniach and Engelsberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doniach|first=S.|date=1966-01-01|title=Low-Temperature Properties of Nearly Ferromagnetic Fermi Liquids|url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.750|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=17|issue=14|pages=750–753|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.750|bibcode=1966PhRvL..17..750D}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain additional repulsion between electrons in some metals, which reduces the critical temperature for [[superconductivity]].

== Properties ==
[[Spin wave|Magnon behavior]] can be studied with a variety of scattering techniques. Magnons behave as a Bose gas with no chemical potential. Microwave pumping can be used to excite spin waves and create additional non-equilibrium magnons which thermalize into [[phonon]]s. At a critical density, a condensate is formed, which appears as the emission of monochromatic microwaves.  This microwave source can be tuned with an applied magnetic field.

The '''March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter''' was a powerful [[nor'easter]] that caused major impacts in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]], [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Southeastern United States]]. It originated as the northernmost low of a [[stationary front]] over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and brought hurricane-force winds to coastal [[New England]] before gradually moving out to sea by March 3. Producing over {{convert|2|ft|in}} of [[snow]] in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in [[Upstate New York]]. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as [[Hurricane Sandy]].

Although the most severe damage was caused by flooding as well as snow, unusually high tides and storm surges along the coast, wind and downed trees caused massive inland power outages,&lt;ref name="FritzNortheaster"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fritz|first1=Angela|title=Nor’easter forecast to topple flood record in Boston as winds push 80 mph|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/03/02/updates-winds-are-howling-and-the-water-is-rising-as-noreaster-bears-down/|accessdate=March 2, 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KarimiWarning"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karimi|first1=Faith|title='Bomb cyclone' forms as flood threat sparks 'LIFE &amp; DEATH' warning|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/us/weather-bomb-cyclone/index.html|accessdate=March 2, 2018|publisher=CNN|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodsNortheast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woods|first1=Amanda|title=Another bomb cyclone batters the Northeast|url=https://nypost.com/2018/03/02/another-bomb-cyclone-batters-the-northeast/|accessdate=March 2, 2018|publisher=New York Post|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the number of outages as high as 1.9 million at one point.&lt;ref name="Nor'easter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salisburypost.com/2018/03/03/noreaster-hits-east-coast-grounds-flights-and-halts-trains-at-least-5-dead/|title=Nor’easter hits East Coast, grounds flights and halts trains; at least 5 dead|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Salisbury Post]]|date=March 3, 2018|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 4, at least 9 people are known to have been killed as a result of the storm, five from falling trees or branches.&lt;ref name="Nor'easter"/&gt; Recovery efforts were later hampered as a [[March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter|second nor'easter]] began to impact the area just a few days after the first one struck.

==Meteorological history==
A [[stationary front]] was draped over the central [[United States]] on the last day of February 2018. During this time period, [[2017–18 North American winter#Late February flooding|dangerous flash flooding occurred]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/28/2018&amp;selmap=2018022812&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 12:00 UTC on 2/28/2018|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=February 28, 2018|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, one of the northernmost lows split from the boundary and began tracking northwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/28/2018&amp;selmap=2018022812&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 12:00 UTC on 2/28/2018|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking into colder air near the border between the U.S and Canada, snow broke out in the eastern half of the [[Midwest]]; the [[Weather Prediction Center]] (WPC) began issuing storm summaries later that day.&lt;ref name="march1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 1 for the Ohio Valley into the Northeast Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm10/stormsum_1.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 1, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnight into the early morning hours of March 2, a new low formed and rapidly strengthened off the coast of [[New Jersey]], while snow began to slowly increase in coverage near [[Pennsylvania]] and southern [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="march2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 2 for Great Lakes to New England Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm10/stormsum_2.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 2, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winds also increased as the pressure gradient of the system increased, with gusts reaching as high as {{convert|80–90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in some areas. Gradually, the storm also began to move out to sea, with the precipitation shield of the system receding from the coast. Consequently, by the early morning hours of March 3, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the storm after it moved far enough away from the East Coast, while also maintaining peak intensity.&lt;ref name="march6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 7 for Great Lakes to New England Winter Storm with Coastal Wind and Rain |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm10/stormsum_7.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 2, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system weakened over the next few days, before it split into two systems on March 5, one of which became a hurricane-force low.

'''NLM CityHopper Flight 431''' refers to a [[Fokker F28 Fellowship|Fokker F-28-4000]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] PH-CHI, that was due to operate an international scheduled [[Rotterdam]]–[[Eindhoven]]–[[Hamburg]] passenger service. On 6 October 1981, the aircraft encountered [[severe weather]] on the first leg, minutes after [[takeoff|taking off]] from [[Rotterdam Airport]], and crashed {{convert|15|mi}} south-southeast of Rotterdam. All 17 occupants of the aircraft&amp;nbsp;– 13 passengers and crew of 4 – perished in the accident.&lt;ref name="FI1982" /&gt;{{rp|183}}&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 19811006-0|accessdate= 14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved in the accident was a [[Fokker F28 Fellowship#Variants|Fokker F28-4000]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] PH-CHI, that was built in 1979 with [[Manufacturer's serial number|c/n]] 1141. At the time of the accident the airframe had accumulated 4,485 flight hours and 5,997 cycles.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

== Description of the accident ==
[[File:NLM CityHopper F-28-4000 PH-CHI LFSB Jun 1979.png|thumb|260px|PH-CHI, the aircraft involved in the accident, is seen here at [[Euroairport]]. (1979)]]
During the weather briefing 44 minutes before takeoff, the crew was apprised to an area of strong [[thunderstorm]]s with 3/8 (37.5%) sky coverage of [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] at a [[Cloud base|base]] of {{convert|1200|ft}}, south-southwest winds {{convert|15|to|25|kn}} strong, and {{convert|5|km}} visibility at Rotterdam Airport.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; The aircraft [[takeoff|took off]] at 5:04&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central European Time|CET]] (UTC +1) from Rotterdam Airport.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; The crew noted heavy rain in thunderstorms on the airplane's weather avoidance radar at 5:09&amp;nbsp;p.m., receiving clearance to avoid the area.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; At 5:12&amp;nbsp;p.m. the aircraft entered a [[tornado]] while flying through clouds.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; The weather system the aircraft entered into was apparently the same "tornado-like" system that [[Zeeland]] locals described as being responsible for considerable property damage.&lt;ref name="F.28 crashes in bad weather" /&gt; Meteorologically, these vortices are indeed tornadoes, and the disintegrating airliner was seen exiting cloud cover. A police officer first photographed the tornado, then smoke from the burning plane a few minutes later. An investigation concluded that a sharp increase in altitude registered on the altimeter was not a change in altitude, rather a pressure drop associated with the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Grazulis |first = Thomas P. |authorlink = Thomas P.

'''Otto Fuel II''' is a [[monopropellant]] used to drive [[torpedo]]es and other weapon systems. It is not related to the [[Otto cycle]].

==Properties==
Otto fuel II is a distinct-smelling,{{how|date=November 2017}} reddish-orange, oily liquid that is a mixture of three synthetic substances: [[propylene glycol dinitrate]] (the major component), [[2-Nitrodiphenylamine|2-nitrodiphenylamine]], and [[dibutyl sebacate]].&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=780&amp;tid=152 | title=Toxic Substances Portal - Otto Fuel II and its Components | publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry | accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not need exposure to any [[oxidant]] to ignite and release energy, as its three components will react among themselves whenever vaporised and heated. Needing no oxidants and being a stable substance makes Otto Fuel II ideal for use in the constrained environment of a submarine. Although the fuel can be made to explode, this requires extreme conditions (such that it can be regarded as practically stable). The [[vapour pressure]] of the fuel is low (i.e., it is not volatile), minimising toxic hazards. Finally, the fuel's [[energy density]] far surpasses the capacity of the [[electric battery]] used in other torpedoes, maximising range.

==Major ingredients==
Named after its inventor, Otto Reitlinger, Otto Fuel II consists of the nitrated [[ester]] explosive [[propellant]] propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), to which a [[Phlegmatized|desensitizer]] (dibutyl sebacate) and a [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]] (2-nitrodiphenylamine) have been added. The chief component, propylene glycol dinitrate, accounts for approximately 76% of the mixture, while dibutyl sebacate and 2-nitrodiphenylamine account for approximately 22.5% and 1.5% (by weight), respectively.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal current use of propylene glycol dinitrate is as a propellant in Otto Fuel II. [[Nitrate]]s of [[polyhydric alcohol]]s such as this have been used in medicine for the treatment of [[angina pectoris]], and as [[explosive]]s since the mid-nineteenth century.

In addition to its use by the [[United States Navy]] as a stabilizer in the manufacture of Otto Fuel II, 2-nitrodiphenylamine is employed for similar purposes by the [[United States Army]] in the manufacture of double base solid propellants. It also has civilian applications as a [[solvent dye]].

Dibutyl sebacate is a desensitizer in Otto Fuel II. However, its major use is as a [[plasticizer]] in production of plastics, namely [[cellulose acetate butyrate]], [[cellulose acetate propionate]], [[polyvinyl butyral]], [[polystyrene]], and many [[synthetic rubber]]s. It can be used for plastics in use in the food [[packaging and labelling|packaging]] industry. It is also used as a [[lubricant|lubricating ingredient]] in shaving lotions, and a flavoring additive in [[non-alcoholic beverage]]s, [[ice cream]], ices, candy, and baked goods.

==Toxicity==
Otto Fuel II is a toxic substance found in EPA's National Priorities List. Ingestion of contaminated food or direct exposure at worksites can cause headaches, poor eye–hand coordination, eye irritation, congested noses, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;   It can be  deadly if inhaled from a fuel spill/torpedo leak.  An MSA Demand Mask is mandatory for cleanup/mitigation efforts.

The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to natural science:

'''[[Natural science]]''' &amp;ndash; a major branch of [[science]] that tries to explain, and predict, nature's phenomena based on [[empirical evidence]]. In natural science, [[hypothesis]] must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: [[life science]], and [[physical science]]. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

== What type of thing is natural science? ==

Natural science can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[Outline of science|science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Natural sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, Gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

== Branches of natural science ==

===Physical science===
*[[Outline of physical science|Physical science]] – branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences". However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example).

====Physics====
** [[Outline of physics|Physics]] – physical science that studies matter and its motion through space-time, and related concepts such as energy and force
*** [[Acoustics]] – study of mechanical waves in solids, liquids, and gases (such as vibration and sound)
*** [[Agrophysics]] – study of physics applied to [[agroecosystems]]
**** [[Soil physics]] – study of soil physical properties and processes.
*** [[Astrophysics]] – study of the physical aspects of celestial objects
***[[Outline of astronomy|Astronomy]] – studies the universe beyond Earth, including its formation and development, and the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects (such as galaxies, planets, etc.) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as the cosmic background radiation).
**** [[Astrodynamics]] – application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft.
**** [[Astrometry]] – branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestially  bodies.
**** [[Cosmology]] – discipline that deals with the nature of the Universe as a whole.
**** [[Extragalactic astronomy]] – branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside our own Milky Way Galaxy
**** [[Galactic astronomy]] – study of our own Milky Way galaxy and all its contents.
**** [[Physical cosmology]] – study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its formation and evolution.
**** [[Planetary science]] – scientific study of planets (including Earth), moons, and planetary systems, in particular those of the Solar System and the processes that form them.
**** [[Astronomy#Stellar astronomy|Stellar astronomy]] – natural science that deals with the study of celestial objects (such as stars, planets, comets, nebulae, star clusters and galaxies) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as cosmic background radiation)
*** [[Atmospheric physics]] – study of the application of physics to the atmosphere
*** [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]] – study of how matter and light interact
*** [[Biophysics]] – study of physical processes relating to biology
**** [[Medical physics]] – application of physics concepts, theories and methods to medicine.
**** [[Neurophysics]] – branch of biophysics dealing with the nervous system.
*** [[Chemical physics]] – branch of physics that studies chemical processes from the point of view of physics.

'''Polydioxanone''' ('''PDO''', '''PDS''') or '''poly-''p''-dioxanone''' is a colorless, [[crystallinity|crystalline]], [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] synthetic [[polymer]].

==Chemistry==
Chemically, polydioxanone is a polymer of multiple repeating [[ether]]-[[ester]] units. It is obtained by [[ring-opening polymerization]] of the monomer [[p-dioxanone|''p''-dioxanone]]. The process requires heat and an [[organometallic]] [[catalyst]] like [[zirconium]] [[acetylacetone]] or [[zinc]] L-lactate. It is characterized by a [[glass transition temperature]] in the range of &amp;minus;10 and 0&amp;nbsp;°C and a crystallinity of about 55%. For the production of sutures, polydioxanone is generally [[extrusion|extruded]] into [[fiber]]s, however care should be taken to process the polymer to the lowest possible temperature, in order to avoid its spontaneous depolymerization back to the monomer. The ether [[oxygen]] group in the backbone of the polymer chain is responsible for its flexibility.

[[Image:Pdo synthesis.png|frame|center|Ring opening polymerization of ''p''-dioxanone to polydioxanone]]

==Medical use==
'''Polydioxanone'''  is used for [[biomedical]] applications, particularly in the preparation of [[surgical suture]]s. Other biomedical applications include [[orthopedics]], [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[plastic surgery]], [[drug delivery]], [[cardiovascular]] applications, and [[tissue engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boland | first = Eugene D. |author2=Coleman Branch D. |author3=Barnes Catherine P. |author4=Simpson David G. |author5=Wnek Gary E. |author6= Bowlin Gary L.  | title = Electrospinning polydioxanone for biomedical applications | journal = [[Acta Biomaterialia]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–123 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] |date=January 2005 | pmid = 16701785 | doi = 10.1016/j.actbio.2004.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Middleton | first = J. |author2=A.

It is degraded by hydrolysis, and the end products are mainly excreted in urine, the remainder being eliminated by digestive or exhaled as [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The biomaterial is completely reabsorbed in 6 months and can be seen only a minimal foreign body reaction tissue in the vicinity of the implant. Materials made of PDS can be sterilized with [[ethylene oxide]].&lt;ref name="Nita"&gt;{{cite journal

==Configuration index&lt;ref name = "IUPAC inorganic"/&gt;==
The first step in determining the configuration index is to assign a priority number to each coordinating ligand according to the [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules]], (CIP rules). The preferred ligand takes the lowest priority number. For example, of the ligands acetonitrile, chloride ion and pyridine thepriority number assigned are chloride, 1; acetonitrile,2; pyridene,3.  Each coordination type has a different procedure for specifying the configuration index and these are outlined in below.

=== T shaped (''TS''-3) ===
The configuration index is a single digit which is defined as the priority number of the ligand on the stem of the "T".

=== Seesaw (''SS''- 4) ===
The configuration index  has two digits which are the  priority numbers of the ligands separated by the largest  angle. The lowest priority number of the pair is quoted first.

=== Square planar (''SP''-4) ===
The configuration index is a single digit which is the priority number of the ligand ''trans'' to the highest priority ligand. (If there are two possibilities the principle of trans difference is applied). As an example, (acetonitrile)dichlorido(pyridine)platinum(II) complex where the Cl ligands may be ''trans'' or ''cis'' to one another.&lt;br /&gt;
The ligand priority numbers are, applying the [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules|CIP]] rules:
*two chlorides of priority number 1
*acetonitrile priority 2
*pyridine priority 3
In the trans case the configuration index is 1 giving the name(''SP''-4-1)-(acetonitrile)dichlorido(pyridine)platinum(II).&lt;br /&gt;
In the ''cis'' case  both of the organic ligands are ''trans'' to a chloride so to choose the trans difference is considered and the greater is between 1 and three therefore the name is (''SP''-4-3)-(acetonitrile)dichlorido(pyridine)platinum(II).

=== Octahedral (''OC''-6) ===
The configuration index has two digits. The first digit is the priority number of the ligand trans to the highest priority ligand. This pair is then used to define the reference axis of the octahedron. The second digit is the priority number of the ligand ''trans'' to the highest priority ligand in the plane perpendicular to the reference axis.

=== Square pyramidal (''SPY''-4) ===
The configuration index  is a single digit which is the priority number of the ligand ''trans'' to the ligand of lowest priority in the plane perpendicular to the 4 fold axis. (If there is more than one choice then the highest numerical value second digit is taken.) NB this procedure gives the same result as ''SP''-4, however in this case the polyhedral symbol specifies that the complex is non-planar.

===Square pyramidal (''SPY''-5)===
This is a two digit  the first digit is the priority number of the ligand on the fourfold (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) axis of the idealised pyramid the second digit is the priority number of the ligand trans to  ligand of lowest priority in the plane perpendicular to the 4 fold axis. (If there is more than one choice then the highest numerical value second digit  is taken.)

===Trigonal bipyramidal (''TBPY''-5)===
The configuration index consists of two digits which are the priority numbers of the ligands on the threefold rotation axis. The lowest numerical value is cited first.

===Other bipyramidal structures (''PBPY''-7, ''HBPY''-8 and ''HBPY''-9)===

The configuration index consists of two segments separated by a hyphen. The first segment consists of two digits which are the priority numbers of the ligands on the five, six or sevenfold rotation axis. The lowest numerical value is cited first.

The second segment consists of 5, 6 or 7 digits respectively. The lowest priority number is the first digit followed by the digits of the other atoms in the plane. The clockwise and anticlockwise sequences are compared and the one that yields the lowest numerical sequence is chosen.

'''Raum Energy Inc.''' was a company based in [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, Canada which designed and manufactured small-scale [[wind turbine]]s, grid-tie inverter and battery charge controller systems.  These systems, which could run off of either wind or photovoltaic generated power, were specifically designed for use with residential-scale applications.  The company's 1.3&amp;nbsp;kW turbine was one of the first systems setup for testing at [[Canada]]'s Wind Energy Institute for to participate in a national study into the reliability and performance of small-scale generator systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weican.ca/news/2008/080925-WEICan-begins-first-testing-program-with-Raum.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611133308/http://www.weican.ca/news/2008/080925-WEICan-begins-first-testing-program-with-Raum.php |archivedate=2009-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's flagship system combined a 3.5&amp;nbsp;kW turbine with a grid-tie inverter or battery charge controller and could generate 6,000&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs of energy annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/business/story.html?id=aebde93e-28a6-4f7f-8b53-51f64357a287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raumenergy.com/3.5kW_Spec_Sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715155147/http://www.raumenergy.com/3.5kW_Spec_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was set to also begin testing at WEICAN in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weican.ca/news/2010/100127-WEICan-Testing-Raum-3-5.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212952/http://www.weican.ca/news/2010/100127-WEICan-Testing-Raum-3-5.php |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9815">On a steam locomotive, the '''reversing gear''' is used to control the direction of travel of the locomotive. It also adjusts the [[Cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]] of the steam locomotive.

==Reversing lever==

This is the most common form of reverser. It consists of a long lever mounted, parallel to the direction of travel, on the driver’s side of the cab. It has a handle and sprung trigger at the top and is pivoted at the bottom so as to pass between two notched sector plates. The [[reversing rod]], which connects to the [[valve gear]], is attached to this lever, either above or below the pivot, in such a position as to give good leverage. A square pin is arranged so as to engage with the notches in the plates and hold the lever in the desired position when the trigger is released.

The advantages of this design are that change between forward and reverse gear can be made very quickly as is needed in, for example, a shunting engine. Disadvantages are that, because the lever must rest at one of the notches, fine adjustment of the cutoff to offer best running and economy is not possible. On large locomotives it can be difficult to prevent the mechanism from jumping into full forward gear (“nose-diving”) when adjusting the cutoff once the locomotive has gathered speed: with such engines it was the practice of drivers to select an appropriate degree of cutoff before opening the [[Steam_locomotive_components|regulator]] and to leave it in that position for the duration of the journey.

==Screw reverser==

[[Image:Stephenson link valve gear.jpg|thumb|250px|Diagram of [[Stephenson valve gear]] controlled by a screw reverser]]In this mechanism the reversing rod is controlled by a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a locking lever to prevent creep and there is an indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit.  On locomotives fitted with [[Railway air brake|Westinghouse air brake]] equipment and [[Stephenson valve gear]], it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied to one side of the piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Power reverse gear===


With larger engines, the linkages involved in controlling cutoff and direction grew progressively heavier and there was a need for power assistance in adjusting them.  Steam (or later, compressed air) powered reversing gear was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Typically, the operator worked a valve that admitted steam to one side or the other of a cylinder connected to the reversing mechanism until the indicator showed the intended position.  A second mechanism, usually a piston in an oil-filled cylinder held in position by closing a control cock, was required to keep the linkages in place. The first locomotive engineer to fit such a device was [[James Stirling (1835-1917)|James Stirling]] of the [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="CanestrariGreggio1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canestrari|first1=Guido|last2=Greggio|first2=Luciano|title=Steam locomotives|year=1985|publisher=Crescent books|location=Avenel, New Jersey|isbn=0-517-48366-1|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several engineers then tried them, including [[William Dean (engineer)|William Dean]] of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] and [[Vincent Raven]] of the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]], but they found them little to their liking, mainly because of maintenance difficulties: any oil leakage from the locking cylinder, either through the [[stuffing box|piston gland]] or the cock, allowed the mechanism to creep, or worse “nose-dive”, into full forward gear while running. Stirling moved to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] and [[Harry Smith Wainwright]], his successor with that company,  incorporated them into most of his designs, which were in production about thirty years after Stirling’s innovation. Later still the forward-looking [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]] fitted them to his famous [[SR Merchant Navy Class|Merchant Navy Class]] of locomotives, but they were mostly removed at rebuild.

Henszey's reversing gear, patented in 1882, illustrates a typical early solution.&lt;ref&gt;William P. Henszey, Reversing-Gear for Locomotives, [https://www.google.com/patents/US259538 U.S. Patent 259,538], June 13, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;  Henszey's device consists of two [[piston]]s mounted on a single piston rod. Both pistons are double-ended. One is a steam piston to move the rod as required.  The other, containing oil, holds the rod in a fixed position when the steam is turned off.  Control is by a small three-way steam valve (“forward”, “stop”, “back”) and a separate indicator showing the position of the rod and thus the percentage of cutoff in use. When the steam valve is at “stop”, an [[tap (valve)|oil cock]] connecting the two ends of the locking piston is also closed, thus holding the mechanism in position. The piston rod connects by levers to the reversing gear, which operates in the usual way, according to the type of valve gear in use.

[[Image:Powerreverser.JPG|thumb|250px|Steam reverser on a Southern Railway 2-8-0.]]

The Ragonnet power reverse, patented in 1909, was a true [[feedback]] controlled [[servomechanism]].  The power reverse amplified small motions of reversing lever in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction.&lt;ref&gt;Eugine L. Ragonnet, Controlling Mechanism for Locomotives, [https://www.google.com/patents/US930225 U.S. Patent 930,225], Aug. 9, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob H Yoder, Locomotive Valves and Valve Gears, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKV-AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;pg=PA131 ], Van Nostrand, New York, 1917; page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''servomotor'' was explicitly used by the developers of some later power reverse mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln A. Lang, Servo Motor Mechanism, [https://www.google.com/patents/US1480940 U.S. Patent 1,480,940], Jan 15, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of feedback control in these later power reverse mechanisms eliminated the need for a second cylinder for a hydraulic locking mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position.

The development of [[articulated locomotive]]s was a major impetus to the development of power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of reverse gear, instead of just one on a simple locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;George R. Henderson, Recent Locomotive Development, Paper 90,[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyVLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA491 Transactions of the International Engineering Congress -- Railway Engineering], San Francisco, Sept. 20-25, 1915; page 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles McShane, Locomotive Power Reverse Gears,[https://books.google.com/books?id=XsBKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413 The Locomotive Up to Date], Griffin &amp; Winters, 1921; 413.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] used the Ragonnet reversing gear, and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features.  In British use, locking cylinders remained in use.  The Hadfield reversing gear, patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet reversing gear with added locking cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;James Hadfield, Hydraulic Locking Cylinder for Locomotive Reversing Gear, [https://www.google.com/patents/US2523696 U.S. Patent 2,523,696], Sept. 26, 1950 (Oct. 7, 1944 in Great Britain).&lt;/ref&gt;
Most [[Garratt|Beyer Garratt]] locomotives used the Hadfield system.

Many American locomotives were built, or retro-fitted, with  power reverse, e.g. [[PRR K4s]], [[PRR N1s]], [[PRR B6]], [[PRR L1s]].

===Enginemen's terminology===

In the UK, a screw reverser is sometimes called a ''bacon slicer'', particularly the type fitted to BR Standard locomotives. In the US, a reversing lever is called a ''[[Johnson bar (vehicle)|Johnson bar]]''.

'''[[Jonkheer]] Sebastiaan Bowier''' (born August 23, 1987) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cyclist.

In September 2013 he achieved a speed of {{convert|133.78|km/h}} in a [[Human-powered land vehicle|human powered vehicle]] (HPV), breaking the previous world record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24133410 |title=Dutch cyclist claims new world speed record in Nevada |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Power Team==
Bowier has been a member of the Human Power Team since 2011. In 2011 he won the Battle Mountain race, but failed to break the world record, instead taking the European and Dutch records with a speed of {{convert|129|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="sebbow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hptdelft.nl/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=224 |title=Sebastiaan Bowier |publisher=Human Power Team Delft and Amsterdam |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was for the second year running the strongest cyclist during selection, and both an experienced recumbent rider and road cyclist.&lt;ref name="sebbow"/&gt;

==Record attempt==
On 15 September 2013, Bowier broke the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] record, previously set by Canadian [[Sam Whittingham]] in 2009, by {{convert|0.6|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="road.cc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://road.cc/content/news/94198-sebastien-bowier-sets-new-human-powered-vehicle-record-nevada |title=Sebastiaan Bowier sets new human-powered vehicle record in Nevada |last=MacMichael |first=Simon |work=road.cc |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of {{convert|133.78|km/h}} was achieved over a {{convert|200|m}} stretch of road in [[Battle Mountain, Nevada]], on a [[recumbent bicycle]] named VeloX3, designed by students from the [[Delft University of Technology]] and the [[VU University Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="road.cc"/&gt; He required a run-up of {{convert|8|km}} before setting the record.&lt;ref name="sky"/&gt;

===Vehicle===
[[File:VeloX3.jpg|thumb|VeloX3]]
The [[VeloX3]] bicycle he used has a profiled carbon fibre shell covered with the same type of coating used on Formula One cars.&lt;ref name="sky"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1143040/cyclist-sebastiaan-bowier-breaks-speed-record |title=Cyclist Sebastiaan Bowier Breaks Speed Record |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |work=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It experiences approximately one-tenth of the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a conventional [[bicycle]], and uses a camera on the top for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/dutch-team-aiming-to-break-human-powered-speed-record-35231/ |title=Dutch team aiming to break Human Powered speed record |last=Jones |first=Jeff |work=BikeRadar |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that hard pedalling led to deformation of the shell, which had to be corrected before the record could be set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/world-human-powered-vehicle-speed-record-upped-to-8313mph-38440/ |title=World human powered vehicle speed record upped to 83.13mph |last=Dansie |first=Sam |work=BikeRadar |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new shells were used for the racing, with parts from the testing vehicles being reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hptdelft.nl/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=470:the-velox3-is-ready-for-testing&amp;catid=:blog |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927185833/http://www.hptdelft.nl/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=470:the-velox3-is-ready-for-testing&amp;catid=:blog |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2013 |title=The VeloX3 is ready for testing! |publisher=Human Power Team Delft and Amsterdam |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SmILE''' is a showcase [[car]] designed for [[Greenpeace]] in 1996 to demonstrate how [[fuel efficient]] a car can be. The name stands for "'''Sm'''all, '''I'''ntelligent, '''L'''ight, '''E'''fficient'. It is based on the [[Renault Twingo]], halving its fuel consumption to 3.3 [[Fuel economy in automobiles|l/100km]] (30 km/l or 85 mpg (imperial) / 68 mpg (US)). 

An important issue in the design was that it should use off-the-shelf technology (parts and know-how). As a result, in mass production it should not cost significantly more than a 'heavier' equivalent. The engine should even be cheaper because it is made of fewer parts. However, parts that would be more expensive are [[supercharging]] (be it [[pressure wave supercharger]] or [[turbo-supercharger]]) and the wheels and the wheel suspension, which  are made of aluminium. 

The major changes made to the Twingo are:
* 23% lighter (650 [[kg]] instead of 845 kg):
** 80 kg less because of a smaller engine and lighter peripherals (battery, radiator and exhaust system)
** 80 kg less in vehicle interior and chassis through lighter seat structures ([[aluminium]] / [[plastic]]) and lighter metals for wheel suspensions, drum brakes, brake calliper and rims. To keep the cost down, no exotic materials (such as [[titanium]] screws or carbon gear boxes) were used.
** lighter wheels, which also have a rolling resistance that is 35% lower.
* Less air resistance, with a 30% improvement in the wind tunnel (C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; value ([[drag coefficient]]) down from 0.37 to 0.25)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/climate/smile/tech/table.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927234909/http://archive.greenpeace.org/climate/smile/tech/table.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A smaller and more efficient engine: a supercharged [[Flat-twin engine|flat-twin]], [[four-stroke engine]] with [[four-valve]] technology in a [[Flat engine#Boxer engines|boxer]] arrangement. A maximum [[torque]] of 75 [[N·m]] results from a [[swept volume]] of 358 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 2,900 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The dynamic pressure supercharger makes sure the engine runs most efficiently at normal operating speeds. Most car engines are designed for optimum performance at maximum speed and load, which are in reality rarely used. At 55 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|bhp]], the engine has the same performance as the original Twingo. Other performance parameters, such as [[maximum speed]], elasticity and [[acceleration]] are the same or better.

The main consumption change of the engine stems from its more frequent use in the higher load range, which results in higher [[thermal stress]]. This is compensated for by an ingenious cooling system. The mean [[piston]] velocities are in the customary range. The use of the latest technologies in materials and surface coatings guarantees stability of piston rings and cylinder bearing surfaces despite the higher pressures due to supercharging.

At least a further 80 kg weight reduction could be achieved through the use of fibre [[composite material]]s, a smaller tank and replacing the glass windows with [[polycarbonate]], but these modifications were not selected.  The changes did not alter the safety standards of the Twingo and the [[airbag]] and lateral collision protection were kept in place.  [[Aluminium]] accounts for 45 kg of the weight of the SmILE (7%), through replacement of both axles, wheel suspension and seat structure. In average cars in Europe this is 65 kg (6%) and rising. One problem with aluminium is the high energy cost of primary production. However, recycled aluminium has a much lower energy cost and identical mechanical properties.  

In [[Germany]], around 10% of all cars are replaced annually by new vehicles, so if all new vehicles had the SmILE standard that would mean an annual reduction of the [[greenhouse gas|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] of the car fleet by 5%.  A similar reduction in fuel consumption would be possible for all [[petrol]] cars, but not [[Diesel engine|diesels]] because they are heavier (and require heavier batteries). The Twingo was chosen because of its favourable ratio between internal space and exterior and because it is a reasonable all-round car for everyone (it is the most imported car in Germany).

Greenpeace says that ultimately, this car is not a definitive solution. Reduction of the number of cars is still necessary, also to reduce other problems, such as [[traffic jam]]s, the emission of toxic substances in cities, the [[Car accident|death toll on roads]] (over a million per year) and the destruction (and carving up) of nature to build roads. [[Alternative fuels]] would be a better solution, but time is pressing, so an intermediate off-the-shelf solution like the SmILE is needed.

The car was designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company of [[Wenko]]. For this, they received a loan of roughly 1.3 million [[euro]] from Greenpeace, which they will return if the engine concept is taken over by a manufacturer for series production or profits are obtained from issuing licences.

A '''sol''' is a [[colloid]]al solution [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of very small [[solid]] particles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Theodore | title = Chemistry : the central science | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2002 | isbn = 0130669970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a continuous [[liquid]] medium.  Sols are quite stable and show the [[Tyndall effect]]. Examples include [[blood]], [[pigment]]ed [[ink]], cell fluids and [[paint]].

Artificial sols may be prepared by dispersion or condensation. Dispersion techniques include grinding solids to colloidal dimensions by [[ball mill]]ing and [[Bredig's arc method]]. The stability of sols may be maintained by using dispersing agents.

Sols are commonly used as part of the [[sol–gel process]].

Elliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the '''Stoddard engine''', the first in 1919 and the second in 1933.  The general engine classification is an [[external combustion engine]] with [[valves]] and single-phase [[gaseous]] working fluid (i.e. a "hot air engine"). The internal [[working fluid]] was originally [[air]], although in modern versions, other gases such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]] may be used.

One potential [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] advantage of using valves is to minimize the adverse effects of "unswept volume" in the [[heat exchangers]] (sometimes called "dead volume"), which is known to reduce engine efficiency and power output in the valveless [[Stirling engine]].

==The 1919 Stoddard engine==
The generalized thermodynamic processes of the 1919 Stoddard cycle are:&lt;ref name="patent1919"&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US1306865 1919 Stoddard Engine US Patent]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] [[Compression ratio|compression]]
# [[Isobaric process|Isobaric]] heat-addition
# Adiabatic [[Thermal expansion|expansion]]
# Isobaric heat-removal

The engine design in the patent was using a [[scotch yoke]].

==The 1933 Stoddard engine==
In the 1933 design,&lt;ref name="patent1933"&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US1926463 1933 Stoddard Engine US Patent]&lt;/ref&gt; Stoddard reduced the internal volume of the [[heat exchanger]]s maintaining the same generalized thermodynamic processes as the 1919 cycle.

'''Supersonic travel''' is a rate of travel of an object that exceeds the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;1). For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) at [[sea level]], this speed is approximately 344&amp;nbsp;[[meter per second|m/s]], 1,125 [[feet per second|ft/s]], 768&amp;nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]], 667&amp;nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]], or 1,235&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre per hour|km/h]]. Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach&amp;nbsp;5) are often referred to as [[hypersonic]]. Flights during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called [[transonic]]. This occurs typically somewhere between Mach&amp;nbsp;0.8 and Mach&amp;nbsp;1.23.

Sounds are traveling vibrations in the form of pressure waves in an elastic medium. In gases, sound travels longitudinally at different speeds, mostly depending on the [[molecular mass]] and [[temperature]] of the gas, and [[pressure]] has little effect. Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, [[Mach number]]s for aircraft may change despite a constant travel speed. In water at [[room temperature]] supersonic speed can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440&amp;nbsp;m/s (4,724&amp;nbsp;ft/s). In solids, sound waves can be polarized longitudinally or transversely and have even higher velocities.

[[Supersonic fracture]] is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a [[brittle]] material.

==Early meaning==
At the beginning of the 20th century, the term "supersonic" was used as an adjective to describe sound whose frequency is above the range of normal human hearing.  The modern term for this meaning is "[[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]".

The tip of a [[bullwhip]] is thought to be the first man-made object to break the sound barrier, resulting in the telltale "crack" (actually a small [[sonic boom]]). The [[wave motion]] traveling through the bullwhip is what makes it capable of achieving supersonic speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/9/crackin-good-mathematics Mike May, ''Crackin' Good Mathematics'', American Scientist, Volume 90, Number 5, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypography.com/article.cfm?id=32479 Hypography - Science for everyone - Whip Cracking Mystery Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern [[fighter aircraft]] are supersonic aircraft, but there have been [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger aircraft]], namely [[Concorde]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-144]]. Both these passenger [[aircraft]] and some modern fighters are also capable of [[supercruise]], a condition of sustained supersonic flight without the use of an [[afterburner]]. Due to its ability to supercruise for several hours and the relatively high frequency of flight over several decades, Concorde spent more time flying supersonically than all other aircraft combined by a considerable margin. Since Concorde's final retirement flight on November 26, 2003, there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service. Some large [[bombers]], such as the [[Tupolev Tu-160]] and [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] are also supersonic-capable.

Most modern [[firearm]] [[bullets]] are supersonic, with rifle [[projectiles]] often travelling at speeds approaching and in some cases&lt;ref name="hornady"&gt;[http://www.hornady.com/images/ballistics/ballistics_charts.pdf Hornady Ammunition Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; well exceeding [[Mach (speed)|Mach 3]].

Most [[spacecraft]], most notably the [[Space Shuttle]] are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air densities. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30&amp;nbsp;km (~98,400&amp;nbsp;feet) to reduce air drag.

Note that the [[Speed of sound#Speed in ideal gases and in air|speed of sound]] decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25&amp;nbsp;km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bpesoft.com/s/wleizero/xhac/?M=s eXtreme High Altitude Conditions Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;

When an inflated [[balloon]] is burst, the torn pieces of [[latex]] contract at supersonic speed, which contributes to the sharp and loud popping noise.

==Supersonic land vehicles==

To date, only one land vehicle has officially travelled at supersonic speed. It is [[ThrustSSC]], driven by [[Andy Green]], which holds the world land speed record, having achieved an average speed on its bi-directional run of {{convert|763|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the [[Black Rock Desert]] on 15 October 1997.

[[Richard Noble]], [[Andy Green]] and a team of engineers are currently planning to break this record in 2019 at [[Hakskeen Pan]] in South Africa with the [[Bloodhound SSC]] hybrid jet- and rocket-propelled car.

==Supersonic flight==
Supersonic [[aerodynamics]] is simpler than subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets at different points along the plane often cannot affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra [[aerodynamic drag]] experienced within the [[transonic]] region (around Mach 0.85–1.2). At these speeds [[aerospace engineer]]s can gently guide air around the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft without producing new [[shock wave]]s, but any change in cross area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body. Designers use the [[Supersonic area rule]] and the [[Whitcomb area rule]] to minimize sudden changes in size.
[[File:Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach1.4.gif|thumb|The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier, and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of sound, c (Mach 1.4). Because the source is moving faster than the sound waves it creates, it actually leads the advancing wavefront. The sound source will pass by a stationary observer before the observer actually hears the sound it creates.]]
However, in practical applications, a supersonic aircraft must operate stably in both subsonic and supersonic profiles, hence aerodynamic design is more complex.

One problem with sustained supersonic flight is the generation of heat in flight.  At high speeds [[aerodynamic heating]] can occur, so an aircraft must be designed to operate and function under very high temperatures. [[Duralumin]], the traditional aircraft material, starts to lose strength and go into plastic deformation at relatively low temperatures, and is unsuitable for continuous use at speeds above Mach 2.2 to 2.4. Materials such as [[titanium]] and [[stainless steel]] allow operations at much higher temperatures. For example, the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]] jet could fly continuously at Mach&amp;nbsp;3.1 which could lead to temperatures on some parts of the aircraft getting above 315&amp;nbsp;°C (600&amp;nbsp;°F).

Another area of concern for sustained high-speed flight is engine operation. Jet engines create thrust by increasing the temperature of the air they ingest, and as the aircraft speeds up, [[aerodynamic heating|friction and compression heat this air]] before it reaches the engines. The maximum allowable temperature of the exhaust is determined by the materials in the [[turbine]] at the rear of the engine, so as the aircraft speeds up, the difference in intake and exhaust temperature that the engine can create decreases, and the thrust along with it. [[Air cooling]] the turbine area to allow operations at higher temperatures was a key solution, one that continued to improve through the 1950s and on to this day.

Intake design was also a major issue. Normal jet engines can only ingest subsonic air, so for supersonic operation the air must be slowed down. Ramps or cones in the intake are used to create [[shock wave]]s that slow the airflow before it reaches the engine. Doing so removes energy from the airflow, causing drag. The key to reducing this drag is to use multiple small oblique shock waves, but this was difficult because the angle they make inside the intake changes with Mach number. In order to efficiently operate across a range of speeds, the shock waves have to be "tuned."

An aircraft able to [[Supercruise|operate for extended periods at supersonic speeds]] has a potential range advantage over a similar design operating subsonically. Most of the drag an aircraft sees while speeding up to supersonic speeds occurs just below the speed of sound, due to an aerodynamic effect known as [[wave drag]]. An aircraft that can accelerate past this speed sees a significant drag decrease, and can fly supersonically with improved fuel economy. However, due to the way lift is generated supersonically, the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] of the aircraft as a whole drops, leading to lower range, offsetting or overturning this advantage.

The key to having low supersonic drag is to properly shape the overall aircraft to be long and thin, and close to a "perfect" shape, the [[Nose cone design#Haack series|von Karman ogive]] or [[Sears-Haack body]]. This has led to almost every supersonic cruising aircraft looking very similar to every other, with a very long and slender fuselage and large delta wings, cf. [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], [[Concorde]], etc. Although not ideal for passenger aircraft, this shaping is quite adaptable for bomber use.

===History of supersonic flight===
{{Main|Sound barrier}}
Aviation research during World War II led to the creation of the first rocket- and jet-powered aircraft.  Several claims of breaking the sound barrier during the war subsequently emerged.  However, the first recognized flight exceeding the speed of sound by a manned aircraft in controlled level flight was performed on October&amp;nbsp;14, 1947 by the experimental [[Bell&amp;nbsp;X-1]] research rocket plane piloted by [[Chuck Yeager|Charles "Chuck" Yeager]]. The first production plane to break the sound barrier was an F-86 [[Canadair Sabre]] with the first 'supersonic' woman pilot, [[Jacqueline Cochran]], at the controls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/jacqueline_cochran.html "Jacqueline Cochran and the Women's Airforce Service Pilots."] ''National Archives and Records Administration: The Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, and Boyhood Home.'' Retrieved: July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Masters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Masters | first = David  | title = German Jet Genesis | publisher = Jane's | date = 1982 | pages = 142 | language = English | isbn = 978-0867206227}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DFS 346 prototype captured in Germany by the Soviets, after being released from a B-29 at 32800&amp;nbsp;ft (10000 m), reached 683&amp;nbsp;mph (1100&amp;nbsp;km/h) late in 1945, which would have exceeded Mach 1 at that height.  The pilot in these flights was the German Wolfgang Ziese.

On August 21, 1961, a [[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-43]] (registration N9604Z) exceeded Mach 1 in a controlled dive during a test flight at Edwards Air Force Base.  The crew were William Magruder (pilot), Paul Patten (copilot), Joseph Tomich (flight engineer), and Richard H. Edwards (flight test engineer).&lt;ref name="Wasserzieher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/i-was-there-when-the-dc-8-went-supersonic-27846699|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508170312/http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/i-was-there-when-the-dc-8-went-supersonic-27846699/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-05-08|title=I Was There: When the DC-8 Went Supersonic|last=Wasserzieher|first=Bill|date=August 2011|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first and only supersonic flight by a civilian airliner other than the Concorde or Tu-144.&lt;ref name="Wasserzieher" /&gt;

'''''The Vanishing Legion''''' is a [[1931 in film|1931]] American [[Pre-Code]] [[Mascot Pictures|Mascot]] [[Serial film|film serial]] directed by [[Ford Beebe]] and [[B. Reeves Eason]].

Stars [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] and [[Edwina Booth]] were originally intended to be in the studio's previous serial, ''[[King of the Wild]]'', but had to be re-cast when the MGM film ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' ([[1931 in film|1931]]) overran its schedule. Both also starred in the Mascot serial ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1932 serial)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and Carey was the lead in ''[[The Devil Horse]]''. An infection received while filming ''Trader Horn'' led to Booth's retirement from acting.

==Plot==

A '''tubing hanger''' is a component used in the completion of [[oil]] and [[gas]] production wells.  It is set in the [[Christmas tree (oil well)|tree]] or the [[wellhead]] and suspends the [[production tubing]] and/or [[casing (oil well)|casing]].  Sometimes it provides porting to allow the communication of [[hydraulic]], [[electric]] and other downhole functions, as well as [[chemical]] injection. It also serves to seal-in the annulus and production areas.

The '''Upsilon meson''' ({{SubatomicParticle|Upsilon}}) is a [[quarkonium]] state (i.e. [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavourless]] [[meson]]) formed from a [[bottom quark]] and its [[antiparticle]]. It was discovered by the [[E288 experiment]] team, headed by [[Leon Lederman]], at [[Fermilab]] in 1977, and was the first particle containing a bottom quark to be discovered because it is the lightest that can be produced without additional massive particles.  It has a [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of {{val|1.21|e=-20|ul=s}} and a mass about {{val|9.46|ul=GeV/c2}} in the ground state.

Jedlik's education began at high schools in Nagyszombat (today [[Trnava]]) and Pressburg (today [[Bratislava]]). In 1817 he became a Benedictine, and from that time continued his studies at the schools of that order, where he was known by his Latin name {{lang|la|Stephanus Anianus}}. He lectured at [[Benedictine]] schools up to 1839, then for 40 years at the Budapest University of Sciences department of physics-mechanics. Few guessed at that time that his activities would play an important part in bringing up a new generation of physicists. He became the dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1848, and by 1863 he was rector of the University. From 1858 he was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and from 1873 was an honorary member. After his retirement he continued working and spent his last years in complete seclusion at the priory in [[Győr]], where he died.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the prototype both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. The first electromotor, built in 1828, and Jedlik's operating instructions are kept at the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. The motor still works perfectly today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traveltohungary.com/english/articles/article.php?id=135 Lunar Radar]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jedlik only reported his invention decades later and the true date of it is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1376.php&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a prolific author. In 1845, Jedlik was the first university professor in the Kingdom of Hungary who began teaching his students in Hungarian instead of [[Latin]]. His cousin [[Gergely Czuczor]], a Hungarian linguist, asked him to create a Hungarian technical vocabulary in physics, the first of its kind, by which he became one of its founders.

In the 1850s he conducted optical and wave-mechanical experiments, and at the beginning of the 1860s he constructed an excellent optical grate.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He was ahead of his contemporaries in his scientific work, but he did not speak about his most important invention, his prototype [[dynamo]], until 1856; it was not until 1861 that he mentioned it in writing in a list of inventory of the university. Although that document might serve as evidence of Jedlik's being the first dynamo, the invention of the dynamo is linked to [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]]'s name because Jedlik's invention did not rise to notice at that time.

In 1863 he discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a "tubular voltage generator", which was successfully displayed at the [[Vienna World Exposition]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The jury of the World Exhibition of 1873 in Vienna awarded his voltage multiplying condenser of [[Cascade connection (capacitors)|cascade connection]] with a prize "For Development". Through this condenser, Jedlik framed the principle of surge generation by cascaded connection. (The cascade connection was an other important invention of Ányos Jedlik)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223457/http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hellotrade.com/energosolar/electronic-engineering.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamo invention===
[[File:Anyos Jedlik manuscript2.jpg|thumb|left|Drawn plan of a "[[telephone|telephon]]" by Ányos Jedlik in Hungarian. [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]].]]

Jedlik's best known invention is the principle of [[dynamo]] [[self-excitation]].

In 1827, Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic rotating devices which he called electromagnetic self-rotors.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter, both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. In essence, the concept is that instead of permanent magnets, two opposed electromagnets induce the magnetic field around the rotor. He formulated the concept of the self-excited dynamo about 1861, six years before [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]] and [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]].&lt;ref&gt;

As one side of the coil passes in front of the north pole, crossing the line of force, current is induced. As the frame rotates further the current diminishes, then arriving at the front of the south pole it rises again but flows in the opposite direction. The frame is connected to a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], thus the current always flows in the same direction in the external [[electronic circuit|circuit]].
