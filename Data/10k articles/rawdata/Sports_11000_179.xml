'''Mosul  football club''' ({{lang-ar|'''نادي الموصل'''}}) is an [[Iraq]]i football club based in [[Mosul]].

==Iraqi Premier League withdrawal==
In the [[Iraqi Premier League 2007–08]] season, Mosul FC withdrew for security reasons. Hence they came back to the Iraqi Premier League without playing in the lower division. In the [[Iraqi Premier League 2008–09]] season, the club announced their withdrawal, this time due to financial problems.

'''Alexandra Gerrard''' ([[née]] '''Curran'''; born 23 September 1982) is an English model, fashion columnist for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and the wife of former [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[English national football team|England]] [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Steven Gerrard]].&lt;ref name="TIFDb"/&gt; She was described as a leading "[[WAGs|WAG]]" of the England national football team, along with women such as [[Victoria Beckham]] and [[Coleen Rooney]]. In 2007, the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' referred to her, then Steven Gerrard's fiancée, as an "''über''-WAG".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;"tussling over the remote with his ''über''-WAG fiancée" – ''[[The Times|Times]]'' Magazine, 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2007, she launched her own fragrance, named "Alex", which was one of the top sellers of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.1891433.0.scents_sensibility.php Scents and Sensibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101025641/http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.1891433.0.scents_sensibility.php |date=1 January 2009 }}, ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', 8 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Curran writes a weekly [[newspaper column|column]] for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', titled "Go Shopping With Alex Curran". She wrote a weekly column for OK Magazine from 2009 until January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/25/g2 Lost in Showbiz], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A former [[manicure|nail technician]], Curran was born in [[Aintree]], Merseyside and raised in [[Maghull]], and attended [[Maghull High School]]. Curran and Steven Gerrard have been a couple since 2002.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;Interview with Alex Curran, ''[[Sunday People]]'', 13 May 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080731205211/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050313/ai_n12944334  Online version]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her relationship with Gerrard, Curran was dating businessman Tony Richardson, while Gerrard was dating [[Jennifer Ellison]].  At some point in 2002, Curran and Ellison switched lovers; ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "who stole whom off whom is still the subject of some debate and perhaps Ellison's autobiography".&lt;ref name="wives"&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1786728,00.html Meet the real footballers' wives], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Curran and Gerrard married on 16 June 2007, at the [[Cliveden]] House luxury hotel in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="wedding"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18732839%26siteid=89520-name_page.html Carrick in Wedding Clash], ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They have three daughters and a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corless|first1=Liam|title="Our family is complete": Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard confirms wife Alex has given birth to their first son|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-legend-steven-gerrard-son-10320064|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 December 2007, while husband Steven Gerrard was away playing with Liverpool, the couple's home was burgled while she and another female resident were inside. Curran was confronted by four masked robbers who were reportedly there for a [[GBP|£]]10,000 watch that Curran had bought for Gerrard for Christmas. On the same day she had mentioned the watch in ''Closer'' magazine. Gerrard was the sixth Liverpool player to be burgled while away playing football.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Football/News_Story/0,,2226584,00.html Masked raiders confront Gerrard's wife in sixth raid on Liverpool players' homes], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==

In 2010 Curran took to designing when she launched the Forever Unique by Alex Gerrard Collection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1312849/Alex-Gerrard-launches-fashion-range.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=It's glam up north: WAGs and soap stars turn out in force at Alex Gerrard's fashion launch | date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first collection was so successful that she launched a second collection in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/alex-gerrard-the-goal-den-girl-of-style-859195&lt;/ref&gt;

Curran was revealed as the model for the new 2013 Lipsy VIP Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lipsy.co.uk/blog/1081/party-like-a-lipsy-vip&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On 8 August 2006, Curran was arrested on suspicion of assault by [[Merseyside Police]] following a fight at the Shangri-La restaurant in [[Liverpool]] city centre. A teenage girl, also from Maghull, was struck in the face with a glass bottle during the altercation.&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=400143&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ico=Homepage&amp;icl=TabModule&amp;icc=picbox&amp;ct=5 Gerrard's WAG arrested over bottle attack], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 12 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Curran was released on bail until November 2006,&lt;ref name="assault2"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=400348&amp;in_page_id=1770 The girl 'hit in the face with a bottle' by Gerrard's fiancee], ''Daily Mail'', 13 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the charges were later dropped.

Curran was also involved in disagreement with singer [[Jamelia]], who was previously engaged to footballer [[Darren Byfield]]. Jamelia described footballer wives as "leeches", and insulted Curran specifically: "God forbid if Alex Curran split up with Steve Gerrard. Who would she be then?" Curran responded in an interview with ''[[OK!]]'' magazine, "She'll be glad to know I don't know her boyfriend's name but Steven (Gerrard) thinks he's lower than a [[non-league football|non-league]] player."&lt;ref name="wagfight"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1886971,00.html People daily comment section], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aloha Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] located in [[Halawa, Hawaii]], a western suburb of [[Honolulu]] (though with a Honolulu address). It is the largest stadium in the state of [[Hawaii]]. Aloha Stadium is home to the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]] [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Rainbow Warriors]] [[American football|football]] team ([[Mountain West Conference]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]]).

It hosts the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Hawai'i Bowl]], and formerly was home to the [[National Football League]]'s [[Pro Bowl]] from 1980 through 2016 (except in 2010 and 2015) and to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Hula Bowl]] from 1975 to 1997 and again from 2006 to 2008. It also hosts numerous high school football games during the season, and serves as a venue for large concerts and events. A [[flea market|swap meet]] in the stadium's parking lot every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday draws large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp |title=Hawaii's premier Aloha Stadium Swap Meet an Outdoor Market in Hawaii&amp;#124;Aloha Outdoor Market, Flea Markets and Swap meet for shopping in Honolulu |publisher=Alohastadiumswapmeet.net |date=1975-09-12 |accessdate=2009-07-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531123144/http://alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp |archivedate=31 May 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aloha Stadium was home field for the [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]] [[Hawaii Islanders]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) from 1975 to 1987, before the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox|team]] moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].

==History==
[[File:AlohastadiumsatUSGS.png|thumb|left|Aerial view in baseball/soccer configuration]]
Before 1975, Honolulu's main outdoor stadium had been [[Honolulu Stadium]], a wooden stadium on King Street.  However, it had reached the end of its useful life by the 1960s, and was well below the standards for Triple-A baseball.  The need for a new stadium was hastened by the Rainbows' move to NCAA Division I.  Located west of downtown Honolulu and two miles north of [[Honolulu International Airport]], Aloha Stadium was constructed in 1975 at a cost of $37&amp;nbsp;million. The baseball field is aligned north-northwest (home plate to centerfield), as is the football field.

The first sporting event at Aloha Stadium was a college football game between Hawaii and [[Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville Javelinas football|Texas A&amp;I]] (now Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville) on September 13, 1975.&lt;ref name=crushop/&gt; Played on Saturday night, the crowd was 32,247,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp Aloha Stadium Swap Meet "About Us" page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531123144/http://alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp |date=2009-05-31 }}, [http://www.alohastadiumswapmeet.net/ alohastadiumswapmeet.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and the visitors prevailed, {{nowrap|43–9.&lt;ref name=crushop/&gt;}}

The stadium was somewhat problematic for its initial primary tenant, the baseball Islanders. Located in west-central Oahu, it was far from the team's fan base, and many were unwilling to make the drive. Additionally, while [[TheBus (Honolulu)|TheBus]] stopped at the main gate of Honolulu Stadium, the stop for Aloha Stadium was located some distance from the gate.  As a result, attendance plummeted and never really recovered—a major factor in the franchise's ultimate move to the mainland.&lt;ref name=Advertiser&gt;Kaneshiro, Stacy. [http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Jul/04/sp/hawaii907040333.html "Islanders a fan hit during 27-year run"]. ''[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]'', 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, stadium management initially refused to allow the use of [[Cleat (shoe)#Baseball|metal spikes]] on the [[AstroTurf]] in May 1976.  When the [[Tacoma Rainiers|Tacoma Twins]] complied with a parent-club directive to wear the spikes, stadium management turned off the center field lights.  After 35 minutes, the umpires forfeited the game to the Twins.  The Islanders protested, claiming they had no control over the lights.  However, the PCL sided with the Twins, citing a league rule that the home team is responsible for providing acceptable playing facilities.&lt;ref name=Advertiser/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Chuck. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19760901&amp;id=KfpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1vgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4981,314263 Sport Stew]. Spokane Daily Chronicle, 1976-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The teams ended the season in a tie for first in the Western Division and Hawaii won the one-game playoff in Tacoma.

As originally built, Aloha Stadium had various configurations for different sport venues and other purposes. Four movable 7,000-seat sections, each 3.5&amp;nbsp;million {{nowrap|pounds&lt;ref name="capacity" /&gt;}} could move using [[air caster]]s into a diamond configuration for baseball (also used for soccer), an oval for football, or a triangle for concerts.  In January 2007, the stadium was permanently locked into its football configuration due to cost and maintenance issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There have been numerous discussions with Hawaii lawmakers who are concerned with the physical condition of the stadium. There are several issues regarding rusting of the facility, several hundred seats that need to be replaced, and restroom facilities that need to be expanded to accommodate more patrons.&lt;ref name="rust" /&gt;  Much of the rust is due to a design mistake in the choice of [[weathering steel]] to build the stadium.  It was intended to create a protective patina that would eliminate the need for painting, but in the ocean salt-laden air of Honolulu, it has never stopped rusting.

A 2005 study by Honolulu engineering firm [[Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.]] determined that the stadium required $99 million to be completely restored and an additional $115 million for ongoing maintenance and refurbishment over the next 20 years to extend its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/May/11/ln/FP705110373.html |title=Stadium rust to get $12.4M treatment|publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2007, the state legislature proposed to spend $300&amp;nbsp;million to build a new facility as opposed to spending approximately $216&amp;nbsp;million to extend the life of Aloha Stadium for another {{nowrap|20–30}} years. The new stadium may also be used to attempt to lure a [[Super Bowl]] to Hawaii in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

One council member has said that if immediate repairs are not made within the next seven years, then the stadium will probably have to be demolished due to safety concerns. In May 2007, the state allotted $12.4&amp;nbsp;million to be used towards removing corrosion and rust from the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Expansion and improvements==
In 2003, the stadium surface was changed from [[AstroTurf]] (which had been in place since the stadium opened) to [[FieldTurf]].&lt;ref name="turf" /&gt; In July 2011 the field was replaced with an [[Act Global]] UBU Sports Speed S5-M synthetic turf system.

In 2008, the state of Hawaii approved the bill of $185 million to refurbish the aging Aloha Stadium.&lt;ref name="$135 million"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaii stadium to get $185M overhaul; UH expands pay-per-view package |first=Brandon |last=Masuoka |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jun/27/ln/hawaii806270385.html |newspaper=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |issn=1072-7191 |oclc=8807414 |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2013-02-04 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ECDDmB5u?url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jun/27/ln/hawaii806270385.html |archivedate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Aloha Stadium completely retrofitted its scoreboard and video screen to be more up to date with its high definition capability. The Aloha Stadium Authority plans to add more luxury suites, replacing all seats, rusting treatments, parking lots, more restrooms, pedestrian bridge supports, enclosed lounge, and more. There is also a proposal that would close the 4 openings in the corners of the stadium to add more seats.

In 2011, the playing field was refurbished in part due to a naming rights sponsorship from Hawaiian Airlines. As a result of the sponsorship deal, the field was referred to as Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sponsorpitch.com/articles/2496 Hawaiian Airlines Grabs Naming Rights To Aloha Stadium Field; SponsorPitch; 08-04-2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117190626/http://sponsorpitch.com/articles/2496 |date=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline did not renew sponsorship after the deal expired in 2016. As a result, the field went unnamed until late August, when [[Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union]] signed a 3-year/$275,000 agreement. As of 2016, the field is now known as '''Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union Field at Aloha Stadium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/business-breaking/credit-union-buys-naming-rights-for-aloha-stadium-field/|title=Credit union buys naming rights for Aloha Stadium field|date=26 August 2016|work=staradvertiser.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, there was a study in the Honolulu StarAdvertiser about replacing Aloha Stadium due to safety concerns and a liability risk. The plan is to build a smaller 30,000 seat stadium on the existing property and also build commercial development around the stadium. In theory, it would save the state millions of dollars instead of renovating and keep the existing stadium as it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2014/06/26/sports/study-recommends-smaller-venue-to-replace-aloha-stadium/|title=Study recommends smaller venue to replace Aloha Stadium|work=staradvertiser.com|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/04/05/sports/sports-breaking/report-aloha-stadium-a-potential-danger-to-public/|title=Report: Aloha Stadium now a 'liability,' cheaper to build new stadium|work=staradvertiser.com|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States women's national soccer team]] was scheduled play a game against Trinidad and Tobago as part of their World Cup Winning Victory Tour at the stadium on December 6, 2015; however, the game was canceled the day before gameday due to concerns over the turf being unsafe to play on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Soccer Cancels Dec. 6 Match against T&amp;T in Hawaii Due to Field Conditions|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2015/12/06/09/55/151205-wntvtri-honolulu-cancelled|website=US Soccer|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby===
On June 2, 2013, the stadium played host to a [[rugby league]] test match where [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] defeated the [[United States national rugby league team|USA]] 34–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/tomahawks-get-ready-for-match-up-with-na-toa-samoa-at-aloha-stadium|title=Tomahawks get ready for match-up with Na Toa Samoa at Aloha Stadium|work=KHON2|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] from the Australasian-based [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) competition organized for a rugby league match to be played at Aloha Stadium against NRL rivals [[Penrith Panthers]] later in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broncos Panthers To Play Match In Hawaii|url=http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/sport/nrl/news/2015/6/brisbane-broncos-penrith-panthers-exhibition-match-aloha-stadium-hawaii-2015/|website=triplem.com.au|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September the NRL blocked the idea and the game didn't go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition matches are a bad idea in the USA – just look at the Wallabies!|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2015/09/17/exhibition-matches-bad-idea-usa-just-look-wallabies/|website=theroar.com.au|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Billiard Room at Schönbrunn Palace, c. 1855/1860, [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] after a watercolour by Franz Heinrich
]]
A '''billiard room''' (also '''billiards room''', or more specifically '''pool room''', '''snooker room''') is a [[recreation room]], such as in a house or recreation center, with a [[Billiards table|billiards, pool or snooker table]].  The term billiard room is sometimes also used as [[synonym]]ous with "[[billiard hall]]" i.e., a business providing public access to hourly-rental or coin-operated billiard tables.

The billiard room may be in the public center of the house or the private areas of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Old House Interiors|last=Publications|first=Home Buyer|date=2016-11-29|publisher=Home Buyer Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billiard rooms require proper lighting and clearances for game playing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2wHBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Interior Design Productivity Toolbox: Checklists and Best Practices to Manage Your Workflow|last=Harbinger|first=Phyllis|date=2014-08-04|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118680438|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are adjustable cue sticks on the market, 5 feet of clearance around the pool table is ideal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Interior designer [[Charlotte Moss]] believed that "a billiard room is synonymous with group dynamics.  It's where you mix drinks and embark on a little friendly competition..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PYPa1Kb31UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Charlotte Moss Decorates: The Art of Creating Elegant and Inspired Rooms|last=Moss|first=Charlotte|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Random House Incorporated|isbn=9780847833696|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Billiards probably developed from one of the late-14th century or early-15th century lawn games in which players hit balls with sticks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8NMAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Christensen|first2=Karen|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195131956|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest mention of pool as an indoor table game is in a 1470 inventory list of the accounts of King Louis XI of France.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the [[French Revolution]] and the Napoleonic Wars, billiard rooms were added to some famous 18th-century cafés in Paris and other cities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlKhCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165&amp;dq=billiard+room+interior+design&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpgrDwxM3QAhWFJiYKHa5PBZgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=billiard%20room%20interior%20design&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Interior Design|last=Banham|first=Joanna|date=1997-05-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787584|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Billiard Room - Mark Twain House.tiff|thumb|Billiard Room - Mark Twain House]]
Although billiards had long been enjoyed by both men and women, a trend towards male suites developed in 19th century Great Britain.  These male suites paired billiard rooms with smoking rooms and sometimes libraries. One example of these male suites is Castle Carr near Halifax.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By the turn of the century, billiard rooms were considered a standard feature in great British houses with ''[[House Beautiful]]'' claiming "Up-to-date owners of English estates have installed billiard rooms..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dtNAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=House Beautiful|date=1908-01-01|publisher=Hearst Corporation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mid- and late-19th century billiard rooms were designed in an Oriental or Moorish style.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Mark Twain's billiard room in Hartford, CT was decorated with quasi-Moorish stencils.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The late 19th and early 20th century represent the billiard room's heyday.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Burnley Greyhound Stadium''' also known as '''Towneley Stadium''' was a former [[greyhound racing]] and [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium in [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =410|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and Opening==
South of Burnley there was a large open space known as [[Towneley Park]] which served Towneley Hall and the Towneley family for five centuries. In 1902 the estate was sold to the Burnley Corporation and despite the fact that most of the park remained in situ they did agree the sale of a plot of land that ran alongside the River Calder and the Hall's north access road. This ten acre plot was in the area known as Towneley Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnley.gov.uk/residents/towneley-hall|title=Towneley Hall|publisher=Burnley gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium could be accessed from either the east or west side, on the east side the path was opposite the Smalley Street junction with Woodgrove Road and cut across Towneley Park meeting the Hall's north access road. The stadium kennels were adjacent to this path situated on the north side of the stadium. From the west there was footbridge over the [[River Calder, Lancashire|River Calder]] that met the Hall's north access road. Whichever entry was chosen resulted in the same turnstile entrances on the east side of the stadium being used where the main stand overlooked the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/385215/431714/12/101104|title=OS County Series Lancashire and Furness 1931|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local company with a share capital of £13,000 purchased and constructed the greyhound track which was a very large 570 yards in circumference. The first race night was held on 3 September 1927 with seven thousand attending the meeting opened by Lady O’Hagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pictures of Burnley's Greyhound Racing Track at Towneley Holmes. 27 August|year=1927|newspaper=Express and Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The greyhounds initially housed at the Burnley track consisted of 100 brought mainly from Hull. The stadium came under the control of a company called the Associated Greyhound Racecourses with Towneley becoming their second of three tracks that they would eventually own. The first being [[Darnall Stadium]] and the third was the [[Old Craven Park]] in Hull. Towneley also hosted dirt track speedway in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greyhoundderby.com/Burnley%20speedway.html|title=Burnley Speedway|publisher=Greyhound Derby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haulage businessman Bill Sharples had a litter out of track bitch Calliope, sired by [[Grand National (greyhounds)|Grand National]] finalist Douro and trainers included [[Jack Hillman]] (a former England goalkeeper) and Jack Ashworth. In 1931 just four years after opening the Associated Greyhound Racecourses went bankrupt with the track then being taken over by a local businessman named W Spencer who closed the stadium blaming the government betting bill that restricted the days that tracks could race. With meetings limited to a maximum of 101 per annum the management put the stadium, kennels and equipment up for auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burnley Greyhound stadium. 6 November|year=1935|newspaper=Burnley Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Closure==
During 1935 the stadium was taken over by Captain Ramsbottom who had replaced Harry Bury as the judge and handicapper under a previous promotion. Ramsbottom then made a quick profit by selling onto two brothers Dr. and Clem Hodgson with the last greyhound meeting taking place on 2 November 1935.
The buildings associated to the stadium (stands, shelters and kennels) were demolished and the track was filled in as the site became playing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burnley Greyhound stadium. 9 November|year=1935|newspaper=Burnley Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A golf course then spread its wings north and incorporated the site into the course. The position of the stadium today would have been on the northerly holes of a golf course, exactly on the opposite side of the River Calder to the £33 million [[Unity College, Burnley|Unity College]].

'''Canine hydrotherapy''' is a form of [[hydrotherapy]] directed at the treatment of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] conditions, post-operative recovery, and pre-operative or general fitness in [[dog]]s.

==Background==
[[Image:Bilateral hip dysplasia.JPG|left|thumb|Hip dysplasia may be helped by hydrotherapy.]]
A number of conditions in dogs may be aggravated by or may show slow or no improvement as a result of [[weight bearing]] exercise. Among these are [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] and [[Osteochondritis|osteochondritis dissecans]] (OCD), conditions most common in medium to large purebred dogs, such as [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Labrador|Labrador Retriever]]s or [[Golden Retriever]]s; [[Canine degenerative myelopathy|chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy]] (CDRM), a degenerative disease of the spinal cord which causes hind limb problems in German Shepherds; and [[luxating patella]] which is seen predominantly in small and [[toy dog|toy breeds]].

Injuries to the [[cruciate ligament]] or other [[ligament]]s may make post-operative weight-bearing exercise in dogs problematic. [[Obesity in pets|Obese dogs]], while requiring exercise, may aggravate existing conditions or injure themselves due to the weight exerted on their joints if walked normally.

==History==
[[Hydrotherapy]] for humans has been used since ancient times, and some attempt at formalizing treatment was made during the 18th century. Similarly, the benefits of sea water for the treatment and prevention of leg injuries in [[horse]]s has been known for centuries. Because of the financial benefits surrounding the treatment of [[horse racing|race horses]], around the mid-19th century inventors began to produce devices to replicate the benefits of cold sea water immersion for horses.

The [[greyhound racing]] industry eventually recognized the benefits of the equine treatment and in the UK was brought to the forefront by a specialized canine hydrotherapy pool. From there, the therapy was extended to dogs in general.
This had led to the development of underwater treadmills to relieve stress on the animals joints whilst building strength. These have been a turning point in the rehabilitation of dogs as they can be placed in smaller areas, but offer a controlled treatment.

==Pool design==
Pool designs for canine hydrotherapy vary, but most have generic elements. The pool tends to be smaller than a human [[swimming pool]] and is heated. (This is unlike equine hydrotherapy pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have [[dog harness|harness]]es to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric [[hoist (device)|hoist]] for lifting dogs in and out of the water. Water is [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]] or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have [[Jet (fluid)|jet]]s to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.

==Uses==
As an alternative or complement to weight-bearing exercise and medication, canine hydrotherapy may speed recovery after operations or slow the progression of degenerative conditions. It may be used as a pre-operative fitness regime to allow a dog to maintain condition before an operation if it can not exercise normally. When a [[congenital disorder|congenital condition]] is identified in a puppy, it may be the case that surgery is not possible until the animal is physically mature; during the period preceding the surgery, hydrotherapy can be employed to maintain the dog's condition.

Spinal injuries or surgery can cause impairment of motor function, which may be treated by allowing the dog to exercise in water; it provides support and allows the dog to exercise its muscles while nerve regeneration is taking place. Degenerative conditions can make normal weight bearing exercise difficult and pressure on joints and limbs may aggravate some conditions, so hydrotherapy can be used in these cases to allow the dog to exercise in an environment where there is no pressure on the affected areas.

Obese dogs can build fitness and lose weight as a result of exercise in a hydrotherapy pool without putting excessive weight on their joints. Hydrotherapy may be used as part of a general fitness routine for dogs.

'''Deportivo Mictlán''' is a Guatemalan [[association football|football]] club, playing in the top division again in the 2010 Clausura tournament.

Nicknamed ''Los Conejos'' (the Rabbits) and based in [[Asunción Mita]], [[Jutiapa (department)|Jutiapa]], their home stadium is [[Estadio La Asunción]], which holds 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstadiums.com/middle_america/countries/guatemala.shtml Stadiums in Guatemala]&amp;nbsp;– World Stadiums&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mictlán was promoted for the first time in 1992 when they bought the license that ''Galcasa'' from [[Villa Nueva, Guatemala|Villa Nueva]] left in the top division. In 2006 Mictlán achieved their second promotion to the [[Liga Nacional de Guatemala|Liga Nacional]] when they defeated Xinabajul in [[Primera División de Ascenso]] extra match,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/guat06.html Guatemala 2005/06]&amp;nbsp;– RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt; playing the 2006–2007 season in ''Liga Nacional'' for the first time since 1996. They would be back in the Second Division soon again after finishing last in the overall standings, thus being automatically demoted and stay there through the 2009–2010 season .

The team returned to Guatemala's top division for the 2010 Clausura tournament after defeating Sacachispas 1–0 in overtime.

The facility is primarily used for [[basketball]]. It serves as the home of the [[Wisconsin Herd]] of the [[NBA G League]], which is affiliated with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dleague.nba.com/news/milwaukee-bucks-purchase-nba-development-league-team/ |title=Milwaukee Bucks Purchase NBA Development League Team - NBA G League |publisher=Dleague.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukee-bucks-purchase-nba-development-league-team-begin-play-oshkosh-2017-18-season |title=Milwaukee Bucks Purchase NBA Development League Team to Begin Play in Oshkosh for the 2017-18 Season &amp;#124; Milwaukee Bucks |publisher=Nba.com |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/dleague/ |title=Wisconsin Herd |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first event to be held at the arena, a Wisconsin Herd game was on December 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Nolan|title=Wisconsin Herd play first game in Menominee Nation Arena|url=http://www.wbay.com/content/news/Wisconsin-Herd--461415413.html|accessdate=3 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On January 25, 2017, the Oshkosh City Council unanimously approved the construction of the $15 million facility. The cost of the construction was privately funded, with the arena being part of a larger development plan for a new housing and commercial area called the Sawdust District, located near Pioneer Drive Park along the shores of [[Lake Winnebago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arenadigest.com/2017/01/25/oshkosh-approves-d-league-arena-deal/|title=Oshkosh Approves D-League Arena Deal|publisher=ArenaDigest.com|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox11online.com/news/local/fox-cities/plans-submitted-for-oshkosh-basketball-arena|title=Plans submitted for Oshkosh basketball arena|publisher=Fox11Online.com|date=December 26, 2016|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2017, the Oshkosh City Council announced that the arena was to receive an additional $250,000 in state-supported funding for improvement of the nearby roadways and infrastructures to improve transit to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/money/2017/06/12/wedc-awards-oshkosh-250-000-grant-roadwork-near-new-arena/390114001/|title=WEDC awards Oshkosh $250,000 grant for roadwork near new arena|publisher=FDLReporter.com|date=June 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2017, the [[Menominee]] Native American tribe announced that they had purchased the naming rights to the arena, giving it the '''Menominee Nation Arena''' name.

'''Merlis Belsher Place''' is an arena located at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. It is the current home of the [[University of Saskatchewan Huskies]] men and women's hockey teams, as well as the Saskatoon Contacts and Saskatoon Stars of the Saskatoon Minor Hockey Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4300119/saskatoon-stars-contacts-merlis-belsher-place/ |title=Saskatoon Stars and Contacts moving to Merlis Belsher Place |publisher=Global News |date=June 27, 2018 |website=Global News |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2016, the University of Saskatchewan announced plans to build a new athletics facility to replace the 90 year-old [[Rutherford Arena]]. Originally budgeted to cost $41 million dollars, the University sought to raise the necessary funds through its Home Ice Campaign, which sought donations and fundraising opportunities from alumni, minor hockey associations, and the City of Saskatoon. The arena was named in honour of Merlis Belsher, an alumni of the University's Faculty of Law, following a donation of $12.25 million dollars to the Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/university-of-saskatchewan-announces-plan-for-new-41-million-rink-1.3114160 |title=University of Saskatchewan announces plan for new $41-million rink |publisher=CTV Saskatoon |date=October 13, 2016 |website=CTV Saskatoon |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the facility officially began on April 28, 2017 with a ground-breaking ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3414789/merlis-belsher-place-ground-breaking-at-university-of-saskatchewan/ |title=Merlis Belsher Place groundbreaking ceremony held at University of Saskatchewan |publisher=Global News |date=April 28, 2017 |website=Global News |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena was completed in time for the beginning of the 2018-19 Huskies season, with the women's team hosting the first game in the arena's history on October 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadawest.org/sports/wice/2018-19/releases/20181006ely0x7 |title=WHKY: Huskies shutout Pandas, open Merlis Belsher Place in style |date=October 5, 2018 |website=Canada West |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Merlis Belsher Place was designed to replace several aging facilities at the University of Saskatchewan. As part of an agreement with the City of Saskatoon, Merlis Belsher Place features two NHL-sized ice surfaces which can be utilized year round and will provide an added 1,500 hours of icetime for minor hockey in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.usask.ca/articles/huskies/2017/city-boosts-support-for-home-ice-campaign.php |title=City boosts support for Home Ice Campaign |access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility also features two NBA-sized [[basketball]] courts which will be used as practice space for the University's basketball teams, as well as team rooms for the University's soccer teams and numerous change rooms that are meant to be used by community groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merlisbelsherplace.ca/facility/ |title=About Us |access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basketball courts are named in honour of Ron and Jane Graham, who contributed $4 million dollars to ensure their inclusion in the new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alumni.usask.ca/news/2018/merlis-belsher-place-construction-hits-halfway-mark.php |title=Merlis Belsher Place construction hits halfway mark  |access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molde idrettspark''', until 1998 known as '''Molde stadion''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Molde]], [[Norway]]. It serves as the home ground for the [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] team [[IL Molde-Olymp]] and the [[association football|football]] clubs [[SK Træff]] and reserve and development teams of [[Molde FK]]. Prior to the 1998 opening of [[Aker Stadion]] it also served as the home ground for Molde FK's [[Norwegian Premier League]] team. The stadium opened on 28 August 1955 and has a capacity for 15,000 spectators.

==History==
The venue opened on 28 August 1955 in a league match between Molde FK and [[Kristiansund FK]], with the home team winning 1–0. Until then Molde FK had been playing their games at Rivalbanen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moldefk.no/1950-1959/article/eo9fuzov2g0s1x7po8ja6s6ic/title/1955 |title=1955 |publisher=[[Molde FK]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molde played in the top league, the [[Tippeligaen|Main League]] in 1958, after which the stadium was not used for top-level football again until Molde was promoted to the [[1974 Norwegian First Division]]. That year saw an expansion of the terraces. The seated stand was built by the club in the mid-1980s. However, the costs were too much for the club to bear and was a contributing factor to the club's near bankruptcy in 1991. The record attendance of 14,615 dates from a 1987 match against [[Moss FK]]. The A-team moved to Molde Stadion (now Aker Stadion) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfkweb.org/anlegg.php?vis=idrettspark |title=Molde idrettspark |publisher=MFKweb |language=Norwegian |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1266">The '''[[National Paralympic Committee]] of [[Zambia]]''' (NPCZ) is a member of the [[International Paralympic Committee]]. It was set up in 2005, replacing the Zambia Sports Federation of the Disabled. Funded by the government, it aims to ensure the training of coaches for athletes with disabilities, to facilitate the forming of sports clubs, to organise disability games, to spot and train young athletes, and to enhance the latter's confidence. Its first (and so far only) President is former wheelchair marathon athlete and Paralympian [[Lango Sinkamba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/magazine/120209154614856_TheParalympian_2008_01.pdf "NPC Profile: A Remarkable Presidency"], ''The Paralympian'', issue 1, 2008, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.paralympic.org/zambia Zambian National Paralympic Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pace of play''' is an issue concerning [[college baseball]] and [[professional baseball]] regarding the length of games.

Game length in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) began increasing, with the [[1988 New York Yankees season|1988 New York Yankees]] being the first team to average over three hours per game.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Dayn |url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/chart-the-rise-of-the-three-hour-baseball-game/ |title=CHART: The rise of the three-hour baseball game |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=August 27, 2014 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 through 2014, MLB games had increased from an average of 2.85 hours to 3.13 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/mlb-games-length-three-hours-pace-of-play |title=Why are baseball games getting so much longer? &amp;#124; For The Win |publisher=Ftw.usatoday.com |date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in spite of decreases in scoring, with MLB teams scoring 4.1 runs per game in 2014, down from 5.14 in 2000.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;

In college baseball, the [[Southeastern Conference]] experimented with a 20-second [[pitch clock]] during the 2010 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/05/pitch-clock-for-baseball-experiment-begins-in-sec/1|title=Pitch clock for baseball? Experiment begins in SEC|work=USATODAY.COM|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] instituted the pitch clock before the 2011 season for when no runners are on base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2011/03/ncaa_rules_for_college_basebal.html |title=NCAA rules for college baseball are designed to speed up the game |publisher=NOLA.com |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 2014 season, the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]] instituted its own changes. These included a 12-second pitch clock, reducing timeouts, warm-up pitches, making [[intentional walk]]s automatic by signalling the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], rather than throwing four intentional [[ball (baseball statistics)|balls]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/08/05/atlantic-league-pace-of-play-mlb&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arizona Fall League]] began using a pitch clock 2014 and the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] and [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] levels of [[Minor League Baseball]] followed suit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pitch clock for Double-A, Triple-A use|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12172716/mlb-use-pitch-clock-double-triple-games|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those levels saw a 12-minute reduction in game times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20151009&amp;content_id=152478810&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=toolshed&amp;sid=milb|title=Minor League Baseball Toolshed: Pitch clocks do their job in debut season - MiLB.com News - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 2014 season, [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Bud Selig]] announced the formation of a committee to examine the issue. [[John Schuerholz]] chaired the committee, which also included [[Sandy Alderson]], [[Tony Clark]], [[Rob Manfred]], [[Joe Torre]], and [[Tom Werner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/mlb-creates-committee-to-improve-pace-of-games |title=MLB creates committee to improve pace of games &amp;#124; For The Win |publisher=Ftw.usatoday.com |date=September 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manfred, having succeeded Selig as the Commissioner in 2015, instituted rule changes to MLB before the start of the [[2015 MLB season]] to address pace of play, including having batters remain in the [[batters box]] and the installation of time clocks to limit the time spent around [[commercial break]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/story/sports/2015/02/20/mlb-pace-of-play-rule-changes/23771199/|title=Rob Manfred thinks inside the box to speed up MLB games|date=February 20, 2015|work=KSDK|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, MLB had a committee discuss bringing back the [[bullpen car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/12568605/mlb-mlb-bring-back-bullpen-carts|title=Time to bring back bullpen carts?|work=ESPN.com|first=Jerry|last=Crasnick|date=March 31, 2015|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-is-reportedly-considering-bringing-back-bullpen-carts-to-improve-pace-of-play/|title=MLB is reportedly considering bringing back bullpen carts to improve pace of play: Bullpen carts are viewed as a potential answer to the pace of play problem|first=R.J.|last=Anderson|publisher=CBS Sports|date=February 2, 2018|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the [[2017 MLB season]], the rules were amended to allow a [[manager (baseball)|manager]] to order an automatic intentional walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/baseball-makes-intentional-walk-easier-faster-w468401|title=Major League Baseball Eliminates One of Its Most Annoying Rules|last=Rafferty|first=Scott|date=February 22, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 11, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB and the [[MLB Players Association]] (MLBPA) discussed the possibility of introducing the pitch clock at the major league level for the 2018 season.&lt;ref name=opinions&gt;{{cite web|last=Castrovince |first=Anthony |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/opinions-differ-on-mlb-pitch-clock/c-265068962 |title=Opinions differ on MLB pitch clock |publisher=MLB.com |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB opted against imposing it unilaterally, over the opposition of the MLBPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USA TODAY Sports |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/02/19/mlb-no-pitch-clock-2018-but-mound-visits-warm-up-times-limited/351422002/ |title=MLB pace of play: No pitch clock in 2018, but mound visits limited |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=February 19, 2018 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2018 season, MiLB took major actions, including adding pitch clocks at all levels and beginning each [[extra inning]] with a runner on second base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/sports/baseball/minor-leagues-pace-of-play.html |title=Minor League Baseball Expands Pace-of-Play Rules - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] of MLB announced they would introduce their first bullpen car in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/22665199/arizona-diamondbacks-use-golf-cart-bring-relief-pitchers-2018|title=Golf cart to bring in relief pitchers is reborn with Diamondbacks|first=Darren|last=Rovell|work=ESPN.com|date=March 6, 2018|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Primus''' stove, the first [[Portable_stove#Pressurized_liquid_fuel_stoves|pressurized-burner]] [[kerosene]] (paraffin) stove, was developed in 1892 by [[Frans Wilhelm Lindqvist]], a factory mechanic in [[Stockholm]]. The stove was based on the design of the hand-held [[blowtorch]]; Lindqvist’s patent covered the burner, which was turned upward on the stove instead of outward as on the blowtorch.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Patent No. 3944 (Nov. 19, 1892)&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Lindqvist partnered with {{Interlanguage link multi|Johan Viktor Svenson|sv|3=J.V._Svenson}} and established J.V. Svenson’s Kerosene Stove Factory for manufacturing the new stoves which were sold under the name [[Primus AB|Primus]].&lt;ref name="Primus AB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primus.se/Templates/Pages/3_cols_white_middle.aspx?SectionId=5890 |title=Primus |accessdate=2009-05-08 |work=Primus website |publisher=Primus AB}} &lt;/ref&gt; The first model was the No.1 stove, which was quickly followed by a number of similarly-designed stoves of different models and sizes.&lt;ref&gt; Primus Catalog No. 2 (Sept. 1, 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, B.A. Hjorth &amp; Co. (later [[Bahco]]), a tool and engineering firm begun in Stockholm in 1889, acquired the exclusive rights to sell the Primus stove.&lt;ref&gt; A. Room, “Dictionary of Trade Name Origins,” p.142 (NTC Business Books 2d Ed. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficient Primus stove quickly earned a reputation as a reliable and durable stove in everyday use, and it performed especially well under adverse conditions: it was the stove of choice for [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Fridtjof Nansen's North Pole attempt]],  Roald [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]],&lt;ref&gt; R. Amundsen, “The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the “Fram,”1910-1912,” Vol. 1, p.63 (Kessinger Publishing 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd’s]] North Pole expedition.&lt;ref&gt; L. Rose, “Explorer: the life of Richard E. Byrd,” p.88 (University of Missouri Press 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Primus stoves also accompanied [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|George Mallory's ill-fated expedition to Mount Everest in 1924]],&lt;ref&gt; R. Messner, “The Second Death of George Mallory: The Enigma and Spirit of Mount Everest,” p.58” (Macmillan 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|Tenzing and Hillary's successful one in 1953]].&lt;ref&gt; E. Hillary, “View from the Summit,” p.2 (Simon &amp; Schuster 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; While many other companies also made portable stoves of a similar design to the Primus, this style is often [[Generic trademark|generically referred to]] as a “Primus” stove, regardless of the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt; H. Manning, “Backpacking, One Step at a Time,” p.274 (Vintage Books 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The Primus No. 1 stove, made of [[brass]], consists of a fuel tank at the base, above which is a "rising tube" and the burner assembly. A steel top ring on which to set a pot is held above the burner by three support legs. Other Primus-style stoves may be larger or smaller, but have the same basic design. The No. 1 stove weighs about 2½ pounds, and measures about 8½ inches high with an overall diameter of just under 7 inches. The tank, about 3½ inches high, holds a little over two pints of kerosene and will burn for about four hours on a full tank.&lt;ref&gt; Primus Catalog No. 17100E, p.2 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Scheme Burnerhead Primus.JPG|right|thumb|275px|
Illustration of Burner Assembly. A: Rising tube (from fuel tank); B: Ascending tube; C: Burner head; D: Descending tube; E: Vapor nozzle. The ascending tubes and descending tubes are at right angles to one another.]]
[[Image:Primus Stove.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Primus Stove components]]
To light the stove, the user pours a small amount of [[alcohol]] into a circular "spirit cup" just below the burner and lights it to pre-heat the burner assembly.  When it is hot, the user pressurizes the tank by means of a small hand pump integrated into the housing, which forces kerosene from the tank up through the rising tube (A) and the ascending pipe (B) to the pre-heated burner head (C), where the fuel is heated and vapourized. The kerosene [[vapour]] is then forced under pressure through the descending tube (D) to the vapour nozzle (E); here it sprays through a jet in the middle of the burner, where it mixes with air and burns in a sootless blue flame.  The heat from that flame vapourizes more fuel to sustain the process when the spirit cup burns out.  The user can pump the tank more to increase the pressure and make the flame larger; turning a small "air screw" (usually located in the filler cap) will release pressure from the tank and make the flame smaller.&lt;ref&gt; Primus "Instructions for use" Hang Tag (undated, circa 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

If no alcohol is available for lighting, a twist of cloth or even dry grass will form a wick in the spirit cup.  Pumping once will dispense a small amount of kerosene to dribble down into the cup which will then light using the wick.  As the flame dies down, a further gentle pump will either ignite the main burner or dispense more kerosene into the spirit cup.

Prior to the introduction of the Primus, kerosene stoves were constructed in the same manner as [[oil lamp]]s, which use a wick to draw fuel from the tank to the burner and which produce a great deal of [[soot]] due to incomplete combustion. The Primus stove's design, which uses pressure and heat to vapourize the kerosene before ignition, results in a hotter, more efficient stove that does not soot.&lt;ref&gt;C. Hale, "Domestic Science, Part II" pp.81-82 (Cambridge University Press 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; Because it did not use a wick and did not produce soot, the Primus stove was advertised as the first "sootless" and "wickless" stove.&lt;ref&gt; Primus Catalog No. 2, p.3 (Sept. 1, 1897)&lt;/ref&gt;

The push-and-run style involved quickly laying the ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect the return pass. It proved an effective way to move the ball at pace, with players' positions and responsibility being fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ron Burgess: Titanic presence at Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ron-burgess-484252.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2005-02-21 |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1950–51 in English football|1951]] they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division Championship]] and became the first side to win [[Football League Second Division|Second]] and First Divisions in successive seasons.

==Origin==
The "push and run" style of play was first developed by Arthur Rowe at Tottenham Hotspur. Rowe himself would credit [[Peter McWilliam]], the Spurs manager under whom he served, with teaching him how to play a quick passing style of game from which Rowe then extended into "push and run".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlVGrgEACAAJ|title=The Biography of Tottenham Hotspur |first=Julie|last= Welch |publisher=Vision Sports Publishing|date= 7 September 2015 |isbn= 9781909534506 |chapter=Chapter 7: Success is the Best Revenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This possession-based game of play of McWilliam has been traced back to Scottish players who first conceived of the idea of keeping possession of the ball instead of dribbling and charging in their first ever football international against England in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/sep/18/barcelona-gerardo-martino-tiki-taka |title=Barcelona v Ajax and a philosophical line that stretches back to 1872 |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |date= 18 September 2013 |work= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Rowe, McWilliam also taught other Spurs players such as [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] and [[Vic Buckingham]] such possession-based passing game. Buckingham would then pass on this pass-and-move style of play when he went on to manage Barcelona and Ajax, where it would influence the development of [[Total Football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ahalftimereport.com/2016/07/19/peter-mcwilliam-the-tottenham-boss-who-created-legends/ |title=Peter McWilliam: The Tottenham Boss Who Created Legends |date= 19 July 2016 |work=A Halftime Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ringette''' is a team sport with two variations, an indoor and an outdoor version. The winter sport is played on an [[ice rink]].  One indoor court version is called gym ringette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ontario-ringette.com/gymringette.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221082720/http://www.ontario-ringette.com/gymringette.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game objective is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an [[ice]] surface, primarily by females, and requires the use of ice hockey skates. The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick with no blade. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features is the fact that it does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among female participants, the sport is officially mixed.

In the sport's home nation, Canada, the nations elite ringette players play in the [[National Ringette League]] (NRL). The final competition is held annually at the [[Canadian Ringette Championships]]. The winning team in the NRL division is awarded the [[Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ringette.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CRC-Trophies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; named after the late [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Jeanne Sauvé]]. Initially coined the ''Jeanne Sauvé Cup'' and initiated in December 1984, it was first presented at the 1985 Canadian Ringette Championships in [[Dollard des Ormeaux]], [[Québec]]. It is now entitled the '''''Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup''''', in memory of the late Governor General of Canada and is awarded to the best team in the National Ringette League.

==History==
Ringette is a winter season team sport played on an ice rink using ice skates. From its beginnings on a skating rink in 1963 in Espanola, Ontario, the sport has spread to the United States, Finland, Sweden, and France. In Canada, an annual national level competition is held called the Canadian Ringette Championships. The sport is also included in the [[Canada Winter Games]].

Ringette was invented in 1963 by the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA), led by the two founders of ringette, [[Sam Jacks]], from West Ferris, Ontario, director of Parks and Recreation for the city of [[North Bay, Ontario]] and [[Mirl "Red" McCarthy]], recreation director for the town of [[Espanola, Ontario]]. The title of birthplace of ringette is shared by both North Bay, Ontario, and Espanola, Ontario, where the first game was played in the fall of 1963 under the direction of McCarthy. 

NORDA was a regional organization composed of members from a large area that included the [[Ontario]] communities of North Bay, Espanola, [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Elliot Lake, Ontario|Elliot Lake]], [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]], [[Sturgeon Falls, Ontario|Sturgeon Falls]], [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], Onaping and Phelps, as well as [[Témiscaming]], [[Québec]]. This body recognized the problem of limited girls' winter recreational programmes and decided to find a solution.

===Naming the sport===

The first time the name "ringette" is mentioned was at the NORDA meetings held on January 20 and 21, 1963 in Sudbury, Ontario. Sam Jacks advised the group that "he had been working on a new girls' court game". Jacks had first considered an inside floor game for females, presumably based on his previous success with floor hockey.

At their September 15 and 16, 1963 meeting at North Bay's [[RCAF]] base, Sam Jacks informed the group that he would "like to have NORDA receive credit as a body for the birth of this game." Each one of the sports directors left this meeting agreeing to develop the game in their own community and report their findings at the next NORDA meeting in early 1964.

===First game===

Under the guidance of Mirl Arthur "Red" McCarthy, the first game of ringette was held between Espanola high school girls at the Espanola Arena in the fall of 1963. He wrote up a set of rules and created a ring for this occasion, still on display inside the Espanola arena.

In 1963-1964, McCarthy's original ringette rules became experimental in the following Northern Ontario and Quebec communities:

* Espanola, Ontario Arena
* Onaping, Ontario Playground
* Sudbury, Ontario Kingsway Playground
* Sudbury Grace Playground
* Sudbury Adamsdale Playground
* Sudbury Barrydowne Playground
* Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario
* Témiscaming, Québec Arena

McCarthy presented a written list of rules which he had developed, combined with comments and observations to NORDA at their meeting at Moose Lake Lodge in Onaping, Ontario (Sudbury), on January 19 and 20, 1964.

===First league===

In 1964-1965, Sudbury, Ontario formed the first ever ringette league, comprising four teams. Diana Heit, assistant program director of Sudbury Parks and Recreation department, helped the teams with schedules, rules, and coaching.

===First invitational tournament===

On March 5, 1966, the first invitational tournament, the Northern Ontario and Quebec championships, was held in Temiscaming, Quebec. The tournament took place with five teams participating: North Bay Police Playground, Sudbury Rose Marie Playground, Sudbury East End Playground, Temiscaming Reds, and Temiscaming Whites. The tournament was won by the Temiscaming Reds team. This historic tournament created many firsts for the game of ringette:

# The first ringette tournament.
# The first interprovincial tournament.
# The first tournament in Quebec.
# The first tournament for the Canadian and World Championship.
# The first indoor tournament.
# The first tournament on artificial ice.
# The first crests ever created and awarded for the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Kenneth|title=The Ring Starts Here: An Illustrated History of Ringette|year=2004|publisher=[[Highway Book Shop]]|location=Cobalt,Ontario|isbn=0-88954-438-7|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringette was introduced in North Bay on January 21, 1965, at the Kiwanis Playground with teams from Kiwanis and Police zones participating. The game ended in a 5-5 overtime tie. Attempts were being made to form a four-team league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=North Bay Nugget|date=January 23, 1965|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in ringette came slowly to North Bay as ice time was seldom available. It was not until 1971-72 that West Ferris, Ontario, today part of North Bay, had a four-team league operating.

===Introduction to Quebec===

Ringette was introduced to the province of Québec by Bob Reid, director of recreation for Témiscaming, secretary, and chairman of NORDA.

===Further developments===

By 1965-66, NORDA decided that they had carried the game about as far as it could go. The Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO) was chosen to develop and organize it further on a larger scale.

By 1973, an agreement was worked out between SDMRO and the Ontario Ringette Association (ORA) where the copyright to the Official Ringette Rules would be held by the ORA. Finally, in 1983 in agreement with the ORA, these rights were acquired by Ringette Canada.

==The legacy of Samuel and Agnes Jacks==

The West Ferris Arena, today called the '''West Ferris Centennial Community Centre''', was built in 1967, four years after the birth of the sport in 1963 at the Espanola arena. The West Ferris arena, surrounding ball fields, and tennis courts is together called the Sam Jacks Recreational Complex.

After Sam Jacks died in May 1975, his wife Agnes promoted the game and acted as an ambassador for the sport until her own death in April 2005. She was awarded the [[Order of Canada]].

==The legacy of Mirl "Red" McCarthy==

* [http://www.ringette.ca/our-sport/hall-of-fame Ringette Canada Hall of Fame] - Founder (1988)
* Sudbury Sport Hall of Fame (2007)
* Mirl "Red" McCarthy Memorial Trophy - awarded to top Coach in [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]]
* Recreational Director Espanola, Ontario for 41 years.
* Athletic complex in Espanola named the "Red McCarthy Memorial Athletic Fields". 
* Ringette is one of four sports featured on the "Canadian Inventions: Sports" series issued by Canada Post stamps on August 10, 2009.[4]

==Basic rules of play==
The format of game is 2 halves with 15 minutes in each period.

However, in the National Ringette League the format of the game is 4 quarters 15 minutes each with a 15-minute break between the second and third quarters. 
===Players===
Only six players on each team are permitted on the ice at one time, one [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]], two [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]], two [[Defense (sport)|defenders]], and a [[goaltender]].

===Pulling the goalie===

A team may pull the goalie off the ice and one more player may go in the offensive or defensive end. If the goalie is pulled and the play returns to that team's defensive end, one skater may become an acting goaltender. Once she enters the [[Ringette#Crease|crease]], she is bound by the same rules as a regular goaltender.

===Center Ice  Free Pass===
The game begins with the visiting team receiving control of the ring on the defending half of the center circle.  One player from the visiting team must pass the ring to another player within five seconds, without leaving the half circle or crossing the centre line, or else possession is lost and granted to the home team.

===Blue lines===
Players are not permitted to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they must advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but does not need to be under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team touches the ring.

If a goaltender throws the ring across the blue line, a delayed [[Ringette#Violations|violation]] is signalled. The goaltender may use their stick to pass the ring over the blue line.

===Free Play Line ({{aka}} Ringette Line)===
The red line at the top of the defensive circles is called the Free Play Line.  It marks the restricted area of each team's attacking/defending zones.  Only three players from each team, plus the defending goaltender, are permitted into the restricted areas.

Exceptions include:
* The defending team must have one player out of the free play area.  If a team has two penalized players, only two players in addition to the goaltender may be in the zone.
*  If a team has pulled their goaltender, an additional player is allowed into the attacking or defending zone.  The goaltender must be completely off the ice before the additional player is permitted to enter. Once the goalie is pulled, any of the players from that team may enter the goaltender's crease and play as goalie &amp;ndash; but cannot carry the ring out of the crease.

If the violation is non-intentional, the team in violation will lose possession of the ring and have it granted to the non-offending team.  If the violation is deemed intentional, a delay of game penalty is assessed (rare).  If an intentional violation occurs in the last two minutes of the game, a penalty shot is awarded instead. The Extended Zone Line is also known as the "ringette line".

===Crease===
The crease is essentially an invisible wall from ice to ceiling located in front of the goal mouth and defined by a red semi circle on the ice. Goaltenders are the only players permitted in the crease. If a member of the team with ring possession violates the crease with a stick, skate, arm, etc., the play is stopped and the goalie receives the ring. If any member of the non-possession team violates the crease, their team cannot touch the ring for five seconds (counted by the referee), or possession of the ring is given to the other team.

When the ring enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the ring out to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is awarded to the other team for a free pass from one of the defensive free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.

The team in possession of the ring has 30 seconds to shoot, it is not always played this way with the younger girls (Active start, and U10), or it gives up possession to the other team. The shot clock is reset when possession of the ring changes teams, when the ring stops in the goaltender's crease, or when the ring bounces off of the goalie or the front of the goal posts. The shot clock is only applied in competitive levels, starting at the petite level (U12).

===Violations===
A violation is a minor penalty called for violations of game play rules, usually due to improper movement or handling of the ring.  Common violations include entering the crease, touching the ring on either side of the blue line, four players in the zone and 2 (blue) line passes.

If a violation is committed by the team in possession of the ring, play is stopped immediately.  The ring is awarded to the opposing team in the zone the violation occurred.  If a violation is committed by the team not in possession of the ring, a 'delayed violation' is signaled by the official (arm raised with a 90 degree bend at the elbow) and a 5-second count begins.  If the team in violation touches the ring within that time period, play is stopped and the violation is assessed.  If the count expires, the violation is dropped and play continues.

If a violation occurs that would award the defending team a free pass in their own zone, the ring is given to the goaltender as a "goalie ring".  Play resumes immediately when the goaltender receives the ring.  Time is not provided for teams to perform line changes as can be done on a free pass, although on-the-fly changes are permitted as in normal play.

===Penalties===
Penalties in ringette have the same concept as in hockey, with the notable exception that less body contact is allowed, and fighting has a zero-tolerance policy. Penalties are of the following classes:

* Minor penalties, such as boarding, charging, cross checking, elbowing, holding, illegal substitution, hooking, high-sticking, tripping, body contact, slashing, unsportsmanlike conduct and interference. The offending player must sit in the [[penalty box]] for two or four minutes depending on the severity of the penalty (other exceptions apply) and her team plays short-handed.  The penalty ends when the team with the penalty is scored on, or the penalty time runs out.  (If the defense is serving two penalties, the oldest penalty ends.)
* A major penalty is assessed for serious offenses, generally involving intent to injure or an intentional penalty action to prevent a shot during the attacking team's breakaway. Major penalties are four minutes in length and do not end upon the scoring of a goal. Interruption of a breakaway by a penalty action can result in a penalty shot.

-- body contact, slashing, tripping, boarding, charging and any other physical contact penalty, and unsportsmanlike can become a four-minute major penalty depending on the severity and roughness. Players may also receive multiple penalties at the same time for a combination of four or more minutes.

* Misconduct and Match penalties may also be called.  They result in a player's ejection from the game. Misconduct and Major penalties also incur a two- or four-minute fully served penalty to be served by a teammate, unless the penalty is assessed to a non-playing bench member.

When a penalty is assessed against the goalie, a teammate on the ice at the time of the offence must serve it.

If the team not in control of the ring commits a penalty, play is not stopped until the penalized team gains control. This is called a delayed penalty. A minor penalty is nullified if a goal is scored during the delay, unless penalties of equal class were called on both teams. While the penalty is delayed, the attacking team can add a sixth skater to the ice by pulling their goalie. This player can enter the play zone as the fourth attacker.

A team can work off at most two penalties at a time. If a team commits a third penalty, the penalized player sits in the penalty box, but her interval does not start until the first of the other penalties expires (and so forth if there are more penalties).  A team plays with a minimum of three skaters on the ice, regardless of the number of penalties. If freeing a player from the penalty box would give the team more players on the ice than it is entitled to (such as when the team is down to three attackers, but there are two other players in the penalty box), she will not be freed until a whistle stops play.  During the stoppage, the team must remove one player from the ice to return to its proper strength.

A team with two penalties can have only two players (instead of the usual three) in its defensive zone. But if a third person is active in the defensive zone while two man down a third penalty will be called. If there is a third penalty that penalty time does not start till the first penalty is over. All three players may enter the offensive zone.

==Equipment==
Required equipment for ringette is similar to ice hockey:
* ringette stick &amp;ndash; are generally lightweight composite or hollow wood, with metal or ridged plastic tips. Heavily splintered sticks are not permitted.
* ringette ring
* ice skates &amp;ndash; goalies may choose to use goalie skates
* shin pads, worn under the pants (or goalie pads)
* protective girdle (standard hockey pants are also permitted so long as the player wears a "cup" or a "jill" to protect genitals)
* ringette pants &amp;ndash; covering pants.
* ringette or hockey gloves 
* elbow pads
* jersey
* helmet with ringette facemask (must have a triangle bar pattern&amp;ndash;either full or half with a plexiglass shield for the eyes; square bars are disallowed because the stick tip can fit through the spaces)
* neck guard
* shoulder pads &amp;ndash; in some associations/provinces, shoulder pads are optional after U12. In Ontario, shoulder pads are necessary until 18+, other provinces may vary.
* mouthguard- in some leagues/provinces.
The ringette facemask is much like a hockey one except the bars are spaced so that the end of a ringette stick cannot enter the mask.  (bars are shaped as triangles, not squares)

Ringette sticks have tapered ends, with plastic or metal tips specially designed with grooves to increase the lift and velocity of the wrist shot. A ringette stick is also reinforced to withstand the body weight of a player &amp;ndash; a ring carrier leans heavily on his/her stick to prevent opposing players from removing the ring. Sticks are flexible and lightweight to bend without breaking.

==Olympic status==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Ringette is currently not in the Olympics. In its homeland of Canada, stemming the game in order to have the sport recognized by the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in the winter Olympic games is underway. Marketing methods have included using [[social media]] as well as word of mouth.

Ringette has thus far been excluded from the Olympics partly due to the fact that it must have 25% of each gender to qualify.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The sport is typically overlooked by male participants due to its lack of widespread recognition and the more widespread availability of other organized winter sports like ice hockey. Currently, there are not enough males with the skill to qualify for an Olympic team.

==Canadian status==

===Levels of play in Canada===

There are several levels of play in Ringette, categorized by age. Divisions were recently renamed as U* divisions under the new Long Term Development Plan (LTDP) rolled out nationally by [[Ringette Canada]] for the 2009-10 ringette season:
:'''U6-8''' under 6 or 8 years- this age division has been recently created by only a few associations. It is designed to introduce younger children to the sport and begin to develop skills at an early age. Typically, these young players play modified games (shorter time, no penalties, on half of the ice etc.)
:'''U8''' under 8 (previously called 'Bunny' division)
:'''U9 '''' Under 9 (this is a minor Novice Division)
:'''U10''' primarily 8 &amp; 9 years (previously called the 'Novice' division)
:'''U12''' 10- &amp; 11-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Petite' division)
:'''U14''' 12- &amp; 13-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Tween' division)
:'''U16''' 14- &amp; 15-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Junior' division)
:'''U19''' 16- to 18-year-old players (previously referred to as 'Jr Belle' or 'Belle' division)
:'''18+''' 18 years and older players (previously referred to as 'Open' or adult division, usually included lifelong players under 30)
:'''Masters''' 18 years and older, either lifelong players desiring a slower pace, or new players who begin as adults (this division is part of the league associations but excluded from Provincial tournaments)
'''NRL''' Known as the National Ringette league, for elite players aged 18+

In 2010 the league put back in place previous age groups.

Boys are permitted to play at any age level but are restricted to competing at the "B" level or lower in many places, however efforts to include male players at the AA level is increasing. It isn't uncommon to see boys participating above U9 or U6 divisions in some provinces. Due to the pure speed of the sport, skating is emphasized at these levels. Levels of competition, based on skill, range from recreational to competitive, and include: Rec, C, B, BB, A, and AA and AAA, with AA being the highest level at which league competition occurs.  AAA ringette is typically specific to particular regions who feel another category is necessary to clarify their league or tournament play. For example: AAA teams out of Quebec have played AA teams out of Alberta at various tournaments, including the National Championships. In Alberta, the highest level considered is AA, although they are deemed equal to the AAA teams from areas such as Quebec. For those who like the hockey parallel, playing AA ringette is the same as playing AAA hockey. The [[National Ringette League]] was introduced in 2004-2005 season and includes open-aged players at AA/AAA level.

=== National Ringette League ===
{{Main|National Ringette League}}
[[File:National Ringette League 03.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Bourassa Royal]] against [[Montréal Mission]] in NRL ]]

The National Ringette League (also indicated by the initials NRL) is an elite league of ringette in Canada. The NRL groups together the very best players over the age of 19 in Canada. The NRL consists of fifteen teams separated into two conferences. The Western Conference has 5 teams and the Eastern Conference has 10 teams. The NRL recovers directly from Ringette Canada, the guiding organisation for Ringette in Canada.

=== Canadian Championships ===
{{main|Canadian Ringette Championships}}
The Championnats Canadien d'Ringuette/Canadian Ringette Championships took place for the first time in 1979 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringette.ca/events/canadian-ringette-championships/|title=Canadian Ringette Championships - Ringette Canada|newspaper=Ringette Canada|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tournament was conceived so as to be able to determine who are the Canadian champions in the categories Under-16 years, Under-19 years and Open (replaced by the National Ringette League since 2008). The Canadian Championships of ringette usually take place in April of every year.

=== Canada Winter Games ===
The Canada Winter Games are a multi-sport competition of two weeks duration. The Canada Games represent an important national competition. Twenty one sports appear. Ringette takes part in the event during one of two weeks of the Canada Games. Usually the competition begins on Mondays followed by the semi-final on Friday evening and of the National final on Saturdays. The best ringette athletes of ten provinces meet under the banner of teams of each of the provinces there. The Winter Games are held in every 4 years.

Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players.

Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rugby union''', commonly known in most of the world as '''rugby''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/welcome-to-rugby/what-is-rugby|title=What is Rugby?|publisher=World Rugby|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|contact]] [[team sport]] which originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#2 |title=Origins of Rugby&amp;nbsp;– Codification "The innovation of running with the ball was introduced some time between 1820 and 1830." |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped [[rugby ball|ball]] on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.

Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members. 

In 1845, the first football laws were written by [[Rugby School]] pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and the split between rugby union and [[rugby league]] in 1895.  Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|accessdate=22 March 2015|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]]. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their ''de facto'' [[national sport]] include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |accessdate=1 December 2013 |title=Madagascar take Sevens honours |date=23 August 2007 |publisher=International Rugby Board |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGpxxkZd?url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |archivedate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga. 

International matches have taken place since 1871, when the first game took place between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The [[Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1987, takes place every four years. The [[Six Nations Championship]] in Europe and [[The Rugby Championship]] in the Southern Hemisphere are other major international competitions, held annually.

National club or provincial competitions include the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] in England, the [[Top 14]] in France, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] in New Zealand, the [[National Rugby Championship]] in Australia, and the [[Currie Cup]] in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the [[Pro14]] in Europe and South Africa, the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] solely in Europe, and [[Super Rugby]], in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan.

[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|box|thumb|[[Rugby School]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], with a rugby football pitch in the foreground|alt=A wide shot of an old English school with a central tower, a sports pitch is seen in the foreground.]]
The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of [[English public school football games|English school football]] at Rugby School in 1823, when [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] unveiled in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Flotsam|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/6/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=9 January 2009|seriesno=F|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = William Webb Ellis&amp;nbsp;– fact or fiction?|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_union/6255164.stm |first=Sean|last=Davies|publisher=BBC  |accessdate =20 September 2011|date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the doubtful evidence, the [[Webb Ellis Cup|Rugby World Cup trophy]] is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the [[English public school football games|form of game]] played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.

Old Rugbeian [[Albert Pell]], a student at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], is credited with having formed the first "football" team.&lt;ref name="Marshall13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and [[Eton College|Eton]] attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.&lt;ref name="Marshall13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-25946757 "Six ways the town of Rugby helped change the world"].

===First internationals===
The [[1871 England versus Scotland rugby union match|first rugby football international]] was played on 27 March 1871 between [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Scotland won the game 1-0.&lt;ref name="Godwin10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Historical Rugby Milestones 1870s|publisher=Rugby Football History|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first [[rugby sevens]] tournament, the [[Melrose Sevens]],&lt;ref name="Godwin12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still held annually.

Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|British Isles]] team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future [[British and Irish Lions]] tours;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |title=1888 Australia &amp; New Zealand |publisher=The British and irish Lions |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033526/http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]] brought the first overseas team to British spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Forerunners of the All Blacks |last=Ryan |first=Greg |publisher=Canterbury University Press |year=1993 |location=Christchurch, New Zealand|isbn=0-908812-30-2|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888{{mdash}}the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,&lt;ref name="Lions history"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/potted_history.php |title=The History |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |title=IRB Hall of Fame Welcomes Five Inductees |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824065112/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|1987|p=ix}} ''"In the first century of rugby union's history the IRB only recognised matches with international status if both teams in a match came from a small pool of countries: Australia, British Lions, England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales."''&lt;/ref&gt; Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/the-new-zealand-natives-rugby-tour/nz-natives-rugby-tour |title=New Zealand Natives' rugby tour of 1888–9 |publisher=New Zealand History Online |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.&lt;ref name="Lions history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/78377.html |title=Take a trip down memory lane courtesy of our historian John Griffiths |publisher=espnscrum.com |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2011}} ''"1 October: The original Wallabies beat a strong Gloucestershire XV 16–0 at Kingsholm, 2 October: The Invincible Second All Blacks have their toughest tour assignment when they are considered lucky to scrape home 13–10 against a star-studded Newport XV, 2 October: Argentina serve notice of their rapidly rising rugby stock by beating a Cardiff side captained by Gerald Davies."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand]] in 1905, followed by [[1906-07 South Africa rugby union tour|South Africa]] in 1906 and [[1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|Australia]] in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,&lt;ref name="Godwin, p18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were far more successful than critics had expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Rowe|1954|p=27}} ''"When they arrived in this country [Britain] they were regarded as an unknown quantity, but it was not anticipated that they would give the stronger British teams a great deal of opposition. The result of the very first match against Devon was regarded as a foregone conclusion by most British followers."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a [[Ka Mate|haka]] before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)|Tom Williams]] to suggest that Wales player [[Teddy Morgan]] lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The anthem in more recent years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-today.shtml|accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]|date=1 December 2008 |work=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Cymru Wales history]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Although the United States national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", was first sung before baseball games in the mid-19th century, it did not become the official national anthem until 1931.

Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19590.html Italy tour&amp;nbsp;– Bucharest, 14 April 1940] Romania vs Italy, Scrum.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19591.html Italy tour&amp;nbsp;– Stuttgart, 5 May 1940] Germany vs Italy, Scrum.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19592.html Romania tour&amp;nbsp;– Milan, 2 May 1942] Italy vs Romania, Scrum.com&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] continued their annual [[The Varsity Match|University Match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] centenary celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby in the Olympics: Future |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065813/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Cup and professionalism===
In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the [[Commonwealth Rugby Sevens Championships|Commonwealth Games]] in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.&lt;ref name="I.O.C. Decision"/&gt;

Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game "open" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players.&lt;ref name=Stubbs3&gt;{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of "[[shamateurism]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Ontario: The Shamateurs|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804253,00.html|work=TIME |date=29 September 1947|accessdate =6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Teams and positions==
{{main article|Rugby union positions}}
[[File:Rugby Union Formation.svg|thumb|A standard rugby union team formation illustrating each of the positions and their respective numbers.]]
Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field and seven or eight substitutes.&lt;ref name="Law3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=Law 3 Number of Players |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |page=33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players in a team are divided into eight [[Rugby union positions#Forwards|forwards]] (two more than in [[rugby league]]) and seven [[Rugby union positions#Backs|backs]].&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=6|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forwards===
The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.&lt;ref name="talkrugby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkrugbyunion.co.uk/guides/rugby_union_positions.html |title=Rugby Union Positions |publisher=talkrugbyunion.co.uk |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.&lt;ref name="talkrugby"/&gt; The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html|work=ESPN Scrum.com |title=Rugby Glossary |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Front row'''&lt;br /&gt;
The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rugbycoaching.net/rugby-coaching/rugby-positions-explained/|title=Rugby Positions Explained|publisher=Rugby Coaching|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second row'''&lt;br /&gt;
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/&gt; The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/&gt;
[[File:Chabal Rugby Racing vs Stade Toulousain 311009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sébastien Chabal]] (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum.|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersey, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition.]]
'''Back row'''&lt;br /&gt;
The back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/&gt; The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=7|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backs===
The backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.&lt;ref name="talkrugby"/&gt; Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.&lt;ref name="talkrugby"/&gt;

'''Half-backs'''&lt;br /&gt;
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/&gt; They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/&gt; Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/&gt; They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bompa|Claro|2008|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Three quarters'''&lt;br /&gt;
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/&gt; The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown, Guthrie and Growden|(2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish rugby welcomes back Lomu|date=7 January 2006|first=David|last=Ferguson |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/superteams/Scottish-rugby-welcomes-back-Lomu.2740238.jp|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fullback'''&lt;br /&gt;
The fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/&gt; Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.&lt;ref name = "MacDonald"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rugger Practice and Tactics&amp;nbsp;– A Manual of Rugby Football Technique |first=H.

===Scoring===
Rugby union is played between two teams&amp;nbsp;– the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=62–65 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long by {{convert|70|m|yd}} wide.&lt;ref name="pitch size"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |pages=25–30 |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt; Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the "twenty-two", which is {{convert|22|m|yd|0}} from the goal line.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt;

Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least {{convert|94|m|yd}} and the pitch must be at least {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt;

Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, {{convert|5.6|m|yd}} apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar {{convert|3|m|yd}} above the ground.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_union/six_nations/618637.stm |title=A beginner's guide to ... rugby laws |work=BBC |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match structure===
At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent’s 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] at the centre of the half-way line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=85–91 |title=Law 13 Kick-off and Restart Kicks |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will result.&lt;ref name=Midgley&gt;{{Cite book| last = Midgley| first = Ruth| title = The Official World Encyclopedia of Sports and Games| publisher=Diagram Group| year = 1979| location = London| url =|page=394 | isbn = 0-7092-0153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a [[Half-time|break]] in the middle.&lt;ref name="IRBLaw5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 5: Time |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=45–47 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.&lt;ref name="IRBLaw5"/&gt; Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.&lt;ref name="IRBLaw5"/&gt; The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper.&lt;ref name="IRBLaw5"/&gt; If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.&lt;ref name="IRBLaw5"/&gt;

In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |title=IRB Laws&amp;nbsp;– Time |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325160709/http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |archivedate=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.&lt;ref name="irblaws12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 12 Knock-on or Throw Forward |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=81–83 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways&amp;nbsp;— by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]]. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with their arms, a "knock-on" is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.&lt;ref name="irblaws12"/&gt;

Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into [[Touch (rugby)|touch]] so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.&lt;ref name="WRlaw19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=117–137 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.&lt;ref name="WRlaw19"/&gt;

===Breakdowns===
[[File:Schoolkids doing a rugby tackle.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent]]
The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.

'''Tackling'''

A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),&lt;ref name="10.4e"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(e) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230153/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or [[Ankle tap|ankle-tap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(d) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(g) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.&lt;ref name="10.4e"/&gt;

'''Rucking and Mauling'''

Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt;

===Set pieces===

====Lineout====
:{{Main article|Line-out (rugby union)}}

When the ball leaves the side of the field, a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.&lt;ref name="irblaws19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.&lt;ref name="irblaws19"/&gt; The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]]) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.&lt;ref name="irblaws19"/&gt; The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.&lt;ref name="irblaws19"/&gt;

Both sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |page=19.10 |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |page=19.8(p) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scrum====
{{Main article|Scrum (rugby union)}}
[[File:Scrum-1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]]|alt=Two opposing formations of eight men, in white and black to the left, red and black to the right, push against each other in a crouched position; behind them stands another player and the referee]]
A scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 20 Scrum |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=138–150 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over his own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally [[Offside (rugby)#Rugby union|offside]] or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt;

A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt; The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt; The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation.&lt;ref name="FormingScrum"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4205334.stm |title=Forming a scrum |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 August 2011 | date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the ''feed'' rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the ''tunnel''.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt; The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt; The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.&lt;ref name="WRlaw20"/&gt;

===Officials and offences===
{{main article|Rugby union match officials|Laws of rugby union}}
[[File:Touch_judge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Touch judge with flag.]]
There are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees.&lt;ref name="WRLaw6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 6: Match officials |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=48–57 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into "touch"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines.&lt;ref name="WRLaw6"/&gt; In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the "video referee"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/peter-bills-refereeing-protocol-rules-over-common-sense-2242369.html |title=Peter Bills: Refereeing protocol rules over common sense |work=The Independent|first=Peter|last=Bills |accessdate=15 March 2011 |date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachingrugby.com/OpenPagesContent.do?requestType1=currentIssues/&amp;requestType2=lawsSignals |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511235739/http://www.coachingrugby.com/OpenPagesContent.do?requestType1=currentIssues%2F&amp;requestType2=lawsSignals# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2006 |title=Referee Signals |work=coachingrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]], ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.&lt;ref name="WRLaw10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 10: Foul Play |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |pages=66–74 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.&lt;ref name="WRLaw10"/&gt; Players may be sent off (signalled by a [[Red card (sports)|red card]]) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes ([[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]]) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.&lt;ref name="WRLaw10"/&gt;

Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be "cited" by the [[citing commissioner]] after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/heinekencup/rules/index.php |title=European Club Rugby: Key Tournament Rules |work=ercrugby.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacements and substitutions===
During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).&lt;ref name="Law3"/&gt; A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.&lt;ref name="Law3"/&gt; In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.&lt;ref name="Law3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uncontested"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html#irb+acts+uncontested+scrums |title=IRB acts on uncontested scrums |publisher=[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822203000/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, [[World Rugby]] changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15885158/world-rugby-introduces-new-rules-stop-simulation |title=World Rugby introduces new rules to stop simulation |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
[[File:Rugbyball2.jpg|thumb|right|A synthetic rugby ball|alt=An oval shaped synthetic ball, white in colour with red trim, adorned with the manufacturers name.]]
{{main article|Rugby union equipment}}
The most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a [[rugby shirt]] (also known as a "jersey"), [[rugby shorts]], socks and [[Football boot#Different styles for different sports|boots]]. The rugby ball is oval in shape, (technically a [[prolate spheroid]]), and is made up of four panels.&lt;ref name="WRLaw2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 2 The Ball |pages=31–32 |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. The WR lays out specific dimensions for the ball, 280-300mm in length, 740-770mm in circumference of length and 580-620mm in circumference of width.&lt;ref name="WRLaw2"/&gt; Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.&lt;ref name="WRLaw4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 4 Players' clothing |pages=41–44 |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://collections.internetmemory.org/nli/20160331100945/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf# |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are [[mouthguard]]s, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachingtoolbox.co.nz/rugbysmart/protective-equipment/ |title=Protect Your Assets: Mouthguards |accessdate=23 September 2011|publisher= coaching toolbox.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other protective items that are permitted include [[scrum cap|head gear]]; thin (not more than 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads and [[shin guard]]s; which are worn underneath socks.&lt;ref name="WRLaw4"/&gt; Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads.&lt;ref name="WRLaw4"/&gt; Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.&lt;ref name="WRLaw4"/&gt;

It is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.&lt;ref name="WRLaw4"/&gt;

[[SANZAAR]] (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is a joint venture of the [[South African Rugby Union]], [[New Zealand Rugby]], [[Rugby Australia]] and the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] (UAR) that operates [[Super Rugby]] and [[The Rugby Championship]] (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=rugbyweek.com | title=SANZAAR Boss Peters defends TriNations timing | url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/article.asp?id=31407 | accessdate=24 September 2011 | date=4 August 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326201127/http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/article.asp?id=31407 | archivedate=26 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although UAR initially had no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allblacks.com/news/18009/SANZAR-remains-intact |title=SANZAR remains intact |first=James |last=Mortimer |work=[[New Zealand Rugby Union|AllBlacks.com]] |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super Rugby).

National unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to WR. Since 2016, the WR Council has 40 seats.

The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were [[Rugby union in England|England]], the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, [[Rugby union in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Rugby union in Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Rugby union in Wales|Wales]]. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel, and overseas university students.
The first rugby club in [[Rugby union in France|France]] was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year [[Rugby union in Argentina|Argentina]] recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Godwin11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
A rugby club was formed in Sydney, [[New South Wales]], [[Rugby union in Australia|Australia]] in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to [[Rugby union in New Zealand|New Zealand]] by [[Charles John Monro|Charles Monro]] in 1870, who played rugby while a student at [[Christ's College (Finchley)|Christ's College, Finchley]].&lt;ref name="Godwin10"/&gt;

Several island nations have embraced the sport of rugby.

===North America and Caribbean===
{{see also|Rugby Americas North}}

In North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, [[Rugby union in Canada|Canada's]] first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the [[Rugby union in the United States|United States]], when students of [[McGill University]] played against a team from [[Harvard University]] in 1874.&lt;ref name="Godwin10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin11"/&gt;

Although the exact date of arrival of [[rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago]] is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to [[British Guiana]] in 1933, switched their venue to [[Rugby union in Barbados|Barbados]]; introducing rugby to the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include [[Rugby union in Jamaica|Jamaica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |title=Jamaica |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002800/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rugby union in Bermuda|Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |title=Bermuda |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915192248/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |archivedate=15 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Germany vs Belgium rugby match.jpg|thumb|Germany playing [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]]]]
The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Poland|Poland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy]] and [[Rugby union in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="FIRA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79–94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, instigated by the [[French Rugby Federation]], FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB.&lt;ref name="FIRA"/&gt; The founding members were {{runion|ITA}}, {{runion|ROM}}, {{runion|NLD}}, {{runion|POR}}, {{runion|CSK}}, and {{runion|SWE}}.

Other European rugby playing nations of note include [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby union in Portugal]] also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of [[Rugby Europe]] in 2014.

===South America===
[[File:URBA Finals.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine teams [[Asociación Alumni|Alumni]] and [[Hindú Club|Hindú]] playing the [[Torneo de la URBA]] final match in 2007.]]

Although [[Argentina]] is the best-known rugby playing nation in [[South America]], founding the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8362870.stm | title=Puma power: Argentinian rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date=16 November 2009 | accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in [[Rugby union in Brazil|Brazil]] since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when São Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Rugby union in Uruguay|Uruguay]] several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the [[Montevideo Cricket Club]]; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include [[Rugby union in Chile|Chile]] (1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rugby union in Paraguay|Paraguay]] (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{main article|Rugby union in Asia}}
Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. [[Rugby union in India|India]] began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the [[Calcutta Football Club]] forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Calcutta-Cup/|title=The History of the Calcutta Cup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby union in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded match in [[Rugby union in Malaysia|Malaysia]] was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the ''HMS Malaya Cup'' which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby union was introduced to [[Rugby union in Japan|Japan]] in 1899 by two Cambridge students: [[Ginnosuke Tanaka]] and [[Edward Bramwell Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6157863.stm | title=Eastern Promise: Japanese rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date=12 February 2007 | accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented with the news that Japan will host the [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="2015 bid"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8170488.stm | title=England will host 2015 World Cup |work=BBC Sport  | date=28 July 2009 | accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and this is viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach,&lt;ref name="2015 bid"/&gt; particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include [[Rugby union in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Rugby union in South Korea|South Korea]], [[Rugby union in China|China]] and [[Rugby union in the Philippines |The Philippines]], while the former British colony of [[Rugby union in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] tournament which was founded in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2042721.html |title=HSBC join Cathay as Hong Kong Sevens sponsors |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204444/http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2042721.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of [[Rugby union in Oman|Oman]] was formed in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby union in Bahrain|Bahrain]] founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the [[Dubai Sevens]], the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with [[Rugby union in Israel|Israel]], as of 2011, being the only member union from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.&lt;ref name="Full rankings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |title=IRB World Rankings |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810042746/http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In 1875, rugby was introduced to [[Rugby union in South Africa|South Africa]] by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town.&lt;ref name="Godwin11"/&gt; During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesclark.com/rrr/kenya_rugby.html |title=A Review of Kenyan Rugby |publisher=wesclark.com|first=Michael Mundia |last=Kamau |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring [[Rugby union in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century [[Rugby union in Madagascar|Madagascar]] has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4471650.stm |title=Madagascar rugby inspires new passion |publisher=BBC Sport|first=Tim |last=Cocks|date=26 November 2005 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup four times since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8951401.stm |title=Namibia rugby: Out of Boks' shadow |publisher=BBC Sport|first=Sean |last=Davies|date=4 September 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other African nations to be represented in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include [[Rugby union in Côte d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Rugby union in Kenya|Kenya]], [[Rugby union in Uganda|Uganda]] and [[Rugby union in Zambia|Zambia]].&lt;ref name="Full rankings"/&gt; South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 "core teams" that participate in every event of the men's [[World Rugby Sevens Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/destination/edition=9/news/newsid=2048923.html#teams+announced+gold+coast+kick |title=Teams announced for Gold Coast kickoff |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011152812/http://irbsevens.com/destination/edition=9/news/newsid=2048923.html |archivedate=11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, stating that she set up a rugby team in [[Portora Royal School]] in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/19918.php |title=Emily Valentine: First Lady Of Irish And World Rugby|work=IrishRugby.ie |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the [[Cardiff Arms Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=D.E. |title=Cardiff Rugby Club, History and Statistics 1876–1975 |year=1975 |publisher=The Starling Press |location=Risca|pages=70–71 |isbn=0-9504421-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 30 years the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and, according to WR, is now played in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/womensrugby/index.html |title=Great potential for Women's Rugby in Japan |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902103610/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/womensrugby/index.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby.&lt;ref name="WRFU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |title=RFUW: A Brief History |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903054707/http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |archivedate=3 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced in 1994 by the [[Rugby Football Union for Women]] (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries.&lt;ref name="WRFU"/&gt; The premier international competition in rugby union for women is the [[Women's Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1991.&lt;ref name="Women's Rugby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |title=Women's Rugby World Cup history |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=5 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903054707/http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 through 2014, it was held every four years.&lt;ref name="Women's Rugby"/&gt; Following the 2014 event, a new four-year cycle was instituted, with the Women's World Cup held in the middle year of the men's World Cup cycle.

===Rugby World Cup===

The most important tournament in rugby union is the [[Rugby World Cup]], a men's tournament that has taken place every four years since 1987 among national rugby union teams. [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] has won the Rugby World Cup the most (3 times) and is the current cup holder, winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup held at Twickenham, beating Australia in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/rugby-union/34671255 |title=New Zealand beat Australia to retain Rugby World Cup |publisher=BBC News |date=31 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rugby world cup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/2015-rugby-world-cup/rugby/page/87752.html |title=Rugby World Cup |publisher=espn.co.uk|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; England (2003) were the first team from the Northern Hemisphere to win, the other champions being New Zealand (1987, 2011 and 2015), Australia (1991 and 1999), and South Africa (1995 and 2007).&lt;ref name="rugby world cup"/&gt;

The Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987.&lt;ref name="IRB2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/newsmedia/mediazone/02/04/21/65/2042165_pdf.pdf |title=IRB Year in Review 2010 |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |page=74 |year=2010 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103163846/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/newsmedia/mediazone/02/04/21/65/2042165_pdf.pdf |archivedate=3 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230 million television viewers.&lt;ref name="IRB2010"/&gt; Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was less than a million.&lt;ref name="IRB2010"/&gt; The [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]] was contested by 94 countries with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage.&lt;ref name="IRB2010"/&gt; The accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, was a claimed 4.2 billion.&lt;ref name="IRB2010"/&gt;

===Regional tournaments===
Major international competitions are the [[Six Nations Championship]] and [[The Rugby Championship]], held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/trophys.htm |title=Rugby Trophys |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams {{nrut|England}}, {{nrut|France}}, {{nrut|Ireland}}, {{nrut|Italy}}, {{nrut|Scotland}} and {{nrut|Wales}}.&lt;ref name="SixNations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/championship/history.php |title=Six Nations Championship: History |publisher=rbs6nations.com  |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each country plays the other five once. After the initial internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the ''Home International Championships''.&lt;ref name="SixNations"/&gt; France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term ''Five Nations'' first appeared.&lt;ref name="SixNations"/&gt; However, the [[Home Nations]] (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2012/rugby/page/87742.html |title=Six Nations Championship |publisher=ESPN Scrum.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; France then rejoined in 1939–1940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years.&lt;ref name="SixNations"/&gt; France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947.&lt;ref name="SixNations"/&gt; In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's [[Stadio Olimpico]] has replaced [[Stadio Flaminio]], as the venue for their home games since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/1633.php |title=Stadio Flaminio |publisher=rbs6nations.com |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012536/http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/1633.php |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Six Nations champions are Ireland.

The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.&lt;ref name="TriNations History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/fournations/history.asp |title=TriNations Rugby |publisher=RugbyWeek.com |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019065904/http://www.rugbyweek.com/fournations/history.asp |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Boks-face-aerial-bombardment-20100630 |title=NZ expect aerial bombardment |publisher=sport24.co.za |first=J.J. |last=Harmse  |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 26 August 2010 | title = Preview: South Africa v Australia | work = Planet Rugby | publisher = 365 Media | url = http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,16024_6340553,00.html | accessdate = 27 August 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100830132624/http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,16024_6340553,00.html | archivedate = 30 August 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice.

In 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years.&lt;ref name="TriNations History"/&gt; Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/09/14/rugby.argentina.tri.nations/index.html  |title = Argentina invited to join Tri-Nations series|publisher=CNN|date = 14 September 2009|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, [[SANZAAR|SANZAR]] (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033716.html#irb+welcomes+argentina+four+nations+invite |title=IRB welcomes Argentina Four Nations Invite |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826090032/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033716.html |archivedate=26 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others only once. New Zealand are the current champions, having won the [[2018 Rugby Championship|2018 title]] with a round to spare.

{{See also|Rugby union at the Summer Olympics|Rugby sevens at the Commonwealth Games|Rugby union at the Asian Games}}
Rugby union was played at the Olympic Games in [[Rugby union at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[Rugby union at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[Rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]].&lt;ref name="Rugby in the Olympics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/history.html |title=Rugby in the Olympics: History |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=16 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810064813/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/history.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17.&lt;ref name="Rugby in the Olympics"/&gt; In 1908, Australia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three.&lt;ref name="Rugby in the Olympics"/&gt; In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport.&lt;ref name="Rugby in the Olympics"/&gt;

In 2009 the [[International Olympic Committee]] voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020]] games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format.&lt;ref name="I.O.C.

In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held in [[2014 Asian Games|2014]], are [[Japan national rugby sevens team|Japan]] in the men's event and [[China women's national rugby sevens team|China]] in the women's.{{cn|date=August 2017}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040867.html |title=Japan claim Asian Games gold |publisher=planetrugby.com |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092235/http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040867.html |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040914.html |title=Kazakhstan win first Asian Games women's gold |publisher=IRBSevens.com |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092322/http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040914.html |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Women's international rugby===
{{Main article|Women's international rugby union}}
Women's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between [[France women's national rugby union team|France]] and the [[Netherlands women's national rugby union team|Netherlands]] played in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rugbyrelics.com/museum/exhibitions/NR125/14.htm |title=Women's Rugby |work=rugbyrelics.com |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/119928-womans-rugby-beautiful-side-of-brutal-game |title=Women's Rugby: Beautiful Side of a Brtual Game |work=bleacherreport.com |first=Giorgi |last=Dolidze |date=5 February 2009  |accessdate=25 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Women's Rugby World Cup]] was held in Wales [[1991 Women's Rugby World Cup|in 1991]], and was won by the [[United States women's national rugby union team|United States]].&lt;ref name="Women's Rugby"/&gt; The second tournament took place in [[1994 Women's Rugby World Cup|1994]], and from that time through 2014 was held every four years.

As well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there are also other regular tournaments, including a [[Women's Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]], run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in [[1996 Women's Home Nations Championship|1996]] has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 14 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from [[2006 Women's Six Nations Championship|2006]] to [[2012 Women's Six Nations Championship|2012]]. However, since then, England have won only in [[2017 Women's Six Nations Championship|2017]]; reigning champion France have won in each even-numbered year (2014, 2016, 2018) whilst [[Ireland women's national rugby union team|Ireland]] won in 2013 and 2015.

[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|thumb|[[Beach rugby]] match|alt=On a sunlit beach two teams of players, one in yellow the other in blue, play a form of rugby; the central yellow player runs forward clutching the ball with one hand, close to his chest.]]

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is [[Rugby sevens]] (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes.

Major tournaments include the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and [[Dubai Sevens]], both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game. A more recent variant of the sport is [[Rugby tens]] (10's or Xs), a Malaysian variant with ten players per side.&lt;ref name=Completerugby1&gt;{{Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the physical nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact.&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |pages=14–15|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these versions, [[Touch rugby]], in which "tackles" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/getting-a-kick-out-of-touch/story-e6frep5o-1225699224845 |title=Touch rugby league growing in Brisbane |first=Karl|last=deKroo| work=The Courier-Mail |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/~/link.aspx?_id=A4A528E2CC22410390D89AE5E46D1EF9&amp;_z=z |title=Touch Rugby |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919021954/https://www.rfu.com/TheGame/%7E/link.aspx?_id=A4A528E2CC22410390D89AE5E46D1EF9&amp;_z=z |archivedate=19 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tag Rugby]], is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in the fact that kicking the ball is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/FormsOfRugby/Tag.aspx |title=Tag Rugby |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810133935/http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/FormsOfRugby/Tag.aspx |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mini rugby]] is another variant of rugby union aimed at fostering the sport in children.&lt;ref name="Mini Rugby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/downloads/REGULATIONS_Mini_Rugby_2012_to_2015(1).pdf |title=Mini and Leprechaun Rugby | work=irishrugby.ie |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rutherford1&gt;{{cite book |last=Rutherford |first=Don |title=The Complete Book of Mini Rugby |publisher=Partridge |year=1993 |location=London |page=2 |url= |isbn=1-85225-196-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch.&lt;ref name="Mini Rugby"/&gt; Similar to Tag Rugby, [[American Flag Rugby]], (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanflagrugby.com/about-afr.php |title=About AFR |work=americanflagrugby.com |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817210310/http://www.americanflagrugby.com/about-afr.php |archivedate=17 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ to Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.&lt;ref name="Mini Rugby"/&gt;

Other less formal variants include [[beach rugby]] and [[snow rugby]].&lt;ref name="IRB BGRU 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/news/newsid=2026163.html |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=Rugby X-treme hits the Andes |first=Frankie |last=Deges |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726135403/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/news/newsid=2026163.html |archivedate=26 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on other sports==

[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|When codifying [[Australian rules football]] in 1859, [[Tom Wills]] drew inspiration from an early version of rugby he learnt at Rugby School.]]
[[Rugby league]] was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.

[[American football]]&lt;ref name=Completerugby2&gt;{{Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbs&gt;{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canadian football]]&lt;ref name=CanFitba1&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia Canadiana|volume = 8|editor=John Everett Robbins| year=1972 |publisher=Grolier of Canada|location=Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal |page=110 |isbn=0-7172-1601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from early forms of rugby.&lt;ref name=CanFitba1/&gt;

[[Australian rules football]] was influenced by [[rugby football]] and [[English public school football games|other games originating in English public schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Tony |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Wagg |title=Myths and Milestones in the History of Sport |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |pages=8–31 |chapter=Chapter 1: National Myths, Imperial Pasts and the Origins of Australian Rules Football |isbn=0-230-24125-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=A Game of Our Own: The Origins of Australian Football|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2010|pages=244–278|isbn=1-86395-347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=de Moore|first=Greg|title=Tom Wills: His Spectacular Rise and Tragic Fall|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2008|pages=17–47|isbn=978-1-74175-499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Naismith]] took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1027613/index.htm |last=Wolff |first=Alexander |title=The Olden Rules |work=Sports Illustrated |date=25 November 2002 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604031625/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1027613/index.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious contribution is the [[jump ball]]'s similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played rugby at [[McGill University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naismithmuseum.com/main.php?action=cms.JamesNaismith |title=Biography of James Naismith |work=naismithmuseum.com |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914215653/http://www.naismithmuseum.com/main.php?action=cms.JamesNaismith |archivedate=14 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following section is for notable artists who have explored rugby or for works centred on the sport of rugby union. It is not intended for casual mentions of rugby in popular culture or trivial facts such as the Friends episode ''The One with all the Rugby''.--&gt;

Thomas Hughes 1857 novel ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', set at [[Rugby School]], includes a rugby football match, also portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team [[Bective Rangers]] in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' has an account of Ireland international [[James Magee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectiverangers.com/content/view/197/5 |title=Bective Rangers&amp;nbsp;– James Joyce |work=bectiverangers.com |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726215801/http://www.bectiverangers.com/content/view/197/5/ |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale ''[[The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire]]'', mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/vampires/classicstory/sussexvampire_p1.shtml|title=The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire  |date=September 2005|work=BBC |location=UK |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darryl &amp; Lori Schroeder Park''' (formerly known as '''Cougar Field''') is a [[baseball park]] in [[Houston, Texas]].  It is the home field of the [[Houston Cougars baseball]] team.  Several iterations of the ballpark have existed.  The current stadium holds 5,000 people, and opened for baseball in 1995.  With a 1,500 square foot Daktronics video board, Schroeder Park features the second-largest scoreboard in college baseball. Since its opening, Schroeder Park has hosted several notable [[college baseball]] events.&lt;ref name="Athletics"&gt;[http://uhcougars.cstv.com/trads/hou-trads-cougar.html Cougar Field]. UH Athletics. Retrieved 15 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016, the University of Houston announced that, as a response to a large donation to the baseball program, Cougar Field would be renamed Darryl &amp; Lori Schroeder Park. &lt;ref name="Athletics"&gt;[http://www.uhcougars.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/021116aab.html Cougar Field renamed].

==History==
Prior to 1961, the Cougars played at [[Buff Stadium]].  The original baseball stadium named Cougar Field was built roughly in the same area as the current one.  Before 1968, it existed where [[Hofheinz Pavilion]] is today.  To make room for the then new basketball arena, Cougar Field was moved next door.&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;Scholl, Daniel. [http://www.thedailycougar.com/static/vol59/94-03-30.html "Dreams, Days Gone by Mark of Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108141816/http://www.thedailycougar.com/static/vol59/94-03-30.html |date=2009-01-08 }}. ''The Daily Cougar''. Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This iteration of Cougar Field stayed in the same location until March 29, 1994 when it was demolished in preparation for the establishment of the UH Athletics/Alumni center.&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;  To finish the rest of their season's home games, the Cougars played at [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M University's]] [[Olsen Field]] and crosstown [[Rice University|Rice University's]] [[Reckling Park|Cameron Field]].&lt;ref name="Stories"&gt;Wizig, Jerry.

''The Daily Cougar''. Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a multimillion dollar donation from Cougar alumnus and [[San Diego Padres]] owner [[John Moores (baseball)|John Moores]], the current stadium was built throughout the remainder of the year, and had its first game on February 22, 1995.  

In late 2013, Houston, citing national competitiveness in recruiting, changed Schroeder Park's playing surface from natural grass to artificial turf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhcougars.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/110113aab.html |title=Houston Baseball to Turf Cougar Field |publisher=Houston Cougars athletics |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Houston announced a new 20,000 square foot clubhouse and player development center to be constructed for Schroeder Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chron.com/sportsupdate/2015/09/uh-releases-rendering-for-new-baseball-facility-at-cougar-field |title=UH releases rendering for new baseball facility at Cougar Field |author=Duarte, Joseph |date=September 30, 2015 |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, a new Daktronics video board with 1,500 square feet of space replaced the original one, and Schroeder Park became host to the largest scoreboard in college baseball.

==Events hosted==
Since its opening in 1995, Schroeder Park has hosted several notable college baseball events.&lt;ref name="Athletics"/&gt;  In, 1999, 2000,2015, and 2017 an [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Regional]] was hosted at the ball park.  Also in 2000, Schroeder Park was home to an [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Super Regional]].  In addition, the [[2004 Conference USA Baseball Tournament|2004]] and [[2010 Conference USA Baseball Tournament|2010]] [[Conference USA Baseball Tournament]]s were both hosted at the ballpark.

In 2014, the [[United States national baseball team|USA Baseball 18U National Team]] held trials at the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://web.usabaseball.com/article.jsp?ymd=20140824&amp;content_id=91322452&amp;vkey=news_usab |title=18U: Blue one-hits Red in 12-4 victory |publisher=USA Baseball |date=August 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schroeder Park is a scaled-down version of a major league ballpark.&lt;ref name="Athletics"/&gt;  Until October 2015, it featured a scoreboard with a [[Philips]] Vidiwall LED video screen constructed by Spectrum Corporation.&lt;ref name="Scoreboard"&gt;[http://www.spectrumscoreboards.com/products/scoreboards/default.html Scoreboards]. Spectrum Corporation.

For players, in addition to locker rooms, there are facilities for indoor batting practice, storage, and laundry.&lt;ref name="Athletics"/&gt;  Schroeder Park's press box seats 28, and has booths for television and radio coverage.&lt;ref name="Athletics"/&gt;  The field is made of artificial turf, which can increase the running speed, but can also increase injuries as compared to natural grass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9270">[[File:Nogomet Maribor - Varteks 1961 (4).jpg|thumb|A goal being scored]]
In games of [[association football]] teams compete to score the most '''goals''' during the match. A goal is scored when the ball passes completely over a goal line at each end of the field of play between two centrally positioned upright goal posts 24&amp;nbsp;feet (7.32&amp;nbsp;m) apart and underneath a horizontal crossbar at a height of 8&amp;nbsp;feet (2.44&amp;nbsp;m) — this frame is also referred to as a [[Football_pitch#Goals|goal]]. Each team aims to score at one end of the pitch, while also preventing their opponents scoring at the other. Nets are usually attached to the goal frame to catch goalscoring balls.

==Rules==
[[File:Ball in and out of play 2.svg|thumb|If the line in this diagram is the goal line between the goal posts, the only case in which a goal has been scored is position D.]]
Rules concerning goal scoring are described in Law 10 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]:

{{quote|text=A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|infringement of the Laws of the Game]] has been committed previously by the team scoring the goal.|title=Law 10: The Method of Scoring&lt;ref name="LOTG"&gt;{{cite web|title=LAWS OF THE GAME 2015/2016|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/Document/FootballDevelopment/Refereeing/02/36/01/11/LawsofthegamewebEN_Neutral.pdf|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with other cases of the ball travelling [[Ball in and out of play|out of the field of play]], all of the ball must cross all of the line, otherwise play continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Ken|title=When is a goal not a goal?|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/when-goal-not-goal|website=plus.maths.org|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal is credited to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team actually caused the ball to enter the goal. A ball entering a goal from the action of a player defending that goal is called an [[own goal]]. 

Even if serious foul play unambiguously prevents scoring a goal (a [[professional foul]]), a [[referee (association football)|referee]] cannot award a goal if it does not enter the goal as described above; i.e., there is no provision for awarding a goal akin to the [[penalty try]] in [[rugby football]] or the [[goaltending]] offence in [[basketball]].

A goal cannot be scored directly from an [[indirect free kick]] or a [[throw-in]]. Should the ball go into the goal from these without first being touched by another player, play is restarted with a [[goal kick]]. A player cannot score an own goal directly from ''any'' restart of play, in that case a [[corner kick]] would be awarded. Both of these situations, especially the latter, are exceedingly rare.

If there is time remaining in the session of play, after a goal has been scored play is restarted with a [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]] by the side which conceded the goal.

===Deciding if a goal has been scored===
{{seealso|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}
Most goals are relatively unambiguous, as the ball will usually strike the net attached to the goal structure indicating that it passed the goal line as described above. Occasionally, however, situations occur where it is difficult for officials to tell if the ball completely crossed the goal line before a rebound, save, or clearance from the goal area. Additionally, even if the ball crosses the goal line as required, a goal may be disallowed if the attacking team commits an infringement of the Laws of the Game, such as the [[Offside (association football)|offside offence]] or a [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|foul]]. 

As with all other decisions on the Laws of the Game, the referee is the final authority as to whether a goal is scored or disallowed. The match referee is advised by [[assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s, whose view across the pitch from the sidelines may in some cases be more useful in determining whether the ball crossed the goal line or whether the attacking team committed an infringement. 

The goal net was one of the earliest tools employed to aid match officials in determining whether a goal was scored. Introduced in the 1890s, the goal net provides a simple way to determine whether the ball passed on the correct side of the goal posts and crossbar. Although not mandated by the Laws of the Game, goal nets are now ubiquitous across most levels of organised football. Since 2012, [[goal-line technology]] has been used at the highest levels of professional football; it employs a system of cameras and sensors to provide the referee with a discreet signal when the ball has crossed the goal line.&lt;ref name=IFABofficial&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[video assistant referee]] was added in 2018 after years of trials; this is an additional assistant referee who constantly monitors video footage of the match and is empowered to advise the referee if he/she may have made a clear error in awarding a goal.

==Attribution of goals==
The Laws make no mention of attributing goals to individual players. Nevertheless, goals are almost always attributed to individual players, that player being the one who provided the final action causing the goal to be scored. Generally, this is the last player to touch the ball, notwithstanding inconsequential deflections such as failed attempts at a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|save]]. Should a player cause a goal to be scored against their own team, the goal is recorded as an [[own goal]].

The authority on attributing goals varies between competitions. The [[Premier League]] in [[England]] has a dedicated [[Dubious Goals Committee]] for resolving attribution disputes.&lt;ref name="DGC"&gt;{{ cite web| first1 = Sean | last1 = Ingle | first2 = Barry | last2 = Glendenning | first3 = James | last3 = Dart | url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,1855736,00.html | title = Is there really a Dubious Goals Committee? | work = The Knowledge | publisher = The Guardian | date = 23 August 2006 | accessdate = 2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an individual player, scoring multiple goals in a game is considered a notable achievement. In association football, a [[hat-trick]] refers to the uncommon feat of scoring three goals in a single game. Awards exist for individual players who score the most goals in some competitions, such awards are often called the "[[Golden Boot (disambiguation)|Golden Boot]]"&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

==Goal celebrations==
{{mainarticle|Goal celebration}}
[[File:Atlético de Madrid - 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Atlético Madrid]] players celebrate a goal with a group hug]]
Players will typically celebrate scoring a goal with team mates, occasionally putting on elaborate displays for the crowd. The Laws allow this, but mandate that celebration must not be "excessive".&lt;ref name="LOTG"/&gt;

==Quantity of goals==
On average, only a few scores occur per game in association football.

'''State Farm Stadium''', formerly known as '''University of Phoenix Stadium''', is a multi-purpose [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Glendale, Arizona]], west of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. It is the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the annual [[Fiesta Bowl]]. It replaced [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]'s [[Sun Devil Stadium]] as the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Valley of the Sun]]'s main stadium. The stadium is adjacent to the [[Gila River Arena]] and it features the first fully retractable natural grass playing surface built in the United States on top of an AirField Systems drainage system. An opening on one side of the stadium allows the playing field to move to the exterior of the building, allowing the entire natural turf playing surface to be exposed to daylight and also allowing the floor of the stadium to be used for any other purpose (such as seating for concerts or to accommodate motorsports events) without damaging the turf.

The stadium has hosted the [[Fiesta Bowl]], the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]], [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] and [[2016 College Football Playoff National Championship]], which set the venue's entertainment attendance record of 78,603 on January 11, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2011/01/10/bcs-game-sets-new-university-of.html|first=Mike|last=Sunnucks|title=BCS Game Sets New University of Phoenix Stadium Attendance Record|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 [[Super Bowl]] [[Super Bowl XLII|XLII]], 2015 [[Super Bowl XLIX]], 2023 [[Super Bowl LVII]], the [[2015 Pro Bowl]], [[WrestleMania XXVI]], and matches from the [[2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. It was one of the stadiums for the [[Copa América Centenario]] in 2016, with one of those matches being the 3rd place final. It hosted the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in 2017 and will do so again in 2024.

The [[University of Phoenix]] acquired the [[naming rights]] in September 2006, shortly after the stadium had opened under the name '''Cardinals Stadium''' and retained the rights until September 2018. The "University of Phoenix" name was applied as a corporate sponsor, and not as the home stadium of the university, which has no intercollegiate athletics program (the university is a private, for-profit venture).

On September 4, 2018, [[State Farm]] acquired the naming rights. The Cardinals and State Farm reached agreement on an 18-year commitment that resulted in the team’s home venue becoming State Farm Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Urban|first=Darren|title=New Name For Cardinals’ Nest: State Farm Stadium|url=https://www.azcardinals.com/news/new-name-for-cardinals-nest-state-farm-stadium|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=AZCardinals.com|date=September 4, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cardinals Reach Naming Rights Agreement with State Farm; Iconic Arizona Venue to be Known as State Farm Stadium|url=https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-stadium-announcement-phoenix/|publisher=State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company|website=Newsroom.StateFarm.com|date=September 4, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility information and history==
Since moving to Arizona from [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] in 1988, the Cardinals had played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. The Cardinals had only planned to play there until a new stadium could be built in Phoenix.  However, the [[savings and loan crisis]] derailed funding for a new stadium during the 1990s. Over time, the Cardinals expressed frustration at being merely tenants in a college football stadium. The lack of having their own stadium denied them additional revenue streams available to other NFL teams. The Cardinals campaigned several years in the years prior to its construction for a new and more modern facility.

The ceremonial groundbreaking for the new stadium was held on April 12, 2003, and the 63,400-seat stadium opened on August 1, 2006 after three years of construction. The stadium was designed by Eisenman Architects and HOK Sport (now [[Populous (company)|Populous]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofphoenixstadium.com/index.php/stadium/statistics Stadium Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025603/http://www.universityofphoenixstadium.com/index.php/stadium/statistics |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is considered an architectural icon for the region and was named by ''[[Business Week]]'' as one of the 10 “most impressive” sports facilities on the globe due to the combination of its retractable roof (engineering design by [[Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants|Walter P Moore]]) and roll-in natural grass field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lloydengineers.com/professional-international/|title=www.lloydengineers.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[GelreDome]] and the [[Veltins-Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/02/sports_stadiums/source/9.htm World-Class Sports Stadiums: BusinessWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light emitting diode|LED]] video and ribbon displays from [[Daktronics]] in [[Brookings, South Dakota]] were installed in 2006 prior to Arizona's first game of the season at the new stadium.&lt;ref name=displays&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svconline.com/avcontrol/features/avinstall_installation_spotlight_university_2/|title=Installation Spotlight: University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Ariz.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203070758/http://svconline.com/avcontrol/features/avinstall_installation_spotlight_university_2/|archivedate=2010-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the project was [[United States dollar|$]]455 million. That total included $395.4 million for the stadium, $41.7 million for site improvements, and $17.8 million for the land. Contributors to the stadium included the [[Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority]] ($302.3 million), the [[Arizona Cardinals]] ($143.2 million), and the [[Glendale, Arizona|City of Glendale]] ($9.5 million).

[[File:University of Phoenix Stadium no field.jpg|175px|right|thumb|The interior of State Farm Stadium with field removed. To protect the stadium's grass playing surface, non-sporting events are always held with the facility in this configuration.]]
The stadium has 88 [[luxury suites]] &amp;mdash; called luxury lofts &amp;mdash; with space for 16 future suites as the stadium matures.

The {{convert|25|acre}} surrounding the stadium is called Sportsman's Park. Included within the Park is an {{convert|8|acre|sing=on}} landscaped tailgating area called the Great Lawn.

There are no obstructed view seats in the stadium. There are visible areas in the upper deck of the end zone where seats could have been put in but were not due to the giant super columns supporting the roof structure.

[[File:cardswin1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Cardinals win NFC Championship, January 18, 2009]]
The stadium [[seating capacity]] can be expanded by 8,800 for "mega-events" such as college bowls, NFL Super Bowls, and the NFC Championship Game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cards vs. Eagles Sells Out in 6 Minutes|first=Carrie|last=Watters|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/2009/01/11/20090111cardsellout-CR.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=January 11, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by adding risers and ganged, portable "X-frame" folding seats. The endzone area on the side of the facility where the field tray rolls in and out of the facility can be expanded to accommodate the additional seats.

The roof is made out of [[translucent]] [[Taiyo Kogyo Corporation#BirdAir|Birdair]] fabric and opens in 12 minutes. It is the first retractable roof ever built on an incline.

==Events==
[[File:University of Phoenix Stadium roof.jpg|175px|left|thumb|The roof of State Farm Stadium.]]
Events held at the stadium include [[Arizona Cardinals]] home games; public grand opening tours held August 19 and 20, 2006 (attended by 120,000 people); various shows, expositions, tradeshows and motor sport events; the AIA 4A and 5A state championship games for football; and international soccer exhibition matches.

The multipurpose nature of the facility has allowed it to host 91 events representing 110 event days between the dates of August 4, 2006 through the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]] January 8, 2007.

===NFL===
The first preseason football game was played August 12, 2006 when the Cardinals defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 21–13. The first regular season game was played September 10 against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the Cardinals won 34&amp;ndash;27). The stadium's air-conditioning system made it possible for the Cardinals to play at home on the opening weekend of the NFL season for the first time since moving to Arizona in 1988.

On October 16, 2006, the stadium hosted a notable game between the Cardinals and the undefeated [[Chicago Bears]] where the [[2006 Chicago Bears–Arizona Cardinals game|Bears came back from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Cardinals]]. The Bears would later go on to play in [[Super Bowl XLI]].

University of Phoenix Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008 in which the [[New York Giants]] defeated the [[2007 New England Patriots season|previously undefeated]] [[New England Patriots]] 17–14 with a paid attendance crowd of 71,101. This was the second time the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix area]] hosted a [[Super Bowl]], the other being [[Super Bowl XXX]] held in nearby [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in 1996 when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

The Cardinals' first home playoff game since 1947 took place at the stadium on January 3, 2009, with Arizona beating the [[Atlanta Falcons]], 30–24. The stadium also hosted the [[NFL playoffs, 2008–09#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles at Arizona Cardinals|2008-09 NFC Championship Game]] between the Cardinals and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on January 18, 2009, which the Cardinals won 32–25 in front of over 70,000 fans in attendance.

The [[2015 Pro Bowl]] was the first Pro Bowl to be held at the same location as the same year's Super Bowl since 2010. The Pro Bowl returned to Hawaii in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Pro Bowl to be played in Arizona - NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000340271/article/2015-pro-bowl-to-be-played-in-arizona|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2015, the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]] held at the stadium.

WrestleMania XXVI was the twenty-sixth annual [[WrestleMania]] [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event produced by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), which took place on March 28, 2010, at the venue when it was known as University of Phoenix Stadium in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] suburb of [[Glendale, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="Corporate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2009/2009_02_24.jsp|title=Arizona Hosts WrestleMania XXVI|date=February 24, 2009|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=February 24, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227150114/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2009/2009_02_24.jsp|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first WrestleMania since [[WrestleMania XI]] with a non-title match as a main event, the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of [[Arizona]] and the third to be held in an open-air venue,&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/magazine/magazinefeatures10/featureoftheweek20100212/|title=WWE Magazine Feature of the Week|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=February 13, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[WrestleMania IX]] and [[WrestleMania XXIV]]. WrestleMania XXVI was a [[WWE Brand Extension|joint-promotion]] event, with performers both from the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] brands. The event's [[Card (sports)|card]] consisted of eight matches, including three main matches. The first of these matches was a [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification, no count-out]] match, in which [[The Undertaker]] defeated [[Shawn Michaels]] to improve his [[The Undertaker#WrestleMania record|undefeated WrestleMania streak]] to 18–0. Per the pre-match stipulation, Michaels was [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|forced to retire]]. The second was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWE Championship]] that saw [[John Cena]] defeat [[Dave Batista|Batista]] to win the championship. The third saw [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]], [[Chris Jericho]], defeat [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to retain the title. The [[Card (sports)|undercard]] also included a [[Hardcore wrestling|No Holds Barred match]] between [[Bret Hart]] and [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] and the sixth annual [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].

===Other events===
Other events included the Fiesta Bowl National Band Championship High School Marching Band competition.  It has also held many high school graduations. 

On August 1, 2009, the stadium hosted [[Monster Jam]] Summer Heat, with Maximum Destruction defeating Captain's Curse in the racing finals and Grave Digger winning the freestyle event.

The stadium hosted the inaugural [[Stadium Super Trucks]] race on April 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/ |title=Schedule |work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124159/http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/ |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2016, [[Monster Jam]] returned to the stadium for the first time since 2009, with 16 of the best trucks. On February 6, the [[AMA Supercross Championship]] raced for the first time, after visiting [[Chase Field]] from 1999 to 2015.

==Naming rights==
[[File:University of Phoenix Stadium field 01.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|The movable field outside of the stadium.]]

On September 26, 2006 the [[University of Phoenix]] acquired the naming rights to the stadium totalling $154.5 million over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0926stadiumfolo26-ON.html|title=Stadium Name Deal: $154.5 mil Over 20 Years|first=Scott|last=Wong|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=September 26, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 2017, the University of Phoenix terminated the naming rights just 11 years into the 20-year deal, citing financial woes; however, the university kept its name on the stadium until a replacement company was found to give naming rights to. On September 4th, 2018, [[State Farm]] reached a deal securing the rights through 2036. University of Phoenix will remain involved as a sponsor with the team in a reduced capacity as the Cardinals' "official education partner."

== Parking space ==
The stadium has approximately 14,000 on-site parking spaces (plus 12,000 adjacent spaces),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofphoenixstadium.com/stadium/statistics Statistics - University of Phoenix Stadium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622142913/http://universityofphoenixstadium.com/stadium/statistics |date=2013-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; located in numerous lots that surround the stadium's 2,000 disabled parking spaces. The design improvement, featured for example in a Discovery program about this stadium, is zoning. Parking spaces for guests are zoned with preferred leaving directions, to achieve the fastest possible movement of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofphoenixstadium.com/guest/directions Parking &amp; Directions - University of Phoenix Stadium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622152728/http://universityofphoenixstadium.com/guest/directions |date=2013-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tarpaulin''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|ɑr|p|əl|ɪ|n}} {{respell|TAR|pəl|in}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/definition/tarpaulin|title=tarpaulin - Dictionary Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|t|ɑr|ˈ|p|ɔː|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|tar|PAW|lin}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/tarpaulin|title=tarpaulin - Definition of tarpaulin in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''tarp''', is a large sheet of strong, flexible, water-resistant or [[waterproof]] material, often [[cloth]] such as [[canvas]] or [[polyester]] coated with [[polyurethane]], or made of [[plastic]]s such as [[polyethylene]]. In some places such as [[Australia]], and in military slang, a tarp may be known as a '''hootch'''. Tarpaulins often have reinforced [[grommet]]s at the corners and along the sides to form attachment points for [[rope]], allowing them to be tied down or suspended.

Inexpensive modern tarpaulins are made from woven [[polyethylene]]; this material is so associated with tarpaulins that it has become colloquially known in some quarters as '''polytarp'''.

==Etymology==
The word ''tarpaulin'' originated as a [[compound word|compound]] of the words ''tar'' and ''palling'', referring to a [[tar]]red canvas pall used to cover objects on [[ships]]. Sailors often tarred their own overclothes in the same manner as the sheets or palls. By association, [[sailors]] became known as "jack tars".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tar Tar], ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, "paulin" was used for such a cloth; here [[General Rosecrans]] tells a subordinate how to improvise a boat:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A boat has been ordered up, but to make sure a large paulin will be sent down to you, with which, spread under a lot of wagon-beds, you will be able to make a large scow."
(''War of the Rebellion: Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies'', series 1, volume 5, page 260, November 1861)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Two wagon beds&amp;nbsp;... were placed upon frames&amp;nbsp;... Thus constructed, they were placed upon a [[cotton duck|duck]] paulin, which was drawn up tightly around the beds and secured."
(''Ibid.'', page 275)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:WRESTLEMANIA.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A tarpaulin is used at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] (2008) to prevent rain from falling on the performers and stage equipment.]]

Tarpaulins have multiple uses, including as shelter from the elements, i.e., [[wind]], [[rain]], or [[sunlight]], a [[Tent#Parts|ground sheet]]. Tarpaulins are often used during the build process to protect brickwork and masonry from weather damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/477290692|title=Brickwork : for CAA Construction Diploma and NVQs. Level 2|last=(Malcolm)|first=Thorpe, M.|date=2010|publisher=Newnes|others=Hodge, J. C. (John Charles)|isbn=9781856177658|location=Oxford|oclc=477290692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarpaulins are also used for a [[fly (tent)|fly]] in [[camping]], a drop sheet for [[painting]], for protecting the infield of a [[baseball field]], and for protecting objects, such as unenclosed [[truck]]s, [[semi-trailer]]s or [[freight car]]s as well as [[wood pile]]s. Such was the demand for tarpaulins by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]], up until 1990, they operated their own tarpaulin factory.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank. ''A short History of the Tarpaulin Factory at Enfield.'' [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]. September, 1999. pp. 343-347&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used on outdoor market stalls to provide some protection from the elements of nature.
Tarpaulins are also used for advertisement printing, most notably for billboards.

Another historical use of a tarpaulin is to cover seats in a stadium that are rarely used, are in venues oversized for a venue, or are obstructed view seats in a [[multi-purpose stadium]] or indoor arena for a certain sport. The entire third deck of the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]] is also covered in tarp for [[Oakland Athletics]] games, but is uncovered for [[Oakland Raiders]] games, while portions of the upper deck [[CenturyLink Field]] in [[Seattle]] are covered with images of the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] crest or sponsor logos in games which do not require use of that seating.

Perforated tarpaulins are typically used for medium to large [[advertising]], or for protection on scaffoldings, the aim of the perforations (from 20% to 70%) is to reduce wind vulnerability. 
[[Image:perforated pvc tarp.jpg|thumb|right|An example of perforated tarpaulin]]

Polyethylene tarpaulins have also proven to be a popular source when an inexpensive, water resistant fabric is needed. Many amateur builders of [[plywood]] [[sailboat]]s turn to polyethylene tarpaulins for making their sails, as it is inexpensive and easily worked. With the proper type of [[adhesive tape]], it is possible to make a serviceable [[polytarp sails|sail]] for a small boat with no [[sewing]].

Plastic tarps are sometimes used as a building material in communities of indigenous North Americans.&lt;ref name="dear-listener-program"/&gt; Tipis made with tarps are known as [[tarpees]].&lt;ref name="hopper"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper |first1=Frank |title="Those Are Sacred": A First-Person Account From the Tipi Demonstration That Shut Down Traffic |url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/05/10/26161615/those-are-sacred-a-first-person-account-from-the-tipi-demonstration-that-shut-down-traffic |accessdate=16 July 2018 |newspaper=The Stranger |date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Tarpaulins can be classified based on a diversity of factors, such as material type ([[polyethylene]], [[canvas]], [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]], etc.), thickness, which is generally measured in [[Thousandth of an inch|mils]] or generalized into categories (such as "regular duty", "heavy duty", "super heavy duty", etc.), and [[grommet]] strength (simple vs. reinforced), among others.

Tarpaulins can also be classified by size—a common determining factor for consumers in acquiring tarps—and measured in [[width]] by [[length]]. Actual tarp sizes are generally about three to five percent smaller than the advertised size. (Thus, a tarp advertised as {{cvt|20|x|20|ft}} will actually measure about {{cvt|19|x|19|ft}}.) Some other factors that may influence a purchase decision include color (often they come in blue, green, black, or silver), grommet type ([[aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], etc.), and grommet-to-grommet distance (these often run between {{cvt|18|in}} and {{cvt|5|ft}}). The [[Weaving|weave count]], a measure of tarp strength, often runs between (8 and 12 per square inch) and the greater the count, the greater its resistance against ripping in high wind conditions. Tarps may also be washable or non-washable and [[waterproof]] or non-waterproof, and [[rot-proof|mildewproof]] vs. non-mildewproof. Tarp [[flexibility]] refers to its ability to remain pliable during cold winter months; some tarps offer more flexibility than others in cold weather. Some manufacturers also advertise their tarps as "rot-proof", but this may be more a subjective than an objective measurement.

===Type of material ===

==== Polyethylene ====
[[File:NationalCityPNC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tarp is used to identify a business.]]

A [[polyethylene]] tarpaulin ("polytarp") is not a traditional fabric, but rather, a [[laminate]] of woven and sheet material. The center is loosely woven from strips of [[polyethylene]] plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface. This creates a fabric-like material that resists stretching well in all directions and is waterproof. Sheets can be either of [[low density polyethylene]] (LDPE) or [[high density polyethylene]] (HDPE). When treated against [[ultraviolet]] light, these tarpaulins can last for years exposed to the elements, but non-[[UV]] treated material will quickly become brittle and lose strength and water resistance if exposed to sunlight.

====Canvas====
[[Canvas]] tarpaulins are not 100% waterproof, though they are water resistant. Thus, while a little bit of water for a short period of time will not affect them, when there is standing water on canvas tarps, or when water cannot quickly drain away from canvas tarps, the standing water will drip through this type of tarp.

====Vinyl====
[[Polyvinyl chloride]] ("vinyl") tarpaulins are industrial-grade and intended for heavy-duty use. They are constructed of {{cvt|10|oz/sqyd|g/m2}} coated yellow vinyl. This makes it waterproof and have high [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and tear strength. These resist oil, acid, grease and [[mildew]]. The vinyl tarp is ideal for agriculture, construction, industrial and trucks.

==== Silnylon ====
{{main|silnylon}}

[[Tarp tent]]s may be made of [[silnylon]].

===U.S. Color Scheme===
For years manufacturers have used a [[color code]] to indicate the grade of tarpaulins, but not all manufacturers follow this traditional method of grading. Following this color-coded system, blue indicates a lightweight tarp, and typically has a weave count of 8×8 and a thickness of {{cvt|0.005|-|0.006|in}}. Silver is a heavy-duty tarp and typically has a weave count of 14×14 and a thickness of {{cvt|0.011|-|0.012|in}}.

Some of the more common colors in that scheme are:
:{|class=wikitable
!Color!!Name!!Approx. thickness
|-
|Blue||light-duty tarp||{{cvt|0.005|-|0.006|in}}
|-

Tarps have been used both within works of art, and also to conceal works of art from public view.

A 2017 work called ''Tarp'' by Amy Malbeuf consists of a blue tarp with the word "tarp" written on it in glass beads. The work was created in reference to the use of tarps in improvised shelters by [[Homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area|people who are homeless in Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Brandon |title=Reality Check: Oakland’s Museum of Capitalism |journal=Art in America |date=17 July 2017 |url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/reality-check-oaklandrsquos-museum-of-capitalism/ |accessdate=16 July 2018 |quote=Some works more or less iterate the Museum’s core concept of radical denial. Alberta-based Métis artist Amy Malbeuf’s ''Tarp'' (2017), for instance, represents the fantasy the Museum asks us to assume. The work is a big blue tarpaulin on the wall, with the word tarp inscribed on it with glass beads. The wall text describes the piece in a voice from the future. It defines what a tarp 'was' in 2017, and then provides context: “In cities like Oakland, where capitalist development drove people out of homes, tarps became an important part of the improvised shelters which often appeared at the margins of urban areas.” While there is no doubt in my mind that Malbeuf made the piece in sympathy for and in solidarity with the staggering homeless population in Oakland, the fantasy risks increasing the conceptual distance between museumgoers and the displaced by making the reality of this crisis contrafactually pluperfect.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American artist [[Nicholas Galanin]]'s 2018 retrospective art show ''Dear Listener'' at the [[Heard Museum]] included tarps as both elements of sculpture and as part of the gallery presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Jenna |title=Nicholas Galanin's "Dear Listener" with Curator Erin Joyce |journal=Java Magazine |date=5 June 2018 |url=http://javamagaz.com/?p=5078 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |quote=The artist and curator asked Heard Museum to drape the skylights in blue plastic tarps, not just for mood but also to pay tribute to the many uses of this inexpensive resource in Native communities. These tarps are often used to patch leaky roofs, cover damaged car windows and as temporary shelters and sheds. The blue plastic tarps are so ubiquitous, there’s even a nickname for homes made out of them – 'tarp-ees.' The blue tarps appear 'because they are readily accessible and very inexpensive. A lot of people are living below the poverty line on reservations,' Joyce explains ... 'Creation With Her Children,' is a collaboration with Galanin’s partner, artist Merritt Johnson. A blue plastic tarp peeks out as a layer of the woman’s petticoat. Her children are animals who gather at her feet, beneath the folds of her gown. In one hand she holds a mirror, and in the other she holds a knife, gazing at her reflection while carving her own face 'out of necessity.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture ''Creation with Her Children'', a collaboration between Galanin and Merritt Johnson, depicts Creation clothed in a gown made from a blue plastic tarp. While Creation carves her own face, her children, depicted as animals who have human hands, are gathered near her feet. According to the gallery text and the printed program, the tarp, which is "used heavily in indigenous communities," references "contemporary Indigenous life and the long standing effects of forced relocation under colonial rule."&lt;ref name="dear-listener-program"&gt;{{cite book |title=Printed program for Dear Listener: Works by Nicholas Galanin |date=2018 |quote=Creation with Her Children: In this work Galanin collaborated with artist Merritt Johnson. The two depict a female figure, Creation. Creation is shown carving her own face out of necessity. Her ensemble, a 17th-century style European gown, consists of a variety of materials — most notably a blue plastic tarp. The blue tarp — used heavily in Indigenous communities, creating protection from the elements, and even employed to build tipis known as ''tarpees'' — references contemporary Indigenous life and the long standing effects of forced relocation under colonial rule. Her children, two animals with human hands peeking out from under her skirt, do not emerge. They expose their sharp teeth — an act of self-defense from the world they would encounter should they leave the protection of their mother ... Blue Tarp Skylight: The decision to place blue plastic tarps over the skylights in the Dennis Lyon Family Crossroads Gallery was deliberate choice made by Erin Joyce, the Museum's Fine Arts Curator. No, the roof is not leaking or in need of repair, however the tarps do serve a critical function in the exhibition space. Firstly, they work to illuminate the use of blue plastic tarps in Indigenous North America as a cost-effective and readily available tool used to repair roofs, build tipis and various other applications. Secondly, it casts a luminous blue glow down into the gallery — which creates an atmospheric feeling of coolness, playing off the presence of a polar bear placed in the center of the room — but it is all artificial. It serves to create a reminder that we live in a borrowed landscape, under artificial light and in air-conditioned spaces.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the galleries housing ''Dear Listener,'' the skylights have been covered with blue tarps. The decision to do so 
was made by a museum curator in reference to the use of tarps in Indigenous North America as an inexpensive and widely available material used for building and repair. It also casts a blue glow on the room, and creates "a reminder that we live in a borrowed landscape, under artificial light and in air-conditioned spaces."&lt;ref name="dear-listener-program"/&gt;

Tarps have also been used to conceal art from public view, including statues of Confederate generals [[Robert Edward Lee (sculpture)|Robert E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9447">The '''tuck rule''' was a controversial rule in [[American football]] used by the [[National Football League]] from 1999 until 2013. It stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''NFL Rule 3, Section 22, Article 2, Note 2.''' When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a fumble.&lt;ref name="wparticle" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the [[quarterback]] drops or loses the football while he is bringing the ball forward in a [[forward pass|passing motion]], and the ball touches the ground, it is considered an [[incomplete pass]]. If the quarterback drops or loses the football at any other time, it is considered a [[fumble]], as if any other player had dropped it.

It is referred to as the tuck rule because the ball leaving the quarterback's hands is considered a forward pass even if the quarterback intends not to pass the ball, but instead continues the forward motion to tuck the ball back into his body. Only once the forward motion of the arm is completed, and the ball tucked into the quarterback's body, would a subsequent loss of possession be considered a fumble.

[[Mike Pereira]], the former director of officiating of the NFL, noted that the design of the rule avoids the question of the quarterback's intent,&lt;ref name="wparticle"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html|title=Tuck Rule Hard to Grasp|accessdate=2012-01-14 |work=The Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske |date=October 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; except that the referee still must judge whether the initial forward movement of the arm was "intentional."

== History ==

=== Jets vs. Patriots (2001) ===

The tuck rule was called in Week 2 of an NFL regular season matchup on September 23, 2001, between the New England Patriots and the New York Jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/03/20/nfl-rescinds-tuck-rule/HvKSMTSMVWYDfGVMljdVxN/story.html#skip-target1|title=NFL rescinds ‘tuck rule’ - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 1:01 left in the second quarter, Patriots defensive end [[Anthony Pleasant]] apparently forced Jets quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] to fumble the ball, with Patriots defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] making a recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200109230nwe.htm|title=New York Jets  at  New England Patriots - September 23rd, 2001 - Pro-Football-Reference.com|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call was overturned upon review and ruled an incomplete pass, with the tuck rule cited. The Jets tied the game with a field goal on that drive before going on to win 10-3. This was also the game in which Jets linebacker [[Mo Lewis]] hit Patriots starting quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] during the fourth quarter of the game. Bledsoe was replaced with second year backup [[Tom Brady]] for the rest of the season. Bledsoe came in to replace Brady in the 2001 AFC Championship Game against the [[2001 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] after Brady got hit on his ankle. The Pats went on to win 24-17 and then beat the heavily-favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|Rams]] 20-17 in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].

Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] referred to this game after the subsequent [[Tuck Rule Game]], telling ESPN, "I knew what the ruling should have been because we had dealt with that play a little bit earlier in the year on the other side of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHEQtASq9BI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m34s|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Raiders vs. Patriots ("Tuck Rule Game") (2002) ===
{{main|Tuck Rule Game}}

The tuck rule resulted in a controversial finish to an [[Tuck Rule Game|AFC divisional playoff game on January 19, 2002]], between the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Oakland Raiders]].

In the closing moments of the fourth quarter of the game in a snowy [[Foxboro Stadium]], with New England trailing by three points, New England quarterback [[Tom Brady]] dropped back to pass. After he had begun a passing motion, Brady apparently ceased his throwing motion, pulled his right hand down below his shoulder and had touched the ball to his left hand when, coming off the strong side corner blitz, [[Charles Woodson]] knocked the ball out of Brady's hands. Raiders middle linebacker [[Greg Biekert]] then fell on the loose football. The officials initially called the play a recovered fumble, which would have sealed the victory for the Raiders. But after [[instant replay]], referee [[Walt Coleman]] reversed this call, declared the play an incomplete forward pass, and gave possession back to New England. In explaining the reversal to the audience, Coleman stated that the ball was moving forward at the time it was dropped.&lt;ref name="Crookdnose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.foxsports.com/crookdnose/11576|title="Crookdnose's Favorite Football Memory: The Snow Bowl"|date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2006-07-19}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later interviews, Coleman stated that it was his explanation, not the reversal, that was in error; the ball was moving backwards when it was lost, but the tuck rule applied. Patriots kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] later tied the game with a 45-yard field goal; in overtime, the Patriots defeated the Raiders on another field goal. Two games later, the Patriots won [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].

The NFL defended the call, but Bruce Allen, who ran the front office for the Raiders at the time of the game, said, "The rule itself doesn't bother me, but the way the rule is written, it was a fumble."&lt;ref name="wparticle" /&gt; The NFL's Competition Committee re-examined the rule after the season but did not change the rule.

=== Redskins vs. Broncos (2005) ===
The tuck rule was enforced in a regular season game on October 8, 2005, between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref name="wparticle"/&gt; Broncos quarterback [[Jake Plummer]] lost the football while in the Broncos' own end zone. Referees initially called the play a fumble and awarded the Redskins a safety, but after instant-replay review cited the tuck rule in reversing the decision and calling it an incomplete pass.&lt;ref name="wparticle"/&gt; The Broncos eventually went on to win the game.&lt;ref name="wparticle"/&gt; Afterwards, Redskins head coach [[Joe Gibbs]] said, "It makes no sense to me. It's the way it's worded. I think everybody probably sees that and says it's a bad rule."&lt;ref name="wparticle"/&gt; Pereira said the rule came up in games about 12 to 15 times per season and explained that despite its unpopularity, the competition committee had been unable to come up with a better rule.&lt;ref name="wparticle"/&gt;

=== Chiefs vs. Ravens (2011) ===
{{see also|NFL playoffs, 2010-11}}

The tuck rule was also enforced in a NFL playoff game on January 9, 2011, between the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. After this game, Mike Pereira, the former NFL vice-president for officiating, stated that he was no longer in support of the tuck rule.&lt;ref name="Tuckrule"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/mike-pereira-no-longer-supports-tuck-rule/|title="Mike Pereira No Longer Supports Tuck Rule"|date=2011-01-11|accessdate=2011-01-11|work=The New York Times|first=Toni|last=Monkovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repeal ===
In March 2013, the NFL competition committee proposed that league owners eliminate the tuck rule.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com//story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2013/03/14/bell-tuck-rule-change/1989043|title=Bell: NFL Can Finally Tuck Away Horrible Rule|accessdate=2013-03-14 |work=USA Today |first=Jarrett |last=Bell |date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners abolished the rule with a 29-1 vote at the 2013 annual meeting in Phoenix on March 20, 2013.&lt;ref name="espnblog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/tag/_/name/2013-nfl-rules-changes|title=2013 NFL Rules Changes|accessdate=2013-03-20 |work=ESPN NFL Nation Blog |first= Jamison |last=Hensley |date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only team to vote against the elimination of the tuck rule was the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the New England Patriots and Washington Redskins abstained from the vote. Afterwards, referring obliquely to the 2002 Tuck Rule Game, Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]] said, "I love the tuck rule, and forever will, and I know [longtime Raiders owner] [[Al Davis]], may he rest in peace, is probably smiling.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/03/20/nfl-rescinds-tuck-rule/HvKSMTSMVWYDfGVMljdVxN/story.html|title=NFL overwhelmingly kills ‘Tuck Rule’|publisher=Boston Globe|date=March 20, 2013|first=Shalise|last=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current rule reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Passer Tucks Ball.''' If the player loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, or if the player loses possession after he has tucked the ball into his body, it is a fumble.&lt;ref&gt;http://operations.nfl.com/media/2224/2016-nfl-rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Underwater Hockey''' ('''UWH'''), also known as '''Octopush''' (mainly in the [[United Kingdom]]) is a globally played limited-[[contact sport]] in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a [[hockey puck|puck]] across the bottom of a [[swimming pool]] into the opposing team's [[Goal (sport)|goal]] by propelling it with a [[hockey stick|hockey stick (pusher)]].  It originated in [[England]] in 1954 when Alan Blake, a founder of the newly formed [[Southsea]] Sub-Aqua Club, invented the game he called Octopush as a means of keeping the club's members interested and active over the cold winter months when open-water diving lost its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Underwater Hockey |url=http://history.cmas.org/hockey |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwater Hockey is now played worldwide, with the [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]], abbreviated CMAS, as the world governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission |url=http://www.cmas.org/hockey |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Underwater Hockey World Championships|Underwater Hockey World Championship]] was held in [[Canada]] in 1980 after a false start in 1979 brought about by international politics and apartheid.

==Play==
Two teams of up to ten players compete, with six players in each team in play at any one time.&lt;ref name=CMAS&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]] |title=International Rules for Underwater Hockey: Rules of Play |publisher=[[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]] |volume=2 |issue=9.10 |date=September 2005 |url=http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=757&amp;language=1 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining four players are continually substituted into play from a substitution area, which may be on deck or in the water outside the playing area, depending on tournament rules.

Before the start of play the puck is placed in the middle of the pool, and the players wait in the water whilst touching the wall above the goal they are defending. At the start-of-play signal (usually a buzzer or a gong) in-play members of both teams are free to swim anywhere in the play area and try to score by manoeuvring the puck into the opponents' goal. Players hold their breath&lt;ref name=APNOEA&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Davis FM, Graves MP, Guy HJ, Prisk GK, Tanner TE |title=Carbon dioxide response and breath-hold times in underwater hockey players |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=527–34 |date=November 1987 |pmid=3120387 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2448 |accessdate=2008-07-22}}

Play continues until either a goal is scored, when players return to their wall to start a new point, or a break in play is signalled by a [[referee]] (whether due to a foul, a time-out, or the end of the period of play).
[[File:UnderwaterHockeyStrike.jpg|thumb|Going for strike]]

Games consist of two halves of typically ten to fifteen minutes (depending on tournament rules;  20 minutes at World Championship tournaments) and a short half-time interval of usually three minutes. At half time the two teams switch ends.

A typical playing formation is 3-3 (three offensive players or ''forwards'', and three defensive players or ''backs'') of which 3-2-1 (three forwards, two mid-fielders and a back) is a variation. Other options include 2-3-1 (''i.e.'', two forwards, three mid-fielders, and a back), 1-3-2, or 2-2-2. Formations are generally very fluid and are constantly evolving with different national teams being proponents of particular tweaks in formations, such as New Zealand with their 'box' (2-1-2-1) formation. As important to tournament teams' formation strategy is the substitution strategy; substitution errors might result in a foul (too many players in the play area) that can result in a player from the offending team being sent out, or maybe a tactical blunder (with too few defenders in on a play).

There are a number of penalties described in the official Underwater Hockey rules, ranging from the use of the stick against something (or someone) other than the puck, playing or stopping the puck with something other than the stick, and "blocking" (interposing one's self between a teammate who possesses the [[hockey puck|puck]] and an opponent; one is allowed to play the puck but not merely block opponents with one's body). If the penalty is minor, referees award an advantage puck: the team that committed the foul is pushed back {{Convert|3|m}} from the puck, while the other team gets free possession. For major penalties such as a dangerous pass (e.g. striking an opponent's head) or intentional or repeated fouls, the [[referee]]s may eject players for a specified period of time or the remainder of the game.  A defender committing a serious foul sufficiently close to his own goal may be penalised by the award of a penalty shot or even a penalty goal to the fouled player's team. Since this is an underwater sport, surface spectators may be unaware of just how physical Underwater Hockey is.

Often players who are most successful in this game are strong swimmers, have a great ability to hold and recover their breath, and are able to produce great speed underwater whilst demonstrating learned skills in puck control. It is also important that they are able to work well with their team members and take full advantage of their individual skills.

==Injuries==

Although Underwater Hockey is a limited-contact sport, there is a significant risk of injury. Many injuries are typical sports injuries such as sprains, torn muscles and light scratches. More major injuries might include hard impacts or deep cuts to the head, or dental trauma, but there is also risk of life-threatening injury due to being struck on the head possibly causing a concussion or black-out underwater. There is an obvious risk of drowning if knocked unconscious underwater but the players are under observation by the referees during competition, and players in any case tend to be very aware of what their teammates are doing or not doing - in practice an unconscious or seriously injured player is likely to be noticed and assisted or rescued very promptly.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Personal protective equipment is available to reduce injury risks and the published rules make many items, such as mouthguards and earguards, mandatory. There is also a risk of pulmonary capillary stress failure ([[Hemoptysis]]) in some players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.respiratorycasereports.com/article/S2213-0071(14)00004-5/abstract|title=Lung physiology at play: Hemoptysis due to underwater hockey|last=|first=|date=|website=Respiratory Medicine Case Reports|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

]]

Players wear a [[diving mask]], [[Swimmer's snorkel|snorkel]] and [[swimfins|fins]], and carry in one (either) hand a short stick for playing the puck. A full list of equipment is given below:

===Swimwear===

There are usually no restrictions on swimwear, however baggy style trunks or shorts are not recommended as they reduce speed and increase drag in the water. Typical swimwear is [[swim briefs]] for male players and [[one-piece swimsuit]]s for female players.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Mask===
[[File:Isabella Piccoli.jpg|thumb|Worlds Competition Grade Equipment]]
A [[diving mask]] is used for several reasons:
* Players can equalise their ears (using the [[Valsalva manoeuvre]]) as the nose is covered
* Unlike [[swim goggles]] a mask sits outside the eye's [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]], reducing the effects of any impact
* Improved underwater vision
A low-volume mask with minimal protrusion from the face reduces the likelihood of the mask being knocked causing it to leak or flood and temporarily obstruct the player's vision. The published rules require masks to have two lenses to reduce the risk and extent of possible injury from puck impact; the danger of a single lens mask is that the aperture may be large enough to allow a puck to pass through it on impact, and hence into the player's eyes. A number of webbing strap designs are available to replace the original head strap with a non-elastic strap that can reduce the possibility of the player being unmasked.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Snorkel===
A snorkel enables players to watch the progress of the game without having to lift their head from the water to breathe. This allows them to keep their position on the surface, ready to resume play once they have recovered. In order to maximise the efficiency of breathing and reduce drag underwater snorkels are often short with a wide bore and may include a drain valve. The published rules mandate that they must not be rigid or have any sharp edges or points.

The snorkel may accommodate an external [[mouthguard]] which may be worn in conjunction with, or instead of, an internal mouthguard.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Fins===

[[swimfin|Fins]] allow the player to swim faster through the water. A wide variety of fins are used in the sport but large plastic/rubber composite fins or smaller, stiffer [[fibreglass]] or [[carbon fibre]] fins are commonplace at competitions. As with any of the equipment, the published rules mandate that the fins must have no sharp edges or corners, nor buckles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Stick===

The [[hockey stick|stick]] (also referred to as a 'pusher' or 'bat') is relatively short and is coloured white or black to indicate the player's team. The stick may only be held in one hand, which is usually determined by the player's [[handedness]], although players may swap hands during play. The shape of the stick may affect playing style and is often a very personal choice. A wide variety of stick designs are allowed within the constraints of the rules of the game, the principal rules being that the stick (including the handle) must fit into a box of {{Convert|100|x|50|x|abbr=on|350|mm}} and that the stick must not be capable of surrounding either the puck or any part of the hand. A rule concerning the minimum radius of edges tries to address the risk of injury should body contact occur. Construction materials may be of wood or plastics and current rules now supersede those that previously required sticks to be [[homogeneous]], although they almost always are anyway. Many UWH players manufacture their own sticks to their preferred shape and style, although there are increasingly more mass-produced designs to suit the majority (such as Bentfish, Britbat, CanAm, Dorsal, Stingray etc.).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Puck===

The [[Hockey puck|puck]] is approximately the size of an [[ice hockey]] puck but is made of [[lead]] or lead-based material - (adult size weighs {{Convert|1.3|-|1.5|kg|abbr=on}}, junior {{Convert|800|-|850|g|abbr=on|lb}}) - and is encapsulated or surrounded by a plastic covering which is usually performance-matched to different pool bottoms (e.g. tiles, concrete etc.) to facilitate good grip on the stick face while preventing excessive friction on the pool bottom. The puck's weight brings it to rest on the pool bottom, though it can be lofted during passes.

===Caps===

Safety gear includes ear protection, usually in the form of a [[water polo cap]]&lt;ref name=SAMJ&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Landsberg PG |title=South African Underwater Diving Accidents, 1969-1976 |journal=SA Medical Journal|page=2156 |date=December 1976|url=http://archive.samj.org.za/1976%20VOL%20L%20Jul-Dec/Articles/12%20December/4.7%20SOUTH%20AFRICAN%20UNDERWATER%20DIVING%20ACCIDENTS%20,1969-%201976.P.G.Landsberg.pdf |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a secondary indicator of the player's team (coloured black/blue/dark or white/pale as appropriate). Water referees should wear red hats.

===Glove===

A [[glove]] should be worn on the playing hand to protect against pool-bottom abrasion and, in some designs, for protection against puck impact on knuckles and other vulnerable areas, however no rigid protection is permitted. Players may choose to wear a protective glove on both hands, either as additional protection from the pool bottom or, for [[ambidextrous]] players, to switch the stick between hands mid-play.  A glove used in competition must be a contrasting colour to the wearer's stick, but not orange which is reserved for referees' gloves - this is so water referees might be able to better distinguish between a pusher making a legal contact with the puck and a hand making an illegal contact with the puck.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Goal===

The goals (or 'gulleys') are three metres wide and are sited on the pool bottom at opposite ends of the playing area in the centre of the end lines. They consist of a shallow slope leading up to a trough into which the puck may be pushed or flicked. Goals are commonly constructed from [[aluminium]], [[galvanised steel]] or [[stainless steel]]. This makes them negatively buoyant and durable in the [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]] water of swimming pools.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Referees==

[[Referee]]ing the game are two (or three) water [[referee]]s (i.e. in the pool with full [[snorkelling]] gear, and wearing a distinctive red cap, orange gloves and golden yellow shirt) to observe and referee play at the pool bottom, and one or more poolside deck [[referee]]s to track time (both in the period and for each ejected player), maintain the score, and call fouls (such as excessive number of players in play, failure to start a point from the end of the playing area, or another foul capable of being committed at or noticed from the surface).  The deck (chief) [[referee]] responds to hand signals given by the water [[referee]]s to start and stop play, including after an interruption such as a foul or time-out, or indeed to stop play if they themself see a rule infringement.

The Official Rules, which are available for download in [[PDF]] form without charge, define (with illustrations) a valid goal, the fouls and signals, and the dimensions of the playing area, sticks, and goals, as well as team composition and substitution procedure, and additional rules and arrangements for multi-team competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hockey Rules Volume 1 and 2, [http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2854&amp;language=1] &amp; [http://www.cmas.org/document?sessionId=&amp;fileId=2853&amp;language=1], retrieved 16/04/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rules Volumes 1 and 2, {{cite web |url=http://www.thewaa.org/WAA_FILES/Files/PDF%20FILES/UWH%20Rules%20v1%2030%20Vol1%20finalGH.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105302/http://www.thewaa.org/WAA_FILES/Files/PDF%20FILES/UWH%20Rules%20v1%2030%20Vol1%20finalGH.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }} &amp; {{cite web |url=http://www.thewaa.org/WAA_FILES/Files/PDF%20FILES/UWH%20Rules%20v1%2030%20Vol2%20finalGH.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105358/http://www.thewaa.org/WAA_FILES/Files/PDF%20FILES/UWH%20Rules%20v1%2030%20Vol2%20finalGH.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}, retrieved 30/08/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectators==

[[File:Octopush.jpg|thumb|Octopush contest seen from the surface, at Crystal Palace Pool, London]]
At a club or training level, Underwater Hockey is not particularly spectator friendly. Very few pools have underwater viewing ports, and since the action is all below the surface, an observer would usually have to enter the water to see the skill and complexities of the game. Spectators may either put on mask, fins and snorkel and enter the pool for a view of the playing area, or possibly take advantage of the work of underwater videographers who have recorded major tournaments.&lt;ref name=BBCCAM&gt;{{Cite news |work=BBC News |title=New sport is not out of its depth |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4538582.stm |accessdate=2011-06-28 |date=17 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tournaments often have live footage on large screens for the spectators which makes it a very exciting spectator sport. The 2006 ([[Sheffield]], England) and 2010 ([[Durban]], South Africa) [[Underwater Hockey World Championships]] were screened poolside and simultaneously [[webcast]] live to spectators around the world, while the 2008 European Championship in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] had excellent video coverage but no live streaming.&lt;ref name=WEBCAST&gt;{{cite web |publisher=247.tv |title=2006 CMAS Underwater Hockey WC |year=2006 |url=http://www.247.tv/under-water-hockey/2006-cmas-underwater-hockey-wc |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming the games is challenging even for the experienced videographer, as the players' movements are fast and there are few places on the surface or beneath it which are free from their seemingly frenzied movements. Games are often played width-wise across a 50-metre pool to provide spaces in between simultaneous games for player substitutes, penalty boxes, coaches and camera crews. However, research and development of filming techniques is ongoing.

Organizers of major tournaments are usually the point of contact for acquiring footage of underwater hockey matches. Although no official worldwide repository exists for recorded games, there are many websites and instructional DVDs. A wide variety of related footage can be found on video sharing sites.&lt;ref name=YOUTUBE&gt;{{cite web |title=Various UWH clips |url= https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=underwater+hockey+-ice+-model |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Underwater Hockey was started in the United Kingdom by Alan Blake in 1954.  Blake was a founder-member of the newly formed [[Southsea]] Sub-Aqua Club ([[British Sub-Aqua Club]] No.9) and he and other divers including John Ventham, Jack Willis, and Frank Lilleker first played this game in [[Eastney]] Swimming Pool, [[Portsmouth]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blake, A |title=Octopush: An original name invented on the same night as Octopush an original sport was invented |url=http://octopush.awardspace.com/ |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called "Octopush" (and still known locally by that name in the United Kingdom today) the original rules called for teams of eight players (hence "octo-"), a bat reminiscent of a tiny shuffleboard stick called a "pusher" (hence the "-push"), an uncoated [[lead]] [[hockey puck|puck]] called a "squid", and a goal known at first as a "cuttle" but soon thereafter a "gulley".  Apart from 'pusher' and to a lesser extent 'Octopush' much of this original terminology is now consigned to history.

The first rules were tested in a 1954 two-on-two game and an announcement was made in the November 1954 issue of ''[[Neptune]]'', the then-official news sheet of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]]. 
The first Octopush competition between clubs was a three-way [[tournament]] between teams from Southsea, [[Bournemouth]] and [[Brighton]] in early 1955. Southsea won then, and they are still highly ranked at national level today (they won again in 2009, 2012 and 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbuwh.co.uk/index.php?component=page&amp;id=214 |title=The British Octopush Association - History |website=Gbuwh.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport spread to [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] in the mid/late 1950s by the spearfishermen of the Durban Undersea Club (DUC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CMAS |title=Underwater Hockey in South Africa |url=http://history.cmas.org/underwater-hockey-in-south-africa |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; when dirty summer seas prevented the young bloods from getting their weekly exercise and excitement. The first games were played in the pool of club member Max Doveton. However it soon became so popular that weekly contests were held in a municipal pool.  The UK's Octopush used a small paddle to push the puck whilst the South Africans used a mini hockey stick. Whilst the 'long stick' version of underwater hockey did spread outside of South Africa, the UK's 'short stick' version ultimately prevailed and is how UWH is universally played now.

In the [[Americas]], the game first came to [[Canada]] in 1962 via Norm Leibeck, an unconventional Australian [[scuba diving]] instructor and dive shop owner, who introduced the sport to a [[Vancouver]] dive club. Ten years later, the Underwater Hockey Association of [[British Columbia]] (UHABC) was formed and received support from the BC government.

Down under, Underwater Hockey has been played in [[Australia]] since 1966, again because of Norm Leibeck, the same Australian, who returned from Canada with his Canadian bride Marlene, and it now attracts players from a wide range of backgrounds there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Quilford, R. | work=The Age |title=Breath-taking fun for anyone |date=17 December 2007 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/breathtaking-fun-for-anyone/2007/12/16/1197740090518.html |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Australian Underwater Hockey Championships were held in Margaret River, Western Australia in 1975. A Women’s division was added to the championships in 1981 and a Junior division commenced in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=BBC News |title=The History of Underwater Hockey in Australia |date=11 September 2011 |url=http://underwaterhockeyaustralia.org.au/records/ |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Asia]], the game first came to the [[Philippines]] in the late 1970s through the scuba diving community that became aware of Octopush.

It can be seen that the game was much slower and the puck was not flicked at all, in contrast to the modern sport&lt;ref name=YOUTUBE/&gt; where the substantial changes in equipment, team size, and other factors have helped make the game the international sport it is today, with 68 teams from 19 &lt;ref name=WORLDS06&gt;{{cite web |title=2006 CMAS Underwater Hockey World Championships |date=August 2006 |url=http://www.uwhworlds2006.net/en/tournament_sch_results.asp |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries competing at the 18th World Championship in 2013 at [[Eger]] in [[Hungary]] making this the pinnacle in terms of international competition to date.

==International competition==

Underwater Hockey enjoys popularity in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]],  as well as to a lesser extent in other countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Serbia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]] and [[Zimbabwe]], and is gaining a foothold in numerous additional countries.&lt;ref name=ASYLUM&gt;{{Cite news |work=BBC News |title=Moldovans snorkel to new life |date=11 March 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2840543.stm |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Underwater Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] have been held every two years since 1980.  At the [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]] (CMAS) 14th World Underwater Hockey Championship held in August 2006 in Sheffield, England, at the time a record 44 teams from 17 countries competed in six age and gender categories. Participating countries were [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Hungary]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Jersey]] C.I., the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United States]]. Subsequent world championships have been  less well-attended, including the WAA World Championship held in 2008 in [[Durban]], South Africa, until the 18th CMAS World Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater Hockey World Championship 2013 Eger - Hungary. Information Pack is out|url=http://www.cmas.org/hockey/underwater-hockey-world-championship-2013-eger-hungary-information-pack-is-out|publisher=CMAS|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in [[Eger]], [[Hungary]] in August 2013. This event once again saw all age and gender divisions, now including men and women in U19, U23, Masters and Elite categories compete. There were 68 teams competing across the eight age/gender divisions from 19 participating countries, making this World Championship the largest competition in the history of the sport to date.  During 18th World Championships a decision was made by the federations to split the competition into two events with Junior Grades (U19, U23) to be accommodated in a separate event&lt;ref&gt;3rd Age Group World Championship&lt;/ref&gt; to be held every two years from 2015 with the competition&lt;ref&gt;19th World Championship&lt;/ref&gt; for the Elite and Masters grades in [[Stellenbosch]], [[South Africa]] in 2016.

At Elite level [[Australia]] are the current Men's World Champions, and [[South Africa]] are the current Women's World Champions.  
At Masters level [[Australia]] are the current Men's World Champions, and [[Australia]] are the current Women's World Champions. 
At U23 level [[Turkey]] are the current Men's World Champions, and [[New Zealand]] are the current Women's World Champions.
At U19 level [[France]] are the current Men's World Champions, and [[New Zealand]] are the current Women's World Champions.

The next World Championships for Elite and Masters grades are due to be held in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in July 2018.
The next World Championships for the Age Groups are due to be held in [[Sheffield]], [[England]] in August 2019.

==Governing bodies==

Political turmoil within the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission (CMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Underwater Hockey|url=http://www.cmas.org/hockey|publisher=CMAS|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Underwater Hockey world governing body, came to a head soon after the 2006 World Championship, resulting in the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission members resigning en masse and soon thereafter forming an alternative 'world governing body' solely for the sport of UWH, known as the '''World Aquachallenge Association''' (WAA), and which was officially ratified at the 1st WAA World Championship in April–May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Meeting Minutes (on WAA News Page)|url=http://www.thewaa.org/WAA_FILES/Files/PDF%20FILES/WAAMeeting%20Final%20minutes%20Web%20version.pdf|publisher=WAA|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, from this point the UWH community had two world governing bodies, CMAS and WAA.

CMAS has continued to organise international world competitions on a bi-annual basis.  CMAS tried unsuccessfully to hold another World Underwater Games event in 2009 after a successful event in 2007.  These were intended to be multi-disciplinary events thereby grouping UWH with other CMAS-represented sports including [[fin swimming]] and [[underwater rugby]].  The 1st World Games were held in [[Bari]], [[Italy]] in 2007 while the 2nd was scheduled for [[Tunisia]] in 2009 but was cancelled and rescheduled as an UWH-only event held in [[Kranj]], [[Slovenia]] during August 2009. It was billed as a World Championship but only one non-European country competed ([[South Africa]]); France won the Open division while Great Britain took the Women's title.  In the years in between World Games CMAS holds Zone Championships (e.g. the 15th European Championship in [[Eger]], [[Hungary]] during 2017).

WAA attempted to continue with the original World Championship series on a bi-annual basis during years ending with an even number. The 1st WAA Championships (renumbered; it would have been the CMAS 15th) was held in 2008 in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]. The 2nd competition was scheduled for [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]] in August 2010 but it proceeded as an International Event without WAA sanctioning and became the precursor for the development of the independent America's Cup International Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open World Cup UWH 2010 USA results|url=http://www.usauwh.com/news/Wordpress/?m=201008|publisher=USA Underwater Hockey|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European (CMAS) and the rest of the World (WAA) events following the split were held over exactly the same period in 2008 a continent apart. This dichotomy of championships coupled with the real possibility of future sanctions by CMAS on their member countries' organisations and athletes led to many countries being forced to choose which competition to send their team to. As a result, neither competition in 2008 was as well attended as had been the case in previous years, nor as competitive. Subsequently, no WAA sanctioned events have taken place since 2008.  However, in Europe at least, well-organised international tournaments without CMAS or WAA influence (such as at [[Breda]] in the Netherlands, [[Barcelona]] in Spain, or [[České Budějovice]] in the Czech Republic) continue to be regularly attended by a range of club teams from across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teams for the Argonauta 2013 UWH Tournament |url=http://argonautatournament.nl/teams-for-the-2013-argonauta-uwh-tournament/|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XIV International UWH Tournament Barcelona 2013 Results |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4R-o8S7KFrdSmZ6OW1fREZmYkU/edit?pli=1|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6th International UWH Bud Pig Cup |url=http://www.uwh.wz.cz/bud_pick_cup_en.htm |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a new CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission was appointed for a 4-year period to guide the sport on a technical level and gradually it has reconsolidated the sport and produced a development plan to cope with future growth. The commission continues to work to develop relationships with CMAS Board of Directors and obtain support for its development plan.

As part of this plan the Commission developed an Age Group-based International Championship incorporating Under 19, Under 23 and Masters (Men &gt;35, Women &gt;32) Grades.  This Championship was held in July 2011 in [[Dordrecht]], [[Netherlands]]. The event was to be sanctioned by CMAS but the Dutch organising team withdrew their hosting bid and proceeded to host the event successfully with 36 teams participating. As the event was non-compliant with the CMAS Competition procedures, [[Scotland]] was able to compete as a separate country rather than within a combined entity as Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netherlands Open Youth &amp; Masters Underwater Hockey Tournament|url=http://www.underwaterhockey-archive.com/UWH-2011-WJC.htm|publisher=www.underwaterhockey-archive.com/|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the surviving governing body, as of August 2013 CMAS has the following countries and territories affiliated with its Underwater Hockey Commission: [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Hungary]], [[Indonesia]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMAS, Sport, UWH Commission, Member Federations|url=http://www.cmas.org/cmas/federations?continent=&amp;comme=1&amp;commi=3|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arthur Vasermil Municipal Stadium''', commonly known as the '''Vasermil Stadium''', is a football stadium in [[Beersheba]], [[Israel]]. The stadium was designed as an open bowl (though a small part of one side has cover), and at one stage had a running track, though this was later bricked over. In its final form the stadium was all-seated with a capacity of 13,000.

==History==
The stadium was the home ground of [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Be'er Sheva]] from its opening in 1960. Initially known as the '''Municipal Stadium''', it was renamed in 1988 after when the mother of Arthur Vasermil financed stadium refurbishment work; Vasermil had died at [[Majdanek concentration camp]] during [[the Holocaust]] at the age of seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sports/Beersheba-cuts-the-ribbon-on-Israels-newest-soccer-stadium-416350 Beersheba cuts the ribbon on Israel’s newest soccer stadium] The Jerusalem Post, 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005–06 season, it also served as the home ground for [[Maccabi Be'er Sheva F.C.|Maccabi Be'er Sheva]] for their [[Liga Leumit]] season, as their ground did not meet the required standard for Liga Leumit. Maccabi returned to their grounds with their relegation back to [[Liga Artzit]].

The ground was used for international football when [[Israel national football team|Israel]] played the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in friendly match on 15 November 1973, with Israel winning 2–0 in front of 3,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/usamen1.html |title=USA Men's National Team: All-time Results, 1885-1989 |author=|editor=Dave Litterer|date= |work= |publisher=Dave Litterer |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a survey of Beersheba residents finding that the overwhelming majority would prefer the city to renovate the old stadium rather than dedicating all its funds to the building of a new stadium,&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-10|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1235898314027&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Soccer fans out of bounds in council protest|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city council has plans to demolish the stadium after the completion of the [[United States dollar|US$]]50 million 16,000-seat [[Turner Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gab-arch.co.il/projects_main.html Be'er-Sheva Stadium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108055348/http://www.gab-arch.co.il/projects_main.html |date=2011-11-08 }} GAB Architects&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in 2015.

'''Wydad de Fès''' is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club currently playing in the [[Botola|First division]].  The club was founded in 1948 and is located in the town of [[Fès]].

Wydad Athletic Club de Fès (W.A.F) were promoted from the 2nd Division in 2008–09.

==WAF==
Wydad Fassi Sports Club is a football/sports club of the Moroccan city of Fès. This club was founded in 1948, and had for a while fallen on lean times, languishing in the shadows of Division 3 after having been one of the pillars of the national championship first division. They are the second Fès team, with the MAS Fès club having more success in recent time. They play in shirt of vertical black and white stripes.

==Stadium==
Their stadium, [[Complexe Sportif de Fès]], is located at the southern end of the road to [[Sefrou]] (Trek Sefrou), built in a typical Moroccan style. Presentation of use accompanied by technical data, the sports complex of Fès was able to open its doors after much debate on the financing of its facilities. Located on an area of 40 hectares, the stadium can accommodate 45,000 spectators all seated. It has a running track in addition tartan annexes likely to host high-level competitions. 15 years after first breaking ceremony to launch construction work of this complex, which required an investment of 30 billion centimes (30 million), we are in front of a monument which was only dream.
