      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19211">In the [[myth]] and [[folklore]] of the [[Near East]] and [[Europe]], '''Abyzou''' is the name of a female [[demon]]. Abyzou was blamed for [[miscarriage]]s and [[infant mortality]] and was said to be motivated by [[envy]] ({{lang-el|φθόνος}} ''phthonos''), as she herself was infertile. In the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], she is identified with [[Lilith]], in [[Copt]]ic Egypt with [[Abyzou#Alabasandria|Alabasandria]], and in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine culture]] with [[Gello|Gylou]], but in various texts surviving from the [[syncretism|syncretic]] magical practice of antiquity and the early medieval era she is said to have many or virtually innumerable names.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Margaret Fulgum, "Coins Used as Amulets in Late Antiquity," in ''Between Magic and Religion: Interdisciplinary Studies in Ancient Mediterranean Religion and Society'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Abyzou (also spelled '''Abizou''', '''Obizu''', '''Obizuth''', '''Obyzouth''', '''Byzou''' etc.) is pictured on [[amulet]]s with fish- or serpent-like attributes. Her fullest literary depiction is the [[compendium]] of [[demonology]] known as the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'', dated variously by scholars from as early as the 1st century AD to as late as the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Barb, "Antaura. The Mermaid and the Devil's Grandmother: A Lecture," ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 29 (1966), p. 5; "at least to the 2nd century," Sara Iles Johnston, ''Religions of the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22to+at+least+the+2nd%22+inauthor:Sarah+inauthor:Iles+inauthor:Johnston&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; "probably dates to the third century," James H. Charlesworth, "Jewish Interest in Astrology," '' Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II 20.2 (1987) pp. 935–936 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W98sGP3j1GQC&amp;pg=PA935&amp;dq=%22Testament+of+Solomon%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
A.A. Barb connected Abyzou and similar female demons to the story of the [[chaos (cosmogony)|primeval sea]], [[Abzu]], in [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]]. Barb argued that although the name "Abyzou" appears to be a corrupted form of the Greek {{lang|grc|ἄβυσσος}} ''ábyssos'' "abyss",&lt;ref&gt;Based on a popular etymology that saw in the word Greek ''[[bythos]]'' ("depth") with an [[alpha privative]] to mean "without depth" or "bottomless"; Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), p. 4, gives no etymology for ἄβυσσος.&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek itself was borrowed from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''Apsu'' or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''Abzu''.

The primeval sea was originally an [[androgyne]] or asexual, later dividing into the male Abzu ([[fresh water]]) and the female [[Tiamat]] ([[seawater]], appearing as the [[Tehom]] in the [[Book of Genesis]]). The female demons, among whom [[Lilith]] is the best-known, are often said to have come from the primeval sea. In [[ancient Greek religion]], female sea monsters that combine allure and deadliness may also derive from this tradition, including the [[Gorgon]]s (who were daughters of the old sea god [[Phorcys]]), [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], [[harpy|harpies]], and even water [[nymph]]s and [[Nereid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Barb, "Antaura. The Mermaid and the Devil's Grandmother: A Lecture," ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 29 (1966), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the word ''Abyssos'' is treated as a [[noun]] of feminine [[grammatical gender]], even though Greek nouns ending in ''-os'' are typically masculine. ''Abyssos'' is equivalent in meaning to Abzu as the dark chaotic sea before [[Creation myth|Creation]]. The word also appears in the Christian [[New Testament]], occurring six times in the [[Book of Revelation]], where it is conventionally translated not as "the deep" but as "the bottomless pit" of [[Hell]]. Barb argues that in essence the Sumerian Abzu is the "grandmother" of the Christian [[Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;Barb, "Antaura," pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Testament of Solomon==
In the [[late antique]] ''Testament of Solomon'',&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Solomon'' 58–59, translation and introduction by F.C. Conybeare, ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' 11 (1898), p. 30 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dw4ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22I+am+called+among+men+Obizuth%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20am%20called%20among%20men%20Obizuth%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Abyzou (as Obizuth) is described as having a "greenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hair"; the rest of her body is covered by darkness.&lt;ref name="Barb, Antaura, p. 9"&gt;Barb, "Antaura," p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker ("[[King Solomon]]") encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them as he sees fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women about to give birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain.&lt;ref&gt;Barb, "Antaura," p. 5; for online texts of the ''Testament'', see "Selected bibliography" [[Abyzou#Selected bibliography|below.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung up in front of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] in public view. The writer of the ''Testament'' appears to have been thinking of the ''[[Apotropaic magic#Apotropaic symbols|gorgoneion]]'', or the icon of the [[Medusa]]'s head, which often adorned [[Greek temple]]s and occasionally Jewish [[synagogue]]s in late antiquity.&lt;ref name="Barb, Antaura, p. 9"/&gt;

Envy is a theme in the ''Testament'',&lt;ref&gt;Fr. George R.A. Aquaro, ''Death by Envy: The Evil Eye and Envy in the Christian Tradition'' (iUniverse, 2004), p. 99 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kO1s6RFN6R4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Gyllou+OR+Gylou&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and during his interrogation by the king, [[Beelzebub]] himself asserts that he inspires envy among humans.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Solomon'' 27, p. 22 in Conybeare.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the succession of demons bound and questioned, the [[personification]] of Envy is described as headless, and motivated by the need to steal another's head: "I grasp in an instant a man's head ... and put it on myself."&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Solomon'' 43–44, p. 26 in Conybeare.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Envy's [[Sisyphean]] efforts to replace his head, Abyzou (Obizuth) cannot rest until she steals a child each night.

==On medical amulets==
[[File:Abyzou.jpg|thumb|Amulet depicting Abyzou whipped by Arlaph]]
On the inscribed healing [[amulet]]s of the Near Eastern and [[Magic in the Graeco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] magico-medical tradition, illness or affliction is often [[personification|personified]] and addressed directly; the practitioner may be instructed to inscribe or chant a phrase that orders the ailment to depart: for example, "Flee, Fever!"&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a course of treatment employing a "flee" charm, see article on [[Medicina Plinii#Sample remedies|Medicina Plinii]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ailment may also be conceived of as caused by a demon, who must be identified correctly by name and commanded to depart. In this mode, magico-healing practice bears comparison to [[exorcism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy Kotansky, "Incantations and Prayers on Inscribed Greek Amulets," in ''Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion'', edited by Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 113–114 and 119; on exorcism of the childbirth demon, {{cite book|last=Vasilakē|first=Maria|title=Images of the Mother of God: Perceptions of the Theotokos in Byzantium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qw9zUeRLJ1QC&amp;pg=PA256|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|isbn=978-0-7546-3603-8|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abyzou is depicted and named on several early Byzantine [[bronze]] amulets. With her hands tied behind her back, she kneels as she is whipped by a standing figure, identified as Solomon or Arlaph, called Afarof in the ''Testament of Solomon'' and identified with the [[Raphael (archangel)|archangel Raphael]]. On one amulet, the figure is labeled as Arlaph, but an inscription reads "The Seal of Solomon [is] with the bearer; I am Noskam." The reverse inscription is written within an [[ouroboros]], the symbol of a snake biting its tail to form a circle: "Flee, flee, Abyzou, [from] Sisinios and Sisinnia; the voracious dog dwells here." ([[Gello#Legend of Saint Sisinnios|Saint Sisinnios]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter|first=Christopher|title=The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRju9VQdW3QC&amp;pg=PA241|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-84014-694-3|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes takes the Solomon role on Christian amulets.) Although Abyzou is regarded mainly as a threat to child-bearing women and to infants, some of the names of those seeking protection from her on extant amulets are masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Spier, "Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets and Their Tradition," ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 56 (1993), pp. 37–38, full text available [http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cmedst/gmap/uploaded/Medieval%20Byzantine%20Magical%20Amulets%20and%20Their%20Tradition.pdf online.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824055255/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cmedst/gmap/uploaded/Medieval%20Byzantine%20Magical%20Amulets%20and%20Their%20Tradition.pdf |date=2009-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval amulets show a variation on this [[iconography]], with Abyzou trampled underfoot by a horseman. The rider is identified again either as Solomon or Arlaph; one example depicts the rider as Sisinnios, with the demon named as both Abizou and Anabardalea, and an angel named Araph (for Arlaph) standing by with one raised wing. The medieval lead amulets that show the rider subduing the female often have a main image that resembles a gorgoneion and is likely a womb symbol (''hystera'').&lt;ref&gt;Fulgum, "Coins Used as Amulets in Late Antiquity," p. 142; Spier, "Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets," pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The names of Abyzou==
In one magic-related text, the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]] confronts Abyzou and compels her to tell him the 40 names that can control her.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Giannobile and D.R. Jordan, "A Lead [[Amulet|Phylactery]] from Colle san Basilio ([[Sicily]])," ''Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies'' 46 (2006), p. 80, citing ''Cod.Marc.gr.app.'' II 163 in F. Pradel, ''Griechische und süditalienische Gebete, Beschwörungen und Rezepte des Mittelalters'', ''RGVV'' 3.3 (1907) 23–24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RhQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA275 online] for the relevant passage in Greek.&lt;/ref&gt; In magico-religious practice, the knowledge of the secret name of a deity, divine force, or demon offers power over that entity.&lt;ref&gt;The secrecy surrounding the correct names of gods extended to prayer formularies in general and was characteristic of [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], [[Mystery cult|mystery religions]], [[early Christianity]] and Judaism, and other religions of antiquity. See Matthias Klinghardt, "Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion," Numen 46 (1999) 1–52, and for an example of dire consequences attending on the revelation of a secret name, see article on [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Testament of Solomon,'' the demon herself declares that she has ten-thousands of names and forms, and that Raphael is her antithesis. She says that if her name is written on a scrap of [[papyrus]] when a woman is about to give birth, "I shall flee from them to the other world."&lt;ref&gt;Barb, "Antaura,"p. 5; Spier, "Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets and Their Tradition," p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants on the name of Abyzou appear frequently in charms in languages such as [[ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].&lt;ref&gt;Barb, "Antaura," p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyllou, Gylou, Gello===
{{main|Gello}}
The female childbirth demon appears frequently in magical texts under her Babylonian name Gyllou or Gylou. In one Greek tale set in the time of "[[Trajan]] the King", Gyllou under torture reveals her "twelve and a half names":

{{quote|My first and special name is called Gyllou; the second Amorphous; the third '''Abyzou'''; the fourth Karkhous; the fifth Brianê; the sixth Bardellous; the seventh Aigyptianê; the eighth Barna; the ninth Kharkhanistrea; the tenth Adikia; ...&lt;ref&gt;There is a gap in the original text.&lt;/ref&gt; the twelfth Myia; the half Petomene.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked, ''Amulets and Magic Bowls: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity'' (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1985), pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In medieval texts, one of Gylou's twelve and a half names is given as Anabardalea, a name also associated with Abyzou.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, "Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets," p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form of [[Gello]], the demon appears in a fragment from [[Sappho]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sappho]], frg. 178 in ''Poeta Lesbiorum fragmenta'', edited by Edgar Lobel and Denys Page (Oxford 1955), p. 101; Karen Hartnup, ''On the Beliefs of the Greeks: [[Leo Allatius|Leo Allatios]] and Popular Orthodoxy'' (Brill, 2004), pp. 35, 85–86, 149–150, limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perdrizet-Negotium-fig006-Baouit.png|thumb|360px|Fresco unearthed at Bawit. Mounted figure is Sissinios (only "os" remains to be read), the trampled female is Alabasandria.

===Antaura===
Antaura is a female demon who causes [[migraine]] headaches. She is known primarily from a 2nd/3rd century silver ''lamella'' (inscribed metal leaf) found at the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military settlement [[Carnuntum]] in present-day [[Austria]]. Antaura, whose name means something like "Contrary Wind", is said to come out of the sea. In the inscription, she is confronted by the [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|Ephesian Artemis]], who plays the role assigned to the male figures Solomon, Arlaph, and Sisinnios in Jewish and Christian magic.&lt;ref&gt;Barb, "Antaura," especially pp. 2–5; [[Georg Luck]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds. A Collection of Ancient Texts'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2nd ed. 2006), p. 281 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ROcBMDUXCMoC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Antaura&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; Roy Kotansky, "Jesus and the Lady of the Abyss (Mark 2:25–34): ''Hieros gamos'', Cosmogony, and the Elixir of Life," in ''Antiquity and Humanity: Essays on Ancient Religion and Philosophy Presented to Hans Dieter Betz on His 70th Birthday'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2001), p. 100, note 49 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dl0k7IMJaNMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Antaura&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]; Roy Kotansky, "An [[Early Christian]] Gold ''lamella'' for Headache," in ''Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 41–42 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xMDHgzjSU_MC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Antaura&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA41,M1 online]; Vivian Nutton, ''Ancient Medicine'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 274 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oShfkIhduowC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=Antaura&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online]. Full discussion of this amulet in Roy Kotansky, ''Greek Magical Amulets: The Inscribed Gold, Silver, Copper, and Bronze'' Lamellae: ''Text and Commentary'' (Opladen : Westdeutscher Verlag, 1994), 1.270–300 (nos. 52.93–95), esp. 279, 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alabasandria===
At the [[Bawit|monastery of St. Apollo in Bawit]], Egypt, a [[Roman art#Painting|wall painting]] depicts the childbirth demon under the name Alabasandria (or Alabasdria) as she is trampled under the hooves of a horse. The rider wears a belted tunic and trousers in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] manner, and an [[epigraphy|inscription]], now faded, was read at the time of its discovery as Sisinnios.&lt;ref&gt;Fulgum, "Coins Used as Amulets in Late Antiquity," p. 142 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NBQe3gS_ys0C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Alabasandria&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; This central image is surrounded by other figures, including a [[centaur]], the piercing of the [[evil eye]], and the demon's daughter, winged and reptile-tailed, identified by an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), p. 241 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BRju9VQdW3QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA241&amp;dq=demon+Gyllou,+OR+Gylou,+OR+Gello,+OR+Gillo&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the 2012 horror film ''[[The Possession (2012 film)|The Possession]]'', Abyzou is the name of the [[Dybbuk]] that haunts one of the main characters, Emily "Em" Brenek.
* In "The Sisters Mills", an episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] fantasy series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', Abyzou is featured as the primary antagonist. Here she is the origin of the myth of the [[Tooth Fairy]].

'''Albert Reuss''' (2 October 1889 – 4 November 1975) was a painter and sculptor born in [[Vienna]] who fled to England in 1938 following the [[Anschluss]], [[Adolf Hitler]]’s annexation of Austria to the German Reich. In the process, Reuss lost many members of his family, and the reputation he had built up as an artist in Vienna. He continued to work as an exiled artist in England, but his style changed dramatically, reflecting the trauma he had suffered. Several provincial galleries in England hold his work, most notably [[Newlyn Art Gallery]] in [[Cornwall]], the [[British Museum]]  and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, the [[Österreichische Galerie Belvedere]] (the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] Gallery) and the [[Albertina]] both in Vienna, and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cornwallartists.org/cornwall-artists/albert-reuss|title=Albert REUSS {{!}} Cornwall Artists Index|website=cornwallartists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardie|first1=Melissa|title=100 Years in Newlyn: Diary of a Gallery|date=1995|publisher=Patton Press|location=Newlyn|isbn=9781872229171 |page=156|edition=Illustrated|language=en|id= {{ASIN|1872229174|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newlynartgallery.co.uk/activities/albert-reuss/|title=Albert Reuss exhibition in The Picture Room at Newlyn Art Gallery|work=Newlyn Art Gallery &amp; The Exchange|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1889–1922: Early years in Vienna===
Albert Reuss was the son of Hungarian Jews, Ignaz Reisz (1855–1911) and Sidonia née Freund (1861–1928). Ignaz was a ''Fleischhauermeister'' and ''Fleischhändler'', a master butcher and meat trader.&lt;ref name="ArtUK1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artuk.org/discover/stories/albert-reuss-the-artist-as-refugee|title=Albert Reuss: the artist as refugee {{!}} Art UK|website=artuk.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple at some stage moved to [[Malacky]], in former Hungary, now Slovakia, where their first three sons were born. In the late 1880s, the family moved to Vienna, where Albert was born, followed by a further six children, three of whom died in infancy, leaving seven surviving children in all. The family name Reisz was changed by the Austrian authorities to Reiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ikg-wien.at/departments/?lang=en|title=Departments - Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien|work=Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From a young age, Albert became estranged from his family. A frail, sickly and vulnerable child, he seemed neither to fit into nor to belong to the family into which he was born. He suffered from ill-health and had considerable difficulties with social interaction throughout his life. He was introduced to the world of art by a rich uncle, Baron Andreas Ritter von Reisinger, who was married to his father‘s sister, and who appears to have instilled in the young boy a lifelong inferiority complex. Albert's artistic abilities emerged when he was only five years old, and at the age of 14, he applied, unsuccessfully, to the ''[[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien]]''. Unable to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, he was obliged, on leaving school, to assist his father as a butcher. Given his delicate disposition and artistic sensibilities, working at the butchery was not an effective fit. There followed a series of equally unsuitable jobs, including salesman, childminder and actor, all of which ended in dismissal. These repeated experiences of rejection only added to his lack of self-worth. He became determined to teach himself by copying the Old Masters in the Belvedere Gallery and managed to gain several commissions for these paintings, as well as some commissions to paint portraits.

[[file:AlbertReuss1918.jpg|thumb|Albert Reuss in his studio, 1918]]

At the beginning of the [[First World War]], he was obliged to undertake military service, but was allowed to do this in Vienna, due to his poor health, avoiding frontline duty. In 1915 he met his future wife, Rosa Feinstein (1891–1970), the daughter of Benjamin Feinstein, a merchant, and his wife Hinda née Prechner. Benjamin was born in [[Warsaw, Poland]], which was at that time under the rule of Imperial Russia, making him and his family technically Russian. Rosa offered Albert the acceptance and encouragement he so desperately needed. Their marriage lasted for 55 years, and throughout that time she acted, in effect, as his agent and manager.

The couple were married in December 1916, but shortly after, Albert contracted [[tuberculosis]] and spent 18 months in a sanatorium. He took advantage of his confinement by drawing portraits of fellow patients, from which he began to establish a reputation as a portrait artist. Once he had recovered, the couple moved to an apartment at Möllwaldplatz 3, [[Wieden|Vienna IV]], where Albert established his studio, and in October 1922 they converted to Christianity. Also at this time, Albert started to use the surname "Reuss", though this change of name was not officially recognised until 1931. A young student, Sylvio Metzger, also moved into the apartment and developed a lifelong friendship with Albert and Rosa.  A large body of correspondence between Sylvio and the couple has survived, and is stored, along with much other documentation, at "basis wien" in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basis-wien.at/db/object/123781;jsessionid=6845C9255E252B0A4BC08E14C4022B28|title=basis wien - Nachlass Albert Reuss|last=wien|first=basis|website=www.basis-wien.at|language=de|access-date=2018-05-28}}The Estate of Albert Reuss&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=14-26}}

===1922–1938: Artistic development===
During the 1920s, Reuss gradually established himself as an artist, working initially in portraiture, then developing an individual style of line drawing, which he called his linear work. In 1922, he exhibited a portrait at the  [[Vienna Secession]],  (also known as ''the Union of Austrian Artists''), and had his first solo exhibition at the Würthle Galerie in 1926. In 1930, a newspaper proprietor sponsored him to spend a year in Cannes, where he completed forty portraits and landscapes in oil, following which, he had a second solo exhibition at the Würthle Galerie in 1931. His exhibitions received good reviews in the Viennese press. Reuss subsequently became a member of the prestigious artists' association, the [[Hagenbund]], with whom he exhibited on a number of occasions during the 1930s.

From 1926 to 1938, Reuss taught at the ''Fachlehranstalt für das Kleidungsgewerbe'' (The Specialist Teaching Institute for the Clothing Industry'')''. In 1934, he also started working as a sculptor, creating, among other things, portrait busts of the Viennese councillor Johann Grassinger and of  the actress [[Maria Eis]], as well as a study of his wife Rosa, now in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Throughout this period, the couple developed a middle-class lifestyle, and filled their flat in Vienna with numerous books, artefacts and artworks, including two works by [[Egon Schiele]]. Thus, by 1938, Reuss had become an established and relatively prosperous painter and sculptor in Vienna. However, this period coincided with the rise of Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]], and by this time, it became clear that Albert and Rosa would have to flee their home country.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=27–41}}

===1938–1947: Flight from Vienna and first years in England===
Following the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in March 1938, the Reusses packed up all their possessions, including Reuss's artworks, into 38 crates and left these in storage, but almost everything was confiscated by the Nazis. With the help of Cornishman and Quaker, [[John Sturge Stephens]] (1891–1954),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.100firstworldwarstories.co.uk/John-Sturge-Stephens/story/|title=100 First World War Stories {{!}} 100 Faces - 100 Stories|last=Stories|first=100 Faces - 100|website=www.100firstworldwarstories.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; they escaped from Vienna to England, where they arrived in Dover penniless and empty-handed in August 1938. They had with them 10 Reichsmark (equivalent at the time to about £1 sterling), the maximum cash allowed to emigrants by the German authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthony Grenville, Jewish Refugees from Germany and Austria in Britain, 1933-1970: Their Image in AJR Information, p. 4|publisher=Vallentine Mitchell &amp; Co Ltd|isbn=9780853038528|location=Edgware|language=en|id= {{ASIN|085303852X|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the Reiss family were not so fortunate: Albert's brother Julius and his family and his sister Ernestine and her husband Roman Torn,were murdered in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yvng.yadvashem.org/index.html?language=en&amp;s_lastName=reiss&amp;s_firstName=julius&amp;s_place=vienna&amp;s_dateOfBirth=&amp;s_inTransport= |title= Central DB of Shoah Victims' Names - Julius Reiss | website=yvng.yadvashem.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yvng.yadvashem.org/index.html?language=en&amp;s_lastName=torn&amp;s_firstName=ernestine&amp;s_place=&amp;s_dateOfBirth=&amp;s_inTransport=|title= Central DB of Shoah Victims' Names - Ernstine Torn |website=yvng.yadvashem.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reuss's remaining siblings emigrated to the United States.

After a brief stay in London, the Reusses were invited by John Sturge Stephens to his cottage in [[St Mawes]], the springboard of their future life in Cornwall. Now in their late forties, they were obliged to build a new life and career from scratch. This proved to be a struggle, despite the significant help and support they received from numerous benefactors. Two local female painters in St Mawes offered Reuss the use of their studio, and in October 1938, a first exhibition was held there, followed by another exhibition at Lanham's Gallery in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], Cornwall in December 1938. A third exhibition took place in August 1939 in [[Truro]], Cornwall. However, after England‘s declaration of war against Germany in September 1939, Reuss was briefly interned as an "[[enemy alien]]" in June 1940 at a detention centre in Shropshire, which greatly distressed him. Following his release in August 1940, Albert  and Rosa moved to [[Cheltenham]], where they remained for the next eight years. A fourth solo exhibition took place in 1940 in Cheltenham, followed by a fifth in 1944, Reuss having produced over 200 paintings in the corner of his small living room. He also obtained a job as an art teacher at ''Dean Close School,'' an independent school in Cheltenham, which helped him to become more financially self-reliant, and to supplement his income as an artist. In 1947, Albert and Rosa Reuss were finally granted British nationality.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=42–75}}

===1948–1975: The Mousehole years===
In 1948, the Reusses moved to [[Mousehole]], a fishing village in Cornwall, three miles beyond [[Penzance]].{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=76-186}} Here they established the ARRA Gallery. Two flats (one to rent out), together with a studio and gallery, had been built for them by painter Ruth Adams (1893–1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Artists of Northumbria|last=Hall|first=Marshall|date=2005-07-29|publisher=Sansom &amp; Co|isbn=9780953260997|edition=Revised |location=Bristol|language=en|id= {{ASIN|0953260992|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom they had first met in 1938 at Lanham's Gallery in St Ives. Ruth was an ardent admirer of Reuss and was determined to bring her friends back to Cornwall, but she died in an accident just four weeks after their arrival, having left ARRA to the Reusses in her will. This inevitably caused gossip, and the entire episode was a most inauspicious way for Albert and Rosa to begin their new life in the village. Whereas they had been well accepted in St Mawes and Cheltenham, here they were largely to remain outsiders, despite a number of important new friendships.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=76-87}} Much to his chagrin, Reuss's attempts to join the [[Penwith Society of Arts]] were unsuccessful, as is evident in correspondence with founding member [[Peter Lanyon]].  Nevertheless, now 60 years of age, Reuss continued to paint for the rest of his life, supported by the many friends and admirers he and Rosa had made over their first few years in England.

Whilst Albert painted, Rosa managed the ARRA Gallery together with their friend, Jeanne Day, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ithellcolquhoun.co.uk/streams_of_st_bride.htm|title=The Streams of St. Bride|website=www.ithellcolquhoun.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaboration with the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] of Great Britain, hosting local artists such as Mousehole-born [[Jack Pender]] (1918–1998) and [[Alexander Mackenzie (artist)|Alexander Mackenzie]] (1923 -2002) of the [[St Ives School]]. The gallery eventually closed in 1956. Between 1945 and 1956, Rosa also organised numerous solo exhibitions of her husband's work in municipal galleries throughout England, particularly in the North, where many galleries still hold his works.&lt;ref name="Halkes"/&gt;

From 1953, Reuss held regular one-man shows at the renowned O’Hana Gallery in London. Jacques O'Hana was an international art dealer specializing in the French [[Impressionists]]. He was a colourful, larger-than-life character, who became Reuss's friend and mentor for the next 20 years until O'Hana's death in 1974.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=111–126}}

Once ARRA closed, and there were no further exhibitions in the provinces, the couple started to experience considerable financial difficulties. They managed to obtain compensation for victims of political persecution and a small pension from the Austrian Government. They received additional financial support from Reuss's younger brother, Max Reiss, with whom Albert had a difficult relationship.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=134–149}}

Albert and Rosa's last few years were also plagued by ill-health, with repeated hospital stays for both of them. In January 1970, Rosa passed away. She had spent her entire life caring for and supporting her husband and ensuring that he remained in touch with the outside world.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=150–158}} Albert was inconsolable, but struggled on alone for a further five years, still painting. He became concerned about his artistic heritage, fearing that his paintings could be destroyed after his death.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=159–166}}

He entered into a lengthy correspondence with the Austrian Press Secretary and later Deputy Ambassador in London, Dr Ingo Mussi (1935–2012), who arranged, with Jacques O'Hana, for some of Reuss's works to be sent to international galleries in Vienna and Israel. Following O'Hana's death in 1974, almost 200 works, including paintings, sculptures and drawings, remained in the London gallery. Ingo Mussi arranged, with the permission of the dying artist, for these to be sent to Vienna to be curated by an organisation called ''Euro Art''.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=167–182}} In September 1975, ''Euro Art'' hosted an exhibition held on the premises of the Bawag Foundation, which had been established in 1974. Bawag was a bank which had close ties with the Social Democratic Party ([[SPÖ]]) and the Austrian Trade Union Federation ([[ÖGB]]). The bank actively sponsored the promotion of Austrian contemporary art and culture, and Albert Reuss's works were thus amongst the first to be exhibited by the Foundation, in full collaboration with the Socialist government of that time. The exhibition was called ''Bilder der Einsamkeit - Albert Reuss'' ''(Pictures of Loneliness - Albert Reuss)'', and was opened by the Education Minister Dr [[Fred Sinowatz]], who was later to become Austrian Chancellor from 1983 to 1986. In his dying moments, Albert Reuss was finally able to experience success and recognition in his home country. He died on 4 November 1975 at the age of 86 years after a brief stay at a care home in Truro.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=183–186}}

Reuss was a complex individual. A tall, slim, handsome man, he could often appear aloof, even arrogant. Despite his Viennese elegance, he sometimes behaved irrationally, for example he wrote a number of highly inappropriate letters to the very people who were trying to help him. Yet despite his eccentricities, and at times his unacceptable behaviour, he could also be most charming and had a remarkable capacity to draw people to him, even those he offended. He and Rosa were genuinely loved by a large number of people who were prepared to go to great lengths to help and support them.

During the early 1950s, when Reuss was exhibiting in galleries in the North of England, he occasionally gave talks in an attempt to explain his work. An article was published on 11 November 1951 (newspaper unknown) entitled ''Artist Comes to ‘Explain’'' where Reuss is quoted as having described three stages in the development of his art:

″Gateshead's Shipley Art Gallery ... includes pictures representing each of the three important stages through which Reuss's artistic life has passed from early pencil drawings, in which his striving after the essence of his subject was first observable, through the translation of this essence into oils, then to his later more uncompromising works.″

His earlier linear work of the 1920s was characterised by drawings which used a few brief pencil strokes to invoke recognisable images. This gave way to detailed and colourful oil paintings of landscapes, still lifes and figures, influenced by the expressionist Carinthian school of painting. This was a style he first developed during his period in Cannes, using a palette knife and “iridescent and opalescent colour”, for example ''The Carinthian Family'' ''(Die Kärntner Familie)'' (1932, private collection). This body of work was well received by the Viennese art critics of the 1930s,{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=93–110}} but following his exhibition in Vienna in 1975, his earlier work was described as "conventional", whilst he was thought to have "found himself" during his exile in England. Indeed, following his exile, there was an immediate change in Reuss's work into a style which could loosely be called [[Surrealism]]; his oil paintings now became simplified and muted with much cooler colours. Figures often looked sad or listless, or were portrayed with their backs turned. Compare for example ''Woman Reading with Mother-In-Law's Tongue'', a portrait of Rosa (1935, Newlyn Art Gallery) with ''Woman Reading'' (1942–1947, Newlyn Art Gallery). After moving to Mousehole in 1948, bleak landscapes started to appear,  with broken fences and walls, and trees stripped of foliage. The art critics of the 1950s commented in particular on the beauty and simplicity of these paintings, the economy of line, and the artist's considerable draughtsmanship.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=127–133}} Some also saw in Reuss's work a certain spiritual quality. In later years, Reuss's paintings became ever more desolate, and the figures started to disappear. Where figures were present, these looked abandoned, like flotsam on the beach. This is particularly evident in ''Figure and Tree Stump'' originally titled ''Self-Portrait in the Open'' (1967, Newlyn Art Gallery). Often random objects such as corrugated iron and boulders appeared in the landscape, and sometimes even penetrated into rooms, for example ''Interior II'' (1971/72, Newlyn Art Gallery).&lt;ref name="ArtUK"/&gt;

An apt description of Reuss's post-Vienna work appears on the Kunsthandel Widder Gallery's website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunsthandelwidder.com/en/|title=Kunsthandel Widder - Aktuelles|website=www.kunsthandelwidder.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}Viennese gallery specialising in exile art&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Reuss’s artistic output is very much informed by his biography. Objects, floating relinquished through space and having lost any foothold, predominate his imagery… Ripped out of their natural context, those objects tell the story of a voyage, of a kind of abandonment of an object that does not fit in its new environment. In Reuss's artwork, style and choice of subject-matter invoke an association with Surrealism. Dali and Chirico are but the two most important artists [who] bring to mind Reuss's artwork. Reuss's depiction of people has a similarly estranged air about them as those of his objects. Taken out of context, of time, of place, the pictured people appear oddly strange. Melancholic and lonely, but also calm and gentle, Reuss's creations remind the viewer of the art of Josef Floch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albertreuss.at/en/|title=Albert Reuss – Home|website=www.albertreuss.at|access-date=2018-03-22}} Analysis of Reuss's work&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There can be no doubt that these works were an expression of Reuss's mental state, of the extreme melancholy and despair that he had suffered throughout his life, but most especially the trauma he had experienced as a consequence of his exile, culminating in the ''Pictures of Loneliness'' of his final years.

==Estate==
During the last few months of Reuss's life, Dr Mussi urged the ailing artist to appoint an heir, and to make it clear to whom he wished to leave his life's work. He suggested the possibility of leaving it to a public collection in Austria. Frail and confused, Reuss did not understand what was needed, and probably thought that by sending the bulk of his works to Vienna, he was doing just that. Consequently, there was no specific clause in his will naming an heir for his artistic works, though he was clear concerning his other assets, having written his will some years earlier with Rosa. All his artwork therefore went to the named residuary beneficiary, Miss Norette Reed, who had been a friend of Albert and Rosa for many years, and was an ardent admirer of Reuss's work. Norette was not expecting this gift, and in fact had donated her own collection of 31 Reuss paintings to the Newlyn Orion Gallery (now [[Newlyn Art Gallery]]) in June 1975, a few weeks before Reuss's death, specifying that this was to be kept as a permanent collection and not for sale. This became known as the ''Norette Collection''. She now inherited those paintings still remaining at ARRA, Reuss's studio and home in Mousehole, as well as those which had been transferred to Vienna. She was happy for the works in Vienna to remain there, as this had clearly been Reuss's wish, but resolved in June 1977 that she would also donate to the Newlyn Orion all the unsold works which she had inherited, both those in Vienna as well as those which had remained in England. However, in January 1979, Reuss's works still in Vienna were unexpectedly returned to Cornwall. John Halkes, the director at that time of the Newlyn Orion, was delighted with these new acquisitions, some of which were from Reuss's Vienna period.&lt;ref name="Halkes"/&gt; In an interview with Susan Soyinka, Reuss's biographer, in October 2016, he said: "I thought the sensible thing to do was to cream off some of the better ones and add them to the ''Norette Collection'' ... Meanwhile … we didn’t have storage ... so (the remainder) were steadily exhibited and sold over the years." The remaining works, available for sale, now became known as the Vienna Collection, which in later years was retitled the ''Reuss Collection''.{{sfn|Soyinka|2017|p=187–196}}

John Halkes was keen to honour Norette Reed's expressed wishes to raise Reuss's artistic profile and to ensure that a biography would be written. True to his word, he mounted several exhibitions during the 1970s and 1980s, not only at the Newlyn Orion but also at galleries in Plymouth and Bristol. In 1984, Halkes gave Reuss's written estate to a young German art student, Lioba Reddeker (1961–2011), who intended to write a biography, but was unable to complete this. Following her death, the entire documentation, including Lioba's research papers, was passed to ″basis wien″, a database of Austrian artists which she had founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-08|title=Lioba Reddeker|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lioba_Reddeker&amp;oldid=146808014|journal=Wikipedia|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Red Bulletin - July 2010 PP. 46–48|url=https://issuu.com/redbulletin.com/docs/0710_redbulletin_uk/48|journal=Wikipedia|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norette Reed died on 10 June 1991 and bequeathed one third of her residual estate to the Newlyn Orion. When John Halkes left the gallery in 1990, Reuss's works were put into storage and, apart from a further exhibition in 1992, were rarely seen for almost three decades.

==The future of exile art==
In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the “lost generation” of emigrated artists, including Reuss, in Austria and Germany, and indeed there are a number of galleries in Vienna and Berlin which specialize in exiled artists. Reuss's work featured in two hugely successful exhibitions called ''Die Uns Verliessen'' ''(The Ones Who Left Us)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.de/Die-uns-verliessen-Emigration-Wechselausstellung/dp/B00GB8S7TG/|title=Die uns verliessen : österr.

More recently, his works have featured in the [[Leopold Museum]] in the 2007 exhibition ''Zwischen den Kriegen. Österreichische Künstler 1918–1938 (Between the wars: Austrian artists 1918-1938''), in 2015 as part of ''The Bigger Picture'' at the [[Penlee House]] Gallery and Museum in Penzance, and in 2016 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel. His work is also represented in Thomas B Schumann's large collection of exile art in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition-memoria.de/|title=Edition Memoria {{!}} - der einzige in Deutschland ausschließlich Exilautoren publizierende Verlag|website=edition-memoria.de|language=de|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Herr Schumann used one of Reuss's paintings, ''The Art Critic'', on the cover of a book published in 2016, ''Deutsche Künstler im Exil 1933 bis 1945'', ''(German Artists in Exile 1933 to 1945)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deutsche Künstler im Exil 1933-1945: Werke aus der Sammlung Memoria Thomas B.

Monica Bohm Duchen, the organiser of the 1986 ''Art in Exile'' exhibition, is in the process of organising a major national event called '''Insiders/Outsiders''', an exciting nationwide arts festival planned for 2019 to celebrate the extraordinary contribution of refugees from Nazi Europe to British culture. There are plans to exhibit some of Reuss's work at a few galleries in Cornwall as part of this project.

[[Image:An Intelligent Persons Guide to Atheism.jpg|thumb]]
'''''An Intelligent Person's Guide to Atheism''''' is the first book by Daniel Harbour, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] maths and philosophy graduate, who at the time of writing was working for a PhD in linguistics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].

== Synopsis ==

Rather than a history of [[atheism]], as the title may suggest, the book is a guide to why (according to the author) atheism is superior to theism and why the (a)theist discussion is important. 

According to Harbour, atheism is "the plausible and probably correct belief that God does not exist", while [[theism]] is "the implausible and probably incorrect belief that God does exist", and anyone who cares about the truth should be an [[atheist]]. Harbour makes his case on the basis of two fundamental [[worldview]]s which he labels the '''Spartan Meritocracy''' and the '''Baroque Monarchy'''. Worldviews are the ways in which we look at and try to explain the world around us; as a result, the validity of our worldviews is extremely important because it determines the validity and reasonableness of our beliefs. 

The Spartan Meritocracy makes minimal assumptions, that are subject to criticism and possible revision, when trying to explain the world - focusing more upon a proper method of inquiry than on reaching any particular or prejudicial conclusions. The Baroque Monarchy, however, relies upon elaborate dogmatic assumptions in the absence of any evidence — assumptions which are placed beyond question, critique or revision. 

Harbour spends little time directly comparing atheism and theism; rather, he compares these two opposing worldviews and argues that the Spartan Meritocracy is more plausible, more reasonable, and helps make the world a better place to live. Thus, anyone who cares about the [[truth]] should be inclined to adopt it rather than blind obedience to dogmatism as in the Baroque Monarchy.

He does not, however, argue that there is a direct and necessary connection between these worldviews and either atheism or theism — he acknowledges that it is possible in theory for an atheist to adopt the Baroque Monarchy and for some types of theist to adopt the Spartan Meritocracy. Strictly speaking, then, the main thrust of his argument is that the Spartan Meritocracy is superior and anyone who cares about the truth should adopt this worldview. Nevertheless, he also argues that it is highly unlikely for theism ever to occur within the Spartan Meritocracy due to the evidence the world presents, and that, consequently, anyone who adopts the Spartan Meritocracy will almost inevitably be an atheist. Harbour constructs an argument throughout the book to demonstrate that the Spartan Meritocracy leads logically and naturally to atheism rather than theism.

Much of Daniel Harbour's book is focused on demonstrating the ways in which the Spartan Meritocracy does a better job of helping us to explain the world and make the world a better place to live in. The former involves analyzing the impact of science and technology, pursuits fundamentally based upon a [[wikt:spartan|spartan]] and [[wikt:meritocracy|meritocratic]] perspective of nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It would be one thing to abandon the paradigm of rational enquiry if it were merely a proposal on paper. However, centuries of effort have made it much more: it is the most successful attempt to understand the world that the world has ever seen. By dint of breadth, the paradigm stands out. Through the sum total of its theories, it covers more facts, explains more phenomena, and unmasks the mechanisms of more one-time mysteries than any alternative."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was the second of five children, his siblings being named Luis, Digna, Amparito (who died in infancy), and Amparo. Entering the [[Claretians|Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in 1899, Larraona Saralegui received his [[Religious habit|habit]] on 28 July 1902, and [[Profession (religious)|professed]] his final [[Religious vows|vows]] on 8 December 1903. After attending the [[University of Lleida]], he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood by [[Archdiocese of Zaragoza|Archbishop Juan Soldevilla y Romero]] on 10 June 1911. Larraona Saralegui left for Rome on the following 24 October to study at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare|Pontifical Roman Athenaeum ''S.

Before naming him as [[Apostolic Penitentiary|Major Penitentiary]] on 13 August 1961, [[Pope John XXIII]] created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''[[San Carlo ai Catinari|Ss. Biagio e Carlo ai Catinari]]'' in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 14 December 1959. He thus became the first Claretian member of the [[College of Cardinals]]; he required the permission of his order to change his brown habit for scarlet robes, provided they were made of [[wool]].&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825989-2,00.html Eight New Hats] 30 November 1959&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 1962, Cardinal Larraona Saralegui was advanced to [[Prefect]] of the [[Congregation of Rites|Sacred Congregation of Rites]] and, in preparation of the [[Second Vatican Council]], President of the Pontifical Commission of the Sacred Liturgy.

He resigned as Titular Archbishop, on 20 April of that same year. Attending all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, he served as a [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal elector]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]] that selected [[Pope Paul VI]].

==Ideology==
Artgemeinschaft mixes far-right ideology with [[Norsemen|Nordic]] and [[Teutons|Teutonic]] religions such as [[Ásatrú]], but also elements of [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Article by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in North Rhine-Westphalia (German)"&gt;[http://www.im.nrw.de/sch/738.htm Article by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in North Rhine-Westphalia (German)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719175400/http://www.im.nrw.de/sch/738.htm |date=July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and so called [[Ariosophy|ariosophic]] aspects were added.

The ''[[weltanschauung]]'' of the party is [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="Article by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in North Rhine-Westphalia (German)"/&gt; A belief of the party is ''Artgemeinschaft'' (loosely translated as "racial community"), a basic tenets of which is the ''Artglaube'' ("racial belief").

In contrast to other pagan organisations, neither [[Guido von List]] nor [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] plays any role.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Fromm: ''Brennpunkt Esoterik'' published by the [[Hamburg]] ''Office for inner affairs'' {{cite web|url=http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/102176/data/brennpunkt-esoterik.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509193938/http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/102176/data/brennpunkt-esoterik.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important in their beliefs are theses by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Eduard von Hartmann|Eduard v. Hartmann]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] in order to attack Christian moral and to replace it with a pagan one. According to Fromm, belief in Gods is not an important momentum for the Artgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Fromm: ''Brennpunkt Esoterik'' published by the [[Hamburg]] ''Office for inner affairs'' {{cite web|url=http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/102176/data/brennpunkt-esoterik.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509193938/http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/102176/data/brennpunkt-esoterik.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-09 |df= }}, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and media==
Membership is regulated according to racial criteria; only "northern born" people may become members. The members belong to different currents of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]], from militant [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascists]] to representatives of the [[Neue Rechte]] (New Right).&lt;ref name=parlament45&gt;Annette Rollmann: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919143640/http://www.bundestag.de/dasparlament/2005/45/Thema/038.html |date=September 19, 2008 |title=''FAP, Freie Kameradschaft, Artgemeinschaft.'' }} In: ''Das Parlament.''

The '''Bandhmati''' are a Hindu [[caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India.  They are also known as Banbasi.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 160 to 163 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The Bandhmati are a caste that are traditionally involved in the manufacture of ropes. According to some traditions, they are a community of [[Banjara]]s that took to the manufacture of ropes as such became an endogamous sub-group. The Bandhmati are found mainly in [[Saharanpur District]], and are mostly [[Hindu]], with the exception of a small group of [[Muslim Bandhmati]].  Their main tribal deity is Balmiki. The Bandhmati speak the [[Khari boli]] dialect of [[Hindi]], although most of the community both speak and understand standard [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 160 to 163 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Bandhmati practice strict community endogamy, as well as clan exogamy, which a common practice among most [[North India]]n [[Hindu]]s. They live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters.  Each of their settlement contains an informal [[caste]] council, known as a [[panchayat]], sometimes also called a sabha or association. The panchayat is headed by a chaudhary, a position which is elective. As an institution, the main function of the panchayat is to resolve any intra-community dispute, as well as acting an instrument of social control.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 160 to 163 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The Banndhmati are still involved in their traditional occupation, which is the manufacture of ropes. These are then sold at the local market. The raw material for the manufacture of the ropes is obtained from government owned forest, for which the community require licences. A significant number of Bandhmati are agricultural labourers, while other often migrating to [[Mumbai]]  and [[Delhi]] to work as daily wage labourers. Like other [[scheduled caste]] communities, they live an extremely marginal economic existence. A small number of Bandhmati have also become poultry farmers, selling their produce in the towns nearest to their settlements.

'''Champat Rai Jain''' (1867-1942) was an influential [[Jainism|Jain]] writer and [[comparative religion]] scholar of the 20th century who contrasted [[Jainism]] and  [[Christianity in India|Christianity]]. He visited various European countries to give lectures on Jainism. He was conferred with the title ''Vidya-Varidhi'' (lit. Ocean of Wisdom) by [[Bharata Dharma Mahamandal]] (The India-Religious Association).

== Life ==
Champat Rai Jain was born on 6 August 1867 in [[Delhi]], India.{{sfn|Kumar|1996|p=98}} He was married at the age of 13.{{sfn|Kumar|1996|p=98}} In 1892, he went to England to study law.{{sfn|Kumar|1996|p=205}} He was the founder of the Jaina mission in London.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=33}} He died on 2 June 1942. He was a barrister-at-law, orator, writer, and attempted to explain Jainism with modern age [[psychology]] and science terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkjQAAAAMAAJ|p=8|title=Indian Book Industry|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Vijay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farhadian|first1=Charles E.|title=Introducing World Religions: A Christian Engagement|date=2015|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=9781441246509|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VV-BAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Padmanabh Jaini, the colonial era Champat Rai Jain was an [[Apologetics|apologist]] of Jainism, defended the Jain doctrines that were criticized by Christian missionaries, and authored the first Jaina text aimed at the Christian world when Christian missionaries expressed frustration at Jain people with no pagan creator gods refusing to convert to Christianity.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=33}}

== Lectures ==
Champat Rai Jain attempted to present Jainism as a scientific religion, a knowledge that he claimed had neither dogmatism nor mysticism.
{{Quote|
Jainism is a science, and not a code of arbitrary rules and capricious commandments. It does not claim to derive its authority from any non-human source, but is, science-like, founded on the knowledge of those Great Ones who have attained perfection with its aid. Scientific validity can be claimed neither by dogmatism nor mysticism; and it is unnecessary to add that nothing but science and scientific thought can be relied upon to produce immediate, certain and unvarying results.

==Key of Knowledge==
[[File:KeyofKnowledge.jpg|thumb|Book cover of "The Key of Knowledge"]]
"Key of Knowledge", a book authored by Champat Rai Jain, was published in 1915. It was widely acclaimed among the scholars.{{sfn|Jain|1921}}

The Pioneer (on March 12, 1916) wrote: "Mr. Rai's book is singularly lucid and readable and not a word in it could give umbrage to the most sensitive votaries of the creeds discussed."

"The author's learning and breadth of outlook entitle him to patient hearing......"- The East and West—March (1916)

Vijay K. Jain, a modern Jainism scholar in the Preface of his book ''From IIM-Ahmedabad To Happines'' wrote:&lt;ref name= Vijay&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHUdNxsUeGMC|title=From IIM-Ahmedabad to Happiness|isbn=9788190363907|last1=Jain|first1=Vijay K|year=2006|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Many illuminated works and teachings of great thinkers and sages of the past have repeatedly told us that we need to be able to distinguish between valuable gems and valueless stones, both of which are scattered along our way. One such valuable gem that I could lay my hands on, about a decade ago, was that amazingly comprehensive yet precise treatise The Key of Knowledge, by Champat Rai Jain. The book, first published in 1915, true to its title, has timeless pearls of wisdom in each of its 900-plus pages; one has only to have patience, and develop appreciation and understanding to pick them up. No other work that I know of treats of the great issues that confront humanity with the same simplicity, charm, ease, authority and freedom. As could be expected from a Barrister-at-Law of that era, he was a brilliant grammarian and logician; but more than that, he was a great philosopher.}}

Court was born at [[Saint-Cézaire-sur-Siagne]], [[France]], on 24 September 1793.&lt;ref name="allaboutsikhs1"&gt;[http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/british/court-claude-auguste.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609141040/http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/british/court-claude-auguste.html |date=June 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIIQhuAOGaIC&amp;pg=PA339 |title=The state at war in South Asia - Pradeep Barua - Google Books |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career in French army==
In 1813, he joined the French army. After [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in the [[battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815 he was dismissed from service. He left France in 1818 for [[Baghdad]] and joined the Persian forces which were trained at [[Kermanshah]] by a handful of ex-officers of [[Napoleon]]'s army including [[Jean-Baptiste Ventura]]. While in Persia, he met [[Paolo Avitabile]], another Neapolitan adventurer, and together they travelled on to [[Lahore]] reaching there in early 1827.&lt;ref name="allaboutsikhs1"/&gt;

==Military services with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab==

Maharaja Ranjit Singh gave Court employment in the artillery befitting his talents and scientific attainments. Court was responsible for the training of artillerymen, the organization of batteries and the establishment of arsenals and magazines on European lines. The Maharaja had his own foundries for casting guns and for the manufacture of shells. Court supervised these in collaboration with Sardar Lahina Singh Majithia.

When Court produced the first shell at the Lahore foundry, the Maharaja bestowed upon him a prize of Rs 30,000, and when he produced the fuse, he was rewarded with an award of Rs 5,000. Court received a salary of Rs 2,500 per month, besides a [[jagir]].

==Expedition and battles==
He took part in the expedition of Peshawar (1834) and the [[battle of Jamrud]] (1837).
He was promoted to general in 1836.

==Role during struggle for succession of Ranjit Singh==

Claude Auguste Court continued to serve the State after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.
After the death of Kanvar Nau Nihal Singh on 5 November 1840, Court along with Ventura sided with [[Sher Singh]] who was installed as Maharaja, with their help in investing the Fort of Lahore, on 20 January 1841.

==Later life and death==

After Maharaja Sher Singh's assassination in September 1843, he fled to Firozpur, in British territory, and, ultimately securing his discharge from the Sikh army, proceeded with his Punjabi wife and the children to France in 1844. He purchased an estate in the countryside and a residence in the city of Paris where he lived until his death in 1880. A very useful overview of Court's life in India is found in Jean-Marie Lafont's book ''Indika: Essays in Indo-French Relations, 1630-1976 ''[New Delhi, 2000]. Lafont presents an enormous amount of new information of the 'French Generals" serving in Lahore in the 1820s-30s as well as the intellectual interest France showed in all things Indian in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/european-adventurers-scholars-and-officials/court-claude-auguste.html?directory=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614091240/http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/european-adventurers-scholars-and-officials/court-claude-auguste.html?directory=1 |date=June 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest in coin collection==

Court was one of the first Europeans to become interested in the coins of South Asia, which he collected from 1829. Part of the collection was described in ''Revue Numismatique'' in 1839 and Court talks of his coin collection in his valuable ''Memoires'' published in Paris in 1856-57. Court died in Paris in January 1880 leaving his heirs his rich coin collection. We know almost nothing of its fate since then until three albums came to light in an English book sale. They contained 627 coin rubbings, allowing many of Court's coins to be identified. These had been bought by a coin collector, Alexander Cunningham, whose collection was acquired by the British Museum in 1888–94. Cunningham may also have owned the albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/g/general_claude-auguste_courts.aspx |title=General Claude-Auguste Court's book of coin rubbings |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confessionalism''', in a [[religion|religious]] (and particularly [[Christianity|Christian]]) sense, is a belief in the importance of full and unambiguous assent to the whole of a religious teaching. Confessionalists believe that differing interpretations or understandings, especially those in direct opposition to a held teaching, cannot be accommodated within a church communion.

Confessionalism can become a matter of practical relevance in fields such as Christian education and Christian politics. For example, there is a question over whether Christian schools should attempt to enforce a specific religious [[doctrine]], or whether they should simply teach general "Christian values". Similarly, some Christian political parties have been split over whether non-Christians should be allowed to participate — confessionalists, arguing against it, stress the importance of religious doctrine, while non-confessionalists say that shared values are more important than adherence to exact beliefs.

==History==
Historically, the term confessionalism for the first time was used in mid-19th century. Of course the phenomenon of confessionalism and the term “confession”, from which the term confessionalism derived, is much older, referring to once individual belief, then collective belief. Furthermore, the term confession in different languages implies different notions (faith, denomination, croyance, culte, communauté religieuse).

In the 16th and 17th centuries the term confession was only used for the documents of belief (cf. Confessio Augustana) while the religious communities of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Lutheran]]s, and [[Calvinist]]s were referred to as “religious parties”, different “religions” or “churches” - not as confessions. In the late 18th century the term confession started to expand to religious bodies sharing a common creed. The first evidence is the Wöllner and Prussian Religious Edict of 1788 (though there might be earlier proofs for the English-speaking world). The international Congress of Vienna in 1815 still didn’t use the term confession to mark different Christian denominations. Labelling Christian groups “confessions” implied a certain degree of civil progress and tolerance, accepting that no party could claim absolute truth. The original intention to pacify conflicts between the denominations in the 19th century turned into its opposite: Confession bore the ground for new conflicts, as for example in the Cologne conflict about mixed marriages in 1837. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] refused to consider itself as merely a confession.

However ahistorical the terminology (cf. the latest semantical research of L. Hölscher), historians talk about the Early Modern period as a “confessional age” (first evidence: Ernst Troeltsch, 1906) and with good reasons use the terms of [[confessionalization]] and confessionalism.

In the third half or the 19th century the term confessionalism occurred in dictionaries. It referred to internal Protestant conflicts (orthodoxy v. “living” Protestantism), to conflicts between different confessional groups, to everyday resentments and to any exaggerated emphasis of religious identity against competing identities. The Catholic Staatslexikon in 1959 defines Confessionalism as the “endeavour of the confessions to defend their religious doctrine” and their identity, in opposition to indifferentism, but it also meant the “overemphasize of confessional differences, esp. transferring them into the realm of state and society”. In later editions of dictionaries there is no lemma any more since the phenomenon lost its wider impact. Confessionalism exerted a severe impact on European social and political History between 1530 and 1648 and again between 1830 and the 1960s.

Nowadays confessionalism is of minor relevance in European [[State religion|state churches]]. It rose to importance in the early 19th century and vanished in the 1960s. This is why some scholars talk about this time-period as a "second confessional age", comparing the dimensions of confessionalism with the "first confessional age" (16th to 17th centuries). However, various European free churches still consider confessions important, for example, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church (Germany)|Evangelical Lutheran Free Church]] and the [[Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church]] both require clergy and congregations to declare a quia subscription to the [[Book of Concord]].

In [[Lebanon]], the concept of confessionalism holds an important political meaning, since political power and governmental bureaucracy are organized according to religious confessions (as it happened in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries before). For example, the [[National Pact]] (an unwritten covenant) and later the [[Taif Agreement]] provide for a [[Maronite]] Christian president, a [[Sunni]] Muslim prime minister, and a [[Shia]] Muslim speaker of parliament.

==Controversy==
The idea of confessionalism can generate considerable controversy. Some Christian denominations, particularly newer ones, focus more on the "experience" of Christianity than on its formal doctrines, and are accused by confessionalists of adopting a vague and unfocused form of religion. Anti-confessionalists, declaring that the confessionalist view of religion is too narrow and that people should be able to seek religion in their own way, generally argue that it is the spirit and values of religion that matter, rather than the particular rules. Confessionalists generally counter that the "spirit and values" of any given faith cannot be attained without first knowing [[truth]] as given in formal [[dogma]]s.

A World of Atheism: Global Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the global atheist and non-religious population, 76%  reside in Asia and the Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North America (5%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2%) and the Middle East and North Africa (less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Religiously Unaffiliated|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of atheism in [[Africa]] and [[South America]] typically falls below 10%.&lt;ref name="GallupInt"/&gt; According to the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of the world's population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Pew Global"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape |author1=Pew Forum on Religion |author2=Public Life |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the global study noted that many of the unaffiliated, which include atheists and agnostics, still have various religious beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name="Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012" /&gt;

Historical records of atheist philosophy span several millennia. Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the [[historical Vedic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pandian| title = India, that is, sidd| publisher = Allied Publishers| year = 1996| page = 64| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B90uj14NHjMC&amp;pg=PA64| isbn = 978-81-7023-561-3| accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western atheism has its roots in [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy]], but did not emerge as a distinct world-view until the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Baggini2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baggini|first=Julian|title=Atheism: A Brief Insight|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2009|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4027-6882-8|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrepancies exist among sources as to how atheist and religious demographics are changing. Questions to assess non-belief may ask about negation of the prevailing belief, rather than an assertion of [[Negative and positive atheism|positive atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/more-millennials-losing-their-religion_n_1571366.html |title=Millennials Losing Faith In God: Survey |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2014-02-27}} reporting on a Pew study:{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/04/section-6-religion-and-social-values/ |title=Section 6: Religion and Social Values &amp;#124; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press |publisher=People-press.org |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, self-identification is not congruous to people's lack of beliefs automatically. For instance, merely not having a belief in a god, for whatever reason, does not automatically mean that people self-identify as an "atheist".&lt;ref name="Pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Not-All-Nonbelievers-Call-Themselves-Atheists.aspx |title=Not All Nonbelievers Call Themselves Atheists &amp;#124; Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2012 WIN/Gallup International Survey, the number of atheists is on the rise across the world, with religiosity generally declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rieke Havertz |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2012/0815/Atheism-on-the-rise-around-the-globe |title=Atheism on the rise around the globe |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other global studies have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.&lt;ref name="CambridgeZuckerman" /&gt;

==Studies and statistics==

=== Methodological issues ===
The demographics of atheism are substantially difficult to quantify. Words like, "God" or "[[atheism]]" seldom translate well across cultures or languages, and if they are there, they have variant meanings which make cross cultural comparisons tenuous.&lt;ref name="CambridgeZuckerman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galen Understanding Secular" /&gt; As such, it can be hard to draw boundaries between atheism, [[irreligion|non-religious]] beliefs, and [[nontheism|non-theistic]] religious and spiritual beliefs. Furthermore, atheists may not report themselves as such, to prevent suffering from [[social stigma]], [[Discrimination against atheists|discrimination]], and [[persecution#Atheists|persecution]] in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Humanist and Ethical Union |url=http://www.iheu.org/node/1540 |title=The Fate of Infidels and Apostates under Islam |publisher=Iheu.org |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927070417/http://www.iheu.org/node/1540 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some governments have strongly [[State atheism|promoted atheism]] and others have strongly [[Anti-atheism|condemned it]], atheism may be either over-reported or under-reported for different countries. There is a great deal of room for debate as to the accuracy of any method of estimation, as the opportunity for misreporting (intentionally or not) a category of people without an organizational structure is high.  Also, many surveys on religious identification ask people to identify themselves as "[[Agnosticism|agnostics]]" or "atheists", which is potentially confusing, since these terms are interpreted differently, with some identifying themselves as being [[agnostic atheists]]. Additionally, many of these surveys only gauge the number of [[irreligion|irreligious]] people, not the number of actual atheists, or group the two together. For example, research indicates that [[claims to be the fastest growing religion|the fastest growing religious status]] may be "no religion" in the United States, but this includes all kinds of atheists, agnostics, and theists.&lt;ref name="aris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=19 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429150122/http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|archivedate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Unaffiliated/nones-on-the-rise.aspx|title=No Religion on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation|date=9 October 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Factbook, Non-religious people make up 9.66%, while one fifth of them are atheists.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html|title=The World Fact Book: Religions|publisher=World Fact Book|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversity ===
Statistics on atheism are often difficult to represent accurately for a variety of reasons. Atheism is a position compatible with other forms of identity including religions.&lt;ref name="Eller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.1: Issues, Concepts, Definitions|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313351839|editor=Phil Zuckerman|chapter=1. What Is Atheism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Jack David Eller, states that "atheism is quite a common position, even within religion" and that "surprisingly, atheism is not the opposite or lack, let alone the enemy, of religion but is the most common form of religion."&lt;ref name="Eller" /&gt; Furthermore, he observes that "some atheists call themselves "spiritual", and as we have shown above, atheism in its broadest sense does not preclude other religious concepts like nature spirits, dead ancestors, and supernatural forces."&lt;ref name="Eller" /&gt; In many cultures, little conceptual or practical distinction is made between “natural” and “supernatural” phenomena and the very notions of "religious" and "nonreligious" dissolve into unimportance, especially since people have beliefs in other supernatural or spiritual things irrespective of belief in gods.&lt;ref name="Galen Understanding Secular"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pasquale|first1=Frank|last2=Galen|first2=Luke|last3=Zuckerman|first3=Phil|title=The Nonreligious: Understanding Secular People and Societies|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199924945|chapter=1. The Study of Secularity and the Nonreligious &amp; 2. Secularity around the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Netherlands people who lack of beliefs in gods do have a variety of beliefs in other supernatural entities or things.&lt;ref name="Halman" /&gt; 

Globally, some atheists also consider themselves [[Agnosticism|Agnostic]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Atheism in Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Jainism|Jains]],  [[Taoism|Taoist]], or hold other related philosophical beliefs. Some, like [[Secular Jews]] and [[Shinto]]ists, may indulge in some religious activities as a way of connecting with their culture, all the while being atheist. Therefore, given limited poll options, some may use other terms to describe their identity. Some politically motivated organizations that report or gather population statistics may, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresent atheists. Survey designs may bias results due to the nature of elements such as the wording of questions and the available response options. Statistics are generally collected on the assumption that religion is a categorical variable. Instruments have been designed to measure attitudes toward religion, including one that was used by [[L. L. Thurstone]]. This may be a particularly important consideration among people who have neutral attitudes, as it is more likely that prevailing social norms will influence the responses of such people on survey questions that effectively force respondents to categorize themselves either as belonging to a particular religion or belonging to no religion. A negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism. Misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently.

For example, a Canadian poll released September 12, 2011 sampled 1,129 Canadian adults and collected data on the numbers of declared atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/36135/?place=canada |title=Canadians divided on whether religion does more harm than good: poll - WorldWide Religious News |publisher=Wwrn.org |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These numbers conflicted with the latest Canadian census data that pre-supposed that a religious affiliation predisposed a belief in a deity and was based on a poorly worded question. A quote from the study:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The data also revealed some interesting facts about Canadians' beliefs:
* A majority (53%) of [[Canadians]] believe in God. What is of particular interest is that 28% of Protestants, 33% of Catholics, and 23% of those who attend weekly religious services do not.
* One quarter (23%) of those with no religious identity still believe in a God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadians divided on whether religion does more harm than good: poll|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/153789/canadians-divided-on-whether-religion-does-more-harm-than-good-poll/|publisher=Shaw Media Inc.|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even when people directly claim to not believe in a deity, they still do not self-identify as “atheist.” For instance, 41% of Norwegians, 48% of the French, and 54% of Czechs claimed to not believe in a deity, but only 10%, 19%, and 20% of those respondents self-identified as “atheist,” respectively.&lt;ref name="CambridgeZuckerman" /&gt; In the United States, only 5% of the population did not have a belief in a god and out of that small group only 24% self-identified as "atheist", while 15% self-identified as "agnostic" and 35% self-identified as "nothing in particular".&lt;ref name="Pewforum.org"/&gt;

In the Netherlands, beliefs of "convinced atheists" are quite diverse: 41.1% of them believe in telepathy, 21.1% believe in reincarnation, 13.3% believe in life after death, and 1.6% believe in heaven. The percentages on telepathy and reincarnation were similar to the percentages of "religious people" in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the author of the study notes, "Thus, despite the fact that they claim to be convinced atheists and the majority deny the existence of a personal god, a rather large minority of the Dutch convinced atheists believe in a supernatural power!"&lt;ref name="Halman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.2: Gloabal Expressions|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313351839|editor=Phil Zuckerman|chapter=8.

=== Personality profiles and social trends ===
[[File:Michael newdow 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Newdow]] speaks at the Atheist Alliance International Convention. Members of secular groups are very likely to be atheists, but also more willing to hold unpopular views and explore new ideas thoroughly.]]

A study on global religiosity, secularity, and well-being notes that it is unlikely that most atheists and agnostics base their decision to not believe in the gods on a careful, rational analysis of philosophical and scientific arguments since science testing scores in societies where atheism or theism is widespread, are just as poor and such societies have widespread supernatural beliefs besides gods.&lt;ref name="Paul Zuck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Gregory|editor1-last=Zuckerman|editor1-first=Phil|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol. 1: Issues, Concepts, and Definitions|date=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0313351813|chapter=6. The Evolution of Popular Religiosity and Secularism|pages=171-172|quote=Nor is it likely that most atheists and agnostics base their decision to not believe in the gods on a careful, rational analysis of the pertinent philosophical and scientific arguments. As noted earlier Europeans score about as poorly on tests of scientific knowledge as do the more religious American population. The common perplexment of rationalists that so many people are superstitious is psychosociologically naive, most people do not care all that much about scientific rationalism, which explains why three quarters of Americans and many other Westerners believe in something paranormal aside from gods (Sjodin 2002, Gallup 2005a).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing psychological studies on atheists, Miguel Farias, noted that studies concluding that analytical thinking leads to lower religious belief "do not imply that that atheists are more conscious or reflective of their own beliefs, or that atheism is the outcome of a conscious refutation of previously held religious beliefs" since they too have variant beliefs such as in conspiracy theories of the naturalistic variety.&lt;ref name=Farias&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farias|first1=Miguel|editor1-last=Bullivant|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Ruse|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

A study on personality and religiosity found that members of secular organizations (like the international [[Center for Inquiry]]) have similar personality profiles to members of religious groups. This study found that members of secular organizations are very likely to label themselves primarily as "atheists", but also very likely to consider themselves [[humanists]].&lt;ref name=CFIGalen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/centerstage/episodes/episode_104_-_profiles_of_the_godless_results_from_the_non-religious_identi/ |title=Center Stage Podcast, Episode 104 - Profiles of the Godless: Results from the Non-Religious Identification Survey, Luke Galen |publisher=Centerforinquiry.net |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that secular group members show no significant differences in their negative or positive affect. The surveyed individuals also had similar profiles for [[conscientiousness]] (discipline or impulse control, and acting on values like "pursuit of truth"). Secular group members tended to be less [[agreeableness|agreeable]] (e.g. more likely to hold unpopular, socially challenging views), as well as more [[openness to experience|open minded]] (e.g. more likely to consider new ideas) than members of religious groups. Luke Galen, a personality researcher, writes "Many previously reported characteristics associated with religiosity are a function not of belief itself, but of strong convictions and group identification."&lt;ref name=CFIGalen/&gt;&lt;ref name= GalenPersonality&gt;Galen, L.W., &amp; Kloet, J.

According to [[William Sims Bainbridge|William Bainbridge]]'s international study, atheism is common among people whose interpersonal social obligations are weak and is also connected to lower fertility rates in advanced industrial nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bainbridge|first=William|title=Atheism|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion|year=2005|volume=1|issue=Article 2|pages=1–26|url=http://www.religjournal.com/pdf/ijrr01002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a global study on atheism, sociologist Phil Zuckerman noted that countries with higher levels of atheism also had the highest suicide rates compared to countries with lower levels of atheism. He concludes that [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlations does not necessarily indicate causation]] in either case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

== Geographic distribution ==
Though atheists are in the minority in most countries, they are relatively common in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[East Asia]] and present communist states. It is difficult to determine actual atheist numbers. Furthermore, the conflation of terms such as atheist, agnostic, non-religious and non-theist add to confusion among poll data.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''''Echinopsis peruviana''''' (syn. '''''Trichocereus peruvianus'''''), the '''Peruvian torch cactus''', is a fast-growing columnar [[cactus]] native to the western slope of the [[Andes]] in [[Peru]], between about {{convert|2000|-|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. It contains the psychoactive alkaloid [[mescaline]] as well as other alkaloids, although reported levels vary considerably and do not approach the concentrations found in ''[[Echinopsis pachanoi]]''.

==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The plant is bluish-green in color, with frosted stems, and 6-9 broadly rounded ribs; it has large, white flowers. It can grow up to {{convert|3|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with stems up to {{convert|8|-|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter; it is fully erect to begin with, but later possibly arching over, or even becoming prostrate. Groups of 6-8 honey-colored to brown rigid spines, up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, with most about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}}, are located at the nodes, which are evenly spaced along the ribs, up to approximately {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} apart.

==Taxonomy==

===Subspecies===
''Echinopsis peruviana'' ssp. ''puquiensis'' ([[Rauh]] &amp; [[Backeb.]]) Ostolaza&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* var. ''trujilloensis'', [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo, La Libertad]], northwestern Peru.

==Mescaline content==
''Echinopsis peruviana'' is one of a number of ''Echinopsis'' species native to the Andes that have been reported to contain the psychoactive alkaloid [[mescaline]]. Others include ''[[Echinopsis pachanoi|E.&amp;nbsp;pachanoi]]'', ''[[Echinopsis lageniformis|E.&amp;nbsp;lageniformis]]'', ''[[Echinopsis scopulicola|E.&amp;nbsp;scopulicola]]'', ''[[Echinopsis santaensis|E.&amp;nbsp;santaensis]]'' and ''[[Echinopsis puquiensis|E.&amp;nbsp;puquiensis]]''. All those columnar species thought to be psychoactive have been called "San Pedro" in Spanish. Reported concentrations of mescaline vary widely, with causes suggested to include: taxonomic uncertainty leading to difficulties in identification; genetic differences between species and within populations; environmental factors, such as temperature and water availability, affecting plants during growth; and variations in laboratory techniques.&lt;ref name=OgunMcCoTrouDale10/&gt;

Some studies have reported no mescaline content in wild-harvested Peruvian specimens of ''E.&amp;nbsp;peruviana'',&lt;ref name=DjerLiuFarkLipp55&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Djerassi |first1=Carl |last2=Liu |first2=L.H. |last3=Farkas |first3=E. |last4=Lippman |first4=A.E. |last5=Lemin |first5=A.J. |last6=Geller |first6=L.E. |last7=McDonald |first7=R.N. |last8=Taylor |first8=B.J. |date=1955 |title=Terpenoids.

'''Emanuel Raphael Belilios''', [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Justice of Peace|JP]] (14 November 1837 – 11 November 1905) was a Hong Kong Jewish [[opium trade|opium dealer]] and businessman.

Belilios was born in [[Calcutta]], [[British India]] on 14 November 1837. His father was Raphael Emanuel Belilios, member of a Jewish Venetian family. Belilios married Simha Ezra in 1855, and in 1862 he settled in Hong Kong and engaged in trade.

Belilios gained his reputation as a philanthropist. In the years 1887 and 1888, Belilios gave out two annual scholarships valued at $60, to the students of the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] and studying at the [[Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital|Alice Memorial Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Advertisements|work=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|date= 29 September 1887|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1889, Belilios donated $25,000 to set up a girls' government school.

Regarding the Chinese population Belilios observed favourably that: “The native Chinese make no difference between a Jew and Christian. Both are foreigners in their eyes, but, if anything they are better affected towards the Jew who they regard as Asiatic like themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCJNQPszu5sC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Emanuel+Raphael+Belilios&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BrPCtHOLO&amp;sig=O2mZ-xTHrqI0eqiR4HYTmhjseOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwidxp-LlKPdAhXSY98KHdRAAvA4FBDoATAFegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Emanuel%20Raphael%20Belilios&amp;f=false|title=Youtai – Presence and Perception of Jews and Judaism in China|last=Kupfer|first=Peter|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631575338|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family history==
[[File:Raphael Emanuel Belilios Vanity Fair 6 January 1910.jpg|thumb|Raphael Emanuel Belilios Vanity Fair 6 January 1910]]
The Belilios family originated in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Research in Jewish communal archives have traced the family to [[Portugal]] where they live for severals generations as [[New Christian]]s. The Belilios family was forcibly converted in 1497 to Christianity along with the entire Jewish community of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all likelihood the Belilios family remained ethnically apart and practiced [[crypto-Judaism]] as [[marrano]]s until a wave of persecution targeted the elite Portuguese New Christian merchant families in the early seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphael Belilios, who was known in Portugal as Filipo Terço, fled the inquisition to [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other families from the generation of [[refugee]]s the Belilios family strained to pass on objects with a symbolic connection to their former homeland. In 1653 we see Raphael Belilios is recorded in Venice as leaving to his two daughters the silverware that had come with him from [[Lisbon]] to Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belilios having settled in Venice in the early seventieth century regained their previous commercial success and within a century the family firm operated in Venice, Livorno and Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9UCudXJs-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=belilios+venice+family&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T97CQeg1_c&amp;sig=Re2BhzabpAupSYMmMbePG86BLs4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkt7XniKLdAhXuc98KHTIfAI0Q6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=belilios%20venice%20family&amp;f=false|title=The Familiarity of Strangers: The Sephardic Diaspora, Livorno, and Cross-cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period|last=Trivellato|first=Francesca|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300156200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish merchants engaged in Mediterranean trade at the time was conducted business through tight familial alliances with the Sepahrdic community.

Family documents such as wills speak of the Belilios family belonging to "the Jewish nation, of Spanish and Portuguese descent" and "established in [[Livorno]], Venice, London, [[Amsterdam]] and [[Aleppo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9UCudXJs-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=belilios+venice+family&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T97CQeg1_c&amp;sig=Re2BhzabpAupSYMmMbePG86BLs4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkt7XniKLdAhXuc98KHTIfAI0Q6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=belilios%20venice%20family&amp;f=false|title=The Familiarity of Strangers: The Sephardic Diaspora, Livorno, and Cross-cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period|last=Trivellato|first=Francesca|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300156200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mapped the business interests and offices of the Belilios family partnerships which leveraged intense ethnic networking and marriage ties into lasting trading relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Familiarity-Strangers-Sephardic-Diaspora-Cross-Cultural/dp/0300187491|title=The Familiarity of Strangers: The Sephardic Diaspora, Livorno, and Cross-Cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period|last=results|first=search|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300187496|edition= Reprint|location=New Haven London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trading documents show the Belilios family in the seventeenth and eighteenth century also intensely trading with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and even [[Hindu]] merchants in [[Goa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9UCudXJs-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=belilios+venice+family&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T97CQeg1_c&amp;sig=Re2BhzabpAupSYMmMbePG86BLs4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkt7XniKLdAhXuc98KHTIfAI0Q6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=belilios%20venice%20family&amp;f=false|title=The Familiarity of Strangers: The Sephardic Diaspora, Livorno, and Cross-cultural Trade in the Early Modern Period|last=Trivellato|first=Francesca|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300156200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have identified the Belilios family as culturally a type known as [[Port Jew]]s a concept formulated by Lois Dubin and David Sorkin as a social type that engaged in seafaring and maritime economy of Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dubin|first=Lois C.|title=Port Jews Revisited|date=2017/11|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-judaism/port-jews-revisited/9E2AF59CACB8864A04E4881A7AD5D16B|work=The Cambridge History of Judaism|pages=550–575|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/9781139017169.022|isbn=9781139017169|access-date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Port Jew]]s according to Lois Dubin were marked by a flexibility towards religion, an engagement with European culture and "a reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and 'enlightened' Jewish identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dubin|first=Lois C.|title=Port Jews Revisited|date=2017/11|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-judaism/port-jews-revisited/9E2AF59CACB8864A04E4881A7AD5D16B|work=The Cambridge History of Judaism|pages=550–575|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/9781139017169.022|isbn=9781139017169|access-date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families such as the Belilios have been described as "the earliest modern Jews" and offering an "alternative path" to Jewish modernity from the [[Court Jew]]s and the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] centred [[Haskalah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dubin|first=Lois C.|title=Port Jews Revisited|date=2017/11|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-judaism/port-jews-revisited/9E2AF59CACB8864A04E4881A7AD5D16B|work=The Cambridge History of Judaism|pages=550–575|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/9781139017169.022|isbn=9781139017169|access-date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belilios family, like many other Sepahrdic Jews operating out of Livorno, positioned themselves as central merchants and brokers in the booming trade of coral and diamonds coming from the Indian Ocean. Not traveling to India themselves they ran a family partnership in Aleppo and from there relied on a chain of mostly Mizrahi Jewish brokers and [[Caravanserai|caravan]] traders through [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to connect them to their distant Hindu trading partners in the far off Portuguese colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=YaleUniversity|title=John J. Mearsheimer, "The Roots of Liberal Hegemony"|date=22 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSj__Vo1pOU|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belilios were not only traders but also Rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers1/Trivellato.pdf|title=Trivellato Research|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Jacob Belilios served the community of Venice in the early eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers1/Trivellato.pdf|title=Trivellato Research|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Jacob Belilios was one of the main Rabbinical voices in Italy who sought to suppress the mystical visionary and kabbalist [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Moshe Chaim Luzzato]], for fear he was of a renewed outbreak of messianism less than a century since the crisis wrought by the heretical claims of [[Sabbatai Zevi|Shabbatai Zvi.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&amp;context=gc_etds]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1730s saw the Venetian Jewish community afflicted by a profound financial crisis and records show Rabbi Jacob Belilios in 1737–1738 was sent on a mission with a fellow member of the community to seek assistance from the flourishing Spanish and Portuguese Jews congregations in London and Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Jews_in_Venice.html?id=pZ5tAAAAMAAJ|title=History of the Jews in Venice|last=Roth|first=Cecil|date=1975|publisher=Schocken Books|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This downturn in Venetian affairs may have encouraged members of the family to settle permanently on Aleppo. The branch of the Belilios family which established itself and a branch of the family firm in Aleppo was one a clutch of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families known as the Livornese Jews under the protection of the French crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1744 when Isaac Belilios is recorded as having killed a Muslim caravan conductor he was tried by the French consul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These privileges caused friction within the Jewish community of long established and Ladino speaking Sepahrdic Jewish families and Arabic speaking Syrian Jews. The Livornese Jews of Aleppo were known as the "Segnores Francos" by these poorer Eastern Sephardim who were Jews long established in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. These families spoke Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian rather than Ladino and their Arabic was basic at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a cultural divide with the older Sepahrdic community. The Livornese families such as the Belilios were known in Aleppo to follow European customs when it came to dress. This included wearing whigs, hats and contravening Rabbinic ordinance went clean shaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other Western Sephardim the Belilios kept themselves apart, at least initially, from the poorer [[Eastern Sephardim]] or the [[Musta'arabi Jews|Arabic speaking Jews]] of [[Baghdad]] and [[Persia]] they traded with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the eighteenth century the Aleppo branch of the Belilios family was brought into ever closer trading relationships with [[Baghdadi Jews]] and [[Persian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century the Belilios are recorded as owning ships that travelled between [[Syria]] and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However their fortunes sagged. The decline of Aleppo which was followed by the decline of Venice itself in the early 19th century saw a brand of the Belilios family establish itself in [[Basra]] to take advantage of the booming ocean trade with [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] and then now intermarried with the leading families of the older Ladino speaking elite of Aleppo such as the [[Laniado Hospital|Lanyado]] family move onwards to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eiMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=Belilios+Basra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DrVwf2mOPj&amp;sig=gnoAJgOQJ2e2_b5u6B3xZfgFEvg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-2_XDiqLdAhUHUt8KHep0BzMQ6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Belilios%20Basra&amp;f=false|title=The House of Wives|last=Choa-Johnston|first=Simon|date=3 May 2016|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780143194118|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early nineteenth century the Belilios no longer operated as a united family and those established in the Far East were more modest merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought the Belilios family from being dominant players in the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sepahrdic]] world to outsiders in the flourishing Baghdadi Jewish diaspora, with who they intermarried including with the Gubbay and Judah families that were prominent in Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300187496/familiarity-strangers|title=Familiarity of Strangers {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early nineteenth century the Belilios family established in the Far East has assimilated to Baghdadi Jewish culture and were primarily Arabic and English speaking.

Isaac Raphael Belilios, the brother of Emmanuel Raphael Belilios, who was also born in Calcutta established himself in Singapore, with whom the Baghdadi Jews of Calcutta were in constant contact, and went on to dominate the cattle market. Belilios Lane, Belilios Terrace and Belilios Road in Singapore are named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpA4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=isaac+belilios+cattle+merchant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rlaMXhbpnV&amp;sig=D-0mEhy63V9h1NnuI3FTMimF0pk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis2crKhqPdAhXqct8KHYhrCNMQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=isaac%20belilios%20cattle%20merchant&amp;f=false|title=What's in the Name?

The stunning success of Emmanuel Raphael Belilios in Hong Kong catapulted the family to wealth and then to Great Britain. The son of Emmanuel Raphael Belilios, Raphael Emanuel Belilios (or "Billy"), was a barrister in England. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1900 and called to the Bar in 1903.

In the same year, Raphael had an arranged marriage to Vera Charlotte Hart, the only daughter of [[Sir Israel Hart]] of [[Holland Park]] and Lady Charlotte Victoria of [[Knighton, Leicester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish Universities Dinner|newspaper=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|date=16 November 1903|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael was admitted to the Bar on 16 May 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Raphael Belilios|newspaper=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|date=25 May 1906|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occupied chambers at [[Middle Temple]] from 1904 to 1922. The death of Raphael Emmanuel Bellios meant unlike other Baghdadi Jewish families such as the Sassoons the fortune of Emanuel Raphael Belilios did not establish a dynasty.

Plaques on the wall of the Spanish Synagogue in Venice record that many of the last members of the Belilios family established in Venice perished in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jvenice.org/en/spanish-synagogue|title=Spanish Synagogue|last=Administrator|website=''jvenice.org''|access-date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evangelist portraits''' are a specific type of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] included in ancient and [[mediaeval]] [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]]s, and later in [[Bible]]s and other books, as well as other media. Each [[Gospel]] of the [[Four Evangelists]], the books of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], may be prefaced by a portrait of the Evangelist, usually occupying a full page.  [[Evangelist's symbol#Evangelists.27 symbols|Their symbols]]  may be shown with them, or separately.  Often they are the only figurative [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illumination]] in the manuscript.  They are a common feature in larger Gospel Books from the earliest examples in the 6th century until the decline of that format for illustrated books in the High Middle Ages, by which time their conventions were being used for portraits of other authors.

==Author portraits==
They originate in the classical secular tradition of the author portrait, which was often the only illustration in a classical manuscript, also used as a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] (not unlike the contemporary author photo, though this is usually shown on the back cover or wrapper). A very few examples of Late Antique secular author portraits survive, and rather more later copies.  Some examples also draw on the conventions of the [[Late Antique]] consular portrait, much used for the Emperors, who were also [[consul]]s.  Examples of these, copied from the original, can be seen in the [[Chronography of 354]] (see also the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] of 30 years later).  The Evangelist may be holding a book, but is not writing in it, and he faces the front on a large throne, surrounded by an elaborate frame, usually domed or pedimented.  These frameworks are thought to draw from the style of the [[Scaenae frons]], or elaborate [[proscenium]] structures of [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]]s.

==The Evangelists' symbols==
[[File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] miniature portraying the Evangelists with their symbols, from the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], c. 820]]

The traditional symbols of the Evangelists were often included in the images, or especially in the [[Insular art|Insular]] tradition, either given their own additional images on a separate page, or used instead of an evangelist portrait.  The symbols are: the [[Lion]] of Mark, the [[Eagle]] of John, the [[Ox]] or [[Calf]] of Luke and the [[Angel]] or Man of Matthew.  Often all are shown with wings, as in the familiar winged lion used in the coat of arms of [[Venice]], whose [[patron saint]] was Mark.  Sometimes, as in the example from Lorsch, the symbols are shown dictating the text to the evangelist.

==Depictions and other media==
[[Late Antique]] evangelist portraits often show standing figures, as in the ivory panels of the Throne of [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]] in [[Milan]], but from the [[Insular art]] of the 7th to 10th centuries, evangelist portraits in manuscripts nearly always closely followed the seated classical models, showing the Evangelists at full-length, either looking out at the viewer or writing at a table or desk and seen at an oblique angle.  These were derived from unknown classical prototypes, similar to those in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] and [[Saint Augustine Gospels]], though both of these types are rather different from the general types.&lt;ref&gt;The portrait of Mark in the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] seems taken directly from the single portrait, usually thought to be of [[Ezra]], in the Codex Amiatinus.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually a setting is provided for the figure.  Details of the classical models, such as anachronistic [[scroll]]s and scroll-boxes, and a small writing-stand with a single dolphin-shaped support (see gallery below), survive well into the Middle Ages, sometimes clearly misunderstood by the artists concerned. Perhaps because of the secular origins of the typology, [[halo (religious iconography)|haloes]] are less likely to be worn than in other types of image.  The level of detail shown in the furniture and fittings is unusual for Early Medieval art.  An arch behind the author, often with curtains hanging across it, in some examples close to the classical models, gradually is turned into a decorative framing device for the whole scene.

Early Gospel Books often had a very elaborate and costly [[treasure binding]] or cover in metalwork, often with jewels and ivories.  These most often featured a central panel with [[Christ in Majesty]], often including the Evangelists and/or their symbols in the corners.  Versions of the same composition appear in all media used for Early Medieval religious art, including wall paintings.  The [[Tassilo Chalice]] is an 8th-century example of pure metalwork with five oval medallion portraits of Christ and the Evangelists (with symbols) round the cup.

==Insular variants and decline==
[[File:Irischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Insular, 8th century, now St Gall. Unusually, a single unspecified Evangelist with all four symbols]]
The early artists of the Insular period often show evangelists from the front who appear to be standing, although a chair is drawn behind them; the human figure was not a focus of interest or skill for these artists.  Later Insular depictions seem to show figures without chairs, who are standing.  Most of Europe continued to use the seated model however, usually seen in a three-quarters on view, and usually with a cushion behind.  Sometimes all four evangelists were combined on a page, sometimes around a [[Christ in Majesty]].  Standing portraits were usual, however, for wall and later panel paintings (and in the [[Tree of Jesse]] composition) with the Evangelists often treated as, and mixed with, other saints.  
 
The Gospel book as a medium for heavily illustrated manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, and with it the use of the Evangelist portrait. In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th-century [[Ostromir Gospels]] and the [[Khitrovo Gospels]] of about 1390 from [[Muscovy]].   In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a [[historiated initial]] at the start of each Gospel.  Other books sometimes contained them as well.  Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St [[Jerome]], who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, a lion, dozing at his feet. Similarly [[St Gregory the Great]] may be shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, whispering in his ear.

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted this right in practice. Some government officials committed abuses of citizens' religious freedom.
During the period covered by this report, the overall status of respect for religious freedom did not significantly change. While respect for non-Protestant groups appeared to improve slightly, respect for Protestant groups appeared to decline in several parts of the country. In most areas, officials generally respected the constitutionally guaranteed rights of members of most faiths to worship, albeit within strict constraints imposed by the Government. Authorities in some areas continued to display intolerance for minority religious practice especially by Protestant Christians. The Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC), a popular front organization for the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), was responsible for oversight of religious practice. The Prime Minister's Decree on Religious Practice (Decree 92) was the principal legal instrument defining rules for religious practice. Decree 92 also institutionalized the Government's role as the final arbiter of permissible religious activities. Although this decree has contributed to greater religious tolerance since it was promulgated in 2002, authorities have increasingly used its many conditions to restrict some aspects of religious practice.

During the period covered by this report, some local officials pressured minority Protestants to renounce their faith on threat of arrest or forceful eviction from their villages. Such cases occurred in Bolikhamsai, Houaphan, and Luang Namtha provinces. Arrests and detention of Protestants occurred in Luang Namtha, Oudomsai, Salavan, Savannakhet, and Vientiane provinces. Two Buddhist monks were arrested in Bolikhamsai Province for having been ordained without government authorization. In some areas, minority Protestants were forbidden from gathering to worship. In areas where Protestants were actively proselytizing, local officials have sometimes subjected them to "reeducation."

A Christian man in Salavan Province was arrested on April 1, 2006 for refusing to renounce his faith and placed under house arrest until his release in late July 2006. At the end of the period covered by this report, there were four known religious prisoners, as well as at least seven other Protestants who were apparently being detained without charges for other than religious reasons, but in whose cases religion was suspected to have played a role. Conflicts between ethnic groups and movement among villages sometimes exacerbated religious tensions. The efforts of some Protestant congregations to establish churches independent of the Lao Evangelical Church (LEC) continued to cause strains within the Protestant community.

==Religious demography==
{{Main|Religion in Laos}}

The country has an area of {{convert|85000|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 6.4 million. Almost all ethnic or "lowland" Lao are followers of [[Theravada Buddhism]]; however, lowland Lao constitute only 40-50 percent of the population. The remainder of the population belongs to at least 48 distinct ethnic minority groups. Most of these ethnic minorities are practitioners of animism, with beliefs that vary greatly among groups. Animism is predominant among most Sino-Thai groups, such as the Thai Dam and Thai Daeng, as well as among Mon-Khmer and Burmo-Tibetan groups. Even among lowland Lao, many pre-Buddhist animistic religious beliefs have been incorporated into Theravada [[Buddhist]] practice. Catholics and Protestants constitute approximately 2 percent of the population. Other minority religious groups include those practicing the Baha'i faith, Islam, [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and Confucianism. A very small number of citizens follow no religion.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution, promulgated in 1991, provides for freedom of religion; however, local authorities in particular sometimes violated this right. Article 30 of the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, a fact frequently cited by officials in reference to religious tolerance. Article 9 of the Constitution, however, discourages all acts that create divisions among religious groups and persons. The Government has interpreted this clause restrictively, and both local and central government officials widely refer to Article 9 as a reason for placing constraints on religious practice, especially proselytizing and the expansion of Protestantism among minority groups. Although official pronouncements acknowledge the existence of different religious groups, they emphasize religion's potential to divide, distract, or destabilize.

A person arrested or convicted for religious offenses, as with most other alleged civil liberties violations, had little protection under the law. Detained persons may be held for lengthy periods without trial. Court judges, not juries, decided guilt or innocence in court cases, and the defense rights of the accused were limited. All religious groups, including Buddhists, practice their faith in an atmosphere in which application of the law is arbitrary. Certain actions interpreted by officials as threatening brought harsh punishment. Religious practice was "free" only if practitioners stayed within tacitly understood guidelines of activity acceptable to the Government.

The Government typically refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing on the part of its officials, even in egregious cases of religious persecution. Blame was usually attributed to the victims rather than the persecuting officials. In some past cases, officials concocted patently unbelievable explanations for events in order to exonerate local officials. While the Government has sometimes admitted that local officials are often part of the problem, it has been unwilling to take action against officials who have violated laws and regulations on religious freedom.

In its 20 articles, Decree 92 establishes guidelines for religious activities in a broad range of areas. While the decree provides that the Government "respects and protects legitimate activities of believers," it also seeks to ensure that religious practice "conforms to the laws and regulations." Decree 92 reserves for the LFNC the "right and duty to manage and promote" religious practice, requiring that nearly all aspects of religious practice receive the approval of the LFNC office having responsibility for the village, district, and province where the activity occurs and, in some cases, requiring approval from the central level LFNC.

Decree 92 legitimizes proselytizing by Lao citizens, printing religious materials, owning and building houses of worship, and maintaining contact with overseas religious groups–all contingent upon a strict approval process. In practice, the Government used the approval process to restrict the religious activities of certain groups and has effectively prevented some religious denominations from importing and printing religious materials as well as constructing houses of worship.

The Government required several religious groups, apparently with the exception of Buddhists and Catholics, to report membership information periodically to the Religious Affairs Department of the LFNC. The Government also restricted the publication of religious materials that applied to most religious groups, again excepting Buddhists.

Both the Constitution and Decree 92 assert that religious practice should serve national interests by promoting development and education and instructing believers to be good citizens. The Government presumed both a right and a duty to oversee religious practice at all levels to ensure religious practice fills these roles in society. In effect this has led the Government to intervene in the activities of minority religious groups, particularly Protestants, on the grounds that their practices did not promote national interests or demonstrated disloyalty to the Government.

Although the state is secular in name and practice, members of governmental institutions are by-and-large followers of Theravada Buddhism, the religion of the majority of the ethnic Lao population. The Government's exemption of Buddhism from many of the Decree 92 restrictions imposed on other organized religions and its promotion of Buddhism as an element of the country's cultural and spiritual identity gave Theravada Buddhism the status of an unofficial national religion. Many persons regarded Buddhism as both an integral part of the national culture and a way of life. The increasing incorporation of Buddhist ritual and ceremony in state functions reflected the elevated status of Buddhism in society.

In some areas where animism predominated among ethnic minority groups, local authorities have actively encouraged those groups to adopt Buddhism and abandon their "backward" beliefs in magic and spirits. The Government discouraged animist practices that it regarded as outdated, unhealthy, or illegal, such as the practice in some tribes of killing children born with defects or of burying the bodies of deceased relatives under peoples' homes.

Although the Government did not maintain diplomatic relations with the Holy See, representatives of the Papal Nuncio visited from Thailand and coordinated with the Government on assistance programs, especially for lepers and persons with disabilities.

Since 2001 the Government has more closely scrutinized the activities of Laos' small Muslim population but has not interfered with the community's religious activities. Muslims in the small Islamic community were able to practice their faith openly and attend the two active mosques. Daily prayers and the weekly Jumaat prayer on Fridays proceeded unobstructed, and all Islamic celebrations were allowed. Muslims were permitted to go on the Hajj. Groups that conduct Tabligh teachings for the faithful came from Thailand once or twice per year. In 2006, a local Muslim joined with members of other religious groups to represent the Government at an Interfaith Conference on Religion in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The Government observes two religious holidays, the That Luang Festival (the end of Buddhist Lent) and the Buddhist New Year. It recognized the popularity and cultural significance of Buddhist festivals, and most senior officials openly attended them. The Government generally allowed major religious festivals of all established congregations without hindrance.

Authorities require new denominations to join other religious groups with similar historical antecedents despite clear differences between the groups' beliefs. In March 2004 the LFNC's Order Number 1 required all Protestant groups to become a part of the LEC or the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The order stated that no other denominations would be permitted to register, a measure to prevent "disharmony" in the religious community. Although the Prime Minister's Decree on Religious Practice establishes procedures for new denominations to register, the Government's desire to consolidate religious practice for purposes of control has effectively blocked new registrations. In theory, denominations not registered with the LFNC were not allowed to practice their faith.

There was no religious instruction in public schools nor were there any parochial or religiously-affiliated schools operating in the country. However, several private pre-schools and English language schools received support from religious groups abroad. In practice many boys spent some time in Buddhist temples, where they received instruction in religion as well as in academics. Temples traditionally have filled the role of schools and continued to play this role in smaller communities where formal education was limited or unavailable. Christian denominations, particularly the LEC, Seventh-day Adventists, and the Catholic Church, operated Sunday schools for children and young persons. Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies conducted religious training for children as well as for adult members.

The Government requires and routinely granted permission for formal links with co-religionists in other countries. In practice the line between formal and informal links was blurred, and relations generally were established without much difficulty.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The Government's tolerance of religion varied by region and by religion. Throughout the country, however, religious practice was restrained by official rules and policies that only allowed religious groups to practice their faith under circumscribed conditions. LEC members and other Protestant groups that have wanted to be recognized as separate from the LEC continued to be the targets of most restrictions. The Buddhist Supreme Patriarch, or Sangkarat, maintained close links to the Government. Government officials commonly invited Buddhist monks to bless newly opened Government buildings and offices. As a result of the Government's decentralization policy that diffused power to provinces and districts, central government control over the behavior of provincial, district, and local officials was weakened. Local officials were often unaware of government policies on topics such as religious tolerance due to the incomplete dissemination and application of existing laws and regulations and, when aware of the laws, often failed to enforce the laws. The LFNC at times visited areas where religious persecution had taken place in order to instruct local officials on government policy and regulation. More often, however, the LFNC's Religious Affairs Department encouraged local or provincial governments to resolve conflicts on their own and in accordance with Decree 92.

In some areas unauthorized churches have generally been allowed to conduct services without hindrance by local authorities. Within the LEC, some congregations have sought greater independence and have forged their own connections with Protestant groups abroad. Authorities in several provinces insisted that independent church congregations return to the LEC, but in other areas authorities allowed independent churches to conduct services without hindrance.

Methodists have consistently sought to register with the LFNC since the beginning of this decade as a separate denomination. In early 2006, Methodists again requested to register with the Government as a religious group separate and apart from the LEC but received no official response. In early 2006 some village and district officials appeared to be taking a stronger stance against unauthorized Methodist congregations; however, this reportedly tapered off in late 2006.

Between 1999 and 2001 local authorities closed approximately 20 of Vientiane Province's 60 LEC churches. Beginning in 2002, most of these churches were allowed to reopen. However, despite requests, officials in several districts of Savannakhet Province did not allow local congregations to reopen as many as 6 of Savannakhet's approximately 40 churches, and they remained closed at the end of the reporting period. Despite recent requests that a church building in Dong Nong Khun Village, which was confiscated by local officials in 2000, be returned to its congregation, provincial officials stated in early 2007 that the number of Protestants in the village was not sufficient to warrant having a church even though local Protestants claimed more than 100 worshippers in the village.

As many as 200 of the LEC's nearly 400 congregations do not have permanent church structures and conduct worship services in members' homes. Since the 2002 promulgation of Decree 92, officials from the LFNC's Religious Affairs Department have stated that home churches should be replaced with designated church structures whenever possible. At the same time, village and district LFNC offices often refused permission to construct new churches, and home churches remained the only viable place of worship for many LEC congregations. The LEC continued to encounter difficulties registering new congregations and receiving permission to establish new places of worship or repair existing facilities, particularly in Luang Prabang City, Attapeu, Luang Namtha, and Savannakhet provinces. No new LEC churches were permitted during the reporting period.

Baha'i spiritual assemblies in Vientiane and Savannakhet cities practiced freely, but smaller communities in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces periodically faced restrictions by local authorities, such as limitations on both the nature and extent of some religious activities.

Lao authorities remained suspicious of major supporters, both foreign and domestic, of religious communities other than Buddhism, especially Protestant groups, in part because these faiths do not share the high degree of direction and incorporation into the government structure that Theravada Buddhism does. Some authorities criticized Christianity as an American or imperialist "import" into the country. In the past decade, the LEC suffered the brunt of local-level efforts to close churches, arrest church leaders, and force members to renounce their faith. The LEC's rapid growth during the last decade, its contacts with religious groups abroad, the active proselytizing by some of its members, and its relative independence of government control contributed to the Government's suspicion of the church's activities. Some authorities also interpreted Christian teachings of obedience to God as signifying disloyalty to the Government and ruling party. There was also strong evidence that the Communist Party leadership viewed Christianity as a tool of western countries to undermine the Communist political system. While LEC leadership was primarily Lao, the LEC membership was mostly ethnic Mon-Khmer tribes and the Hmong, two groups that historically have resisted central Government control, which contributed to the Government's distrust of the LEC.

During the reporting period there were no reports of official interference with or denial of permission to hold religious celebrations in churches, but there were reports that Protestants in some villages were not allowed to hold Christian celebrations in their homes, thus restricting Protestant activities to church buildings only. This was particularly a problem for Protestants who had not been given approval to build church structures in their villages. For example, Protestants in Nakun Village, Bolikhamsai Province, and Xunya Village, Luang Namtha Province, have reportedly been restricted in their ability to hold religious meetings and celebrations in their homes. Protestants in both villages also have not been given approval to build church structures.

Longstanding restrictions on the Catholic Church's operations in the north resulted in the continued existence of only a handful of small congregations in Sayaboury, Bokeo, Luang Namtha, and Vientiane provinces; however, there were signs during the reporting period that the Government was slowly easing its control over the Catholic community in the north. The Government permitted more frequent visits by the Bishop of Luang Prabang to the north to conduct services for the scattered Catholic community there, but it continued to restrict his travel and prevent his residence in Luang Prabang. There were no ordained Catholic priests operating in the north. Several church properties, including a school in Vientiane Municipality, were seized by the Government after 1975 and have not been returned, nor has the Government provided restitution.

The Government prohibited foreigners from proselytizing, although it permitted foreign NGOs with religious affiliations to work in the country. Authorities sometimes seized religious tracts and teaching materials from local Protestants entering the country from abroad and arrested and expelled foreigners attempting to proselytize. In early 2006 two South Koreans were reportedly arrested for proselytizing in Bokeo Province and were expelled.

Although Decree 92 authorized the printing of non-Buddhist religious texts and allowed religious materials to be imported from abroad, it also required permission for such activities from the LFNC. The LFNC did not authorize Christian or Baha'i denominations to print their own religious materials, although both groups have sought permission to do so for several years. Because of these restrictions, some approved Protestant congregations complained of difficulties in obtaining Bibles and other religious materials. The Government has not allowed the Seventh-day Adventists to import Bibles or other religious materials, but the Government did allow the LEC to import a small number of Bibles in early 2007.

During the reporting period, Bibles were confiscated at the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge from those attempting to import materials for existing congregations. However, there were no reports of arrests associated with these confiscations, as had occurred in past years. Several non-Christian groups indicated that they have not been restricted in bringing religious materials into the country.

The Government generally did not interfere with citizens wishing to travel abroad for short-term religious training. In past years, the Government required that Lao citizens exiting the country receive an exit stamp. This requirement was eliminated in early 2007. Even before the exit stamp requirement was eliminated, many persons of all faiths traveled abroad informally for religious training without obtaining advance permission and without informing authorities of the purpose of their travel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually granted exit visas, but on occasion it refused travel permission to persons going abroad for what it regarded as suspect activities.

Identity cards did not specify religion, nor did family "household registers" or passports, two other important forms of identification. On occasion authorities withheld new ID cards or household registers from Protestants because of their religious beliefs or threatened to withhold official documentation unless they renounced their faith. In 2006 district officials in Houaphan Province reportedly accepted several passport applications from Protestants within their district but subsequently refused to send the applications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
Authorities continued to arrest and detain persons for their religious activities. Detentions that occurred during the reporting period tended to be longer than in 2005-2006. At the end of the period covered by this report, there were four religious prisoners: three in Vientiane Province and one in Oudomsai Province. There was also one abduction of a man in Luang Namtha Province in January 2007 in which religion may have played a role. Additionally, six ethnic Hmong, five males and one adult female, who had been detained in 2005 as part of a group of 27, apparently remained in detention at the end of the reporting period. While religion was not considered the primary reason for their detentions, it was considered to be one factor involved. Conditions in prisons were reportedly harsh; like other prisoners, religious detainees suffered from inadequate food rations, lack of medical care, and cramped quarters.

From late 2006 through the end of the reporting period, Protestants in Xunya Village of Luang Namtha Province have reportedly been restricted in their right to worship by local officials. Following the death of a local member of the Protestant community in March 2007, local officials reportedly refused the community permission to hold a Christian funeral service. In May 2007 the LFNC reportedly gave permission for Christian weddings and funerals to take place in the village, but Protestants are reportedly not allowed to gather for worship services. In January 2007 several Christian families in Long District of Luang Namtha Province and Xiang Kho District of Houaphan Province were reportedly asked to renounce their Christian beliefs by local and district-level officials or leave their villages.

In March 2007 Protestants in Nakun Village of Bolikhamsai Province were reportedly reeducated and asked to sign statements indicating that they had engaged in proselytizing. The Protestants were reported as saying that they had been pressured by local officials in regard to their Christian beliefs and had been reeducated several times. Also in March, several Protestant families in Nam Deua Village of Bolikhamsai Province were reportedly told to give up their religious beliefs and threatened with expulsion from their village. In May 2007 7 of the ten Christian families in Nakun Village were reportedly forced to resettle to another village after refusing to renounce their Protestant beliefs.

In January 2007 Mr. Khamsone Baccam, an ethnic Thai Dam man described as a Protestant leader, was arrested in Oudomsai Province. The Government has been unwilling to acknowledge that he is being held, and multiple requests for information about his status were not answered.

Also in January 2007, Mr. Somphone Khantisouk was abducted from a roadside in Luang Namtha Province, reportedly by local police. While the exact reason for Somphone's abduction is unclear, religion is not considered to be the primary cause. However, some in the religious community have indicated that his perceived religious affiliation may have been one factor involved in his abduction.

Bolikhamsai Province officials indicated in February 2007 that two Buddhist monks had been arrested for being ordained without Government approval and for celebrating inappropriately following the ordination ceremony. The two were reportedly only detained a short time before being released.

In December 2006 five ethnic Yao Protestants were arrested in Luang Namtha Province for constructing a church building without appropriate authorization. The five men were released on January 20, 2007, reportedly after complying with a local official's request that they sign a document renouncing their faith. Since their release, the men have reportedly been closely watched by local officials and have not been allowed to gather for worship services.

In late 2006 several villagers in Luang Namtha Province were reportedly called into a local police station and questioned following a children's performance in the village. Reportedly, local officials incorrectly thought that the performance may have had some relationship to a "foreign religion."

In November 2006 two ethnic Khmu U.S. Legal Permanent Residents who were visiting Khon Khen Village in Vientiane Province were detained after participating in and videotaping a Protestant celebration in the village. The two, a pastor and his wife, were released after three-weeks' detention and payment of a $9,000 fine.

Thirteen ethnic Khmu Protestants in Khon Khen Village were also arrested in November 2006. According to government officials, 1 of the 13 was quickly released after it was discovered that he was a local official. Nine of the 12 other Khmu Protestants were released from a police detention facility on May 16. Three pastors, considered the leaders of the group, remained in prison at the end of the reporting period. The Government has not indicated if there are any charges against the three that remain incarcerated.

In August 2006 two LEC members in Saveth Village, Savannakhet Province, were arrested, reportedly for being outspoken about their faith. The two men were held without charges for several months. Eventually, they were charged with "causing division in society" and sentenced to six months in prison. The two were released on February 9, 2007.

From June through July 2006, a Protestant man in Nam Heng Village of Oudomsai Province was reportedly jailed for possessing ammunition at his residence. According to the LEC, the man had completed his service in the military and did have a small amount of ammunition at his residence, not unusual in remote villages where people engage in hunting. The Protestant community, however, regarded the ammunition as an excuse for his arrest, believing the real reason was local officials' opposition to his Christianity. The man was released in July following payment of a $200 fine.

In April 2006 district officials in Salavan Province arrested an LEC member, Mr. Adern, who refused the village chief's order to recant his faith. He was reportedly from one of four Protestant families that had lived in the village, two of which had reportedly been forced to leave by the time of his arrest. During the first 10 days of house arrest he was reportedly bound with wrist and ankle shackles but was then unshackled and allowed to move freely in his home. Mr. Adern was released from house arrest in July 2006.

In 2005 authorities in Bolikhamsai Province detained a group of 27 ethnic Hmong. The group—all but one minors at the time they were initially detained—were residents at the Petchabun displaced-persons' settlement in northern Thailand, and were irregularly deported back to Laos by Thai authorities who considered them illegal immigrants. Some sources indicated that the group members were Christians and may have been detained in Laos in part due to their religious affiliation. Six of the 27 Hmong were apparently still in detention or otherwise unaccounted for at the end of the reporting period. Complicating this case, the Government had refused to acknowledge it was holding the group of 27 for 15 months and, only in March 2007, did it claim it had "found" the 21 girls from the group. The Government released the girls into the custody of extended family members but did not allow the presence of international observers at the release ceremony. Many of the girls have reportedly returned to Thailand. The Government still has not accounted for the five males and one adult female.

In late 2005 an unapproved LEC Church in Houaysay Noi Village, Bokeo Province, was destroyed by local officials, and six church leaders were arrested. One of the six died while in jail, and the other five were released in early 2006.

In 1999, authorities arrested two members of the Lao Evangelical Church in Oudomsai Province, Mr. Nyoht and Mr. Thongchanh, and charged them with treason and sedition, although their arrests appeared to have been for proselytizing. Nyoht was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Thongchanh to 15 years. In October 2006 Nyoht died while in prison. Thongchanh remained in prison at the end of this reporting period despite appeals that his case be reviewed.

Efforts by local officials to force Protestants to renounce their faith continued in some areas. In some cases, officials threatened religious minorities with arrest or expulsion from their villages if they did not comply.

In January 2007 officials in Long District of Luang Namtha Province and Xiang Kho District of Houaphan Province reportedly threatened several Protestant families with expulsion if they did not renounce their beliefs. In March 2007 officials in Nam Deua District of Bolikhamsai Province also reportedly pressured some Protestants to renounce their beliefs.

Lands belonging to several Protestant families in Nam Heng Village of Oudomsai Province were reportedly confiscated by the village chief and redistributed to other villagers in early 2006. Some other Protestants who had previously resettled to the village were said to have returned to their home province of Phongsaly after being pressured by the village chief. According to Lao officials and the LEC, the land confiscation issue was resolved in mid-2006. Local Protestants in the village indicated in early 2007 that, while opposition to Christianity may have complicated the issue, most of those whose lands were confiscated had moved to Nam Heng Village without Government authorization.

In February 2005 authorities expelled Protestant villagers from Ban Kok Pho Village of Bolikhamsai Province after they refused to renounce their faith.

In early 2005 authorities in Muang Phin District of Savannakhet Province detained 24 ethnic Brou Protestants associated with the LEC at the district police office for several days in order to force their renunciation of faith. All but two of the men recanted their faith. These two men were imprisoned for approximately 1 year but were reportedly released in early 2006.

===Forced religious conversion===
Local officials in some areas attempted to force Protestants to renounce their faith; however, there were no reports of explicit forced conversion to another faith during the reporting period. In cases where renunciations occurred, villagers were told by local officials that they would be expelled from their villages if they did not sign documents renouncing their faith. In at least one case, villagers in Nakun Village of Bolikhamsai Province who chose not to renounce their beliefs were reported to have been relocated by local officials. According to Protestants following the incident, village officials had suggested that Protestant villagers convert to Buddhism or to their previously held animist beliefs. The same officials reportedly told villagers that Protestantism is not good because it is an American religion.

There were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===
The Government's record of respect for religious freedom, particularly in regard to Protestant minorities, continued to be marred by problems at the local level, with incidents of persecution occurring in many provinces. However, some positive steps were taken during the reporting period to address specific religious freedom concerns.

In its official pronouncements in recent years, the Government called for conciliation and equality among religious faiths. The LFNC continued to instruct local officials on religious tolerance. Officials from the LFNC traveled with representatives of the LEC to several provinces to promote better understanding between LEC congregations and local officials.

The LEC continued to conduct an active program of public service during this reporting period, providing developmental assistance and organizing social welfare projects in several areas that had previously experienced religious intolerance. In conjunction with the LFNC, the LEC continued to conduct meetings with officials and Protestants in some villages where there had been religious tensions.

On May 6, 2007 the LEC opened a Sports and Vocational Training Center in Vientiane Municipality on a piece of property that had been confiscated by the Government several years earlier. The land was returned to the LEC contingent on the Center being made available for use by Lao athletes to prepare for the 2009 South East Asian Games.

In early 2007 church members in Houaysay Noi Village, Bokeo Province, were given approval to meet in a house church. The village had previously experienced problems, when in late 2005, an unapproved LEC Church in Houaysay Noi Village was destroyed by local officials, and six church leaders were arrested. One of the six died while in jail, and the other five were released in early 2006.

In the past, local officials in some areas obstructed Christian congregations' observance of religious holidays such as Christmas. Church officials indicated that Christmas activities at recognized religious venues in 2006 were less restricted than in 2005, particularly in Vientiane Municipality.

Churches that had previously been closed were allowed to reopen in some provinces in 2006. The Government permitted the reopening of four LEC churches in Bolikhamsai Province that were officially closed in past years, including a church in Khamsan Village that had been closed since 2003. Officials in Muang Feuang District of Vientiane Province granted permission for LEC members to reconstruct a destroyed church in Phone Ngam Village in late 2005, and the church has since reopened. During the reporting period, there were no reported LEC church closures.

In contrast to the past policy of denying all such requests, several provinces also permitted some Christian congregations to expand or renovate long-standing churches. In 2006 Catholics were permitted to construct two rural churches in Vientiane Province. Catholic communities had existed in both villages for more than 10 years.

In June 2006 authorities permitted the Catholic Church to conduct an ordination in Vientiane Municipality along with the ordination of a deacon in Champassak Province. This marked the first Catholic ordinations in the country since 1975.

The ordination in Vientiane Municipality was initially scheduled to take place in late 2005 in Bolikhamsai Province; however, the Government blocked it. In December 2006 the Government allowed the ordination of three additional Catholic priests in Vientiane Municipality. Approval for the ordinations represented improvements over past restrictions.

The small Seventh-day Adventist Church, confined to a handful of congregations in Vientiane Municipality and Bolikhamsai, Bokeo, Champassak, Luang Prabang, and Xiengkhoug provinces, reported no significant Government interference in its activities in recent years, and its members appeared to be free to practice their faith.

In late 2006 the Baha'is were able, with assistance from the Lao Front for National Construction, to reclaim two pieces of property in Vientiane and Khammouane provinces that had been seized by the Government in 1975. In 2006 the Government officially approved land for the establishment of four new Baha'i centers, two in Vientiane Municipality, one in Vientiane Province, and one in Savannakhet Province. While the land approval has been granted, the Baha'i have not yet received all required paperwork from the District Land Offices and have not yet requested approval to begin construction of the new centers. Additionally, in June 2006 the Government gave official approval for Baha'is to use land where they already have a cemetery.

Baha'i local spiritual assemblies and the National Spiritual Assembly routinely held Baha'i 19-day feasts and celebrated all holy days. The Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly in Vientiane met regularly and has sent delegations to the Universal House of Justice in Mount Carmel, in Haifa, Israel. Visitors from sister congregations in Malaysia have visited the Baha'i Center in Vientiane.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
{{See also|Societal abuses|Religious discrimination}}
For the most part, the various religious communities coexist amicably. Society places importance on harmonious relations, and the dominant Buddhist faith generally is tolerant of other religious practices. There has been no ecumenical movement to date. Local cultural mores generally instilled respect for longstanding, well-known differences in belief. However, interreligious tensions arose on rare occasions within some minority ethnic groups, particularly in response to proselytizing or disagreements over rights to village resources. Efforts of some congregations to establish churches independent of the LEC or associated with denominations based abroad led to some tensions within the Protestant community. Frictions also have arisen over the refusal of some members of minority religious groups, particularly Protestants, to participate in Buddhist or animist religious ceremonies.

In December 2005 an LEC pastor, Mr. Aroun Varaphong, was killed in Bolikhamsai Province after preaching at a pre-Christmas service. There is no evidence that a serious investigation into his killing was ever conducted.

'''Gregory John Puciato''' (born March 27, 1980) is best known as the lead singer of the disbanded [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] and is currently the lead singer of [[The Black Queen (band)|The Black Queen]] and [[Killer Be Killed]].  He is noted for reckless live performances, wide vocal range, outspoken views, and controversy stemming from his bands' performances and interviews.

In the December 2007 issue of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' Puciato was voted one of the "37 greatest metal frontmen" of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalmartyr.com/revolvers-greatest-frontmen-and-women-of-metal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031946/http://www.metalmartyr.com/revolvers-greatest-frontmen-and-women-of-metal/ |archivedate=October 22, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he was named number one by [[MetalSucks]] in their listing of "top 25 modern metal frontmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/04/08/1-greg-puciato-the-dillinger-escape-plan|title=#1: Greg Puciato (The Dillinger Escape Plan)|work=MetalSucks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Greg Puciato grew up in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The city was surrounded by poverty and [[African-American culture]] that "had a giant influence on [him]," both in the sense that he does not "feel uncomfortable in any area" and on his fondness for [[R&amp;B]] and [[hip-hop]].&lt;ref name="fret12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ugiy8Qexl0|title=Greg Puciato, The Dillinger Escape Plan: The Sound and The Story|website=www.fret12.com|location=Chicago, Illinois|format=video|accessdate=December 19, 2017|publicationdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;!-- Original blacklisted link: www.fret12.com/blogs/videos/the-sound-and-the-story-greg-puciato-the-dillinger-escape-plan --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he became a fan of [[Guns N' Roses]] through [[MTV]], which was the first band he was "obsessed with."&lt;ref name=fret12/&gt;&lt;ref name=faceculture&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview Dillinger Escape Plan - Greg Puciato (part 1)|accessdate=December 19, 2017|work=FaceCulture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpuYM3jqsuo|format=video|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|publicationdate=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the age of nine, he saw [[Metallica]]'s video for "[[One (Metallica song)|One]]" which bridged him from [[hard rock]] to [[extreme metal]] music. During that period, Puciato started playing guitar, with "[[Seek &amp; Destroy]]" being the first song that he learned how to play.&lt;ref name=faceculture/&gt; He describes the following years as centered around [[thrash metal]] and [[Nintendo]], and shortly afterward, the [[Bad Brains]].&lt;ref name=fret12/&gt;

At fourteen, Puciato was in a thrash metal group, and they did not have a singer, which lead him to move to vocals because he was "too much of a control freak to let someone else sing" and could not do both at the same time, but he continued playing by himself.&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 19, 2017|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/interview-dillinger-escape-plan-6478747|title=Interview: Dillinger Escape Plan|first=Arielle|last=Castillo|publicationdate=January 14, 2008|date=January 10, 2008|8=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171126034007/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/interview-dillinger-escape-plan-6478747|archivedate=November 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, Puciato became a fan of [[funk metal]] bands including the Bad Brains, [[Faith No More]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and [[Living Colour]].  Pucaiato cites [[Mike Patton]] and [[H.R.]] as his biggest vocal inspirations when growing up, who "opened my eyes a lot to what could be done with the voice overtop of heavy music."&lt;ref name=fret12/&gt;&lt;ref name=faceculture2&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 19, 2017|format=video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG0FD2IOajA|title=Interview Dillinger Escape Plan - Greg Puciato (part 2)|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|work=FaceCulture|publicationdate=December 7, 2010|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prindle&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 19, 2017|first=Mark |last=Prindle|url=http://www.markprindle.com/puciato-i.htm|title=Greg Puciato - 2003|date=September 2003|website=www.markprindle.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130707233532/http://www.markprindle.com/puciato-i.htm|archivedate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although raised in a non-practicing home, Puciato attended a [[Catholic]] private school. He was a good student and [[skipped grades]], graduating at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name=self-titled&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Andrew|accessdate=December 19, 2017|title=THE SELF-TITLED INTERVIEW: The Dillinger Escape Plan|publicationdate=July 16, 2010|url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/2010/07/16/the-self-titled-interview-the-dillinger-escape-plan/|website=www.self-titledmag.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161119194518/http://www.self-titledmag.com/2010/07/16/the-self-titled-interview-the-dillinger-escape-plan/|archivedate=November 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he studied for a year in [[Maryland]] and decided to take a break, during which he was invited to join [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]].&lt;ref name=self-titled/&gt;

== Music career ==

=== The Dillinger Escape Plan ===

Puciato joined [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] in September 2001 and first performed with the group weeks later at the ''CMJ music conference'' in October 2001.&lt;ref name=hazard&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan {{!}} Hazard Warning|author=Natalie Zina Walschots|website=[[Exclaim!]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171210072225/https://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|archivedate=December 10, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 11, 2018|publicationdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a scenario mirroring that of young [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], Puciato started out as a fan of [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] in their earlier days. When the band split with their singer [[Dimitri Minakakis]] (due to him wanting to focus more on Graphic Arts/Design), they searched publicly for a new singer by releasing the instrumental version of the song "43% Burnt" (off of their [[Calculating Infinity|debut album]]). Puciato sent in a tape with one version of him mimicking Dimitri Minakakis and one with his own take on the song. He was contacted shortly after by the band, auditioned in person, and was subsequently asked to join. Coincidentally, the band's first release with Puciato was for a [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] tribute compilation, where they covered Damaged I and II. He has since sung on every subsequent release.&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt;

In August 2016 he told ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine that the previously announced Dillinger "hiatus" was in fact a "break up" and explained the artistic reasoning for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theprp.com/2016/08/31/news/dillinger-escape-plans-greg-puciato-breaking-not-going-extended-hiatus/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spylacopa ===
Puciato was also involved with Spylacopa, an experimental musical project headed by [[Candiria]] guitarist John LaMacchia (along with [[Julie Christmas]] of [[Made Out of Babies]] and [[Jeff Caxide]] of [[Isis (band)|Isis]]). Spylacopa released a self-titled EP in 2008, with vocals, as well as some guitar and piano/programming, written by Puciato. Similar programming and piano playing would appear on [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]]'s ''[[Option Paralysis]]'' album as the bonus track "Chuck McChip". Puciato confirmed in 2012 that Spylacopa is "dead".&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2012/07/10/news/greg-puciato-says-splyacopa-and-error-are-dead-as-of-now/|title=Greg Puciato Says Splyacopa And Error Are "Dead As Of Now" - Theprp.com – Metal And Hardcore News Plus Reviews And More|author=wookubus|work=Theprp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Dillinger Escape Plan-1.jpg|thumb|Puciato singing while hanging head down from the ceiling]]

=== Killer Be Killed ===
Later in February 2011, [[Max Cavalera]], in an interview with Swedish magazine ''Metalshrine'', revealed that he and Greg were working on a full-length album, similar in style to Cavalera's [[Nailbomb]] project. The band, later named [[Killer Be Killed]], was also announced to feature former [[The Mars Volta|Mars Volta]] drummer [[Dave Elitch]], and [[Troy Sanders]] of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 11, 2018|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2013/02/08/greg-puciato-max-cavalera-troy-sanders/|title=Dillinger Escape Plan’s Greg Puciato on His Upcoming Album With Max Cavalera|first=Mike |last=Gitter |publicationdate=February 8, 2013 |website=[[Noisecreep]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928223019/http://noisecreep.com/greg-puciato-max-cavalera-troy-sanders/|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 the band recorded their self-titled debut album at Fortress Studio in Los Angeles with producer Josh Wilbur. It was released on May 13, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/killer-be-killed-featuring-cavalera-puciato-sanders-debut-album-cover-artwork-revealed/ Killer Be Killed Featuring Cavalera, Puciato, Sanders: Debut Album Cover Artwork Revealed] [[Blabbermouth.net]]. March 10, 2014. Retrieved on March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Black Queen ===

On June 15, 2018, the band announced that a new album called "[[Infinite Games]]" would be released on September 28th, as well as the formation of a label named [[Federal Prisoner]] with frequent visual collaborator and fine artist [[Jesse Draxler]]. Puciato called the label "as much an act of refusal as it is a statement of intent"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.revolvermag.com/music/black-queen-plot-new-album-infinite-games-tease-music-preview-video&lt;/ref&gt;, further elaborating in a blog post for [[Spotify]] that they would be "giving more than we would be gaining" by signing to an outside label, and that "everything I used to see as help, I suddenly saw as unnecessary at best, and a liability at worst."&lt;ref&gt;https://artists.spotify.com/blog/greg-puciato-why-my-band-decided-not-to-sign-with-a-label&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guest work ===
Puciato sang all of the vocals on the five-song, self-titled EP of [[digital hardcore]] band [[Error (band)|Error]] (founded by future NIN-member [[Atticus Ross]] and [[Epitaph Records]] owner and [[Bad Religion]] founding guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]].&lt;ref name=error&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 11, 2018|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/error-mw0000323915|website=[[Allmusic]]|title=Error {{!}} Error|first=MacKenzie |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position was mainly considered as temporary studio work, since the band never played any concerts.

In February 2011 Puciato and [[Devin Townsend]] publicly decided to collaborate after both being Tweeted by a fan expressing interest in seeing them work together. The track ended up being called "The Mighty Masturbator" and was released as part of Townsend's ''[[Deconstruction (Devin Townsend Project album)|Deconstruction]]'' album. Upon hearing the vocals, Townsend remarked "Ladies and Gentlemen, Greg Puciato just tore me a new asshole. Fucking hell…AWESOME".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/greg-puciato-rips-devin-townsend-new-asshole/|title=Greg Puciato Rips Devin Townsend New Asshole|publicationdate=February 25, 2011 |first=Chris |last=Harris |website=Gunshyassassin.com|accessdate=February 11, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302231052/http://gunshyassassin.com/news/greg-puciato-rips-devin-townsend-new-asshole/|archivedate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 [[Suicide Silence]] announced that Puciato had contributed guest vocals to a song called "Monster Within", on the album ''[[You Can't Stop Me (album)|You Can't Stop Me]]'', their first album after the death of vocalist [[Mitch Lucker]].&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite web|last=Chichester|first=Sammi |url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/suicide-silence-reveal-new-album-artwork-and-details-for-you-cant-stop-me.html|title=Suicide Silence Reveal New Album Artwork and Details for You Can’t Stop Me|work=revolvermag.com|accessdate=February 11, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002245/http://www.revolvermag.com/news/suicide-silence-reveal-new-album-artwork-and-details-for-you-cant-stop-me.html|archivedate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 Puciato appeared as a murderer in the [[Retox (band)|Retox]] video "Let's Not Keep in Touch", in which he chases and kills Retox guitar player Mike Crain with a baseball bat, before dumping him out of a van which [[Justin Pearson]] is driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/retoxs-lets-not-keep-in-touch|title=Retox's New Video Is a Good Old Fashioned Beatdown|work=NOISEY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 Puciato appeared as a "shadow figure" in the [[Drab Majesty]] video "39 By Design".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqn9fXzYWoo&lt;/ref&gt;

Puciato wrote the foreword for [[Jesse Draxler]]'s 2018 visual arts book "Misophonia". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Misophonia-Jesse-Draxler/dp/0999609904&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, views and controversies==
In a 2013 interview, Puciato said that he does not "have a filter" on his statements, live performances and songs' lyrics, and in the past he thought that this "was a plus".&lt;ref name="thevine.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 19, 2017|url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/the-dillinger-escape-plan-i-appreciate-that-you-appreciate-my-candidness-20130522-238044|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan: "I appreciate that you appreciate my candidness"|first=Toby|last=McCasker|publicationdate=May 22, 2013|website=www.thevine.com.au|8=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140502111316/http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/the-dillinger-escape-plan-i-appreciate-that-you-appreciate-my-candidness-20130522-238044|archivedate=May 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claims that his [[social media]] had become a "distraction" and their original intention was distorted, which was to have a closer relationship with his fans, and that led him to close them all in early 2013, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.&lt;ref name="thevine.com.au" /&gt; 

On July 23, 2010, Puciato's death was faked by bandmates [[Ben Weinman]] and [[Liam Wilson]], when they posted on their Twitter accounts that Puciato had passed in his sleep. Shortly after their [[Warped Tour]] set on July 23, [[Every Time I Die]] vocalist [[Keith Buckley]] tweeted, "If Greg Puciato is dead, then his corpse just played a great set on mainstage today." debunking the rumors of Puciato's death.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

He has been outwardly critical of both [[organized religion]] and mainstream politics, and of the relationship between the two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/dillinger-escape-plan-greg-puciato-criticizes-religion-role-politics-twitter-rant/|title=Dillinger Escape Plan's Greg Puciato Criticizes Religion's Role in Politics During Twitter Rant|work=Loudwire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been consistently supportive of [[LGBT]] rights, criticizing homophobia in metal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-dillinger-escape-plan-frontman-homophobia-in-metal-grosses-me-out/&lt;/ref&gt; releasing a shirt in support of LGBT rights with The Dillinger Escape Plan,&lt;ref&gt;http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/dillinger-escape-plan-are-baiting-homophobes-with-their-new-merch/&lt;/ref&gt; and debuting a video from [[The Black Queen (band)|The Black Queen]] on [[Out (magazine)|''Out'']]'s  magazine website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.out.com/music/2016/7/21/exclusive-black-queen-drops-dark-video-secret-scream&lt;/ref&gt;

Puciato has been outspoken on his opinions about other musicians, especially during his tenure with The Dillinger Escape Plan, criticizing artists such as [[Puddle of Mudd]],&lt;ref name=prindle/&gt; [[Fall Out Boy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 9, 2018|url=http://spotlightreport.net/on-the-spot-2/interview-greg-puciato-from-killer-be-killed|title=Interview: Greg Puciato From Killer Be Killed|publicationdate=December 22, 2014|website=Spotlightreport.net |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231191546/http://spotlightreport.net/on-the-spot-2/interview-greg-puciato-from-killer-be-killed|archivedate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jared Leto]] of [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], the latter whom he called a "[[Poseur|poser]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=March 7, 2011 |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/greg-puciato-owns-jared-leto/ |title=Greg Puciato Owns Jared Leto |website=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=December 7, 2012|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407112712/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/greg-puciato-owns-jared-leto/ |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Puciato dated former pornographic actress [[Jenna Haze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| last = Ferguson| first = Brandon| url = http://www.ocweekly.com/music/porn-star-jenna-haze-dating-dillinger-escape-plans-greg-puciato-6603816| title = Porn Star Jenna Haze Dating Dillinger Escape Plan's Greg Puciato (!)| website = [[OC Weekly]]| publicationdate = March 6, 2012| accessdate = February 8, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| last = Pasbani| first = Robert| url = http://www.metalinjection.net/gossip/so-dillinger-escape-plan-frontman-greg-puciato-is-totally-dating-porn-star-jenna-haze| title = So DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN Frontman Greg Puciato Is Totally Dating Porn Star Jenna Haze| website = [[Metal Injection]]| publicationdate = January 31, 2012| accessdate = February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2016, Puciato revealed that he has struggled with [[panic attack]]s and [[agoraphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-black-queen-interview-with-greg-puciato-i-d-never-had-a-panic-attack-before-i-thought-i-was-a6874776.html|title=The Black Queen interview with Greg Puciato: ‘I’d never had a panic attack before … I thought I was dying’|first=Remfry |last=Dedman |publicationdate=February 15, 2016|website=[[The Independent]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215142018/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-black-queen-interview-with-greg-puciato-i-d-never-had-a-panic-attack-before-i-thought-i-was-a6874776.html|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he detailed his vocal writing and recording processes. He stated: "I don't leave anything out of the realm of possibility when it comes to vocal style, as far as getting what I want. I'm more interested in capturing or amplifying the emotion of the song". Puciato compared writing a song to a "morphing straight line", rather than a "collection of parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/hear-mind-blowing-isolated-vocals-dillinger-escape-plans-limerent-death|title=Hear Mind-Blowing Isolated Vocals to Dillinger Escape Plan's "Limerent Death"|publicationdate= December 12, 2017 |website=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|deadurl=no|archivedate=December 12, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212221613/https://www.revolvermag.com/music/hear-mind-blowing-isolated-vocals-dillinger-escape-plans-limerent-death}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During The Dillinger Escape Plan's 2002 performance at the [[Reading Festival]] in the United Kingdom, Puciato defecated onstage, put it into a bag, and threw it into the crowd before smearing the rest onto himself, proclaiming "This is a bag of shit, I just wanted to show you this so you'll recognize it later on throughout the day" referring to other bands that would appear that day of the festival, especially Puddle of Mudd.&lt;ref name=prindle/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Fox|url=http://www.strictlyrandl.com/features/the-top-100-reading-bands-of-the-2000s-no-96-dillinger-escape-plan/|title=The Top 100 Reading Bands Of The 2000s No.96: Dillinger Escape Plan|date=|website=Strictlyrandl.com|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act caused much controversy and had them on the verge of being banned in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolling stone"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/dillinger-escape-plans-10-craziest-shows-w444546|title=Dillinger Escape Plan's 10 Craziest Shows|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=September 25, 2017|first=Dan |last=Epstein|publicationdate=October 14, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016004806/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/dillinger-escape-plans-10-craziest-shows-w444546|archivedate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admission requirements ==
Students are not required to have a [[high school]] diploma to gain early admission and start taking courses at the school.  Students are not required to take the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] or [[SAT]] tests to gain admission.  The school does have an application form that must be completed and submitted with a $150 fee.

The school grants a "Specialized Associate Degree Program" which it calls, "Associate of Applied Science Degree of Management and Administration".  The school also offers "Continuing Education Certificate Programs".  There also exist a number of "Public Workshops and Corporate Programs" which are short courses on specific topics.  The school also provides [[World Institute of Scientology Enterprises|WISE]] certificate programs; WISE being a Scientology-affiliated business group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/world/news/wise/index.html Enabling Groups to Flourish and Prosper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704133824/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/world/news/wise/index.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Illyrians'', 1992, p. 245, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}. "...Illyrian deities are named on monuments of the Roman era, some in equation with gods of the classical pantheon (see figure 34)."&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no single most prominent Illyrian god and there would have been much variation between individual [[Illyrian tribes]]. The Illyrians did not develop a uniform cosmology on which to center their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "Unlike Celts, Dacians, Thracians or Scythians, there is no indication that Illyrians developed a uniform cosmology on which their religious practice was centred. An etymology of the Illyrian name linked with serpent would, if it is true, fit with the many representations of..."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some deities are known exclusively from [[Istria]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "...dominant Illyrian deity and some were evidently worshipped only in particular regions. Thus several deities occur only in Istria, including Eia, Malesocus, Boria and Iria. Anzotica was the Liburnian Venus and appears in the traditional image of the classical goddess."&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''Eia'', ''Malesocus'', ''Boria'' and ''Iria''. In [[Liburnia]], ''Anzotica'' is identified with [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]. Other local theonyms&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "Other local deities were Latra, Sentona and the nymph Ica, praying in relief sculpture), Knez 1974 (ritual vessel), Baçe 1984 (temple architecture in Illyrian Albania)."&lt;/ref&gt; include  ''Latra'', ''Sentona'' and ''Ica''. ''Bindus'', identified with [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]], was worshipped among the [[Japodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "...including altars dedicated by chiefs of the Japodes at the shrine of [[Bindus]] Neptunus at a spring near Bihaé (see figure 30). The first reported contact between Japodes and Romans occurred..."&lt;/ref&gt; Further north, the hot springs of [[Topusko]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "North of the Japodes, the altars to Vidasus and Thana dedicated at the hot springs of Topusko reveal the local Roman Illyrians..."&lt;/ref&gt; were dedicated to ''Vidasus'' and ''Thana'', identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "...identities of Silvanus and Diana, a familiar combination on many dedications in the territory of the Delmatae."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. From the eastern Balkans, the cult of the [[Thracian horseman]] spread to Illyria during the early centuries CE. The god ''Medaurus''&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "...the short cloak streaming out behind. The Illyrian town Rhizon (Risinium) on the Gulf of Kotor had its protective deity Medaurus..."&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned in a dedication at [[Lambaesis]] in Africa by a Roman senator and native of [[Risinium]] appears to be identical to the horseman, being described as riding on horseback and carrying a lance. The [[Delmatae]] had ''Armatus'' as a god of war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes. "...Armatus at Delminium (Duvno) who was evidently a war god of the Delmatae, and the Latin Liber who appears with the..."&lt;/ref&gt; The god ''[[En (Illyrian god)|En]]'' was also worshipped by Illyrians.&lt;ref name= "Lurker"&gt;Lurker, Manfred. ''The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons'', Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library, 2005. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; ''En'' was demoted to demonic status following the arrival of Christianity in Illyria, and continues to be used in the [[Albanian language]] to refer to Thursday ({{lang-sq|Enjte}}).&lt;ref name="Lurker"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13084">Indigenous churches are churches suited to local culture and led by local Christians. There have been two main [[Protestant]] strategies proposed for the creation of indigenous churches:

# '''Indigenization''': Foreign missionaries create well-organized churches and then hand them over to local converts. The foreign mission is generally seen as a scaffolding which must be removed once the fellowship of believers is functioning properly. Missionaries provide teaching, pastoral care, sacraments, buildings, finance and authority, and train local converts to take over these responsibilities. Thus the church ''becomes'' indigenous. It ''becomes'' self-supporting, self-propagating and self-governing.
# '''Indigeneity''': Foreign missionaries do not create churches, but simply help local converts develop their own spiritual gifts and leadership abilities and gradually develop their own churches. Missionaries provide teaching and pastoral care alone. The church is thus indigenous ''from the start''. It ''has always been'' self-supporting, self-propagating and self-governing.

[[Henry Venn (Church Missionary Society)|Henry Venn]] (Anglican, [[Church Missionary Society]]) (1796–1873){{sfn|Shenk|1985|p=25}} and [[Rufus Anderson]] (Congregationalist, American Board) (1796–1880) simultaneously developed a strategy of Indigenization in response to the extreme paternalism exercised by western [[missionaries]] of the early 19th century, particularly in Asia. They perceived that "rice" Christians were completely dependent on missionaries and loyal to the church only as long as they were receiving free food. In exchange, missionaries expected complete loyalty from the "natives" and resisted giving up authority and control. The system was thought to foster an unhealthy parent–child relationship between the missionaries and national believers.

[[Anthony Norris Groves]] (1795–1853){{sfn|Dann|2005|p=198}} attempted to avoid this problem in pioneer areas by guarding against any form of dependency from the start. He chose to represent no foreign denomination or missionary society, and he encouraged full co-operation between all [[Protestant]] missionaries for the encouragement of indigenous initiatives. He predated [[Roland Allen]] by eighty years as an advocate of Indigeneity rather than Indigenization. Looking directly to God for guidance and provision, he was a formative influence on [[Hudson Taylor]] and the "[[faith mission]]" movement, but the direct influence of his indigenous strategy is more evident in the remarkable movements associated with [[Bakht Singh]] in India and [[Watchman Nee]] in China.{{sfnm |1a1=Dann |1y=2005 |2a1=Dann |2y=2007}}

[[File:Hudson Taylor.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hudson Taylor]]]]
[[John Livingstone Nevius]] (1829–1893) served as a Presbyterian missionary to China in the late 1800s.{{sfn|Hunt|1991|pp=120–122}} After questioning the methods of western missionaries of his time, he wrote a book published in 1886, ''The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches'', which called for discarding old-style missions and the adoption of his new plan to foster an independent, self-supporting local church. He criticized the missionaries' practice of paying national workers out of mission funds, believing the healthy local church should be able to support its own local workers.

[[Hudson Taylor]] (1832–1905) was a Protestant [[missionary]] from [[England]] to [[China]] and founder of the [[China Inland Mission]]. He became disillusioned with other Protestant missionaries in China that lived in compounds and employed indigenous people as servants. Taylor subsequently learned local dialects, adopted local dress, and went up and down rivers in China preaching. He sought to distance himself from any paternal organizations or denominations{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} in favour of "[[faith mission]]s"{{sfn|Kane|1984|p=75}} which relied on the support of nationals and individuals. He also sought to train indigenous leaders to lead churches and mission stations in China, rather than have them run by foreigners.

[[Dixon Edward Hoste]] (1861–1946) succeeded Hudson Taylor as director of the [[China Inland Mission]]. Hoste is credited with making the Chinese churches apply the [[three-self principle]] of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. This threefold motto was later adopted by the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] after missionaries were expelled from China.

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Bishop Nicolas Zamora.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicolás Zamora]]]]
[[Roland Allen]] (1868–1947) also attempted to apply indigenous church principles to the missions of his day. After serving as an Anglican missionary in China from 1895 to 1903, he returned to England and spent 40 years writing about missions principles. Two of his books, ''Missionary Methods: St. Paul's or Ours?'' (1912) and ''The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church: And Causes that Hinder It,'' are still in print.

[[Alice Luce]] (1873–1955), first an Anglican missionary in India, and subsequently an Assemblies of God missionary among Hispanics along the US–Mexico border, was influenced by Allen's theory of missions and in 1921 she wrote a series of articles, "Paul's Missionary Methods", for the ''[[Pentecostal Evangel]]''. Due to her advocacy, indigenous church principles became normative for Assemblies of God missions during the early part of the 20th century.

[[Nicolás Zamora]] (1875–1914) founded on 28 February 1909 the first Indigenous Evangelical Church in the Philippines. Behind the founding of the IEMELIF, nationalist and subsequent independence movements. Filipinos wanted full autonomy, including in the realm of religion, as the 333 years of Spanish rule were marked by the Catholic Church's control over both temporal and spiritual affairs. His vision and motivation was faith in God's providence, and belief that the Filipino was capable of erecting a self-sustaining, autonomous, and self-propagating evangelical church. In 1903, he was assigned to be a pastor at Knox Memorial Church becoming the first Filipino Protestant pastor. Zamora took up law at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] where he honed his skills in debate and oration, then entered a seminary in Shanghai.

[[John Wesley Haley]] (1878–1951), [[Free Methodist Church in Canada]] missionary to [[South Africa]] 1902–1909, 1917–1934, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]] 1934–1946. Haley left South Africa after several decades of ministry disillusioned with traditional mission practice and initiated new ministry in Burundi following the indigenous mission approach, involving Burundian converts in the leadership, decision-making process "from the beginning". He felt a special kinship with the work of Nevius and Allen, despite limited understanding from his mission board.

Melvin Hodges (1909–1988), an [[Assemblies of God]] missionary to [[Nicaragua]],{{sfn|McGee|1998|p=20}} again popularized the idea in the 1950s with his book, ''On the Mission Field: The Indigenous Church.'' He defined the indigenous church as "a native church&amp;nbsp;... which shares the life of the country in which it is planted and finds itself ready to govern itself, support itself, and reproduce itself." Hodges believed that foreign money creates dependence and establishes paternalistic patterns within mission movements, leading to an unhealthy, anemic church. His experience as a missionary no doubt influenced his presentation of the [[three-self principle]]. He emphasized the need for flexibility and tailoring the principles to fit the need of the local believers.

In his book ''Transforming Mission'',{{sfn|Bosch|2011}} [[David Bosch]] (1929–1992), a {{citation needed span |date=August 2018 |text=Dutch Reformed}} [[missiology|missiologist]],{{sfn|Anderson|2011}} echoed [[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul G. Hiebert]]'s suggestion that a ''fourth'' "self" needed to be added to the Venn–Anderson framework: "self-theologizing".{{sfnm |1a1=Bosch |1y=2011 |1pp=460–462 |2a1=Cathcart |2a2=Nichols |2y=2009 |2p=211}} Though much self-theologizing had already taken place in mission churches, much of it has been left unnoticed or considered [[syncretistic]].{{sfn|Bosch|2011|p=462}} Bosch suggested that in order to not fall into the two extremes of [[syncretism]] or "[[Babylonian captivity]]", self-theologizing must be in dialogue with the universal [[invisible church]].  Only then would a truly indigenous church exist.{{sfn|Bosch|1997|pp=450–457}}

{{Islam in Australia}}

The '''Islamic Research and Educational Academy''' (IREA) is an independent Islamic [[dawah]] organisation based in [[Hoppers Crossing, Victoria]]. It has been categorised as 'extremist' by some groups.&lt;ref name = "Melbourne University"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/melbourne-university-hosts-extremist-muslim-group-in-the-wake-of-sydney-shooting/news-story/ef3f4bbabf34db37dabbf70f78de4f65  |title= Melbourne university hosts extremist Muslim group in the wake of Sydney shooting|author=|date=5 October 2015|work=News Ltd|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Sunni]]-based and says, "We use religion to unite, where others may seek to use it to divide".  It is led by Waseem Razvi.

==Waseem Razvi==

The founding President of IREA, Waseem Razvi was born in 1981&lt;ref name = saudi/&gt; and brought up in [[Saudi Arabia]] by parents of Indian origin. In 2004, he moved to Australia for higher studies. He obtained a master's degree in information systems from the Melbourne Institute of Technology in 2007. He quit from his job in 2010 to engage fully in [[Dawah]] works.

Razvi has been quoted as describing Australia, "As the largest multicultural country in the world, Australia accommodates people from around 200 nationalities. It is an open migrant country that embraces people of all cultures and religions with open hands and hearts" and that "Australian society gives followers of different faiths every opportunity to propagate their religion peacefully." "I am delivering sermons in certain churches in which I try to present the true picture of Islam as well as to remove misgivings, with a focus on major similarities and commonalities of Islam and Christianity.”&lt;ref name=saudi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20130911179986 |title=Young preacher lauds Australia’s strength to embrace all faiths |author=Cheruppa, Hassan |date=11 September 2013 |work=[[Saudi Gazette]] |accessdate=21 April 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004063621/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20130911179986 |archivedate= 4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razvi has met with Egyptian Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in [[Qatar]],&lt;ref name = "CT1"/&gt; who has said he supports IREA's dawah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/newscustom/melbourne-islamic-conference-organiser-waseem-razvi-met-notorious-sheikh-20150325-1m7le9.html  |title=Melbourne Islamic conference organiser Waseem Razvi met notorious sheikh |author=Bucci, Nino|date=25 March 2015|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razvi has travelled to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar]] to raise funds and to lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/terror/school-funding-to-pay-for-radical-muslim-preachers/story-fnpdbcmu-1227074423698  |title=School funding to pay for radical Muslim preachers |author=Baxendale, Rachel|date=30 September 2014|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said in Saudi Arabia that there is a group in Australia, [[Q Society of Australia|Q Society]] , founded by Christian and Jewish zealots, with the slogan, 'Muslims should be kicked out of Australia.'&lt;ref name = saudi/&gt;

Razvi is a supporter of the late Islamic preacher, [[Ahmed Deedat]],&lt;ref name = "Melbourne University"/&gt;&lt;ref name = saudi/&gt; whose books have been banned from sale in France for being, "violently anti-Western, anti-Semitic and inciting to racial hate."&lt;ref name = "Melbourne University"/&gt;

==The Australian Islamic Peace Conference==

IREA runs ''Australian Islamic Peace Conferences'' (AIPC) which the [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] has reported as a "controversial event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/hate-preachers-in-australia-uncovered-after-fiery-lateline-interview/story-fnh81ifq-1227086138502  |title=Hate preachers in Australia uncovered after fiery Lateline interview |date=10 October 2014|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]| accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razvi has described the three main goals of the ''Australian Islamic Peace Conferences'' was to, "achieving unity among Muslims, build bridges of understanding between Muslims and Australian community, and open a door of communications for Muslims with the authorities. Organization of AIPC was a culmination of my endeavors to achieve these goals and it was a very successful one."&lt;ref name = saudi/&gt;

The advertised main speaker for the 2013 Peace Conference was [[Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/boy-5-to-headline-islamic-peace-conference/story-fnj4aog3-1227275803182  |title=Boy, 5, to headline Islamic ‘peace conference’ |date=24 March 2015|work=[[News Ltd]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, "has called for violent jihad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/fiery-imam-invited-to-speak-here-20121211-2b7td.html  |title=Fiery imam invited to speak here |author=Zwartz, Barney|date=12 December 2012|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is alleged to have made [[Antisemitic]] remarks.&lt;ref name = "2013 conference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2Faa257c64-8320-4cab-964d-8f041853ad36%2F0160;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2Faa257c64-8320-4cab-964d-8f041853ad36%2F0000%22  |title=Australian Islamic Peace Conference |author=Senator Bernardi|date=12 March 2013|work=[[Australian Parliament House]]|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the conference Al-Sudais was denied a visa to enter Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/islam-forum-speakers-shrouded-in-secrecy/story-fn59niix-1227278760932  |title=Islam forum speakers shrouded in secrecy |author=Baxendale, Rachel|date=26 March 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the 2013 conference was [[Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia|Abu Hamza]] who has been accused of telling men, "how to beat their wives".&lt;ref name = "2013 conference"/&gt;

For the 2013 Peace Conference, held at the [[Melbourne Showgrounds]], Christians from various churches initially had approval to hire a stall to give away Bibles.  The approval was subsequently withdrawn.  The explanation given was, "because it would be unsafe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.menzieshouse.com.au?p=1360  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924180307/http://www.menzieshouse.com.au?p=1360  |dead-url=yes  |archive-date=24 September 2015  |title=Not even true to themselves |author=Crocker, Geoff |date=16 March 2013|work=Menzies House|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of IREA's conferences was banned by the [[Melbourne University]] because it required gender segregation of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/academic-calls-for-end-to-ritualised-humiliation/story-e6frgcjx-1226629597535  |title=Academic calls for end to 'ritualised humiliation' |author=Baxendale, Rachel|date=26 April 2013|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/melbourne-uni-cancels-inter-faith-event-by-islamic-research-and-educational-academy/story-e6frg6nf-1226640997698  |title=Melbourne Uni cancels 'inter-faith' event by Islamic Research and Educational Academy |author=Baxendale, Rachel|date=13 May 2013|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2015 conference, a young boy impersonated Islamic tele-evangelist [[Zakir Naik]] (Razvi's role model)&lt;ref name = saudi/&gt; who is banned in Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/03/30/jews-were-behind-911-attack-says-msian-preacher/  |title=Jews were behind 9/11 attack, implies Malaysian preacher|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the conference keynote speaker [[Hussein Yee]] has implied that the Jews were behind the [[September 11 attacks|2001 World Trade Centre attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/islamic-conference-keynote-speaker-says-september-11-not-unjust/story-e6frg6nf-1227282382336  |title=Islamic conference keynote speaker says September 11 not unjust |author=Baxendale, Rachel|date=28 March 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 2017 conference is entitled, ''[[Quran]] The book that shook the world''.  Speakers include [[Shady Alsuleiman]] and [[Keysar Trad]].  In the promotional flyers, the three females have their faces replaced with black ink, while the faces of all other 12 male speakers are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/womens-faces-hidden-on-australian-islamic-peace-conference-flyer-sparking-outrage/news-story/565ef11479ce53341a1dc9b8fd17fbc6  |title=Women’s faces hidden on Australian Islamic Peace Conference flyer, sparking outrage |date=8 February 2017|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4201898/Islamic-Peace-Conference-hides-faces-women-flyer.html  |title='It's backward and reduces them to faceless beings': Muslim conference under fire for deleting faces of female speakers on promotional flyer |author=Piotrowski, Daniel|date=8 February 2017|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With organisers saying it was done to protect the women from being, "targeted in the streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/rita-panahi/bizarre-alliance-sees-regressive-left-tolerating-islamist-bigotry/news-story/5dcc28f70de23c0740633b55255673d5  |title=Bizarre alliance sees Regressive Left tolerating Islamist bigotry |author=[[Rita Panahi|Panahi, Rita]]|date=10 February 2017|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, one of the female speakers, Monique Toohey pulled out after seeing her face blacked out, saying,  "I didn't feel like it aligned with my values, and certainly not in a way that I choose to represent myself publicly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3aw.com.au/news/islamic-conference-under-fire-for-a-flyer-which-doesnt-show-female-speakers-20170209-gu9gqz.html  |title=Islamic Conference under fire for a flyer which doesn't show female speakers |date=9 February 2017|work=3AW|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4210590/Speaker-pulls-Melbourne-Islamic-Peace-conference.html  |title='A roll my eyes moment': Female Muslim leader pulls out of Islamic conference - after organisers deleted women's faces from 'backwards' promotional flyer  |author=Piotrowski, Daniel|date=10 February 2017|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia==

The ''Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia Inc'' is co-located with IREA. Razvi is the secretary of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d01b8d2733813970c-800wi  |title=Association extract for Council for the Prevention of Islamophia |work=Consumer Affairs Victoria|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose is to, "to protect and defend the Muslim community from discrimination based on their Islamic faith and/or race by multiple means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-not-for-profits/incorporated-associations/search-for-an-incorporated-association?id=9b60b348-46e6-e411-80ed-c4346bada684  |title=Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia |work=Consumer Affairs Victoria|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An Australian speaking tour by the Dutch-American activist and author [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], was proposed for April 2017.  The ''Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia'' said there would be 5,000 protesters outside the [[Festival Hall (Melbourne)|Festival Hall]] in Melbourne if she was to speak at that venue,&lt;ref name = "tour"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/ayaan-hirsi-ali-islam-critic-and-author-cancels-australian-tour/news-story/130e9e7659bcc8de20f4cb03fd6c164d  |title=Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali cancels tour |author=Maly, Paul|date=4 April 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because, "she is an extremist who condones violence and radicalises people."&lt;ref name = "CT1"/&gt; Her Australian tour was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/34888839/islam-critic-hirsi-ali-cancels-aust-tour |title=Islam critic Hirsi Ali cancels Aust tour |author=Tasker, Belinda|date=3 April 2017|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "tour"/&gt;

Waseem Razvi and the IREA have been involved in proposals for [[Masjid|mosques]] in the Melbourne suburbs of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]],&lt;ref name="IREA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/radicals-trip-in-race-to-put-out-the-begging-bowl/news-story/2c74e3ed3856c2ad9109e2a4d786b784  |title=Radicals trip in race to put out the begging bowl |author=Blaxendale, Rachel|date=16 July 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melton, Victoria (suburb)|Melton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melton-protests-pro-and-antimuslim-groups-clash-20151122-gl531g.html  |title=Melton protests: Pro and anti-Muslim groups clash |author=Webb, Carolyn|date=|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[City of Casey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/04/05/19/31/residents-say-they-arent-racist-they-just-dont-want-new-mosque  |title=Residents say they aren't racist, they just don't want new mosque|work=9News|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groenveld first began providing information about groups she referred to as cults to the public and counselling affected individuals in 1979.&lt;ref name="About Jan" /&gt; In 1980, she founded the ''Freedom in Christ'' [[Christian ministry|ministry]], whose purpose was to counsel former members of controversial groups, and provide information about coercive religious sects.&lt;ref name="Guilliatt1996" /&gt;

Jan founded the Cult Awareness and Information Centre (CAIC), in 1990.&lt;ref name="About Jan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilliatt1996" /&gt; Groenveld's CAIC website was started in 1991.&lt;ref name=WhoIsCAIC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groenveld|first1=Jan|title=Who on Earth is the Cult Awareness &amp; Information Centre??|url=http://cac.ggcs.net.au/contributions.htm|publisher=Cult Awareness &amp; Information Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015033158/http://cac.ggcs.net.au/contributions.htm|archivedate=2009-10-15 }}{{Self-published source|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groenveld first met [[Steven Hassan]] in 1993, when she brought him to [[Brisbane, Australia]] from the United States for a seminar.  Hassan educated Groenveld as to the "serious potential for doubt and lack of veracity in [[satanic ritual abuse]] stories".&lt;ref name="Guilliatt1996" /&gt;

==Cited as "cult expert"==
In 1999 a [[Brisbane]] tabloid, the [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] interviewed Groenveld on the likelihood that more [[destructive cult]]s would show up in Australia during 1999 before the new Millennium. The publication titled Groenveld a "cult specialist"&lt;ref name="Sunday"&gt;Griffith, C. (10 January 1999) "Doom Cults Aussie Alert", ''Sunday Mail'' [[Brisbane, Australia]], pages 1, 4.&lt;br /&gt;However, Queensland cult specialist Jan Groenveld said the doomsday merchants were more likely to come to Australia. "If it's a biblical cult, they may go to Israel, but eastern, Nostradamus-based and UFO-based cults believe the southern hemisphere, in particular Australia, may suffer less or later damage as the end approaches."&lt;/ref&gt; two other Australian publications, the [[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]], a Brisbane tabloid, and [[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] a tabloid in [[Hobart]] titled her a "cult expert."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culticstudiesreview.org/csr_news/csr_newsgrp/twelve_tribes_2002_02_31.htm Twelve Tribes Café in Australia], Griffith, Chris; Watt, Amanda (26 December 2001), ''Courier Mail'', Australia, page 7.&lt;br /&gt;Brisbane cult expert Jan Groenveld said that the group's commercial operations may look benign, but that the public should be wary if approached by cult members with invitations to visit their community.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Binet, Harriet (2 November 2000) "Cult Alert", ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'', (Australia), page 1.&lt;br /&gt;A Brisbane cult expert Jan Groenveld has worked with the families of members involved with Infinity.  She described it as a cult which used subtle mind control to manipulate people for financial gain.  "They cut off their family if there is any opposition," Mrs Groenveld said. "People become separated from families and become totally absorbed. "They really get hooked on the leader. No one that's in a cult knows that it's a cult.  "It's not until you start to see that things are wrong that you can see what you're in."  Mrs Groenveld, who has counselled victims and families of cults for more than 20 years, said isolating people from their family and urging them to "stay away from unbelief" was a common tactic.
&lt;/ref&gt; She warned the publication about a cult called the [[Twelve Tribes Mission]], believing them to possess militant tendencies.  She warned: ''"There are people out there all over the place who would like to be another Jim Jones"'', referring to the [[Peoples Temple]] suicides.&lt;ref name="Sunday" /&gt;

==Work for Church of Scientology==
In 1984 Weiland was a member of the Church of Scientology's [[Religious Technology Center]], and performed work for the organization in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Atack | first =Jon | title =[[A Piece of Blue Sky|A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L.

In an interview at the National Press Club in 1994, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' asked Weiland and Scientology President [[Heber Jentzsch]] about the Church of Scientology's practice of investigating reporters who write about Scientology.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tobin120694" /&gt; "First of all, we don't do that. There's no institutional or organized campaign or effort or action ongoing to go after a reporter," lied Weiland.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt; When asked about a discrepancy after Church of Scientology officials confirmed in 1998 that their attorneys had hired a firm to investigate a reporter for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', Weiland said: "It's not a personal thing. Every time a reporter steps out of his way to create damage to the church ... then, of course, it's gloves off."&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt; He said that the ''Boston Herald'' reporter's articles were inaccurate, and the Church of Scientology decided to investigate the individual in order to determine what "vested interest" he was working for and what "sinister motive" he had.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">The terms '''liberal Anglo-Catholicism''' and '''liberal Anglo-Catholic''' refer to people, beliefs and practices within [[Anglicanism]] that affirm [[liberal Christian]] perspectives while maintaining the traditions culturally associated with [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. The word ''liberal'' in this context refers to both theological and [[social liberalism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The social liberalism of liberal Anglo-Catholics can be seen in an association with [[Christian socialism]].{{sfn|Dearmer|1907}}{{verification failed|date=August 2018}} With regard to Christian socialism, [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] in 1849 said, "I seriously believe that Christianity is the only foundation of [[Socialism]], and that a true Socialism is the necessary result of a sound Christianity."{{sfn|Maurice|1849}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}} Generally, liberal Anglo-Catholics will be [[social justice]]–minded.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Jonathan Daniels]], a seminarian of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]] who died during the [[civil rights movement]], is a modern martyr for liberal Anglo-Catholics.

Liberal Anglo-Catholics allow modern knowledge and research to inform their use of reason.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Relationship between religion and science|Science and religion]], for instance, are held to be legitimate and different methodologies of revealing God's truth.{{sfn|Muray|2007}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}} This also directly affects the liberal Anglo-Catholic's reading of [[Bible|scripture]], [[ecclesiastical history]], and general methodology of [[Christian theology|theology]]. A metaphor is that theology for liberal Anglo-Catholics is a "dance" that allows people to slowly grow in an understanding of God.{{sfn|Johnson|2005}}

In the UK the [[Affirming Catholicism]] movement is a home to many liberal Anglo-Catholics.{{sfn|Zook|2014|p=120}} Examples of liberal Anglo-Catholics include the former [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] and [[Michael Ramsey]].{{sfn|Brittain|McKinnon|2011|p=359}} [[Westcott House, Cambridge]], is a [[Church of England]] theological college in the tradition of liberal Anglo-Catholicism.{{sfn|Coles|2014|ps=: "I had to find somewhere to train and it wasn't easy to decide which college to pick. Most, from the bishop down, said Westcott House, the liberal catholic theological college in Cambridge."}}{{sfn|Heck|2014|p=2}}

This is a '''list of ancient monoliths''' found in all types of [[Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman buildings]].

It contains [[monolith]]s
*quarried, but not moved 
*quarried and moved
*quarried, moved and lifted clear off the ground into their position ([[architrave]]s etc.)
*quarried, moved and erected in an upright position ([[column]]s etc.)

Transporting was done by land or water (or a combination of both), in the later case often by special-built ships such as [[obelisk carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Wirsching|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For lifting operations, [[Crane (machine)#History|ancient cranes]] were employed since ca. 515 BC,&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 7, 16"/&gt; such as in the [[Trajan's Column#Erection|construction of Trajan's Column]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=419–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be stressed that all numbers are estimations since only in the rarest cases have monoliths been actually weighed. Rather, weight is calculated by multiplying [[volume]] by [[density]]. The main source, J. J. Coulton, assumes 2.75 t/m³ for [[marble]] and 2.25 t/m³ for other stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Coulton|1974|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an explanation of the large margin of error, which often leads to widely differing numbers, see [[List of megalithic sites#Calculating the weight of megaliths|these introductory remarks]].

At the April 1995 [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] announced the creation of a new leadership position known as the '''area authority'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/05/this-work-is-concerned-with-people “This Work Is Concerned with People”], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1995, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, area authorities were renamed '''area authority seventies''' and ordained to the office of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]]. The church announced that these seventies would become members of a Quorum of the Seventy based upon the geographic region to which they were assigned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/05/may-we-be-faithful-and-true “May We Be Faithful and True”], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the title "area authority seventy" was shortened to '''area seventy''', which is the title currently in use.

== Formation of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Quorums of the Seventy ==
When area authority seventies were first called in 1997, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Quorums were created. At that time, the Third Quorum consisted of those seventies living in the church's Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Pacific [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]]. The Fourth Quorum comprised those living in the Mexico, Central America, and South America areas. The Fifth Quorum of the Seventy comprised those living in the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/05/news-of-the-church/new-leaders-called-three-new-quorums-of-seventy-formed News of the Church: New Leaders Called, 3 New Quorums of the Seventy Formed], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy ==
In July 2004, the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy was organized from the Fifth Quorum because the number of quorum members exceeded 70, the number of members prescribed by scripture. The Fifth Quorum then comprised area seventies serving in the church's North America Northwest, North America West, Idaho, Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas, while the Sixth Quorum comprised those living in the North America Central, North America East, North America Northeast, North America Southeast, and North America Southwest areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/07/news-of-the-church/first-presidency-announces-creation-of-the-sixth-quorum-of-the-seventy?lang=eng News of the Church: First Presidency Announces creation of the Sixth Quorum of the Seventy], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the Seventh and Eighth Quorums of the Seventy ==
In July 2005, the church announced that, due to the great distance members of the Third and Fourth Quorums of the Seventy had to travel to meet as quorums, the Seventh and Eighth Quorums of the Seventy would be created. The Third Quorum included those area seventies living in the church's Africa Southeast, Africa West, Europe Central, Europe East, and Europe West areas. The Fourth Quorum included those members living in the Brazil North, Brazil South, Chile, and South America South areas. The Fourth Quorum included those living in the Central America, Mexico North, Mexico South, South America North, and South America West areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/07/news-of-the-church/seventh-and-eighth-quorums-of-the-seventy-announced?lang=eng News of the Church: Seventh and Eighth Quorums of the Seventy Announced], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas consolidated over the years ==
In the intervening years, along with the changes announced in quorum composition, the church's [[Area (LDS Church)|geographic areas]] were consolidated and realigned. Now each quorum is composed of area seventies in the following areas:
* '''Third Quorum: '''Africa Southeast, Africa West, Europe, and Europe East areas.
* '''Fourth Quorum: '''Central America, Mexico,  South America Northwest, and Caribbean areas.
* '''Fifth Quorum: '''Idaho, North America Northwest, North America West, Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas.
* '''Sixth Quorum: '''North America Central, North America Northeast, North America Southeast, North America Southwest areas.
* '''Seventh Quorum: '''Brazil and South America South areas.
* '''Eighth Quorum: '''Asia, Asia North, Pacific, and Philippines areas.

'''Mbwiri''' is a [[Central Africa]]n [[demon]] who is said to possess people. Those he possesses would usually be diagnosed with [[epilepsy]] by a doctor.

When such a possession occurs, the [[shaman]] is called. A hut is built in which the afflicted resides along with the shaman and his assistants until he is cured. For ten days or a fortnight these people eat and drink at the expense of the patient's relatives, and dance to the music of flute and drum. Mbwiri is said to abhor good living, and this is the best way to drive him out. The patient will be the only one who knows that he is possessed.  The patient also dances until the epileptic fits come on. When he is pronounced cured, he builds a little [[Fetishism|fetish]] house,  and thenceforth avoids certain kinds of food and performs certain duties. Sometimes, however, the process appears to result in madness, and some patients run away into the bush.

[[File:Nicky Imber working on head.jpg|thumb|250px|Nicky Imber working on sculpture]]

After escaping the Nazi concentration camp in [[Dachau]],&lt;ref name="TheDaily"&gt;The Daily Journal Friday September 22, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he pledged to dedicate his art to perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust. Among his more famous works are "[[The Hope (Imber)|The Hope]]" and "The Love of Torah". His work can be seen around the world, in [[Northern Israel]], the [[United States]], and the Venezuelan Museum of Natural History in Caracas.

== Biography==
Nicky Imber was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Vienna, he drew anti-Nazi caricatures for Jewish student publications.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni"&gt;Meir Hareuveni, Ma'ariv newspaper, September 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; After several thwarted attempts by the family to leave Vienna, in 1938, in the wake of the '[[Anschluss]]', Imber was deported to [[Dachau]].&lt;ref name="TheDaily" /&gt; Witnessing the murders of family and friends, he plotted his escape. Using skills he had learned in art school, he made a face mask out of bread and sand, stole a Nazi soldier's uniform and walked out the front gate unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Carmiel]],1981 Yad Vashem Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he boarded a ship headed to [[Haifa]]. The ship's passengers were refused entry by the British mandatory authorities and imprisoned in a detention camp in [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1943, Imber worked out a deal with the authorities for his release by joining the British Army, serving as a war artist and a dental assistant in East Africa. After the war, he opened an art school in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and worked as a photographer and a safari guide.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1949 to 1954, he lived in [[Venezuela]], where he was contracted to do an East African [[Diorama]] series. The National Museum added an entire wing to display it.&lt;ref name="VeVenezuela"&gt;Ve Venezuela Vol.2 No.56 April–May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this period he got married and had a daughter Raquel, who accompanied and assisted him.

In 1959, Imber was commissioned to create sculptures and dioramas for the Haifa Prehistory Museum at Gan Ha-em in [[Haifa]], Israel. In 1960 he returned to Venezuela to restaured the Phelps series of Dioramas for the Museum in Caracas.&lt;ref name="VeVenezuela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münstersche Zeitung Friday August 22, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1961 and 1971 he travelled extensively around Europe and after establishing an international name for himself, returned to the United States. In New York he became famous for his realistic oil paintings of portraits of [[Aga Khan]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Sir Richard Burton]] and [[Simon Bolivar]].&lt;ref name="TheSun"&gt;The Sun Reporter Tuesday July 31, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Venezuela in 1976, Imber created huge sculptures of prehistoric animals, forming one of the world's largest historical animal parks. During this period he also created realistic sculptures of famous Venezuelans for the country's National Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;El Nacional, Caracas, Thursday, April 22, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In 1978, Imber spent three years designing and building a Holocaust memorial park at the entrance to the city of [[Karmiel]] located in the Galilee, entitled 'From Holocaust to Resurrection.'&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt; Imber also established animal theme playgrounds around the city. [[File:Nicky Imber building "Hope" in Carmiel, Israel.JPG|thumb|Nicky Imber building "Hope" in Carmiel, Israel]]

In the 1980s, Imber established residence in Karmiel, Israel. In Israel he was inspired to create highly emotional, life like collections.

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''''Pratima''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिमा}}) is a step or a stage marking the spiritual rise of a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|lay person]] (''shravak''). There are eleven such steps called ''pratima''.&lt;ref&gt;Shravakachar Sangrah, Five Volumes, Hiralal Jain Shastri, Jain Sanskruti Samrakshak Sangh Solapur, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After having passed the eleven steps, one is no longer a ''sravaka'', but a ''muni'' ([[Jain monasticism|monk]]).

Rules prescribed for laymen are divided into twelve ''vrata'' (vows) and eleven ''pratimas'' (steps){{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=77}} and are described in several codes of conduct ([[Ratnakaranda|''shravakacharas'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras By R. Williams&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pratimas'' are mentioned in several ancient texts like [[Ratnakaranda Shravakachara]] (2nd century A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Upasakdashang aur uska Shravakachar, Subhash Kothari, Agam Ahimsa Samta Evam Prakrit Sansthan, Udaipur  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

#Darshan Pratima (Right perspective): The worship of the true God (i.e., tirthanhara,) guru (preceptor) and shastra (Scripture), and the avoidance of gambling, meat-eating, drinking (wine), adultery, hunting, thieving and debauchery.

Ashadhara in his Sagara-Dharmammrata (13th century) has groups the 11 steps into three ranks.

*Grahin (jaghanya: first to sixth pratima)
*Varnin (madhyama: seventh to ninth pratima): At this point the householder is termed a [[Varni]]. The pratimas are:
*Bhikshuka (uttama: tenth and eleventh pratima): At this point a person depends on others for daily survival.

Those who have ascended to the eleventh pratima are termed [[Kshullaka]] (with two articles of clothing) and [[Jain Muni|Ailaka]] (with only one piece of cloth) in the [[Digambara]] tradition. The eleventh pratima is termed Shramanabhuta Pratima (being almost like a Shramana) in the [[Svetambara]] tradition. The next step is that of a full [[Jain muni|Jain Muni]].

{{other uses|Protector (disambiguation)}}
'''Protector''', sometimes spelled '''protecter''', is used as a title or part of various historical titles of heads of state and others in authority. The word literally means ''one who protects''.

==Political and administrative==

===Heads of state===

====Iran====
''Wakil ar-Ra`aya'' (rendered as '''Protector of the People''') was the (or a?) title of the Persian imperial Monarch under the [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasty - those rulers refused (except the last as noted) the style [[Shahanshah]]. The founding ruler adopted the style; it appears that his successors used the same style, although documentation is obscure
*1773 - 1 March 1779 Mohammad Karim Khan Zand (b. c.1707 - d. 1779) 
*6 March 1779 - 1779 Abu al-Fath Khan Zand (1st time) (b. 1755 - d. 1787) - ''jointly with'' 6 March 1779 - 19 June 1779 Mohammad Ali Khan Zand (b. 1760 - d. 1...) 
*19 June 1779 - 22 August 1779 Abu al-Fath Khan Zand (2nd time) 
*22 August 1779 - 14 March 1781 Mohammad Sadeq Khan Zand (d. 1782)

*12 February 1785 - 17 February 1785 Baqer Khan Khorasakani 
*18 February 1785 - 23 January 1789 Jaafar Khan Zand (d. 1789) 
*23 January 1789 - 10 May 1789 Seyd Morad Khan Zand 
*10 May 1789 - 30 October 1794 Lotf Ali Khan Zand (b. c.1766 - d. 1794); he again adopted the traditional style [[Shah]]anshah March 1794 - 30 October 1794

====Europe====
: ''for the use in the British Isles as regent during minority or incapacity of the King and as republican Head of state of the Cromwellian Commonwealth see [[Lord Protector]]''
*[[Iceland]]: one Sovereign was styled ''Alls Íslands '''Verndari''' og Hæstráðandi til Sjós og Lands'' ("Protector and supreme authority of all of Iceland on land and sea") 25 June - 22 August 1809 (an intermezzo between Danish Governors styled ''[[Stiftamtmadur]])'': [[Jürgen Jürgensen]] (b. 1780 - d. 1841; nicknamed ''Hundadagakonungur'' "the Dog-Day King") .
*[[Estonia]]: ''State-protector'' is a common rendering of [[Riigihoidja]], a single Head of state and Head of government of that Baltic republic, 24 January 1934 - 24 April 1938 (acting to 3 September 1937), Konstantin Päts (b. 1874 - d. 1956), earlier five times State Elder, thereafter the first and only President before the Soviet takeover.
*[[Finland]] (linguistically close to Estonian): State Protector is a common rendering, besides Regent, of two Finnish Heads of State 18 May 1918 - 27 July 1919, the first incumbent being also the last of the previous -untitled- Acting heads of state
*The elective kingdom called 'Commonwealth' of Poland &amp; Lithuania, August 1655 – 23 February 1660: King [[Karl X Gustaf]] (b. 1622 - d. 1660) (as King of Sweden), in Polish Karol X Gustaw, was styled '''''Protektor''' Rzeczypospolitej'' ('Protector of the Republic, i.e. the (Polish-Lithuanian) Commonwealth') as challenger to the duly elected king Jan II Kazimierz during the middle part of his reign (17 January 1649 - 16 September 1668)

====Americas====
*in the [[Dominican Republic]]: 4 August 1865 - 15 November 1865, his first non-consecutive presidential term: [[José María Cabral|José María Cabral y de Luna]] (b. 1819 - d. 1899)

*in present [[Nicaragua]]: on 20 April 1823 general [[José Anacleto Ordóñez]] was proclaimed ''General en Jefe del Ejército, Protector y Libertador de Granada''; he acted as head of state (e.g. in a treaty ), but set up a Governing [[military junta|Junta]] (it's unclear whether he was a member) which continued to govern after Granada's accession{{Clarify|November 2009|date=November 2009}} to the [[Central American Federation]] on July 2
*in [[Peru]]: 3 August 1821 - 20 September 1822 general [[José Francisco de San Martín]] y Matorras (b. 1778 - d. 1850)

*in [[Brazil]], 12 October 1822 - 15 November 1889, the imperial style was ''Imperador Constitucional e '''Defensor Perpétuo''''' (Constitutional Emperor and '''perpetual defender'''), not unlike the hollow [[victory title]]s of late Roman emperors

===Foreign hegemons===

====Napoleonic France====
*in most of Germany, east of the Rhine, except Prussia, from 25 July 1806 to 19 October 1813, the French Emperor, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], bore the additional title of '''''protecteur''' de la Confédération du Rhin'', i.e. Protector of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], generally known as ''Rheinbund'' ('Rhenan League'), uniting the German princes that had bowed to the conqueror. The actual presidency of its diet and council of Kings was held by a German prince, the [[Fürstprimas]] ('Prince-primate').
*Bonaparte had a similar position in Switzerland (then called the [[Helvetic Republic]]/[[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]]) under French occupation, but there his style was ''Médiateur de la Confédération Helvétique'' (Mediator, 1809 - 31 December 1813), while the chairmanship of the Diet (legislative assembly, since 10 March 1803), the acting Head of the Confederation, with the title ''[[Landammann]] der Schweiz'' {{de icon}}/''Landamman de la Suisse'' {{fr icon}}/''[[Landamano]] della Svizzera'' {{it icon}}, fell simply to the [[chief magistrate]] of the canton hosting it.

====Nazi Germany====
*Nazi Germany was represented by a '''Reichsprotektor''' ('Reich protector') in the Czech puppet-state it installed on 16 March 1939 under the explicit name ''Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren'', the "[[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]". (This excluded the ethnically German regions, which were annexed as ''Reichsgau'' [[Sudetenland]].) The Reichsprotektor held the real executive power, not the native President and Prime Minister. The German incumbents, after a month under a Military Governor, were:
**5 April 1939 &amp;ndash; 20 August 1943 [[Konstantin von Neurath]], ''[[Freiherr]]'' (1873 &amp;ndash; 1956) NSDAP 
**27 September 1941 &amp;ndash; 4 June 1942 [[Reinhard Heydrich]] (1904 &amp;ndash; 1942) NSDAP (acting for Neurath) 
**27 May 1942 &amp;ndash; 28 May 1942 [[Karl Hermann Frank]] (1898 &amp;ndash; 1946) NSDAP (acting for the mortally wounded Heydrich) 
**28 May 1942 &amp;ndash; 14 October 1943 [[Kurt Daluege]] (1897 &amp;ndash; 1946) NSDAP (acting [to 5 June 1942] for Heydrich]) 
**14 October 1943 &amp;ndash; 8 May 1945 [[Wilhelm Frick]] (1877 &amp;ndash; 1946) NSDAP 
**26 April 1945 &amp;ndash; 8 May 1945 [[Ferdinand Schörner]] (1892 &amp;ndash; 1973) (military commander with unrestricted executive power)

====Fictitious====
The self-styled [[Emperor Norton|Emperor Norton I of the United States]] included among his titles "Protector of Mexico."

===Colonial administration===
*In Spanish America, a '''[[Protector of the Indians]]''' was to restrain the abuses of the [[conquistadores]] at the expense of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Amerindian|Indios]], e.g. granted to the first missionary [[bishop of Cusco]] (in Peru).
*In the British Empire, a colonial official responsible for administering the [[Chinese Protectorate]]s, entities charged with the well-being of [[Chinese race|ethnic Chinese]] residents of the [[United Kingdom|British]]-held [[Straits Settlements]]—which included current-day [[Singapore]]—during that territory's [[Colonialism|colonial]] period.
*In the French empire, the ''Protecteur des Indigènes'' 'Protector of the Natives' was a colonial official charged with the protection of an indigenous community; ironically, such 'native' status was also awarded to the (Asian) ''immigrants'' -thus officially named- on the island of [[La Réunion]].

==Religious==

===Catholic===
{{Main|Cardinal protector}}
Since the thirteenth century it has been customary at Rome to confide to some particular Cardinal a special solicitude in the [[Roman Curia]] for the interests of a given religious order or institute, confraternity, church, college, city, nation, etc. Such a person is known as a ''Cardinal Protector''.

===Islamic===
The title ''Hâdim ül Haramain ish Sharifain'' or ''Khādim al-Ḥaramayn al-Sharifayn'', Arabic/Turkish for 'Servant of the Noble Sanctuaries', notably [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] (the destinations of the [[hajj]] pilgrimage; both in the [[Grand Sherif]]'s peninsular Arabian territory; the third being [[Jerusalem]], part of an Ottoman province) was awarded to Ottoman Sultan [[Salim Khan I]] by the Sherif of Mecca in 1517, a year after his conquest of Egypt and assuming of the title of [[Commander of the Faithful]], and [[Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], i.e. Caliph; both remained part of the full style of his successors on the Turkish throne.

Rabbi Ankawa is survived by hundreds of descendants today, mostly in Israel, France, Venezuela and the United States.  Leading Halachic rabbis refer to his books as sources for contemporary Jewish legal works.

'''''Ring''''' (リング Ringu) is a series of [[horror novels]] written by [[Koji Suzuki]]. The novels were initially a [[trilogy]], consisting of ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]'', ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'', and ''[[Loop (novel)|Loop]].'' A [[short story collection]] called ''[[Birthday (short story collection)|Birthday]]'' was released shortly after, introducing extra stories interconnecting the trilogy. Two further books, ''S'' and ''Tide'', were published in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

The novels revolve around a curse, embodied within a videotape, unleashed by [[Sadako Yamamura]], the ghost of a psychic who was raped and murdered before being thrown into a [[Water well|well]]. Though the curse was initially presented as a supernatural force, it is eventually revealed to be a cataclysmic virus which Sadako utilizes for her own misanthropic ends.

The success of the novels led to the release of [[The Ring (franchise)|numerous film adaptations]] in Japan, South Korea, and the United States of America.

===''Ring''===
{{main|Ring (Suzuki novel)}}

This story is set in present-day [[Tokyo]]. When four teenagers mysteriously die one night at the same time, Kazuyuki Asakawa, a journalist and uncle to one of the teens, takes a particular interest in the case and investigates. This leads him to a holiday resort called Hakone Pacific Island, where the four teens stayed one week before their death. There he watches a videotape left behind in their room which contains a series of abstract and realistic images. At the end of the sequence of cryptic and disturbing images, a warning appears: "The one who saw these images is destined to die in one week at this time. If you do not wish to die, do as will be said from now on. That is-" but the rest is erased by an advertisement. This has a strange mental effect on Kazuyuki, who immediately believes that the tape has now placed its mark on him.

He enlists the help of his best friend, Ryuji Takayama, a philosophy graduate and an admitted rapist. When Ryuji hears Kazuyuki's story, he watches the tape, and asks Kazuyuki to make him a copy for him to study at home. Their investigations lead them to the volcanic island of Oshima. After Kazuyuki's wife and child also watch the tape, Kazuyuki realises he must find the truth and perform the "charm" to prevent the deaths of both his family and his friend.

Then their investigations lead them to search for a person named Sadako Yamamura. Sadako was the daughter of Shizuko Yamamura, who was known for her exceptional [[Extra-Sensory Perception|ESP]] abilities but later branded as a charlatan. In depression, Shizuko jumped into [[Mount Mihara]]'s crater. Later they learn that Sadako, who lived 30 years ago, was still missing. The evidence leads them back to Hakone where they find a well. At the bottom lie Sadako's remains; Kazuyuki sets her free by giving her a proper burial. Thinking he has performed the charm, Ryuji and Kazuyuki go home convinced. At Ryuji's deadline, he is watching the videotape; the space around the TV becomes distorted. He dials Mai Takano, his assistant. The television shows the scene of rolling dice. Ryuji tries to telephone Kazuyuki and yells "Get me out of here!" before screaming as he is killed by the curse.

When Kazuyuki realizes that the charm was to copy the tape and show it to somebody else, he rushes to his family to save them.

===''Spiral''===
{{main|Spiral (Suzuki novel)}}

The events in the story occur a day after Ryuji's death. By chance, Ando Mitsuo, Ryuji's former university classmate, is assigned to do the autopsy of Ryuji. He and his colleague, Miyashita, found a benign tumor in Ryuji's throat which is believed to be the cause of his death. They are puzzled because the tumor that they find resembles a smallpox tumor that was eradicated 30 years ago. Ando, along with his colleague, Miyashita, find out that an organism called the Ring Virus causes this tumour. The virus is transferred to the body through the tape and begins to grow into a tumour inside the viewer's throat. When the charm is not performed, the tumor grows until it blocks the airway and kills the person. To stop this, the tape must be copied and shown to another person.
Inside his stomach they find the word RING and a series of cryptic messages. This further perplexes Ando.

In search for the cryptic messages meaning, he comes to meet Ryuji's assistant, Mai Takano. Mai, who seems to know something about the videotape, tells Ando about the curse but is unsure how Ryuji died. As a scientist, Ando laughs at Mai's explanation. He goes to talk to Kazuyuki but finds that he and his family were involved in a car accident. It is discovered that Kazuyuki's wife and child were dead before the crash. Kazuyuki is critically wounded and unable to talk. At the accident site there lies a crushed videotape. When Mai suddenly disappears, Ando is further motivated to investigate. He stumbles upon Ryuji's files which contain the title, THE RING. He is uncertain about the discovery because it contains supernatural explanations and contradicts scientific ones.

The virus mutated and uses the report as a medium. After reading the report, Ando has thoughts of Sadako and the well. Through a series of events, he is led to the well in Hakone.

Days after Mai's disappearance, he meets a beautiful woman named Masako who introduced herself as Mai's older sister. He falls in love with her. In doing so, they make love one night and Masako ends up pregnant. Later he finds out that Masako and Sadako are the same. One night he receives a letter from Sadako/Masako stating; "Don't ever disobey me because you don't know who you are dealing with." Ando chooses Sadako and is told to publish Ryuji's files and dominate the world.

===''Loop''===
{{main|Loop (novel)}}

A medical student named Kaoru Futami has a father who has contracted a deadly disease called Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), a cancer involving both animals and plants. He discovers that his father was involved in a massive supercomputer project named LOOP. The LOOP was a computer simulation of the emergence of life but that did not succeed. It is known that everyone who was involved in the LOOP has died by the same type of cancer.

In the course of events, Kaoru meets a woman named Reiko and falls in love with her. They sleep together, and Reiko becomes pregnant, which makes Reiko vulnerable to MHC. Kaoru continues his investigations, which lead him to a man (and the last surviving person involved in the LOOP) named Amano. Amano reveals that LOOP was a project involving 100 supercomputers strung together and aiming to recreate life. Amano tells Kaoru of a lab in New Mexico where another scientist might be alive. Kaoru goes there only to find the scientist dead. Then, he enters the lab and finds a pair of virtual reality goggles and gloves. He tried it, and minutes later he is in the LOOP.

In the LOOP, he sees everything, but one event intrigues him, the emergence of the Ring Virus. He sees in detail all the events of the previous novels from different angles. After some discussion with Amano, he knows that the LOOP's creator wanted to recreate Ryuji's death and in so doing could clone him and insert him into someone's womb. The cloned Ryuji, however, had the Ring Virus in him. When Ryuji was born, the virus escaped and mutated into MHC.

Kaoru is desperate to find a cure for MHC, but he encounters a storm that leaves him dying. He is saved by an old man named Cristoph Eliot, the leader of the LOOP project. He reveals that Kaoru was Ryuji's clone and so has an exceptional gift, immunity to MHC.

Kaoru has to be analyzed so that his immunity can be understood. An analysis machine is created. The analyzed object, however, has to be molecularized in order to be scanned accurately, meaning that Kaoru might die. Heroically, he agrees to this.

The old man transfers Kaoru's analyzed molecules into the LOOP. He promises that Reiko, his wife, can see him through the VR Goggles and that she will not be alone. In the LOOP, Kaoru is reborn through Sadako as Ryuji. He creates a vaccine for the Ring virus which he gives to Ando, reenacting the epilogue of ''Spiral''. The book ends with Kaoru/Ryuji sitting watching the stars, thinking that Reiko is watching over him.

=== ''Birthday'' ===
{{main|Birthday (short story collection)}}

This short story collection consists of stories related to the ''Ring'' novels. It is also the conclusion to the Ring series.

'''Floating Coffin''' – These are the final moments of Mai Takano's life within the premises of Spiral.

It begins when she watches the tape. She starts ovulating then, and Sadako's DNA is planted in Mai's eggs. After viewing the tape, she feels nausea. Unknown to her, Sadako is being conceived in her womb. Days later, Sadako has total control of Mai since she lacks the will to resist. Exactly seven days after viewing the tape, Mai gives birth to a baby Sadako. When Sadako is reborn, she kills Mai with her psychic powers.

'''Lemonheart''' – The second story of the collection tells the story of Sadako when she was 19 years old in Tokyo. This is 30 years prior to the Ring. 
 
When Sadako graduated from high school, she joined the Hiroshi Acting Troupe as an apprentice. As days go by, she falls in love with Toyama, the soundman. Once, she is caught doing nensha with a turned-off TV. This alienates her from the group. While Sadako and Toyama are intimate, a spiteful member of the troupe records their conversation. When the member plays this recording, everyone who hears it dies five days later. Because of these events, Sadako flees to Hakone to her father, who is in the hospital.

At a well, a doctor rapes her, but she defends herself with a psychic attack on the doctor. He retaliates by strangling Sadako, which incapacitates her power. Helpless, she is thrown into the well. As she dies, she has a vision of being reborn inside Mai Takano's womb, which occurs in the first story.

'''Happy Birthday''' – The final story develops the plot of the last novel, ''[[Loop (novel)|Loop]]'', while incorporating new information disclosed in the previous two short stories. It depicts the last events taking place in the ''Ring'' universe chronologically and is also the conclusion of the series.

Reiko is questioning the worth of giving birth to a child if the only world he'll arrive in is full of death. Her older son has died, and the father of her unborn child still missing. There she goes to a lab and learn the final secrets of the LOOP.

=== ''S''===
{{main|S (Suzuki novel)}}

'''S''' is a 2012 Koji Suzuki novel and the fifth entry of the series.

Following on the story told in the series of novels that began with the runaway bestseller ''Ring'', this work starts with 28-year-old image processing specialist Takanori Ando being handed a USB memory stick by the president of the CG production company where he works. Tasked with analyzing its contents, Ando gasps at the graphic images he sees, and quickly concludes that they cannot have been faked or generated by CG software. Assuming the man in the video did indeed kill himself, what could his purpose have been in leaving this footage behind?
Ando saves the file to his PC. When he plays it again the next day, the man's body has shifted to a lower position, and in subsequent viewings, the video undergoes further changes. Meanwhile, Ando's fiancée Akane Maruyama, a 24-year-old high-school teacher, learns she is pregnant with his child. When she is at Ando’s apartment, she is drawn as if by an irresistible force to watch the suicide video on his PC. After examining the video more closely, Ando manages to identify the apartment building where he believes it was filmed. He also realizes that someone is following him, though intermittently, and that he may in fact be in danger.
The man who holds the key to the story is philosophy instructor Ryuji Takayama, who appeared in previous volumes of the series. Twenty-five years ago, Takayama had died after watching a video that transmitted a curse, but, miraculously returning to life, he has been battling the evil villainess Sadako to prevent the Sadako Virus from spreading. Akane is in fact Takayama's child by a woman who carries Sadako's DNA, and the man who kills himself in the suicide is a way of informing Ando about the intervening events.

===''Tide''===
{{main|Tide (Suzuki novel)}}
[http://www.booksfromjapan.jp/publications/item/2210-tide Koji Suzuki - Tide, 2013.]

Released in 2013 and the sixth entry to the series, ''Tide'' is linked most directly to its sequel ''Loop''.
Cram-school math instructor Seiji Kashiwa is a creation of the supercomputer LOOP, and the biological information implanted in him reflects the lives of Ryuji Takayama, who appeared in both Ring and Loop, and Kaoru Futami, who appeared in the latter volume; but due to a system error, portions of his memory have become lost. One day, student Rie Yoshina comes to him for advice regarding her friend Haruna Tajima, who inexplicably fell into a coma after seeing a female dogū figurine of the Jomon Period (ca. 12,000–300 BCE) depicting the release of a snake. It is a baffling story, but as he listens to Rie's account, Seiji senses intuitively that it is a message directed at him. As if guided by some unknown force, he begins going back over the events that took place in ''Ring''. The reader learns about the conflicts between Shizuko Yamamura and her daughter Sadako, who were central to the events; about the early years of the ancient ascetic who gave Shizuko her special powers; and about the surprising secret of Ryuji Takayama's birth. In the process, Seiji becomes one with Ryuji, and begins filling in the missing pieces of his memory. At the same time, he comes to feel a connection with the unbroken tides of human passion and memory that have ebbed and flowed since time immemorial, and in turn, to understand why he has been given life in this world.

==Film adaptations==

There have been at least a dozen films made which are either direct adaptations of Suzuki's ''Ring'' books, or which create new stories using the same characters and background story of the books.

Four adaptions have been made of Suzuki's 1991 book ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]''.  The first was the Japanese TV film ''[[Ring: Kanzenban|Ring]]'', released in 1995.  This remained very close to the book but didn't have the success of later films.

In 1998, [[Hideo Nakata]] made a new Japanese adaptation of the book in his film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''.  The original sequel to this was ''[[Rasen]]'', an adaptation of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' (Suzuki's sequel to his first ''Ring'' book).  However, due to poor reception, a new sequel, [[Ring 2]], was released in 1999 which continued the storyline of Ring but was not based on Suzuki's books.  This was followed in 2000 by ''[[Ring 0: Birthday]]'', which was based on the short story "Lemonheart" from Suzuki's 1999 book, ''[[Birthday (short story collection)|Birthday]]''.

One ''Ring'' film has been made in South Korea, the 1999 film ''[[The Ring Virus]]''.

Three full-length ''Ring'' films were made in the USA, plus one short film.  In 2002, ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' was released.  This was an adaptation of Nakata's 1998 film.  A short film, ''[[Rings (short film)|Rings]]'', was released in 2005 to fill the gaps between the 2002 film and the second full-length film ''[[The Ring Two]]'', also released in 2005.  A third full-length film, ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', was released in 2017.

In 2012 ''[[Sadako 3D]]'' was released, adapted from Suzuki's book ''[[S (Suzuki novel)|S]]'', and in and 2013 ''[[Sadako 3D 2]]'' was released.

In 2015, ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=https://echecetcinemat.wordpress.com/2015/11/24/hikiko-san-vs-sadako-nagaoka-hisaaki-2015 Hikiko-san vs Sadako]'' was released.  It is a crossover of the Japanese Hikiko-san series of horror films.

In 2016, ''[http://www.flickchart.com/movie/F7FFA070A7 Bunshinsaba vs Sadako]'' was released.  It is a crossover of the People's Republic of China ''[[Bunshinsaba (2012 film)|Bunshinsaba]]'' series of horror films.  (The South Korean ''[[Bunshinsaba]]'' series is unrelated.) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngSQjdRbhk trailer] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYsbnY9rKqg&amp;t=38s review]

In 2016 ''[[Sadako vs. Kayako]]'', directed by [[Kōji Shiraishi]],  was released.  It is a crossover of the ''Ju-on'' and ''Ring'' series of horror films.  It features Sadakaya, a ghost that resulted from the fusion of Sadako and the ''[[Ju-on]]'' antagonist [[Kayako Saeki]].

==Ring references in other films==

The 2003 film ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' significantly parodies the American remake film ''The Ring''.

The 2009 season 5 episode of ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', "Head Over Heels", contains horses going crazy. The episode makes a direct comparison with Samara driving the horses crazy in her barn with her nensha powers

The 2013 season 5 episode of ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', "Scared to Death", contains a haunted DVD so scary that it kills people three days after they watch it.&lt;ref&gt;TV.com, [http://www.tv.com/shows/castle/scared-to-death-2677150/ "Scared to Death"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BroadwayWorld.com, [http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/VIDEO-Sneak-Peek-Scared-to-Death-On-the-Next-CASTLE-20130315 "VIDEO: Sneak Peek - 'Scared to Death' on the Next CASTLE"], 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The episode makes a direct comparison between the curse and ''The Ring''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' episode "Scared to Death", airdate March 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Châlons''' ([[Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Catalaunensis''; [[French language|French]]: ''Diocèse de Châlons'') is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Châlons-sur-Marne]], [[France]]. The diocese comprises the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Marne]], excluding the arrondissement of Reims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholique-chalons-en-champagne.cef.fr/ Official web site] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03566a.htm Châlons-sur-Marne] - [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archdiocese of Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dchln.html Diocese of Châlons] from [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org catholic-hierarchy.org]{{Self-published source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Local legends maintain that the evangelization of Châlons by [[St. Memmius]], sent thither by [[St. Peter]] and assisted by his sister [[Saint Poma|Poma]], also by St. Donatian and St. Domitian, took place in the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Rabanus Maurus Abbot of Fulda (9th century), quoted in ''Acta Sanctorum'' [https://archive.org/details/actasanctorum36unse August, Volume 2], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; These legends are not creditable,&lt;ref&gt;Duchesne, III, p. 95 note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the revised list of the diocesan saints in the Breviary (prayer book) these legends have been suppressed.

[[Abbé Duchesne|Louis Duchesne]], a prominent scholar of early Christianity in Gaul, assigns the founding of the See of Châlons to the fourth century. [[Amandinus]], who attended the Council of Tours in 461, is traditionally listed as its ninth bishop. [[Leudomerus]] (St. Lumier), Bishop of Châlons about 580, was noted for his rapport with animals.

The bishops of Châlons played a part in French history as Peers of France. At the coronation of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] kings, the Bishop of Châlons always carried the royal ring.

===Cathedral, seminary, college===
The older cathedral at Châlons had been dedicated to Saint Vincent, up to the time of [[Charles the Bald]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' IX, p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt; It had become the cathedral under Bishop Felix I, ca. 625, when the older cathedral was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Estrayez-Cabassolle, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 931, and again in 963, the town of Châlons suffered serious fires. In 931 the fire was deliberately set by  King Raoul (Rudolph) in reprisal for the support given by Bishop Bovo to Count Héribert of Vermandois against the King.&lt;ref&gt;Barthélemy  (1861), I, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 963 it was Count Héribert of Vermandois who put the city to the flames because Bishop Gebuin had supported the deposition of Héribert's son from the archbishopric of Reims. In both cases the cathedral suffered serious damage. In 1138 the cathedral was struck by lightning and mostly destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Estrayez-Cabassolle, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[Châlons Cathedral|Cathedral of S. Étienne]] was consecrated in 1147 by the exiled [[Pope Eugene III]], assisted by eighteen cardinals, with [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Estrayez-Cabassolle, pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1253, when he was visiting Rome, Bishop  Pierre de Hans was able to obtain what was claimed to be a fragment of the head of S. Étienne ([[Saint Stephen|Stephen the Protomartyr]]) from the Abbot of the monastery at [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|S. Paolo fuori le mura]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' IX, p. 887.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first seminary in Châlons was founded by Bishop Jérome de Burges (or Jérôme Bourgeois) on 14 October 1572, in part of the abandoned Hôpital Saint Lazare, which was thereafter called the Collège S. Lazare. From 1617, the seminarists shared quarters with the Jesuits, and when the Jesuits moved to larger quarters, the seminary followed them. It was only in 1646 that Bishop de Vialar provided them with separate, and inadequate, quarters. Bishop de Clermont-Tonnerre had the church of S. Nicholas demolished and the seminary extended on its foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Barbat|title=Histoire de la ville de Chalons-sur-Marne et de ses monuments depuis son origine jusqu'à l'époque actuelle (1854)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjFnDQtLMf4C&amp;pg=PA58|year=1860|publisher=Barbat|location=Chalons sur Marne|language=French|pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collège de Châlons (Collège S. Lazare) was endowed by Bishop Cosme Clausse on 30 May 1615, and he and the City entered into a contract with the Jesuits to staff the college on 23 February 1617. The Jesuits directed the school until they were expelled from France in 1762, at which point the collège was turned over to laymen and secular clergy until the end of the monarchy in 1791. In 1784 some 245 pupils were being educated there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives Départementales de la Marne antérieures à 1790: Inventaire sommaire:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1szl2CtvJYC&amp;pg=PA211|series=Archives civiles: Séries C, D, E, F|year=1892|publisher=l'Union républicaine|location=Châlons|language=French|pages=iv, 211}} Barbat, pp. 37-39. {{cite book|author=Louis Grignon|title=Topographie historique de la ville de Chalons-sur-Marne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLkhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324|year=1889|publisher=Martin|location=Chalons|language=French|pages=324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefices===
The diocese was well supplied with positions which carried income with them. The cathedral had eight dignities: the Dean, the Cantor, the Grand Archdeacon (of Châlons), the Archdeacon of Joinville, the Archdeacon of Astenai, and the Archdeacon of Vertus, the Treasurer, and the Succentor.&lt;ref&gt;The Archdeacons are not attested until the eleventh century. Guignon, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there were thirty Canons. In 1699 the number of Canons was thirty-nine, while in 1764 the number was thirty-one.&lt;ref&gt;Barthelémy (1853), pp. 71. Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 155 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; There had once been a Provost as well, but the office was abolished by Bishop Roger in 1065, with royal consent. The bishop appointed the four Archdeacons and the Treasurer, while the Dean, the Cantor, and the Succentor were elected by the Chapter of the Cathedral. The Chapter also assigned the prebends, to which the Archdeacons and Treasurer were not entitled.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' IX, pp. 858-859. Barthelémy (1853), pp. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also two Collegiate Churches in the city of Châlons, Saint-Trinité (with ten prebendaries, appointed by the Cathedral Chapter) and Nôtre Dame en Vaux (with twelve prebendaries, appointed by the Cathedral Chapter).&lt;ref&gt;''Pouillie général'' (1648), p. 4 (p. 72).&lt;/ref&gt; Among its abbeys,&lt;ref&gt;Barthélemy (1861), I, pp. 127-198.&lt;/ref&gt; the diocese counted: St. Memmius (Augustinians), founded in the fifth century by Alpinus; Toussaints (Augustinians), founded in the eleventh century; Châtrices (Augustinians); Montier-en-Der (Benedictines), founded in the seventh century by St. Bereharius, a monk from [[Luxeuil]];&lt;ref&gt;Dervum (Montier-en-Der): ''Gallia christiana'' IX, pp. 906-910.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Urbain, founded in 865;&lt;ref&gt;Saint Urbain: ''Gallia christiana'' IX, pp. 923-924.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Pierre au Mont (Benedictines), founded during the same period; Moiremont (Benedictines);&lt;ref&gt;Moiremont (Mauri-mons): ''Gallia christiana'' IX, pp. 931-932.&lt;/ref&gt; Huiron (Benedictines); Saint-Sauveur-de Vertus (Benedictines); Nôtre-Dame de Vertus (Augustinians); Trois-Fontaines (Cistercians); Haute-Fontaine (Cistercians); Cheminon (Cistercians); and Moutier-en-Argonne (Cistercians). The king was the patron and made the appointments at Toussaints, Saint-Pierre, Saint-Memmius, and Châtrices.&lt;ref&gt;''Pouillie général'' (1648), pp. 3-4 (pp. 71-72).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Notre-Dame de l'Épine|Nôtre-Dame de l'Epine]], near Châlons, was a place of pilgrimage as early as the beginning of the fifteenth century, thanks to the mysterious discovery of a miraculous image of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Demaison|title=Documents inédits sur l'église Notre-Dame de l'Epine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9NLAAAAYAAJ|year=1895|publisher=Imprimerie de l'Académie|location=Reims|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===

In 1790 the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] decided to bring the French church under the control of the State. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called '[[Departments of France|départements]]', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. Since there were more than 130 bishoprics at the time of the Revolution, more than fifty dioceses needed to be suppressed and their territories consolidated. Clergy would need to take an oath of allegiance to the State and its Constitution, specified by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], and they would become salaried officials of the State. Both bishops and priests would be elected by special 'electors' in each department. This meant schism, since bishops would no longer need to be approved (preconised) by the Papacy; the transfer of bishops, likewise, which had formerly been the exclusive prerogative of the pope in canon law, would be the privilege of the State; the election of bishops no longer lay with the Cathedral Chapters (which were all abolished), or other responsible clergy, or the Pope, but with electors who did not even have to be Catholics or Christians.

The diocese of Châlons-sur-Marne was one of the dioceses which was suppressed, and its territory was transferred to a new diocese centered at Reims, and called the 'Diocese of the Marne'. The bishop of Marne would be the Metropolitan of a 'Metropole du Nord-Est', which would include: Marne, Aisne, Ardennes, Meurthe, Moselle, and Nord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=Répertoire biographique de l'épiscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A. Picard et fils|location=Paris|language=French |pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dioceses of Soissons and Troyes were also suppressed and incorporated into the 'Diocèse du Marne'. The Bishops of Reims, Châlons, Soissons and Troyes protested, addressing letters to their clergy and to the 'electors' and warning them to take no account of the activities of the government as regards the Church. In Châlons a large number of the clergy were in favor of reforms. One in four of the curates, and one in five of the vicars, refused to take the oath to the Civil Constitution (or retracted it after they had taken it).&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that they were discharged from their functions and left without incomes; they became targets of the more radical of the revolutionaries.

In Marne, the 539 electors were invited to assemble by the Constituent Assembly, and 395 of them assembled at Reims in March 1791. They elected Fr. Gangand, the curé of Mareuil-sur-Ay, but he refused. Then, on March 15, they elected Nicolas Diot as Bishop and Metropolitan of Marne, and he thus acquired control over the suppressed diocese of Châlons-sur-Marne. He was consecrated in Paris on 1 May 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel.&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, p. 456. Gobel had been consecrated a year earlier by Bishop Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord of Autun and two other titular bishops.&lt;/ref&gt; The consecration was valid, having been performed in the proper form by three Roman Catholic bishops, but illicit and schismatic, since the election and consecration had taken place without the sanction of [[Pope Pius VII]]. Diot acquiesced in new attitudes; he actually presided at the marriage of one of his priest. He survived the Terror (which had abolished Religion and replaced it with Reason), and as late as 1800 he carried out an episcopal consecration (Cambrai) In 1801 he presided at a diocesan synod, and in June 1802 at a Metropolitan synod. He died on 31 December 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, pp. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of the Concordat===

In the meantime First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte was preparing to end the religious confusion in France by entering into a Concordat with the Vatican. He had plans for the future, and he required a united France in order to carry them out successfully. In separate actions both he and Pius VII called on all bishops in France to submit their resignations. On November 29, 1801, by the bull ''Qui Christi Domini'', [[Pope Pius VII]] suppressed all of the Roman Catholic dioceses in France, and reinstituted them under papal authority. This act did away with whatever doubt or ambiguity might still exist as to a 'Constitutional Church' and 'Constitutional dioceses' in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pius VI |author2=Pius VII|title=Collectio (per epitomen facta,) Bullarum, Brevium, Allocutionum, Epistolarumque, ...

The [[Concordat of 1801]] was unilaterally abrogated by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|Law of Separation of Church and State]], enacted on 9 December 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rh19.revues.org/627?lang=en Mathilde Guilbaud], "La loi de séparation de 1905 ou l’impossible rupture," ''Revue d'histoire du XIX siècle'' 28 (2004) pp. 163-173; retrieved: 2017-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  From that date, the Republic no longer nominated French bishops. The law also declared that all religious buildings were property of the state and local governments, and enacted the prohibition of affixing religious signs on public buildings. Nuns were removed from hospital staffs. Schools were secularized, and religious instruction was forbidden to children between the ages of six and thirteen. The law did not apply to the provinces of Alsace or Lorraine, which were at the time part of the German Empire.

Discord accompanied a third attempt, at which the majority settled on Bartolomeo the Lombard, a Canon and Theologus of Châlons; but a minority put forth the brother of the Bishop of Verdun, Robert de Torota, and indicated that if he were unacceptable, they would support Canon Hugh, the Cantor of the Cathedral Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove''' (also known as the '''Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove''', {{zh|t={{linktext|竹|林|七|賢}}|s={{linktext|竹|林|七|贤}}|p={{linktext|Zhú|lín| Qī| Xián}}}}) were a group of Chinese scholars, writers, and musicians of the 3rd century CE.  Although the various individuals all existed, their interconnection is not entirely certain.  Several of the seven were linked with the [[Qingtan]] school of [[Daoism]] as it existed in the [[Cao Wei]] state (or nation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/536514/Seven-Sages-of-the-Bamboo-Grove |work=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seven Sages found their lives to be in danger when the avowedly "Confucian" [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (Sima clan) came to power. Among other things, some of the seven wrote poems criticizing the court and the administration, and wrote Daoist influenced literature. Not all seven sages had similar views. Some of the seven tried to negotiate their way through the difficult political positions by self-consciously adopting the roles of alcohol-fueled pranksters and eccentrics avoiding government control (for example, Liu Ling), yet some ended up joining the Jin dynasty (for example Wang Rong). However much they may or may not personally engaged in ''[[qingtan]]'', they became the subjects of it themselves in the ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'' (Chinese: 世說新語 "[[A New Account of the Tales of the World]]").

The Seven Sages are [[Ji Kang]] (aka Xi Kang), [[Liu Ling (poet)|Liu Ling]], [[Ruan Ji]], [[Ruan Xian]], [[Xiang Xiu]], [[Wang Rong (Jin dynasty)|Wang Rong]] and [[Shan Tao (Taoist)|Shan Tao]].  Ji Kang was especially close to Ruan Ji; their relationship was described as "stronger than [[metal]] and fragrant as [[orchids]]".  The wife of Shan Tao was said to be impressed by Ruan Ji and Ji Kang's prowess when she spied on them during [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinsh, Bret.  (1990).  ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''.  University of California Press.  pp. 68- 69&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is traditionally depicted, the group wished to escape the intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life during the politically fraught [[Three Kingdoms period]] of Chinese history. They gathered in a [[bamboo]] grove near the house of Ji Kang in [[Shanyang District|Shanyang]] (now in [[Henan]] province) where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the simple, rustic life.  This was contrasted with the politics of court. The Seven Sages stressed the enjoyment of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages]], personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of nature.

It would be Ji Kang's refusal to work for the new regime which would eventually lead to his [[execution]].  The group's rural life became a common theme for [[art]], and they inspired other artists who wished to retreat during times of political upheavals.

Another person associated with the Seven Sages is [[Rong Qiqi]] (榮啟期), who in fact lived quite earlier. This association is depicted in some apocryphal art from the fourth century CE, in a tomb near Nanjing.

The Seven Sages, or the symbol that they became, have been remarked to be influential in Chinese poetry, music, art, and overall culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4797">[[File:Nomisukune14.JPG|thumb|upright|God of sumo, [[Nomi no Sukune]]]]
'''The Shinto origins of sumo''' can easily be traced back through the centuries and many current [[sumo]] rituals are directly handed down from Shinto rituals. The [[Shinto]] religion has historically been used as a means to express Japanese nationalism and ethnic identity, especially prior to the end of [[World War II]]. In its association with Shinto, sumo has also been seen as a bulwark of Japanese tradition.&lt;ref name="reader"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Reader |first = Ian |date=December 1989 |title = Sumo: The Recent History of an Ethical Model for Japanese Society |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=6 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/09523368908713700 |pages=285–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumo can be traced back to ancient Shinto rituals to ensure a bountiful harvest and honor the spirits known as [[kami]]. In modern times, the canopy over the sumo ring, called the [[dohyō]] is reminiscent of a Shinto shrine, the officiator is dressed in garb very similar to that of a Shinto priest, and the throwing of salt before a bout is believed to purify the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last = Kamiya|first = Setsuko|year = 2010| title = Steeped in tradition, Shinto, sumo is also scandal-stained|newspaper = Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to becoming a professional sport in the Tokugawa period, sumo was originally performed on the grounds of a shrine or temple. The present ''dohyō'', which is still considered sacred, is in honor of the days when matches were held on the sacred grounds of shrines and temples. The roof over the ''dohyō'' called ''yakata'' originally represented the sky for the purpose of emphasizing the sacred nature of ''dohyō'', which symbolizes the earth. On the day before the beginning of each tournament, the ''dohyō-matsuri'', a ring-blessing ceremony, is performed by sumo officials called ''gyōji''. They are the referees on the ''dohyō'', who judge each sumo match. Their elaborate, colorful costumes are based on ceremonial court robes of the [[Heian period]] (AD 794 – 1185). Also their black hats are exact copies of the hats worn by Shinto priests depicted in various Heian art. Dressed in the white robes of a Shinto priest ''gyōji'' purify and bless the ''dohyō'' in a solemn ceremony during which salt, kelp, dried squid and chestnuts are buried in the center of the ''dohyō''. Observing officials and invited guests drink sake, Japanese traditional alcoholic drink as it is offered to each one in turn. The remaining sake is poured over the straw boundary of the ''dohyō'', as an offering to the gods. Shinto ritual still continues to pervade every aspect of sumo. Before a tournament, two of the sumo officiators known as [[gyōji]] functioning as Shinto priests enact a ritual to consecrate the newly constructed ''dohyō''.

Each day of the tournament the [[dohyō-iri]], or ring-entering ceremonies performed by the top divisions before the start of their wrestling day are derived from sumo rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sumo Ceremonies |work=Beginner's Guide of Sumo |publisher=[[Japan Sumo Association]] |url = http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/ceremonies.html |accessdate =August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ceremony involves them ascending the ''dohyō'', walking around the edge and facing the audience. They then turn and face inwards, clap their hands, raise one hand, slightly lift the ceremonial aprons called kesho-mawashi, and raise both hands, then continue walking around the ''dohyō'' as they leave the same way they came in. This clapping ritual is an important Shinto element and reminiscent of the clapping in Shinto shrines designed to attract the attention of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Light&amp; Kinnaird|first = Richard &amp; Louise|year = 2002| title =Appeasing the gods: Shinto, sumo and ‘true’Japanese spirit. Article from the book titled WITH GOD ON THEIR SIDE: SPORT IN THE SERVICE OF RELIGION}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Makuuchi#yokozuna|yokozuna]]'s ring-entering ceremony is regarded as a purification ritual in its own right, and is occasionally performed at Shinto shrines for this purpose. Every newly promoted ''yokozuna'' performs his first ring-entering ceremony at the [[Meiji Shrine]] in Tokyo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">In the [[religion in ancient Rome|religion of the Roman Empire]], the '''Silvanae''' are [[nymph]]s or goddesses associated with the woodland god [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]. They are attested by inscriptions mainly in [[Pannonia]], with a little more than a third of the evidence scattered in the rest of the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, and in [[Latin literature]], Silvanus is accompanied by nymphs. ''Silvanae'' may be a regional preference in naming, not a form of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cultic devotion]] distinct from the Nymphs of Silvanus.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Like similar nature deities, Silvanus himself is found sometimes conceived of as plural ''(Silvani)'', and Silvani/Silvanae form a male-female complement characteristic of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman conception of deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Silvana is often depicted holding a tree branch, and although the evidence is sketchy, they may have been a form of [[hamadryades]],&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; nymphs who inhabit trees. The Silvanae sometimes bear the [[epithet]] ''augustae'', given to deities associated with [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], or ''silvestres'', "woodland".&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dacia]], they are once called ''Campestres'', like the "Mothers of the Field" honored by the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Année épigraphique|AE]]'' 1967.405; Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes in the company of the crossroads goddesses known as Quadruviae, Triviae or Biviae (Four-, Three- or Two-Ways), found in Celtic regions of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dedications to the Silvanae were made by free [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] and military personnel,&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Roman legions|legionaries]], a military prefect of [[equestrian order|equestrian rank]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' III.10394, from [[Aquincum]].&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]].&lt;ref&gt;''IDR'' III, 2, no. 333, from [[Ulpia Traiana]].&lt;/ref&gt; About a quarter of the dedications were made by [[Women in ancient Rome|women]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvanae, usually three in number, are depicted frontally in a row with their hands or arms intertwined. They can also appear singly, or in a group of as many as nine figures. When Silvanus appears with them, he stands to the left or right without interrupting their grouping. The Silvanae carry tree branches, flower pots, conch shells, or wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; With one exception, in which they appear nude from the waist up, Silvanae are clothed.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 44, especially note 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their concentration in the [[Danubian provinces]], Silvanae are sometimes thought to be Imperial forms of the Celtic [[Matres and Matrones|Matres or Matronae]], "mother" goddesses who often appear as a clothed triad bearing flowers or other vegetative symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,''{{page needed|date=May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification is particularly suggested by an inscription from [[Lugdunum]] that names ''Matres Pannoniorum''.&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' XIII.1766.&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.L. West]] thought them more likely to be [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] nymphs than [[Italic tribes|Italic]].&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European Poetry and Myth'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The three Silvanae may reflect an understanding of Silvanus's tripartite nature as described in the ''[[Gromatici Veteres]]'' and by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Takht-e Soleymān''' ({{lang-fa|تخت سلیمان}}), also known as Azar Goshnasp ({{lang-fa|آتشکده آذرگشنسپ}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huff|first=Dietrich|title=Taḵt-e Solaymān|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/takt-e-solayman|date=2002-07-20|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "''the Fire of the Warriors''", is an archaeological site in [[West Azarbaijan]], [[Iran]]. It lies midway between [[Urmia]] and [[Hamadan]], very near the present-day town of [[Takab]], and {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Tehran]].

The fortified site, which is located on a hill created by the outflow of a calcium-rich spring pond, was recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]] in July 2003. The citadel includes the remains of a [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]] built during the [[Sassanid]] period and partially rebuilt (as a mosque) during the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] period. This temple housed one of the three "Great Fires" or "Royal Fires" that Sassanid rulers humbled themselves before in order to ascend the throne. The fire at Takht-i Soleiman was called ''[[atar|ādur]] Wishnāsp'' and was dedicated to the ''arteshtar'' or warrior class of the Sasanid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Zakeri | first=Mohsen | authorlink=Mohsen Zakeri | coauthors= | title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: The origins of Ayyaran and Futuwwa | date= | publisher=[[Harrassowitz Verlag]] | location= | isbn=3-447-03652-4 | pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th century{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Armenia]]n manuscript relating to [[Jesus]] and [[Zarathustra]], and various [[historian]]s of the [[Islam]]ic period, mention this pond. The foundations of the fire temple around the pond is attributed to that legend. Takht-E Soleyman appears on the 4th century [[Peutinger Map]].

This site got its biblical name after the Arab conquest. Folk legend relates that [[King Solomon]] used to imprison monsters inside a nearby 100 m deep crater which is called ''Zendan-e Soleyman'' "Prison of Solomon". Solomon is also said to have created the flowing pond in the fortress.

Archaeological excavations have revealed traces of a 5th-century BC occupation during the [[Achaemenid]] period, as well as later [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] settlements in the citadel. Coins belonging to the reign of [[Sassanid]] kings, and that of the Byzantine emperor [[Theodosius II]] (AD 408-450), have also been discovered there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17320">'''Talmud Torah''' schools were created in the Jewish world, both [[Ashkenazic]] and [[Sephardic]], as a form of [[religious school]] for boys of modest backgrounds, where they were given an elementary education in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the [[Scripture]]s (especially the [[Pentateuch]]), and the [[Talmud]] (and [[Halakha]]). This was meant to prepare them for [[Yeshiva]] or, particularly in the movement's modern form, for Jewish education at a high school level. The Talmud Torah was modelled after the [[Cheder]], a traditional form of schooling whose essential elements it incorporated, with changes appropriate to its public form rather than the heder's "private" financing through less formal or institutionalized mechanisms, including tuition fees and donations.

==Roots==

===Origin of schools===
The father was traditionally the sole teacher of his [[children]] in Jewish history (Deut. xi. 19). The institution known as the "''bei rav''" or "''bet [[Rabbi|rabban]]''" (house of the teacher), or as the "''bei safra''" or "''bet sefer''" (house of the book), is said to have been originated by [[Ezra]]' and his [[Great Assembly]], who provided a public school in Jerusalem to secure the education of fatherless boys of the age of sixteen years and upward. But the school system did not develop until [[Joshua ben Gamla]] the high priest caused public schools to be opened in every town and hamlet for all children above six or seven years of age (B. B. 21a).

The expense was borne by the community, and strict discipline was observed. [[Abba Arika|Rav]], however, ordered Samuel b. Shilat to deal tenderly with the pupils, to refrain from corporal punishment, or at most to use a shoe-strap in correcting pupils for inattention. A stupid pupil was made monitor until able to grasp the art of learning. [[Rabbah bar Nahmani|Raba]] fixed the number of pupils at twenty-five for one teacher; if the number was between twenty-five and forty an assistant teacher ("resh dukana") was necessary; and for over forty, two teachers were required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On a path toward happiness|url=http://www.jlicentral.com/news.php?task=fullstory&amp;NID=118|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only married men were engaged as teachers, but there is a difference of opinion regarding the qualification of the "melammed" (teacher). Raba preferred one who taught his pupils much, even though somewhat carelessly, while [[Rav Dimi]] of [[Nehardea]] preferred one who taught his pupils little, but that correctly, as an error in reading once adopted is hard to correct (ib.). It is, of course, assumed that both qualifications were rarely to be found in one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS for Your Soul - Kabbalah to Navigate Your Inner World|url=http://www.novijewishcenter.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1987392/jewish/GPS-for-the-Soul-Kabbalah-to-navigate-your-inner-world.htm|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
The teaching in the Talmud Torah consumed the whole day, and in the winter months a few hours of the night besides. Teaching was suspended in the afternoon of Friday, and in the afternoon of the day preceding a holy day. On [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]s and holy days no new lessons were assigned; but the work of the previous week was reviewed on Sabbath afternoons by the child's parent or guardian (Shulḥan 'Aruk, Yoreh De'ah, 245).

The Talmud Torah did little for what was then considered the properly religious teaching and training of the pupils; this was left to parents or guardians. The main object of the early schools was, instead, to instruct the pupil in the laws of Moses and in the knowledge of the rabbinical writings, more from a literary than from a practical standpoint. In later times, influenced in a measure by the Christian parochial schools of the thirteenth century, the reading of the prayers and benedictions and the teaching of the principles of the Jewish faith were included. In almost every community an organization called "Hevra Talmud Torah" was formed, whose duty was to create a fund and provide means for the support of public schools, and to control all teachers and pupils.

R. [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250–1328) ruled to allow withdrawals from the funds of the Talmud Torah for the purpose of meeting the annual tax collected by the local governor, since otherwise great hardships would fall upon the poor, who were liable to be stripped of all their belongings if they failed in the prompt payment of their taxes (Responsa, rule vi., § 2). On the other hand, money from the general charity fund was at times employed to support the Talmud Torah, and donations for a [[synagogue]] or cemetery were similarly used (ib. rule xiii., §§ 5,14).

Because Talmudic and Torah education was traditionally deemed obligatory for males and not females, Talmud Torahs were traditionally single-sex institutions. It is common even in the present day for men to continue their full-time Torah studies well into their third decade of life while females pursue "secular" education such as computer programming, mathematics, and home economics.

==Early history==
The Talmud Torah organization in [[Rome]] included eight societies in 1554, and was reconstituted August 13, 1617 (Rieger, "Gesch. der Juden in Rom," p.&amp;nbsp;316, Berlin, 1895). Later, certain synagogues assumed the name "Talmud Torah," as in the case of one at [[Fes, Morocco]] in 1603 (Ankava, "Kerem Ḥemed," ii. 78, Leghorn, 1869) and one at [[Cairo]]. This was probably because the school was held in or adjoined the synagogue.

===Funding===
The income of the society was derived from several sources:
: (a) one-sixth of the Monday and Thursday contributions in the synagogues and other places of worship;
: (b) donations at circumcisions from guests invited to the feast;
: (c) donations at weddings from the groom and the bride and from invited guests;
: (d) one-tenth of the collections in the charity-box known as the "mattan ba-setar."

[[Samuel de Medina]] (1505–89) ruled that in case of a legacy left by will to a Talmud Torah and guaranteed by the testator's brother, the latter was not held liable if the property had been consumed owing to the prolonged illness of the deceased (Responsa, Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ, No. 357). A legacy for the support of a yeshivah and Talmud Torah in a certain town, if accompanied by a provision that it may be managed "as the son of the testator may see fit," may be transferred, it was declared, to a yeshivah elsewhere (ib. Oraḥ Ḥayyim, i., No. 60; see also "Paḥad Yiẓḥaḳ," s.v., p.&amp;nbsp;43a).

===Governance===
The election of officers was made by ballot: three [[Gabbai|gabba'im]], three vice-gabba'im, and a treasurer. Only learned and honorable men over 36 years of age were eligible for election. The taḳḳanot regulating these sources of the Talmud Torah's income were in existence in the time of R. [[Moses Isserles]]. R. [[Yoel Sirkis]], rabbi of [[Cracow]] in 1638, endorsed these regulations and added many others, all of which were confirmed at a general assembly of seventy representatives of the congregations on the 25th of Ṭebet, 5398 (1638; F. H. Wetstein, "Ḳadmoniyyot," document No. 1, Cracow, 1892).

===Staffing===
Solomon b. Abraham ha-Kohen (sixteenth century) decided that it requires the unanimous consent of the eight trustees of a Talmud Torah to engage teachers where a resolution has been passed that "no trustee or trustees shall engage the service of a [[Melamed]] without the consent of the whole" (Responsa, ii., No. 89, ed. Venice, 1592).

As a specimen of the medieval organization of these schools that of the Cracow schools may be selected. From the congregational record (pinḳes) of Cracow in 1551 it appears that the Talmud Torah society controlled both private and public schools. It passed the following taḳḳanot, or Jewish legal writs:

(1) The members shall have general supervision over the teachers and shall visit the Talmud Torah every week to see that the pupils are properly taught.

(2) No melamed may teach the [[Pentateuch]] except with the translation "Be'er Mosheh" (Judæo-German transl. by Moses b. Issachar, Prague, 1605), "which is in our vernacular"; for the advanced pupils he shall use no other than the Rashi commentary.

(3) A melamed in the primary class shall teach not more than twenty-five pupils and shall have two assistants.

(4) One melamed shall not compete with another during the term of his engagement, and shall not seek to obtain a pupil in charge of another teacher, even at the expiration of the term, unless the father or the guardian of the pupil desires to make a change.

(5) The members of the Ḥebra Talmud Torah shall hire a competent and God-fearing melamed, with an assistant, for poor and orphaned boys at the bet ha-midrash.

(6) The melamed and assistant shall teach pupils the
[[Hebrew alphabet]] (with the vowels), the [[Siddur]], the Pentateuch (with the "Be'er Mosheh" translation), the [[Rashi]] commentary, the order of the prayers, etiquette, and good behavior—every boy according to his grade and intelligence; also reading and writing in the vernacular. The more advanced shall be taught Hebrew grammar and arithmetic; those of the highest grade shall study Talmud with Rashi and Tosafot.

(7) Boys near the age of thirteen shall learn the regulations regarding [[tefillin]].

(8) At the age of fourteen a boy who is incapable of learning Talmud shall be taught a trade or become a servant in a household.

===Curriculum===
The [[Sephardim]] are said to have conducted their Talmud Torah schools more methodically than the [[Ashkenazim]], particularly in Europe. The one in [[Amsterdam]] was highly praised by R. [[Shabbethai Horowitz|Shabbethai]] b. [[Isaiah Horowitz]] ("Wawe ha-'Ammudim," p.&amp;nbsp;9b, appended to "[[Isaiah Horowitz#Works|Shelah]]", Amsterdam, 1698). [[Shabbethai Bass]], in the introduction to his "Sifte Yeshanim" (p.&amp;nbsp;8a, ib. 1680), describes this Talmud Torah and wishes it might serve as a model for other schools:

"It is built near the synagogue, and has six rooms, each accommodating a separate class under a melammed. The first class is for small boys who are learning to read their prayers. In the second class they learn the [[Pentateuch]] from beginning to end, with the musical accents. In the third, they translate the Pentateuch into the vernacular and use the [[Rashi]] commentary, divided into the regular weekly [[sidrot]].

"In the fourth, they learn the [[Neviim|Prophets]] and the Hagiographa, with the proper accents and translation. In the fifth, they learn grammar and begin upon a series of [[halachic]] excerpts from the Talmud, the text being in Hebrew and the explanations in the vernacular. Before the approach of a holy day they memorize the laws in the [[Shulchan Aruch]] pertaining to that holy day. The sixth class is preparatory to the yeshivah in the [[bet ha-midrash]] and is conducted by the ḥakam-rabbi. In this class every day one halachah, with the commentaries of Rashi and the [[Tosafot]], is studied, and compared with the conclusions in the codes of Maimonides, Asheri, and Caro.

"The hours of study are from 8 to 11 in the morning, and from 2 to 5 in the afternoon; in winter, till the [[Mincha]] prayer. The expense of maintaining this school is defrayed from a fund contributed by the members of the Ḥebra Talmud Torah. This Sephardic school made an exception to the rule of keeping the pupils in Talmud Torah all day, and a few hours of the night in the short winter days."

==Modern history==

===Germany===
The Talmud Torah at [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], [[Moravia]], from 1724 to 1744, gave poor boys an education equal to that which was offered their more fortunate companions. The studies consisted of Siddur, [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Pentateuch), and [[Talmud]] ([[Moritz Güdemann]], ''Quellenschriften zur Gesch. des Unterrichts und der Erziehung bei den Deutschen Juden,'' p.&amp;nbsp;275). The schools in eastern Europe retained the ancient type and methods of the Ashkenazic schools up to the middle of the nineteenth century, when a movement for improvement and better management took place in the larger cities.

===Russia===
In 1857 at [[Odessa]], the Talmud Torah which had existed ever since the city was chartered was reorganized into a model school by distinguished pedagogues. In 1881 [[S. J. Abramowitch]] was appointed principal over 400 pupils. In 1904 two branches were opened in the suburbs with an additional 400 pupils. The boys were furnished text-books and clothing for free. Expenses were altogether 20,000 [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s annually. Every city within the [[Jewish Pale]] in [[Russia]] had a similar school. The income was derived from a Jewish tax on meat and from private contributions.

===Jerusalem===
In Jerusalem the Talmud Torah of the Sephardim, called "Tiferet Yerushalayim," was reorganized by the ''[[hacham bashi]]'' rabbi [[Raphael Meir Panigel]] in 1891, with 300 pupils and 13 teachers.  The boys learned Arabic and arithmetic in addition to other subjects, which ranged from the alphabet to the Talmud. The time of study was from sunrise to sunset. The largest contributions for the support of the school came from the [[Sassoon (surname)|Sassoon]] family, [[Baghdadi Jews]] of [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]], through the [[halukka|meshullachim]].

The Ashkenazic Talmud Torah and [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]], with 35 teachers and over 1,000 pupils, succeeded the school established by R. [[Judah he-Hasid (Jerusalem)]]. It was started with a fund contributed by Hirsch Wolf Fischbein and David Janover in 1860. The annual expenditure was in 1910 about $10,000, over half of which was collected in the United States. At Jaffa the Talmud Torah and yeshiva Sha'are Torah was organized in 1886 by N. H. Lewi, with 9 teachers and 9 classes for 102 boys. Its expenses were about $2,000 yearly, mostly covered by donations from abroad.

===United States===
In America the Machzikei Talmud Torah in [[New York City]], an Ashkenazi Talmud Torah, was organized in 1883 by Israel (Isidor) Rosenthal. It maintained schools on its own premises at 225-227 East Broadway. It instructed over 1,100 boys at a yearly expense of about $12,000. On January 22, 1905, the society opened a branch at 67 East 7th street, to which Jacob H. Schiff donated $25,000. The society was managed by a board of directors and a committee of education. The studies comprised elementary Hebrew, the reading of the prayers, the translation of the Pentateuch into [[Yiddish]] and English, and the principles of the Jewish faith and practise. The time of study occupied only two hours per day, after public-school hours, as all pupils attended the city schools for secular education. There were several other Talmud Torahs in New York; and similar institutions existed in all cities of the United States and Canada with a large Jewish population.

Girls in the United States at this time were often educated at public schools together with boys, and they received their Jewish education through programs at synagogues and Sunday schools, because Jewish day schools were less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Contemporary form==
Talmud Torah schools continue to exist throughout the Jewish world.  They are usually primary schools whose curricula incorporate Jewish and secular material in order to prepare students for Jewish education in the high school or yeshiva environments.  Talmud Torah schools tend in their contemporary form to be mixed schools which follow a traditional orientation to Jewish education—that is, one which approach to Judaism is congruent with the Sephardic and historic Ashkenazi orientation, as opposed to the nineteenth- and twentieth-century emergence of Ashkenazi denominations such as the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement

[[File:Sumiyoshi Taisha Hunatama Jinja1.jpg|thumb|A shrine surrounded by a ''tamagaki'']]
A {{nihongo|'''''tamagaki'''''|玉垣}} is a fence surrounding a [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto shrine]], a sacred area or an imperial palace.&lt;ref name="shintoencyclopedia-tamagaki"/&gt; Believed to have been initially just a brushwood barrier of trees, ''tamagaki'' have since been made of a variety of materials including wood, stone and—in recent years—concrete. Depending on the material and technique utilized, such fences have a variety of names:
*{{nihongo|board fence|板玉垣|ita tamagaki}} made of roughly finished thick boards,
*{{nihongo|unbarked lumber fence|黒木の玉垣|kuroki no tamagaki}} made of unpeeled or unstripped boards or logs,
*{{nihongo|squared timber fence|角玉垣|kaku tamagaki}},
*{{nihongo|squared lattice fence|角格子玉垣|kakugōshi tamagaki}} and {{nihongo|diagonal lattice fence|筋違格子玉垣|sujikaigōshi tamagaki}},
*{{nihongo|vermillion fence|朱玉垣|shutamagaki}},
*{{nihongo||竪籤玉垣|tatehigo tamagaki}} made of vertically set thin strips of bamboo or wood,
*{{nihongo|see-through fence|透垣|sukashigaki}}
The simple fences of ancient and medieval times became more elaborate in pre-modern Japan with the addition of roofs, [[wainscoting]] and [[grille]]s between posts. An example is the 1636 {{nihongo||東西透塀|Tōzai Sukibei}} around the main sanctuary of [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]].&lt;ref name="shintoencyclopedia-tamagaki"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

If the enclosed area is surrounded by multiple fences, generally the innermost one is called {{nihongo||瑞垣 or 瑞籬|mizugaki}}. The {{nihongo|inner sanctuary|内宮|naikū}} of [[Ise Grand Shrine]] is surrounded by four fences. From outside to inside these are: {{nihongo||板垣|itagaki}}, outer and inner ''tamagaki'' and ''mizugaki''. At Ise these fences separate areas for worshipers of different status. All visitors are allowed to pass a gate through the outermost ''itagaki'' fence, while traditionally only members of the imperial family were allowed to pass through the second fence, the outer ''tamagaki''. Today this privilege has been extended to elected representatives. Local mayors and members of assemblies worship at the inner eaves of the outer ''tamagaki'', representatives of prefectural governments, officials of Ise Shrine and [[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]]s{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} stand halfway between the outer and inner ''tamagaki''. The [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]], members of both chambers of the [[Diet of Japan|diet]], and other senior elected officials are allowed to the point just outside the gateway to the inner ''tamagaki''. Entrance to the inner ''tamagaki'' is limited to members of the imperial family and only the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and the [[Japanese empresses|empress]] are generally allowed to enter through the innermost ''mizugaki'' fence.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;An exception is made for the crown prince and princess who, on the occasion of their marriage, can enter the area enclosed by the ''mizugaki''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shintoencyclopedia-tamagaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jaanus-mizugaki"&gt;{{cite web

The ''tamagaki'' and the traditional ''[[torii]]'' gate are sometimes replaced by a covered corridor called ''[[kairō]]'' and a ''[[rōmon]]'' gate. Originally Buddhist, neither was initially typical of shrines, but in time they often came to play the role of the more traditional ''tamagaki''.&lt;ref name="nks"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nihon Kenchiku-shi|editor=Fujita Masaya, Koga Shūsaku|publisher=Shōwa-dō|date=April 10, 1990| edition=September 30, 2008|isbn=4-8122-9805-9|language=Japanese| page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example is [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]] in [[Kyoto prefecture]]. This phenomenon was partly caused by the strong influence of Buddhism on ''[[kami]]'' worship due to the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] fusion of Buddhism and local religion ([[shinbutsu shūgō]]).

Provenzano was an unemployed electrician when on January 10, 1984 he entered [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] Courthouse in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] carrying a shotgun, an assault rifle, and a revolver along with a large quantity of ammunition and opened fire with the revolver when two bailiffs approached to search him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/provenzano647.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Provenzano had been charged with disorderly conduct five months earlier and had gone to the Court House with the intention of shooting the officer who had charged him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odmp.org/officer/14186-deputy-sheriff-arnold-william-wilkerson&lt;/ref&gt;  He killed 60-year-old Deputy Sheriff William Arnie Wilkerson, a retired Navy Lt. Commander who had served 14 years with the Sheriff's Department.  In addition, 53-year-old Deputy Sheriff Harry Dalton was wounded and suffered brain damage becoming partially paralyzed eventually dying from his injuries seven years later in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prosecutor.co.clark.in.us/html/death/US/provenzano647.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 19 year old Correctional Officer Mark Parker was hit in the spine and paralyzed from the neck down after being caught in the crossfire as he used his own body to shield a civilian from the gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odmp.org/officer/195-deputy-sheriff-harry-jordan-dalton-jr&lt;/ref&gt; Parker eventually died in March 2009 due to complications from his injuries. Provenzano would be found guilty and sentenced to death for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19840111&amp;id=_gEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6s4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3094,263108 Defendant opens fire in courtroom, kills 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==

In 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Provenzano that argued that the [[electric chair]] was a [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. During the proceedings, Michael Minerva, who had witnessed [[Jerry White (criminal)|Jerry White]]'s execution, said that "White's body stiffened and was thrust upward and backward to the back of the electric chair" after the current had been switched on to the chair. He also said that he heard air moving through White's lips and throat, though he could not tell whether the air was going in or out. But even after the execution by electric chair of [[Allen Lee Davis]] had caused many irregularities, the constitutionality of the electric chair remained upheld. However, by the time the inmate following Davis was to be executed, Florida inmates sentenced to death could choose between lethal injection and the electric chair. Everyone executed in Florida following Davis thus far ({{As of|2013|4|lc=on}}) has chosen lethal injection.

Provenzano was originally scheduled to be the second person executed in Florida's newly built electric chair on Wednesday July 14, 1999, but the execution was stayed following the gruesome death of [[Allen Lee Davis]] (''supra'') just six days before the scheduled July 14, 1999 execution date on Thursday, July 8, 1999.  Provenzano’s eventual execution was carried out using a lethal injection protocol subsequently adopted by the Florida state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070999/met_2a1Execu.html#.VclNJGzbL4j&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenzano had spent almost 16 years on [[death row]] before being executed at [[Florida State Prison]] in [[Starke, Florida|Starke]] on June 21, 2000. He was the 48th murderer executed in Florida since that state's reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976.

Historically, many would mainly feature [[contactee]]s giving presentations about their experiences. Other topics, like [[UFO conspiracy theory]], general [[conspiracy theory]], and other [[paranormal]] phenomena are often discussed. However, some serious topical discussions and seminars are conducted at modern conventions{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''''Wu''''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.

==The word ''wu''==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' {{linktext|巫}} "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be of either sex. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

''Wu'' is used in compounds like ''[[Gu (poison)|wugu]]'' 巫蠱 "sorcery; cast harmful spells", ''wushen'' 巫神 or ''shenwu'' 神巫 (with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|''shen'']] "spirit; god") "wizard; sorcerer", and ''wuxian'' 巫仙 (with [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] "immortal; alchemist") "immortal shaman".

The word ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. Chinese uses phonetic [[transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration]] to distinguish native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻. "Shaman" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of [[Shramana]] "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Joseph Needham]] (1954:134) suggests "shaman" was transliterated ''xianmen'' 羨門 in the name of [[Zou Yan]]'s disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the ''[[Shiji]]'' that Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BCE), "wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals", [''xianmen''], and the like." Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for "shaman": ''shanman'' 珊蛮, which described the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Wanyan Xiyin]], and ''sizhu'' 司祝, which was used for imperial [[Manchu]] shamans during the [[Qing Dynasty]].

===Translations===
''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences."

===Pronunciations===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 巫 is ''wu'', which [[historical Chinese phonology|phonologically]] descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''wu'' 巫: ''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]), ''mjuo'' &lt; *''{{IPA|mjwaɣ}}'' (Zhou Fagao), *''mjag'' ([[Li Fanggui]]), ''mju'' &lt; *''ma'' (Axel Schuessler), and *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' ([[Victor H. Mair]]) . Linguists disagree whether ''wu'' had an Old Chinese [[velar]] final ''-g'' or ''-ɣ''. This 巫 is pronounced ''mouh'' in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], ''vu'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], ''mu'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and ''fu'' or ''[[miko]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

===Characters===

The contemporary [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] for ''wu'' combines the graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ''gong'' [[Wikt:工|工]] "work" and ''ren'' [[Wikt:人|人]] "person" doubled (cf. ''cong'' [[Wikt:从|从]]). This 巫 character developed from [[Seal script]] characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from [[Bronzeware script]] and [[Oracle bone script]] characters that resembled a [[cross potent]].

The first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''wu'' as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:祝|祝]] "sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, "An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing."  This Seal graph for ''wu'' is interpreted as showing "the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance" (Karlgren 1923:363) or "two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)" (Schafer 1951:153).

This dictionary also includes a variant [[Great Seal script]] (called a ''guwen'' "ancient script") that elaborates ''wu'' 巫.  Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this ''guwen'' graph as ''gong'' 廾 "two hands held upward" at the bottom (like ''shi'' 筮's Seal graph) and two "mouths" with the "sleeves" on the sides; or (1920:424) "jade" because the ''Shuowen'' defines ''ling'' 靈 "spiritual; divine" as synonymous with ''wu'' and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), "an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade."

Schafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for ''wu'' and ''nong'' [[Wikt:弄|弄]] "play with; cause" (written with 玉 "jade" over 廾 "two hands") that shows "hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph."

Tu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the ''wu'' oracle character "was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination." Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that ''gong'' 工 originally pictured a "carpenter's square", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used ''wu'' 巫 interchangeably with ''fang'' [[Wikt:方|方]] "square; side; place" for sacrifices to the ''sifang'' 四方 "four directions".

This 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:
*''wu'' [[Wikt:誣|誣]] (with the "speech radical" 言) "deceive; slander; falsely accuse"
*''shi'' [[Wikt:筮|筮]] (with the "bamboo radical" 竹) "[[Achillea millefolium]] (used for divination)"
*''xi'' [[Wikt:覡|覡]] (with the "vision radical" 見) "male shaman; male sorcerer"
*''ling'' [[Wikt:靈|靈]] (with the "cloud radical" 雨 and three 口 "mouths" or "raindrops") "spirit; divine; clever"
*''yi'' [[Wikt:毉|毉]] "doctor", which is an old "shaman" [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''yi'' [[Wikt:醫|醫]] (with the "wine radical" 酉)

===Meanings===
The comprehensive ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of ''wu'' 巫, translatable as:
#"[[Mediumship|spirit medium]]; [[shaman]]; [[Witchcraft|witch]]; [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]"
#"[[witch doctor]]; [[medicine man]]"
#"mountain name"
#"[[Toponym|place name]]"
#"[[Wu (surname)|surname]]"
The former two "shaman" and "doctor" ''wu'' meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three "[[proper name]]" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. ''[[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]]'' [[Wikt:|巫山]] "Wu Mountain" is located near [[Chongqing]] in [[Sichuan]] Province. In Chinese, it is known through the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''Wushanyunyu'' 巫山雲雨 (with "clouds and rain") "lovers' rendezvous; coitus" (for example, see ''[[Rain Clouds over Wushan]]''). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where [[Wushan Man]] "taxon of ''[[Homo erectus]]''" was discovered. Two nearby place names are ''[[Wuxi County|Wuxi]]'' 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and ''[[Wu Gorge]]'' (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the [[Yangtze River]]'s [[Three Gorges]] region. The [[Chinese surname]] ''Wu'' goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 "[[Eric Moo]]"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. "shaman horse") is both a [[Chinese compound surname]] (for example, the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Wuma Shi|Wuma Shi/Qi]] 巫馬施/期) and a name for "horse shaman; equine veterinarian" (for example, the ''Zhouli'' official).

===Etymologies===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] hypothetically connect the [[etymology]] of Chinese ''wu'' "spirit medium; shaman" not only with [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages, but also with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language groups.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed a relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", "Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer)".

Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion).

Schuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese ''xian'' &lt; ''sjän'' &lt; *''sen'' [[仙]] "transcendent; immortal; alchemist" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan ''gšen'' "shaman" and [[Thai language|Thai]] {{IPA-th|mɔɔ|}} &lt; Proto-Tai *''{{IPA|hmɔ}}'' "doctor; sorcerer". In addition, the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and Proto-Western-Austronesian  *''{{IPA|səmaŋ}}'' "shaman" may also be connected with ''wu''. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.

First, ''wu'' could be the same word as ''wu'' 誣 "to deceive" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between "magical power" and "deceive": ''sprul-ba'' "to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power" cognate with {{IPA-bo|pʰrul|}} "magical deception".

[[File:Tomb brick g.JPG|thumb|Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing "long-sleeved dancers" and attendants.]]
Second, ''wu'' could be cognate with ''wu'' [[Wikt:舞|舞]] "to dance". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that ''wu'' 巫 "shaman", ''wu'' [[Wikt:無|無]] "not have; without", and ''wu'' 舞 "dance", "can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the [[thaumaturgic]] powers of his inspired personality" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing "long-sleeved dancers" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the ''Shuowen jiezi'' that early ''wu'' characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.

Third, ''wu'' could also be cognate with ''mu'' 母 "mother" since ''wu'', as opposed to ''xi'' 覡, were typically female. [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] associates ''wu'' shamanism with fertility rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word ''wu'' (*''myu'') "shamanka" and such words as "mother", "dance", "fertility", "egg", and "receptacle". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of [[Confucius]] was a ''wu''.

[[Image:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|Cross potent]]
Fourth, ''wu'' could be a loanword from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] *''maguš'' "magi; magician" (cf. [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''mogu''), meaning an "able one; specialist in ritual". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese ''wu'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' 巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician" was a [[loanword]] from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; [[magi]]".

Mair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for ''wu'' 巫 (above) and Western [[heraldic]] [[cross potent]] '''☩''', an ancient symbol of a ''magi'' or ''magician'', for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, “The Earliest Identifiable Written Chinese Character”, ''Archaeology and Language: Indo-European Studies Presented to James P. Mallory'', eds. Martin E. Huld, Karlene Jones-Bley &amp; Dean Miller (Washington, D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man, 2012), 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early records of ''wu''==
The oldest written records of ''wu'' are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning the historical origin of the ''wu'', we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the ''wu'' are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou ''wu'' are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character ''wu''. Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou ''wu'' cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Wu'' in Shang oracular inscriptions===
Shima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character ''wu'': 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 "''wu'' spirit/sacrifice" and 氐巫 "bring the ''wu'') and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular ''wu'':
#"a spirit, ''wu'' of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered"
#"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology"
#"an equivalent for ''shi'' 筮, a form of divination using achilea"
#"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory"
The inscriptions about this living ''wu'', which is later identified as "shaman", reveal six characteristics:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#whether the ''wu'' is a man or a woman is not known;
#it could be either the name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a definite territory or nation;
#the wu seems to have been in charge of some divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of appeasement);
#the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other persons (the king included) suggests that the ''wu'' was not the person of choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement;
#there is only one inscription where a direct link between the king and the ''wu'' appears. Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the ''wu'' does not appear clearly;
#he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the Shang as a tribute. (Boileau 2002:355) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the ''Wu'' spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.

===''Wu'' in Zhou received texts===
Chinese ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" occurs over 300 times in the [[Chinese classics]], which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of ''wu''-shamans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single text can describe many roles for ''wu''-shamans. For instance, the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' idealizes their origins in a [[Golden Age]]. It contains a story about [[King Zhao of Chu|King Zhao]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the ''Shujing'' that the sage ruler [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] "commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth". He asks his minister to explain and is told.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called ''xi'' (shamans), and, if women, ''wu'' (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.
:In the degenerate time of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shaohao]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the successor of [Shaohao], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhuanxu]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., charged &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chong&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Governor of the South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. (tr. Bodde 1961:390-391) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as healers====
The belief that [[demonic possession]] caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese medicine]] historically changed from ''wu'' 巫 "spirit-mediums; shamans" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to ''yi'' 毉 or 醫 "doctors; physicians" who used herbal medicine, [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]].

As mentioned above, ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor". This archaic ''yi'' 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), "ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a ''wu'' 巫 'shaman'." Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of ''wu'' practitioner described in the ''Liji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Replacing the exorcistical 巫 "shaman" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 "wine" in ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), "the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the ''wu'', but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the "priest-physicians," who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients."
[[File:iching-hexagram-32.svg|thumb|Hexagram 32, ''Heng'' 恆]]
''Wu'' and ''yi'' are compounded in the word ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors", translated "exorcising physician" (De Groot 1910), "sorcerer-physician" (Schiffeler 1976), or "physician-shaman" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a "Southern Saying" that a good ''wuyi'' must have ''heng'' [[Wikt:恆|恆]] "constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., ''Yijing'' [[I Ching hexagram 32#Hexagram 32|Hexagram 32]])". The (ca. 5th century BCE) ''[[Lunyu]]'' "Confucian Analects" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" give different versions of the Southern Saying.

First, the ''Lunyu'' quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of ''te'' 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Confucius refers to a ''Yijing'' line interpretation of the Heng "Duration" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): "Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace." In Waley's earlier article about the ''Yijing'', he translated "If you do not stabilize your "virtue," Disgrace will overtake you", and quoted the ''Lunyu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes ''heng'' to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'." Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also ''heng'' 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [''de''] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the ''Liji'' quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that "A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks." This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the ''Book of Poetry'' (II, v, ode 1, 3) "Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans." The Charge to [Yue] says ([''Shujing''], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), "Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue." 'It is said in the [''Yijing''], "When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'." (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Liji'' version makes five changes from the ''Lunyu'' (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes ''bushi'' 卜筮 "diviner" instead of ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor", compounding ''bu'' "divine by bone or shell, [[scapulimancy]] or [[plastromancy]]" and ''shi'' (also with "shaman") "divine by milfoil stalks, [[cleromancy]] or sortilege". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark "well said!"; he describes the southern proverb as "probably a saying handed down from antiquity" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The ''Liji'' correctly quotes the ''Shijing'' (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: "Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans." (4) It quotes the "Charge to Yue" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king [[Wu Ding]]) differently from the fabricated ''Guwen'' "[[Old Texts]]" ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" chapter with this name.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(5) It cites an additional ''Yijing'' Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of ''heng''. "Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man."

The mytho-geography ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" associates ''wu''-shamans with medicinal herbs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Shaman Whole" translates [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 below.

Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning healing, a comparison of the ''wu'' and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the ''wu'' does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as rainmakers====
''Wu'' anciently served as intermediaries with [[nature spirit]]s believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a [[drought]], ''wu''-shamans would perform the ''yu'' [[Wikt:雩|雩]] "sacrificial [[rain dance]] ceremony". If that failed, both ''wu'' and ''wang'' [[Wikt:尪|尪]] "cripple; lame person; emaciated person" engaged in "ritual exposure" (Schafer 1951) [[rainmaking]] techniques based upon [[homeopathic]] or [[sympathetic magic]]. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, "Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain." These ''wu'' and ''wang'' procedures were called ''pu'' [[Wikt:曝|曝]]/[[Wikt:暴|暴]] "expose to open air/sun", ''fen'' [[Wikt:焚|焚]] "burn; set on fire", and ''pulu'' [[Wikt:暴露|暴露]] "reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun".

For the year 639 BCE, the ''Chunqiu'' records, "In summer, there was a great drought" in [[State of Lu|Lu]], and the ''Zuozhuan'' notes a discussion about ''fen wu wang'' 焚巫尪:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a ''wu'' and a cripple at the stake. [[Zang Wenzhong]] 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be ''wu'' and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the ''wu'') could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The duke followed this advice, and subsequently "scarcity was not very great".

The ''Liji'' uses the words ''puwang'' 暴尪 and ''puwu'' 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a ''wu'' and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators interpret the ''wu'' as a female shaman and the ''wang'' as a male cripple.

De Groot connects the ''Zuozhuan'' and ''Liji'' stories about ritually burning ''wu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' ''wang'' were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the ''wu''; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as oneiromancers====
[[Oneiromancy]] or [[dream interpretation]] was one type of divination performed by ''wu'' 巫. The ''Zuozhuan'' records two stories about ''wu'' interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.

First, in 581 BCE the lord of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], who had slain two officers from the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed ''wu'' "shaman" from Sangtian 桑田 and a ''yi'' "doctor" named Huan 緩 from [[Qin (state)|Qin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: "You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence." It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. "What will be the issue?" asked the duke. "You will not taste the new wheat," she replied. &lt;br&gt;
After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, "That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?" Then one of them said: "If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?" When the physician arrived, he said, "Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it." The duke said, "He is a skilful physician", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note "witch" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators have attempted to explain why the ''wu'' merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the ''wu'' was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.

Second, in 552 BCE a ''wu'' named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [''[[Dagger-axe|ge]]''] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: "Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note "wizard" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boileau questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;why wasn't the ''wu'' asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the ''wu'' was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the ''wu'' was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to these two stories, ''wu'' were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a ''Zhuangzi'' story about the ''shenwu'' 神巫 "[[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirit/god]] shaman" Jixian 季咸 from [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"As soothsayers." writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), "the ''wu'' in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance."

====Wu-shamans as officials====
Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of ''wu'' 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese ''wu'' used "techniques of ecstasy" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe ''wu'' were "ritual bureaucrats" or "moral metaphysicians" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.

[[Chen Mengjia]] wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were ''wu''-shamans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that "the king made the prognostication that …," pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by [[Kwang-chih Chang]] who cited the ''Guoyu'' story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, ''everybody'' had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis "somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history" and says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of the relationship between ''wu'' and ''wang'' [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the ''wu'' was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the ''wu'' was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head ''wu'' was influenced by [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shujing'' "Classic of History" lists [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The [[Duke of Zhou]] tells Prince [[Shao]] 召 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard that of ancient time, when [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] had received the favoring decree, he had with him [[Yi Yin]], making his virtue like that of great Heaven. [[Tai Jia]], again, had Bao Heng. [[Tai Wu]] had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; [[Zu Yi]] had [巫賢] Wu Xian. [[Wu Ding]] had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Boileau,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using  [''shi'' 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character ''wu'' of Wu Xian father and son as being a [[cognomen]], the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory ''wu''. Perhaps, later, the name (''wu'' 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character ''wu'' (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wu''-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of ''wugu'' 巫蠱 (with [[Gu (poison)|''gu'']] "venom-based poison") "sorcery; casting harmful spells". In 130 BCE, [[Empress Chen Jiao]] was convicted of using shamans from [[State of Yue|Yue]] to conduct ''wugu'' magic. She "was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince [[Liu Ju]] involved accusations of practicing ''wugu'', and subsequently "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).

Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as [[sexism]]. Schafer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|women in government]], and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The "licentiousness" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the "respectable" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the ''Chou li'', apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle ''yin'', were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element ''yang'', were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., ''wu'' 巫 "shamaness" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "shaman"), Kagan believes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to [[Women in ancient and imperial China|strip women of their public and sacred powers]] and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a "Confucian medicine" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).

The ''Zhouli'' provides detailed information about the roles of ''wu''-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), "Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (''Liguan'' 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, ''Chun guan'' 春官)." This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 "Manager/Director of Shamans", Nanwu 男巫 "Male Shamans", and ''Nüwu'' 女巫 "Female Shamans".

The managerial Siwu, who was of [[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|''Shi'']] 士 "Gentleman; Yeoman" feudal rank, yet was not a ''wu'', supervised "the many ''wu''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (''yu'' 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (''wuheng'' 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (''jiang'' 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the ''si'' 祀 and ''yan'' 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. &lt;br&gt;
The Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (''yu''). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Falkenhausen concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
The poetry anthology ''Chu Ci'', especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]].(1985[2011]:''passim'') Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as ''[[Heavenly Questions|Tianwen]]'' (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (''Nine Songs'') as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from ''[[Li Sao]]'' through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by [[Liu An]], the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The [[List of Chu Ci contents|''Chu Ci'' contents]] have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-[[Han dynasty]] group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, "[[Bu Ju]]" and "[[Yu Fu]]") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be "functional, explicitly shamanistic": ''[[Jiu Ge]]'', ''Tian Wen'', and the two shamanic summons for the soul, "[[The Great Summons]]" and "[[Summons of the Soul]]".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that "shamanism, if there is any" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.

====Background====
The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the [[oracle bone|shell and bone]] oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the [[Shang dynasty]] and with the literary works of the Western [[Zhou dynasty]], which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the [[Han dynasty]] under the title ''[[Chu Ci]]'', literally meaning something like "the literary material of Chu".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented  government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of [[Qu Yuan]] and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the ''Chu Ci'', and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)

====''Li Sao'', ''Yuan You'', and ''Jiu Bian''====
{{Main|Li Sao|Yuan You|Jiu Bian}}
The signature poem of the ''Chu Ci'' is the poem ''[[Li Sao]]''. By China's "first poet", [[Qu Yuan]], a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. "[[Yuan You]]", literally "The Far-off Journey" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does ''[[Jiu Bian]]'', as part of its climactic ending. In the ''Li Sao'', two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

====Questioning Heaven====
{{Main|Heavenly Questions}}
The ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' (literally "Questioning Heaven") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.

====''Jiu Ge''====
{{Main|Jiu Ge}}
The ''Jiu Ge'' may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the [[Yangzi River]] basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.

====Summoning the soul====
{{Further|Hun and po}}
Summoning the soul (''hun'') of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 ''Chu Ci'' pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.

====Individual wu shaman====
{{Main|List of wu shaman}} 
Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the ''Chu Ci''. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as "Shaman Ancestors". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received ''Chu Ci'' text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''Zhao Hun''/''Summons for the Soul''. He also appears in ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)

==Modern wu==
[[File:Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen, in July 1994 (Photo by Richard Noll).jpg|thumb|The [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman Chuonnasuan in July 1994.]]
The ancient Chinese traditions of ''wu''-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.

Scholars have studied many aspects of modern ''wu''. De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in [[Fujian]], called ''saigong'' (pinyin ''shigong'') 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed ''tongji'' mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] in northeast China.

Jordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west. (1995:117-8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">'''Yazdin''' (died 627) was an influential [[Iranian people|Iranian]] aristocrat, who served as the financial minister of the [[Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628).

== Biography ==
=== Origins and conversion to Christianity ===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the southwestern part of the [[Sasanian Empire]].]]
Yazdin was a native of [[Kirkuk]] in the [[Garamig ud Nodardashiragan]] province; he belonged to a high-class Iranian family{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=171}} (although of original [[Arameans|Aramean]] descent) which practiced [[Zoroastrianism]]. He was the son a certain Mihryar, and had a brother named Dadgushnasp.{{sfn|Becker|2013|p=32}} Yazdin's mother was the daughter of the governor (''[[marzban]]'') of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]].{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=299}} When Yazdin grew up, he was sent to a Zoroastrian school, which he, however, disliked and fled from. He shortly arrived to his foster parents who received him warmly. He was later found by his father, who, after having beaten him, sent him back to the school. Yazdin fled once again, and was in the end allowed to stay with his foster parents, while his brother Dadgushnasp would go to school instead. Yazdin visited the church several times with his foster parents, but in the end fled from them and got [[baptized]].{{sfn|Becker|2013|p=32}}

=== Financial ministry and death ===
Due to his aristocratic origin, Yazdin had much land under his possession, mostly near Kirkuk and [[Marga (East Syrian diocese)|Margha]].{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=171}} He is later mentioned as serving as the financial minister of king [[Khosrow II]]. Because Yazdin was a Christian and member of the [[Church of the East]], he did everything, to improve the position of his coreligionists. Yazdin built numerous churches and enjoyed the fullest confidence of Khosrow.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=171}}

During the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a certain Yazden was appointed as the governor of [[Armenia]]. This Yazden may have been the same person as Yazdin.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=175}} In 614, the Sasanians seized the [[True Cross]] and brought it to the capital [[Ctesiphon]], where Yazdin took care of the cross and had a celebration along with the other Christians of the Empire. He then sent a piece of the cross to [[Mount Izla]], a place near Nisibis.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=229}}

Yazdin also had rivals at the Sasanian court of Ctesiphon, which included Khosrow's wife [[Shirin]], and the royal physician [[Gabriel of Sinjar]], who unlike him, were both [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite Christians]], and were attempting to push back the influence of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] in favor of their church.

However, in 624, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Heraclius]] turned the tide of war against the Sasanians, and advanced into northern [[Adurbadagan]], and by 627, he was close to Ctesiphon. These Sasanian failures made Khosrow so angry that he had several of his officers, including Yazdin, executed. Yazdin had a son named [[Shamta]], who is said to have killed Khosrow.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=171}} However, according to other sources, it was the Iranian aristocrat [[Mihr Hormozd]], who had Khosrow killed.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=158}}
