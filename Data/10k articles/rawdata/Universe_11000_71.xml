On 4 March 2015, at around 05:20 local time, there was a [[mining accident]] at the [[Zasyadko coal mine]] in [[Donetsk People's Republic|rebel-held Eastern Ukraine]]. It is suspected to have been caused by a gas explosion.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine gas blast: 30 feared dead in Zasyadko coal mine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31725243|accessdate=4 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-three people were confirmed dead.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Local rebels claimed a death toll of 30.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; There were 230 people in the mine at the time of the explosion.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, [[Volodymyr Groysman]], called for a minute's silence for 32 fatalities, but later retracted that figure to say that one had died and 30 others' status was unknown.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Ukrainian President [[Petro Poroshenko]] called for police and rescue services to have access to the mine.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

}}
The '''2016 Southeastern United States gasoline shortage''' was an phenomenon caused by the [[2016 Colonial Pipeline Leak]] and the resulting [[panic buying]] in which many [[gas stations]] across six [[U.S. state|states]] have entirely run out of [[gasoline]], causing price hikes, halts of services, and several declarations of [[State of emergency|states of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/investing/gasoline-prices-shortage-pipeline-leak/index.html|title=Gasoline shortages, price hikes coming to East Coast after pipeline leak|last=Riley|first=Charles|date=2016-09-16|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, September 12, 2016, a leak occurred in [[Shelby County, Alabama]], spilling an estimated 350,000 US gallons of [[summer-grade]] gasoline, requiring a partial shutdown of the [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], and causing gas shortages in much of the [[Southeastern United States]]. Six states are affected ([[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Virginia]]), with Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia declaring [[State of emergency|states of emergency]]. These declarations have eliminated certain size and weight restrictions on vehicles carrying gasoline, and the hours which they are allowed to deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbrc.com/story/33088344/colonial-pipeline-at-least-350,000-gallons-of-gas-leaked-from-line|title=Colonial Pipeline: At least 42,000 gallons of gas leaked from line|website=wbrc.com|publisher=[[WBRC]]|last=Posey|first=Melanie|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[gas station]]s in the affected regions entirely ran out of gas. [[Panic buying]] greatly contributed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2016/09/17/panic-leads-long-gas-lines-nashville-again/90575330/|title=Worries lead to long gas lines in Nashville — again|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Colonial Pipeline]] leak in Shelby County, Alabama was first detected on September 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waaytv.com/ap/national/alabama-georgia-governors-lift-driver-rules-after-gas-spill/article_fad2e1ea-bbc2-5e55-b85e-75a99012a761.html|title=Alabama, Georgia governors lift driver rules after gas spill|last=Press|first=The Associated|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 17, the affected regions began experiencing gas shortages due to the leak and panic buying. [[Colonial Pipeline|Colonial]] has announced the construction of a bypass pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/gas-prices-up-stations-running-out-after-pipeline-spill/2016/09/17/8b3a4d32-7d3c-11e6-8064-c1ddc8a724bb_story.html|title=Colonial announces construction of temporary pipeline|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, Colonial Pipeline Company announced the completion of an emergency bypass pipeline. Whilst flow is now at optimal rates, Colonial claims it will be "several days" before processed fuel reaches and replenishes affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://helena.colonialresponse.com/|title=Helena – Colonial Pipeline Response|website=helena.colonialresponse.com|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''88888 Lights Out''' was a [[civil society campaign|campaign]] with the stated goal of increasing awareness of [[global warming]] and promoting actions to reduce energy consumption. By encouraging [[India]]'s residents to turn out the lights for eight minutes and to become more aware of environmental concerns, the organisers sought to limit [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and reduce pollution of the [[globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Earth/Global_Warming/Chennai_88888_Lights_Out_on_Aug_8/rssarticleshow/3326272.cms|title=Chennai: 88888 Lights Out on Aug 8|date=August 5, 2008|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign organisation ==
The campaign was started by [[Exnora International]],&lt;ref name="exnoraThemselves"/&gt; a [[NGO|non-governmental organisation]] in [[India]]. It called for people to switch off their lights for eight minutes at 8 p.m. on August 8, 2008 (8-8-8-8-8) to spread awareness and take action to reduce energy consumption and the resulting environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/08/stories/2008080861190600.htm|title=‘Lights Out 88888’ campaign launched |date=2008-08-08|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Chennai]], Governor [[Surjit Singh Barnala]] ordered the lights off in [[Raj Bhavan (Tamil Nadu)|Raj Bhavan]] at 8 p.m. for 8 minutes and said that an awakening should be created among the people of all walks of life on the root cause of global warming, it occurred at the very beginning of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/09/stories/2008080958530300.htm|title=Campaign eloquent as lights fall ‘silent’|date=2008-08-09|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort has been part of a wider effort by the groups involved to bring attention to environmental issues.&lt;ref name="exnoraThemselves"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chennai Lights Out Campaign builds awareness|url=http://www.exnorainternational.org/events.shtml#Campaign|publisher=Exnora|accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1595">'''Acoustic plaster''' is [[plaster]] which contains fibres or aggregate so that it [[absorption (acoustics)|absorbs sound]].

Such plaster is applied in thicknesses of up to 1.5 inches.  As compared with other sound insulation, it is easy to apply and is [[fireproof]] but it can be more fragile, being affected by physical stress and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings | page=802 | chapter=Building Noise Control | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EL4nt2VFTZIC&amp;pg=PA802 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustic plaster is used in construction of rooms which require good acoustic qualities such as [[auditorium|auditoria]] and [[library|libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Public library buildings | author=Dana Quick McComb | year=1935 | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Time-saver standards |year=1950 | publisher=F.

Proprietary types of acoustic plaster developed in the 1920s included Macoustic Plaster, Sabinite, Kalite, Wyodak, Old Newark and Sprayo-Flake produced by companies such as [[USG Corporation|US Gypsum]].  These superseded [[felt]]s and [[quilt]]s as a common preference of architects but were difficult to apply and so were superseded in turn by [[acoustic tile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hearing history |author=Mark Michael Smith |page=350 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8203-2582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acrylate polymers''' belong to a group of [[polymer]]s which could be referred to generally as [[plastic]]s.  They are noted for their transparency, resistance to breakage, and elasticity. They are also commonly known as '''acrylics''' or '''polyacrylates'''. Acrylate polymer is commonly used in cosmetics such as nail polish as an adhesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Erich Penzel
|title=Polyacrylates|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acrylate]] [[monomer]]s, used  to form acrylate polymers, are based on the structure of [[acrylic acid]], which consists of a [[vinyl group]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] ester terminus or a nitrile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Takashi Ohara, Takahisa Sato, Noboru Shimizu, Günter Prescher, Helmut Schwind, Otto Weiberg, Klaus Marten, Helmut Greim|title=Acrylic Acid and Derivatives|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH, |location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_161.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pslc.ws/macrog/acrylate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other typical acrylate monomers are derivatives of acrylic acid, such as [[methyl methacrylate]] in which one vinyl hydrogen and the carboxylic acid hydrogen are both replaced by [[methyl]] groups, and [[acrylonitrile]] in which the carboxylic acid group is replaced by the related [[nitrile]] group.

Acrylic elastomer is a general term for a type of [[synthetic rubber]] whose main component is [[acrylic acid]] [[alkyl]][[ester]] ([[Ethyl group|ethyl]] or [[butyl ester]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6015860/claims.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612111417/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6015860/claims.html |archivedate=2011-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acrylic elastomer has characteristics of heat and [[oil]] resistance. 

It is divided into old type and new type: Old types include ACM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether) containing chlorine and ANM (copolymer of acrylic acid ester and acrylonitrile) without chloride. 
Other than the slightly better water resistance of ANM, there are no physical differences; even processability is poor for both types. Since prices are also high, demand is not so high vis-à-vis the characteristics. On the other hand, the new type of acrylic rubber does not contain any chlorine despite its unclear chemical composition. Processability has been improved; most of the tackiness to rolls, as well as staining problems related to mold have been solved. 

Major characteristics of acrylic rubber include heat resistance and oil resistance; it can endure a temperature of 170–180 ℃ under dry heat or in oil. Since it does not have a double bond, acrylic rubber also boasts of good weatherability and ozone resistance. 

Its cold resistance is not that good, however. The saturation point is −15 ℃ for the old type and −28...−30 ℃ for the new type. In terms of vulcanization, the standard method for the old type is amine vulcanization. To minimize permanent deformation, the old type requires curing for 24 hours at a temperature of 150 ℃. On the other hand, for the new type, the press curing time and follow-up vulcanization time are significantly reduced by combining metal soap and sulfur. It has no special characteristics. The rebound resilience and abrasion resistance of the new type are poor, and even its electrical characteristics are considerably poor compared with acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and butyl rubber. 

The materials are used mainly for oil seals and packagings related to automobiles.

Compositional objects are wholes instantiated by collections of parts.  If an [[ontology]] wishes to permit the inclusion of compositional objects it must define which collections of objects are to be considered parts composing a whole.  [[Mereology]], the study of relationships between parts and their wholes, provides specifications on how parts must relate to one another in order to compose a whole.

== Mereology of material objects ==
Ontological disputes do not revolve around what particular matter is present; rather, the center of disputation is what objects can be said to be instantiated by a given collection of matter.  The token objects posited by a given ontology may be classified as instances of one or more distinct object types.  As the types of objects accepted proliferate, so do the possible tokens that a given collection of matter can be said to instantiate.  This creates variations in size between ontologies, which serve as an arena for disputes among philosophers.  The ontologies of present concern are those that include compositional objects among posited types.  Compositional objects are objects made of a collection of one or more parts .  These objects seem to be included in any intuitively constructed ontology as objects ordinarily encountered are doubtless composed of parts.  For example, any ontology that affirms the existence of tables, rabbits, or rocks necessarily commits to the inclusion of some compositional objects.  The specification of ‘some’ compositional objects foretells the point of attack suffered by these theories.  Clarification demands that these theories provide a means to account for which compositional objects are included and which are excluded.  One may include tables and, presumably, chairs, but what about the composition of the table and surrounding chairs?  What characteristics of a collection of parts determine that they form a whole?

=== Mereological Nihilism ===
Mereological nihilism is an extreme eliminative position.  Mereological nihilism denies that any objects actually instantiate the parthood relation appealed to in theoretical descriptions of mereology.  If there are no relationships that count as parthood relationships, then there are no composite objects.  One may initially seek to reject such a position by pointing to its counterintuitive conclusions.  However, there are other mereological positions that prove equally counterintuitive and so a more substantial rebuttal is required.  A principled rejection of mereological nihilism is put forward those committed to atomless gunk.  A mereology is gunky if every part is itself a whole composed of further parts.  There is no end to the decomposition of objects, no fundamental part or mereological atom.  There is no place for the atoms posited by mereological nihilism in gunky ontologies.  This causes a problem because if all that exists are atoms, but there is nothing like an atom that exists within an ontology, then nothing can be said to exist (Van Cleve, 2008).  Noting the appeal of accepting that things do exist, one must reject mereological nihilism in order to maintain a gunky ontology.  Not everyone will strive to maintain a gunky ontology and so mereological nihilism is still potentially a viable position.

=== Conservative Theories ===
There are various attempts to conserve the existence of parthood relationships.  These theories all attempt to specify characteristics that a collection of objects must possess in order to compose a whole.  Characteristics may derive from some principle or be proposed as brute fact.

==== Principled Accounts ====
A principled account of the composition relationship will appeal to a general characteristic which is sufficient to instantiate the relationship.  Many of these accounts appeal to characteristics derived from intuitive notions about what does or does not allow objects to function as parts in a whole.  Two such proposed restricting characteristics are connection and cohesion (Van Cleve, 2008).  First, connection is the stipulation that objects must be spatially continuous to some degree in order to be considered parts composing a whole.  Objects like tables are made of legs connected to tops.  Tables and legs are in direct contact with one another, the parts are spatially contiguous.  Yet, the chairs are only in proximity to the table and so do not compose a table set.  In order to maintain the standard of absolute contiguity one would have to recruit the air molecules bridging span between the table and chairs.  This is unsatisfactory though because it fails to exclude extraordinary objects such as the table, the air molecules, and the dog’s nose as he begs for food.  It seems that it is necessary to redefine connection as some degree of proximity between parts within a whole .
	By abandoning the extreme of direct contact, any account of connection acquires the burden of defining what degree of proximity instantiates composition.  It will not do to leave specification of degree for future theorists if one cannot even show it is possible to provide such a determination in a principled manner.  The continuum of the spatial dimension is a three dimensional axes composed of distinct ordered points.  Suppose absolute succession of points along a dimension corresponds to direct contact of parts.  According to a moderate formulation of connection, composition is instantiated by two objects separated by a countable number of discrete points (x), where (x) need not be one, but cannot be unbounded.  Unfortunately, even the more moderate formulation is untenable.  Criticizing the possibility of bounding degree, Sider (2001) takes as given these premises:
(1)	On a continuum of discrete points, if there are both instances of both composition and not, then the series of points instantiating composition (e.g. (1, 2, 3, 4)) is continuous with any series not (e.g. (5, 6, 7)).
(2)	There is no principled way determine a cutoff for composition along such continuums (no non-arbitrary way to determine between (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 3, 4)).
(3)	 Since the nature of existence does not allow for indeterminacy a cutoff must be specified (a failure to determine between (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 3, 4) leaves (4) in a position between existence and non-existence that does not exist).
Conclusion: If composition is to be non-arbitrary then it must either always occur or never.
Sider’s rejection of any bounding of degree is not particular to spatial proximity.  Degree of cohesion can also be represented as a continuum.  Much like absolute spatial contiguity was determined too strict, absolute cohesion is also rejected.  To illustrate Van Cleve (2008) describes how a rod and line compose a fishing rod.  The line must move with the rod to some degree.  In order to accomplish this knots of line are tied around the rod.  As the knots are tightened the line becomes more and more fixed to the rod.  There is a cutoff where the line could be tighter, yet is tight enough to compose the fishing rod.  Any variable represented on a continuum will fail to provide a principled determination of this cutoff.

==== Brute Accounts ====
===== Van Inwagen's 'Life' =====
According to Van Inwagen a collection of objects are considered parts composing a whole when that whole demonstrates life (Van Cleeve, 2008).  This approach guarantees the existence of you and me, while ruling out extraordinary objects consistent with other conservative theories.  Detractors of the 'life' criterion point out the difficulty of defining when life is present.  It is not clear if a virion, a virus particle composed of nucleic acid and surrounding capsid, is a compositional object or not.  Additionally, in some formerly paradigmatic cases of life it can be difficult to identify when it is no longer present, and thus the compositional object is no longer extant (e.g. brain death).

=== Mereological Universalism ===
Mereological universalism is an extreme permissive position.  Essentially, mereological universalism contends that any collection of objects constitutes a whole.  This secures the existence of any compositional objects intuitively thought to exist.  However, by the same light that ordinary objects exist, so do much stranger ones.  For example, there exists both the object composed of my key ring and keys and the object composed of the moon and six pennies located on James Van Cleve’s desk (Van Cleve, 2008).  Motivation for such a counterintuitive position is not immediately apparent, but arises from the ability to reject all alternatives.  Despite little intuitive appeal, mereological universalism seems less susceptible to principled rejection than any of its alternatives.

'''Daniel Dingel''' was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] engineer who claimed to have invented a “''hydrogen reactor''” able to power a [[water-fuelled car]].

==Hydrogen Reactor car==
Dingel says he began working on his hydrogen reactor in 1969, and claims to have used the device to power his [[Toyota Corolla E110|1996 Toyota Corolla]]. Dingel explains that his invention splits  producing hydrogen from water in an onboard water tank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Norman|title=On demand system for using water (HHO) as a sole fuel|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=0evbAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=daniel+dingel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JqvmTpW-OPGaiQfm3Iz8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dingel&amp;f=false|publisher=[[USPTO]]|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and does not produce any carbon emissions. However, he has never revealed the secret to his invention.&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;{{Citation

==Investment by Formosa Plastics Group and Estafa case==
In November 2000, John Ding Young of [[Formosa Plastics Group]] (FPG) sought Dingel out and, convinced that the invention was genuine, signed a “preliminary understanding” with him for several projects.&lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt; He aims to have business partners to get an "[[Patent Cooperation Treaty|international patent]]" and to commercialize his technology.&lt;ref name="Alarilla"/&gt;

In December 2008, Dingel became even more controversial when he was found guilty and sentenced to a maximum of 20 years imprisonment in an Estafa (swindling) case filed against him by Young and FPG. In a decision dated Dec. 9, 2008  Judge Rolando How of the [[Parañaque City]] Regional Trial Court’s Branch 257 found him guilty of taking $410,000 from FPG, saying that Dingel "''defrauded Young when the inventor failed to fulfill his obligation of developing his “hydrogen reactor” and creating experimental cars in 2000.''" &lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt;

Young claimed that Dingel signed a joint venture agreement with FPG, and initially received $30,000 in goodwill money and $20,000 for research and development. Young said that Dingel then visited the FPG headquarters in [[Taipei]] and asked for $300,000 so he could purchase three cars which he would use as prototypes when he returned to the Philippines.  Young adds that in September 2001 he sent another $60,000 in additional funds, as agreed upon in the joint venture agreement.&lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt;

Former [[Solicitor-General of the Philippines|Philippine Solicitor General]] [[Frank Chavez (Solicitor General)|Frank Chavez]], whom Dingel asked to serve as his counsel, said that he would appeal the court decision before it became final on the Christmas Eve of 2008.&lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt;

Daniel Dingel died on October 18, 2010 in Las Pinas City, Metro Manila in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aldred|first=Peter|title=The Dingel Foundation|url=http://dinglefoundation.com/|publisher=Ethos World News|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11088">[[File:White Background - Cropped.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Dewatering screw press]]
A '''dewatering screw press''' is a [[screw press]] that separates [[liquid]]s from [[solid]]s. A screw press can be used in place of a belt press, [[centrifuge]], or [[filter paper]].  It is a simple, slow moving device that accomplishes dewatering by continuous gravitational drainage.  Screw presses are often used for materials that are difficult to press, for example those that tend to pack together.  The screw press squeezes the material against a [[Mechanical screening|screen]] or [[Filtration|filter]] and the liquid is collected through the screen for collection and use.  

==History==
An example of a dewatering press is a [[wine press]].  Dating back to [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], these machines worked similarly to the modern screw press but possessed some disadvantages which have been corrected and improved within modern presses. The ancient wine press only allowed for [[grape]]s to be juiced in batches and often a thick cake would form against the screen, making it difficult for the juice to flow through the screen and be collected for wine.  Most modern screw presses allow for a continuous flow of material by surrounding the screw with a screen, which also helps to avoid the build up of a layer of solid material on the screen. One modern approach even removes the screen in favor of a system of fixed and moving rings, which often eliminates solids buildup entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PWTech Volute Dewatering Press:|url=http://pwtech.us/HTML/volute_dewater.html|website=Process Wastewater Technologies, LLC|accessdate=10 October 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly known screw press of this design is said to have been invented by famous Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] and is known as the [[screw conveyor]].  The screw conveyor consists of a shaft, which is surrounded by a spiral steel plate, similar in design and appearance to a [[corkscrew]].  This design is used in a multitude of screw presses.  There are some machines of this and also of similar design that are not screw presses at all - they do not separate solids from liquids but are instead used to fuse them together.  An example of this is a [[Molding (process)|mold]]-filling machine. [[Plastic]] pellets are inserted at one end and heat is applied, melting the pellets and discharging them into a mold.  Another example is known as a cooker-extruder and is used in the production of snack foods such as [[pretzel]]s and more.

==Design==
Most screw presses can have dilute materials pumped directly into the screw press, although pre-thickening sometimes improves the performance of the press.  This is typically done with a static or sidehill screen, a rotating drum screen, belt press, or a gravity table.

Patented in 1900, Valerius Anderson’s interrupted flight design is most commonly used as opposed to the continuous flight design.  Anderson, upon studying the continuous flight design, noticed that it led to co-rotation and a less efficient job being done dewatering, especially with softer materials.  He solved this by putting interruptions on the flights of the screw.  The interruptions allowed for the materials to stop moving forward between interruptions along the shaft and also allows for an adequate buildup of the material before it is pushed through the screw press to container that catches the material.  This allowed for a better job at the dewatering and a consistent cake material being released.  

The interrupted flight design screw presses uses were broadened from just soft or mushy materials to include most materials screw presses were used for because unlike the continuous design screw presses the interrupted flight design did not require constant feed or consistency of material.  If either were diminished in the continuous design so would production of the dewatered product, in order to avoid this while maintaining the continuous flight design a larger and heavier press with variable speed settings was a necessity; the press also entailed the need of an operator.  

The interrupted flight design eliminated the need for consistency as the compression of the screw did not change as the material did not progress through the screw until a sufficient amount of the material had formed, as described above.  This also eliminates the need for changing speed and an operator.  The design allows for self-correction and efficiency that is unavailable with the continuous design.  It allowed for a more economically effective screw press that has been used for more than just slimy or slippery materials.

After a period of time and its initial patent, resistor teeth were added to the presses where there was no flighting in order to increase the agitation of the materials adding to the limitation of the tendencies of co-rotation within the press

===Options===
The buildup of press cake moisture is controlled by a discharge door or cone.  Screw presses possess different options that include perforated/slotted screens, a rotating cone, hard surfacing on the screw, and supplemental screen surface in the inlet hopper on the face of the cone.  The standard construction for screw presses is of [[stainless steel]] with a [[carbon steel]] frame on the larger presses.  

===Capacity===
The specific details of the design of a screw press depend on the material however.  The configurations, screw speeds, screens for maximum outlet consistency, including an excellent capture rate vary per material.  Most screw presses are designed to feed material that has a 40-60% water make up.  The length and diameter ratio of the screw press also depends on the material.  The range of the capacity of a screw press

===Drive===
Larger presses use a foot-mounted [[Gear ratio|gearbox]] while smaller presses use a hollow-shaft gearbox.  Currently, nearly all presses are driven by [[electric motor]]s due to their reliable and low cost frequency drives.  The electric motors replaced the previously popular [[hydraulic motor]] drives. A vertical design was popular in the 1800s through the 1950s but they are no longer made. Most screw presses are currently built with the screws in a horizontal configuration. One newer version uses an angled screw design to reduce floor footprint and press cake moisture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PWTech Volute Dewatering Press:|url=http://pwtech.us/HTML/volute_dewater.html|website=Process Wastewater Technologies, LLC|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compressive Mechanisms===
Compression is created within the screw press by increasing the inner shaft diameter of the screw.  For example, if a 16" screw press has a 6" shaft at the start, the flights on the screw will be 5" tall.  If this 6" shaft diameter is then increased to 12" at the discharge, the fights will be only 2" tall at this point.  Thus compression is applied as the material is being pressed from a 5" opening through a 2" space.  

This compression can also be achieved tightening the separation of the flights of the screw.  If at the inlet, the pitch is 16", the material thus will move 16" with each revolution.  If it is then decreased to 8" at the point of discharge, the material will move 8" per revolution.  This results in there being more material forced into the press than there is being forced out of the press at a time.  This creates the desired compression and pushes the liquid through the screen.

Another way to achieve compression is to place a cone at the point of discharge.  This can also be called a choke, stopper, or door.  In many designs it is bolted into a fixed position, making a fixed, smaller opening which the material must pass through.  More commonly found however, the screw press has the cone pushed into the point of discharge via a hydraulic or air cylinder.  

===Specialized types===
Some other types of presses are vapor-tight presses, and twin-screw presses.  Vapor-tight presses are used during the production of soybean protein concentrate (SPC), [[citrus]] and [[apple]] [[pectin]], bioresin, and [[Xanthan gum]].  Twin-screw presses contain two overlapping compression screws.  This is more complicated on a mechanical level because the screws must remain synchronized in order for them to work properly.  These are often used for slippery materials and feature an internal shredding action.

==Classification==
There are two major kinds of screw presses of this design.  One type, known as Expellers ®, removes water from fibrous material, while the other removes free liquid from a material. 

===Expellers===
{{main|Expeller pressing}}
Oil expellers are used to squeeze the [[fat]] out of [[soybean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[sunflower]] seeds, canola (rape seeds), and other [[oil seed]]s.  The expeller works by exerting extremely high pressures which convert the fat in seeds into a liquid oil.  Once the oil is liquefied the oil flows through the screen and is collected.

===Removal of free liquid===
Screw presses that are used to free liquid from material are commonly used in the [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]] industries, [[municipal]] [[biosolids]], [[septage]] and [[grease trap]] sludge, [[food]] production, food waste, [[manure]], and also within the [[chemical industry]].

==Applications==
===Pulp and paper industries===
Pulp and paper industries remove water within [[cellulose fiber]].

===Sewage disposal===
Biosolids are dewatered and heated through a specific process which includes raising the [[pH]] to a level of 12.  Septage and grease trap sludge is dewatered with a simple screw press of the above stated design.  Nutrient management programs dewater [[Pig|hog]] and [[cow]] manure for sale and commercial use.

===Food processing===
[[Alcohol]] solutions are squeezed from foods with screw presses (such as [[soybean]]s, [[protein]], [[pectin]], and [[xanthan gum]].)  Food processing factories use screw presses to separate water from waste streams and convert the  solid into animal feeds.  For example, [[sugar beet]] pulp, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] [[Peel (fruit)|peel]], and spent [[grain]].

Fish and orange peel dewatering often provide maximum yield when dewatered within a press of the interrupted flight design and with the addition of steam begin injected into the material.  Commonly steam injection holes are drilled into the resistor teeth of the press close to the screw's shaft.

===Chemical industry===
Within the chemical industry screw presses are used for “ABS, [[sodium alginate]] and [[carrageenan]], [[synthetic rubber]], [[synthetic resin]], hydrated [[polymer]], [[naphthalene]], [[elastomer]]ic adhesive, [[color film]] emulsion, CmC, [[pharmaceuticals]]” and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fkcscrewpress.com/chemicali.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">The '''Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority''' (EAEA) has been established in 1955. It leads the national research and development in the basic and applied peaceful nuclear research. 

Egypt was the second in the African Continent, after South Africa, to build a nuclear reactor. The first research reactor ([[ETRR-1|ET-RR-1]]), commissioned in 1961, is a Van de Graf type 4 MW reactor engineered and built by Russia.  Another research reactor ([[ETRR-2|ET-RR-2]]) is 22 MW open pool MultiPurpose Reactor (MPR) located at Inshas, 60&amp;nbsp;km from Cairo, engineered and built by [[INVAP]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;For more information and data sheet about the reactor, see its data sheet provided by the manufacturer [http://www.invap.net/nuclear/etrr-2/data-e.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EAEA has scientists educated in the topmost universities and research institutes. It is organized into four research centers: 

* [[Nuclear Research Center]] (NRC)
* [[Hot Laboratory and Waste Management Center]] (HLWMC)
* National Centre for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT)
* National Centre for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control (NCNSRC)

These centres are further subdivided into major research divisions. 

The EAEA is a member of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and other regional and international organizations.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|enˈriːko ˈfermi|lang}}; 29 September 1901&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1954) was an Italian and naturalized-American physicist and the creator of the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], the [[Chicago Pile-1]]. He has been called the "architect of the [[nuclear age]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enrico-fermi-architect-of-the-nuclear-age-dies|title=Enrico Fermi, architect of the nuclear age, dies|date=Autumn 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "architect of the atomic bomb".&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He was one of the very few physicists in history to excel both [[theoretical physics|theoretically]] and [[experimental physics|experimentally]]. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[induced radioactivity]] by neutron bombardment and the discovery of [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]].  He made significant contributions to the development of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].

Fermi's first major contribution was to statistical mechanics. After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an [[ideal gas]], employing a statistical formulation now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called "[[fermion]]s". Later Pauli postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during [[beta decay]], to satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]]. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the "[[neutrino]]". His theory, later referred to as [[Fermi's interaction]] and still later as [[weak interaction]], described one of the [[fundamental interaction|four fundamental forces of nature]]. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered [[neutron]]s, Fermi discovered that [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] than fast ones, and developed the [[Fermi age equation]] to describe this. After bombarding [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements; although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were subsequently revealed to be [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]].

Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new [[Italian Racial Laws]] that affected his Jewish wife [[Laura Capon]]. He emigrated to the United States where he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first artificial self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. He was on hand when the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], went critical in 1943, and when the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] did so the next year. At [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] he headed F Division, part of which worked on [[Edward Teller]]'s [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] "[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]" bomb. He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, where he used his [[Fermi problem|Fermi method]] to estimate the bomb's yield.

After the war, Fermi served under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] on nuclear matters and policy. Following the detonation of the first Soviet [[fission bomb]] in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|hearing]] that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s, and he speculated that [[cosmic ray]]s arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are [[list of things named after Enrico Fermi|named after Fermi]], including the [[Enrico Fermi Award]], the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]], and the synthetic element [[fermium]], making him one of 16 scientists who have [[List of scientists whose names are used in chemical element names|elements named after them]].

== Early life ==
[[File:BirthHouseOfEnricoFermi01.jpg|thumb|right|Via Gaeta 19, Rome, where Fermi was born]]
Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1901. He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head (''{{lang|it|Capo Divisione}}'') in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=3–4, 8}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=23}} His sister, Maria, was two years older than him, and his brother Giulio was a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be [[wet nurse]]d, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=19}}  Although he was baptised a [[Roman Catholic]] in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; Enrico was an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] throughout his adult life. As a young boy he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building [[electric motor]]s and playing with electrical and mechanical toys.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=5–6}} Giulio died during the administration of an anesthetic for an operation on a throat [[abscess]] in 1915.{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=15–16}} Maria died in an airplane crash near [[Milan|Milano]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |title=Maria Fermi Sacchetti (1899-1959) |website=www.OlgiateOlona26giugno1959.org |access-date=6 May 2017 |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830153427/http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |archivedate=30 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Fermi's first sources for his study of physics was a book he found at the local market at ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' in Rome. Published in 1840, the 900-page ''Elementorum physicae mathematicae'', was written in Latin by [[Jesuit]] Father [[Andrea Caraffa]], a professor at the [[Collegio Romano]]. It covered [[mathematics]], [[classical mechanics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[acoustics]], insofar as these disciplines were understood when the book was written.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=7}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=315}} Fermi befriended another scientifically inclined student, [[Enrico Persico]],{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=24}} and together the two worked on scientific projects such as building [[gyroscope]]s and trying to accurately measure the acceleration of Earth's [[gravity]].{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=11-12}} Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged by his father's colleague Adolfo Amidei, who gave him several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated quickly.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=8–10}}

== ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in Pisa ==
[[File:Enrico Fermi giovane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Enrico Fermi as a student in Pisa]]
Fermi graduated from high school in July 1918 and, at Amidei's urging, applied to the ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola Normale Superiore]]'' in [[Pisa]]. Having lost one son, his parents were reluctant to let him move away from home for four years while attending it, but in the end they acquiesced. The school provided free lodging for students, but candidates had to take a difficult entrance exam that included an essay. The given theme was "Specific characteristics of Sounds". The 17-year-old Fermi chose to derive and solve the [[partial differential equation]] for a vibrating rod, applying [[Fourier analysis]] in the solution. The examiner, Professor Giulio Pittarelli from the Sapienza University of Rome, interviewed Fermi and praised him, saying that he would become an outstanding physicist in the future. Fermi achieved first place in the classification of the entrance exam.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=11–13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/1173/ |title=Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana - Giulio Pittarelli |publisher=Scuola Normale Superiore |language=Italian |access-date=6 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years at the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'', Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named [[Franco Rasetti]] with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the director of the physics laboratory, [[Luigi Puccianti]], who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|pp=15–18}} During this time Fermi learned [[tensor calculus]], a mathematical technique invented by [[Gregorio Ricci]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] that was needed to demonstrate the principles of [[general relativity]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=320}} Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[atomic physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}

In September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and [[Nello Carrara]]—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research [[X-ray crystallography]], and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=20}} During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal ''[[Nuovo Cimento]]''. The first was entitled "On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion" (''{{Lang|it|Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio}}''). A sign of things to come was that the [[mass]] was expressed as a [[tensor]]—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was "On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges" (''{{lang|it|Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche}}''). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the [[speed of light]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317–319}}

The first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper "Concerning a contradiction between [[electrodynamic]] and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal ''[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Über einen Widerspruch zwischen der elektrodynamischen und relativistischen Theorie der elektromagnetischen Masse |language=German |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=23 |pages=340–344 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=1059488 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Fermi submitted his article "On the phenomena occurring near a [[world line]]" (''{{lang|it|Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria}}'') to the Italian journal ''[[I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei]]''. In this article he examined the [[Principle of Equivalence]], and introduced the so-called "[[Fermi coordinates]]". He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves as if it were a [[Euclidean space]].{{sfn|Bertotti|2001|p=115}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}

[[File:World line2.svg|left|thumb|A [[light cone]] is a three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in [[spacetime]]. Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed. The time line is the vertical axis.]]
Fermi submitted his thesis, "A theorem on probability and some of its applications" (''{{lang|it|Un teorema di calcolo delle probabilità ed alcune sue applicazioni}}''), to the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in July 1922, and received his [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|laurea]] at the unusually young age of 20. The thesis was on [[X-ray diffraction]] images. [[Theoretical physics]] was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was one on [[experimental physics]]. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}

While writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book ''Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity'' by [[August Kopff]] in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the famous [[Mass–energy equivalence|Einstein equation]] ({{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) was an enormous amount of [[nuclear potential energy]] to be exploited. "It does not seem possible, at least in the near future", he wrote, "to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it."{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}

In 1924 Fermi was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the [[Masonic Lodge]] "Adriano Lemmi" of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goilombardia.it/massoni-illustri/enrico-fermi|title=Enrico Fermi L'Uomo, lo Scienziato e il Massone|language=Italian |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermi decided to travel abroad, and spent a semester studying under [[Max Born]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he met [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan]]. Fermi then studied in [[Leiden]] with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] obtained through the intercession of the mathematician [[Vito Volterra]]. Here Fermi met [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], and became good friends with [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]].  From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught [[mathematical physics]] and [[theoretical mechanics]] at the [[University of Florence]], where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and [[solid state physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=321–324}} While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schrödinger equation, the Italian physicist would often say, "It has no business to fit so well!"{{sfn|Hey|Walters|2003|p=61}}

After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper "On the quantisation of the perfect monoatomic gas" (''{{lang|it|Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico}}''), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which  describes the distribution of particles in [[physical system|systems]] of many [[identical particles]] that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]], who also showed how it was related to the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. Accordingly, it is now known as [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=329–330}} Following Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called "[[fermion]]s", while those that do not are called "[[boson]]s".{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=31}}

== Professor in Rome ==

From Left to right: [[Oscar D'Agostino]], [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Franco Rasetti]] and Fermi]]
Professorships in Italy were granted by competition (''{{lang|it|concorso}}'') for a vacant chair, the applicants being rated on their publications by a committee of professors. Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the [[University of Cagliari]] on [[Sardinia]], but was narrowly passed over in favour of [[Giovanni Giorgi]].{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=37–38}} In 1926, at the age of 24, he applied for a professorship at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. This was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of Professor [[Orso Mario Corbino]], who was the University's professor of experimental physics, the Director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=45}} The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and [[Aldo Pontremoli]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=38}} and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Ettore Majorana]] and [[Emilio Segrè]], and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=127}} They were soon nicknamed the "[[Via Panisperna boys]]" after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DipWeb/museo/fermi.html |title=Enrico Fermi e i ragazzi di via Panisperna |language=Italian |publisher=University of Rome |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermi married [[Laura Capon]], a science student at the University, on 19 July 1928.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=61}} They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=38–39}} On 18 March 1929, Fermi was appointed a member of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]] by  Mussolini, and on 27 April he joined the [[Fascist Party]]. He later opposed Fascism when the 1938 [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]] were promulgated by Mussolini in order to bring Italian Fascism ideologically closer to German [[National Socialism]]. These laws threatened Laura, who was Jewish, and put many of Fermi's research assistants out of work.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fermi.lib.uchicago.edu/fermibiog.htm |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |title=About Enrico Fermi |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/ottobre/02/Cosi_Fermi_scopri_natura_vessatoria_co_0_0110022882.shtml |authorlink=Paolo Mieli |first=Paolo |last=Mieli |title=''Così Fermi scoprì la natura vessatoria del fascismo'' |language=Italian |newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=2 October 2001 |accessdate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204537/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/ottobre/02/Cosi_Fermi_scopri_natura_vessatoria_co_0_0110022882.shtml |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Strumenti/Strumenti_CLXVII.pdf |author=Direzione generale per gli archivi |title=''Reale accademia d'Italia:inventario dell'archivio'' |language=Italian |year=2005 |publisher=Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali |location=Rome |page=xxxix |accessdate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907065146/http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Strumenti/Strumenti_CLXVII.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Legal Examination of Mussolini's Race Laws|url=http://primolevicenter.org/printed-matter/a-legal-examination-of-mussolinis-race-laws/|website=Printed Matter|publisher=Centro Primo Levi|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their time in Rome, Fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his ''Introduction to Atomic Physics'' (''{{Lang|it|Introduzione alla fisica atomica}}''), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}} Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from his own research.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=38}} A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist [[Hans Bethe]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=217}} who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper "On the Interaction between Two Electrons" ({{Lang-de|Über die Wechselwirkung von Zwei Elektronen}}).{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333–335}}

At this time, physicists were puzzled by [[beta decay]], in which an [[electron]] was emitted from the [[atomic nucleus]]. To satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]], Pauli postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a "[[neutrino]]".{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=346}}&lt;ref name="Beta decay"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fermi | first = E.| title = Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay (English translation by Fred L.

The neutrino was detected after his death, and his interaction theory showed why it was so difficult to detect. When he submitted his paper to the British journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that journal's editor turned it down because it contained speculations which were "too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers".{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=346}} Thus Fermi saw the theory published in Italian and German before it was published in English.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=127}}

In the introduction to the 1968 English translation, physicist Fred L. Wilson noted that:{{quote|Fermi's theory, aside from bolstering Pauli's proposal of the neutrino, has a special significance in the history of modern physics. One must remember that only the naturally occurring β emitters were known at the time the theory was proposed. Later when positron decay was discovered, the process was easily incorporated within Fermi's original framework. On the basis of his theory, the capture of an orbital electron by a nucleus was predicted and eventually observed. With time much experimental data has accumulated. Although peculiarities have been observed many times in β decay, Fermi's theory always has been equal to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;The consequences of the Fermi theory are vast. For example, β spectroscopy was established as a powerful tool for the study of nuclear structure. But perhaps the most influential aspect of this work of Fermi is that his particular form of the β interaction established a pattern which has been appropriate for the study of other types of interactions. It was the first successful theory of the creation and annihilation of material particles. Previously, only photons had been known to be created and destroyed.&lt;ref name="Beta decay" /&gt;}}

In January 1934, [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] and [[Frédéric Joliot]] announced that they had bombarded elements with [[alpha particle]]s and induced [[radioactivity]] in them.&lt;ref name="JoliotCurie1934a"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Joliot|first2=Frédéric|last1=Joliot-Curie|first1=Irène|title=Un nouveau type de radioactivité|trans-title=A new type of radioactivity|journal=Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=198|issue=January–June 1934|date=15 January 1934|language=French|pages=254–256|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31506/f254.image}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JoliotCurie1934b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joliot|first1=Frédéric|last2=Joliot-Curie|first2=Irène|title=Artificial Production of a New Kind of Radio-Element|journal=Nature|volume=133|issue=3354 |year=1934|pages=201–202 |doi=10.1038/133201a0|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/5/2/xii.full.pdf|bibcode = 1934Natur.133..201J }}&lt;/ref&gt; By March, Fermi's assistant [[Gian-Carlo Wick]] had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the [[neutron]], which [[James Chadwick]] had discovered in 1932.{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=152–153}} In March 1934, Fermi wanted to see if he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's [[polonium]]-[[beryllium]] [[neutron source]]. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a [[particle accelerator]], which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–351}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=153–156}}

[[File:RasettiFermiSegre.JPG|thumb|Enrico Fermi between [[Franco Rasetti]] (left) and [[Emilio Segrè]] in [[academic dress]]]]
Fermi had the idea to resort to replacing the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a [[radon]]-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 m[[Curie|Ci]] of radon gas, supplied by [[Giulio Cesare Trabacchi]].{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=73}}&lt;ref name="De Gregorio2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Gregorio|first1=Alberto G.|title=Neutron physics in the early 1930s|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|volume=35 |issue=2|year=2005 |pages=293–340 |doi=10.1525/hsps.2005.35.2.293 |arxiv=physics/0510044}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day [[half-life]] of radon. He knew that this source would also emit [[gamma ray]]s, but, on the basis of his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding [[platinum]], an element with a high [[atomic number]] that was readily available, without success. He turned to [[aluminium]], which emitted an alpha particle and produced [[sodium]], which then decayed into [[magnesium]] by beta particle emission. He tried [[lead]], without success, and then [[fluorine]] in the form of [[calcium fluoride]], which emitted an alpha particle and produced [[nitrogen]], decaying into [[oxygen]] by beta particle emission.

The natural radioactivity of [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] made it hard to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called [[hesperium]] and [[ausonium]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–349}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=153–156}} The chemist [[Ida Noddack]] criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium ([[technetium]]) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=161–162}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–349}}

[[File:Beta-minus Decay.svg|thumb|left|[[Beta decay]]. A [[neutron]] decays into a [[proton]], and an [[electron]] is emitted. In order for the total energy in the system to remain the same, Pauli and Fermi postulated that a [[neutrino]] (&lt;math&gt;\bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;) was also emitted]]
The Via Panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects. The experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that [[paraffin wax]] was effective at slowing neutrons, so he decided to try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in [[silver]] compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–352}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=153–156}} The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the fewer collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energyfromthorium.com/2007/02/13/a-few-good-moderators-the-numbers/ |title=A Few Good Moderators: The Numbers |publisher=The Energy From Thorium Foundation |accessdate=24 September 2013|date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] than fast ones. He developed a [[diffusion equation]] to describe this, which became known as the [[Fermi age equation]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=347–352}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=153–156}}

In 1938 Fermi received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] at the age of 37 for his "demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of [[nuclear reaction]]s brought about by slow neutrons".{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=51}} After Fermi received the prize in [[Stockholm]], he did not return home to Italy, but rather continued to New York City with his family in December 1938, where they applied for permanent residency. The decision to move to America and become U.S. citizens was due primarily to the racial laws in Italy.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=130}}

Fermi arrived in New York City on 2 January 1939.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=52}} He was immediately offered posts at five universities, and accepted a post at [[Columbia University]],{{sfn|Persico|2001|p=40}} where he had already given summer lectures in 1936.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=352}} He received the news that in December 1938, the German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] had detected the element [[barium]] after bombarding uranium with neutrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Willis Lamb]], two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, found out about it and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi, but Fermi later gave the credit to Lamb:{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=267}}
{{quote|I remember very vividly the first month, January, 1939, that I started working at the Pupin Laboratories because things began happening very fast. In that period, Niels Bohr was on a lecture engagement at the Princeton University and I remember one afternoon Willis Lamb came back very excited and said that Bohr had leaked out great news. The great news that had leaked out was the discovery of fission and at least the outline of its interpretation. Then, somewhat later that same month, there was a meeting in Washington where the possible importance of the newly discovered phenomenon of fission was first discussed in semi-jocular earnest as a possible source of [[nuclear power]].{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=222-223}}}}

Noddack was proven right after all. Fermi had dismissed the possibility of fission on the basis of his calculations, but he had not taken into account the [[binding energy]] that would appear when a [[nuclide]] with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron.{{sfn|Amaldi|2001a|pp=161–162}} For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the [[transuranic elements]] that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but [[fission products]]. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=267}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fermi|first=Enrico|title=Artificial radioactivity produced by neutron bombardment (Nobel Lecture)|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-lecture.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=12 December 1938|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809111423/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-lecture.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists at Columbia decided that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, in the basement of [[Pupin Hall]] at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Eugene T. Booth]], [[John R. Dunning]], [[G. N. Glasoe|G. Norris Glasoe]], and [[Francis G. Slack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=H.L.|last2=Booth|first2=E. |last3=Dunning|first3=J.|last4=Fermi |first4=E.|last5=Glasoe |first5=G. |last6=Slack|first6=F.|title=The Fission of Uranium|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=55|issue=5|date=16 February 1939|pages=511–512 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.55.511.2|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55..511A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of [[George Washington University]] and the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, fostering many more experimental demonstrations.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=269–270}}

French scientists [[Hans von Halban]], [[Lew Kowarski]], and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] had demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed, suggesting the possibility of a chain reaction.&lt;ref name="Von HalbanJoliot1939"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Halban |first1=H.|last2=Joliot |first2=F.|last3=Kowarski |first3=L. |title=Number of Neutrons Liberated in the Nuclear Fission of Uranium|journal=Nature|volume=143|issue=3625|date=22 April 1939|pages=680 |doi=10.1038/143680a0|bibcode = 1939Natur.143..680V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi and Anderson did so too a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="AndersonFermi1939"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=H.|last2=Fermi|first2=E.|last3=Hanstein|first3=H.|title=Production of Neutrons in Uranium Bombarded by Neutrons|journal=Physical Review|volume=55|issue=8|date=16 March 1939|pages=797–798|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.55.797.2|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55..797A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson|first=H.L.|title=Early Days of Chain Reaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|date=April 1973|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leó Szilárd]] obtained {{convert|200|kg}} of [[uranium oxide]] from Canadian [[radium]] producer [[Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited|Eldorado Gold Mines Limited]], allowing Fermi and Anderson to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale.&lt;ref name=Anderson1939 /&gt; Fermi and Szilárd collaborated on a design of a device to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear reaction—a [[nuclear reactor]]. Owing to the rate of absorption of neutrons by the hydrogen in water, it was unlikely that a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a [[neutron moderator]]. Fermi suggested, based on his work with neutrons, that the reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and [[graphite]] as a moderator instead of water. This would reduce the neutron capture rate, and in theory make a self-sustaining chain reaction possible. Szilárd came up with a workable design: a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=186–188}} Szilárd, Anderson, and Fermi published a paper on "Neutron Production in Uranium".&lt;ref name=Anderson1939&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=H.|last2=Fermi|first2=E.|last3=Szilárd|first3=L. |title=Neutron Production and Absorption in Uranium|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=56|issue=3|date= 1 August 1939|pages=284–286|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.284|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box5/a64g01.html|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..284A }}&lt;/ref&gt; But their work habits and personalities were different, and Fermi had trouble working with Szilárd.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=356–357}}

Fermi was among the first to warn military leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the [[Navy Department]] on 18&amp;nbsp;March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|p=185}} Later that year, Szilárd, [[Eugene Wigner]], and [[Edward Teller]] sent [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|the famous letter signed by Einstein]] to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|U.S. President Roosevelt]], warning that [[Nazi Germany]] was likely to build an [[atomic bomb]]. In response, Roosevelt formed the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] to investigate the matter.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=188–189}}

[[File:Enrico Fermi ID badge.png|thumb|right|Fermi's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]]]
The Advisory Committee on Uranium provided money for Fermi to buy graphite,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=314–317}} and he built a pile of graphite bricks on the seventh floor of the Pupin Hall laboratory.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|p=190}} By August 1941, he had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite, which he used to build a still larger pile in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|p=195}}

The S-1 Section of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, with the U.S. now engaged in [[World War II]], making its work urgent. Most of the effort sponsored by the Committee had been directed at producing [[enriched uranium]], but Committee member [[Arthur Compton]] determined that a feasible alternative was [[plutonium]], which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors by the end of 1944.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=194–196}} He decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the [[University of Chicago]]. Fermi reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] there.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399–400}}

The possible results of a self-sustaining nuclear reaction were unknown, so it seemed inadvisable to build the first nuclear reactor on the University of Chicago campus in the middle of the city. Compton found a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about {{convert|20|miles}} from Chicago. [[Stone &amp; Webster]] was contracted to develop the site, but the work was halted by an industrial dispute. Fermi then persuaded Compton that he could build the reactor in the [[squash (sport)|squash]] court under the stands of the University of Chicago's [[Stagg Field]]. Construction of the pile began on 6 November 1942, and [[Chicago Pile-1]] went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=198–202}}  The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded Fermi calculated that criticality could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fermi |first=E. | title=The Development of the First Chain Reaction Pile | journal=[[Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.]] | year=1946 | volume=90 |issue=1 | pages=20–24 | bibcode= | doi= | jstor=3301034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experiment was a landmark in the quest for energy, and it was typical of Fermi's approach. Every step was carefully planned, every calculation meticulously done.{{sfn|Salvetti|2001|pp=198–202}}  When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, Compton made a coded phone call to [[James B. Conant]], the chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]].{{quote|
I picked up the phone and called Conant. He was reached at the President's office at [[Harvard University]].
"Jim," I said, "you'll be interested to know that the Italian navigator has just landed in the new world." Then, half apologetically, because I had led the S-l Committee to believe that it would be another week or more before the pile could be completed, I added, "the earth was not as large as he had estimated, and he arrived at the new world sooner than he had expected."

"Is that so," was Conant's excited response. "Were the natives friendly?"
"Everyone landed safe and happy."{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=144}} }}

To continue the research where it would not pose a public health hazard, the reactor was disassembled and moved to the Argonne Woods site. There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, revelling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=366}} The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=207}}

When the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208–211}} Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for [[DuPont]] staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=205}} Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=104}}

In September 1944, Fermi inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]], the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, it had been designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that if all 2,004 tubes were loaded, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304–307}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=220–223}}

[[File:Fermiac.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[FERMIAC]], an [[analog device]] invented by Enrico Fermi to implement studies of neutron transport]]
In mid-1944, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Fermi to join his [[Los Alamos Laboratory|Project Y]] at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=368–369}} Arriving in September, Fermi was appointed an associate director of the laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|"Super" (thermonuclear) bomb]]; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the "water boiler" [[Aqueous homogeneous reactor|aqueous homogeneous]] [[research reactor]]; F-3 Super Experimentation under [[Egon Bretscher]]; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson.{{sfn|Hawkins|1961|p=213}} Fermi observed the [[Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. He paced off the distance they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=674–677}}

Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and [[Ernest Lawrence]], Fermi was part of the scientific panel that advised the [[Interim Committee]] on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=531-532}} Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] from the [[public address system]] in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for [[world government]]. He therefore did not join the [[Association of Los Alamos Scientists]].{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=244-245}}

== Post-war work ==
Fermi became the Charles H. Swift Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945,{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=157}} although he did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with his family until 31 December 1945.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=167}} He was elected a member of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/20001146.html "Enrico Fermi" on NASOnline.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The Metallurgical Laboratory became the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] on 1 July 1946, the first of the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratories]] established by the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=xix–xx}} The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both places. At Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating [[neutron scattering]] with [[Leona Marshall]].{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=171}} He also discussed theoretical physics with [[Maria Mayer]], helping her develop insights into [[Spin–orbit interaction|spin–orbit coupling]] that would lead to her receiving the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=172}}

The Manhattan Project was replaced by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) on 1 January 1947.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=643}} Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=648}} He also liked to spend a few weeks of each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory,{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=175}} where he collaborated with [[Nicholas Metropolis]],{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=179}} and with [[John von Neumann]] on [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]], the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=381}}

[[File:Laura and Enrico Fermi 1954.jpg|thumb|left|[[Laura Fermi|Laura]] and Enrico Fermi at the [[Enrico Fermi Institute|Institute for Nuclear Studies]], Los Alamos, 1954]]
Following the detonation of the first Soviet [[fission bomb]] in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing the development of a hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=380–385}} Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with [[Stanislaw Ulam]], he calculated that not only would the amount of [[tritium]] needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]] could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=527–530}} Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the [[Oppenheimer security hearing]] in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=102–103}}

He made the first predictions of pion-[[nucleon]] resonance,{{sfn|Segrè|1970|p=179}} relying on [[statistical methods]], since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=374–379}} In a paper co-authored with [[Chen Ning Yang]], he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fermi | first1 = E. | last2 = Yang | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.76.1739 | title = Are Mesons Elementary Particles? | journal = Physical Review | volume = 76 | issue = 12 | page = 1739 | year = 1949 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1949PhRv...76.1739F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was elaborated by [[Shoichi Sakata]]. It has since been supplanted by the [[quark model]], in which the pion is made up of quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.{{sfn|Jacob|Maiani|2001|pp=254–258}}

Fermi wrote a paper "On the Origin of [[cosmic radiation|Cosmic Radiation]]" in which he proposed that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space, which led to a difference of opinion with Teller.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=374–379}} Fermi examined the issues surrounding magnetic fields in the arms of a [[spiral galaxy]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=386}} He mused about what is now referred to as the "[[Fermi paradox]]": the contradiction between the presumed probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life and the fact that contact has not been made.{{sfn|Jones|1985a|pp=1–3}}

Toward the end of his life, Fermi questioned his faith in society at large to make wise choices about nuclear technology. He said:

{{quote|Some of you may ask, what is the good of working so hard merely to collect a few facts which will bring no pleasure except to a few long-haired professors who love to collect such things and will be of no use to anybody because only few specialists at best will be able to understand them? In answer to such question[s] I may venture a fairly safe prediction.

History of science and technology has consistently taught us that scientific advances in basic understanding have sooner or later led to technical and industrial applications that have revolutionized our way of life. It seems to me improbable that this effort to get at the structure of matter should be an exception to this rule. What is less certain, and what we all fervently hope, is that man will soon grow sufficiently adult to make good use of the powers that he acquires over nature.{{sfn|Fermi|2004|p=142}}

== Death ==
Fermi underwent an exploratory operation in Billings Memorial Hospital on 9 October 1954, after which he returned home. 50 days later, Fermi died at age 53 of [[stomach cancer]] in his home in Chicago,&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0929.html |title=Enrico Fermi Dead at 53; Architect of Atomic Bomb |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 November 1954 |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred at [[Oak Woods Cemetery]].{{sfn|Hucke|Bielski|1999|pp=147, 150}}

|quote=As a person, Fermi seemed simplicity itself. He was extraordinarily vigorous and loved games and sport. On such occasions his ambitious nature became apparent. He played tennis with considerable ferocity and when climbing mountains acted rather as a guide. One might have called him a benevolent dictator. I remember once at the top of a mountain Fermi got up and said: "Well, it is two minutes to two, let's all leave at two o'clock"; and of course, everybody got up faithfully and obediently. This leadership and self-assurance gave Fermi the name of "The Pope" whose pronouncements were infallible in physics. He once said: "I can calculate anything in physics within a factor 2 on a few sheets; to get the numerical factor in front of the formula right may well take a physicist a year to calculate, but I am not
interested in that." His leadership could go so far that it was a danger to the independence of the person working with him. I recollect once, at a party at his house when my wife cut the bread, Fermi came along and said he had a different philosophy on bread-cutting and took the knife out of my wife's hand and proceeded with the job because he was convinced that his own method was superior. But all this did not offend at all, but rather charmed everybody into liking Fermi. He had very few interests outside physics and when he once heard me play on Teller's piano he confessed that his interest in music was restricted to simple tunes.

Fermi received numerous awards in recognition of his achievements, including the [[Matteucci Medal]] in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the [[Hughes Medal]] in 1942, the [[Franklin Medal]] in 1947, and the [[Rumford Prize]] in 1953. He was awarded the [[Medal for Merit]] in 1946 for his contribution to the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Alison|1957|pp=135–136}} Fermi was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1950|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; The [[Basilica of Santa Croce]], [[Florence]], known as the ''Temple of Italian Glories'' for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gotterdammerung.org/photo/travel/italy/florence/churches/basilica-di-santa-croce/060907-175358%20The%20Tomb%20of%20Enrico%20Fermi%20at%20Santa%20Croce.html |title=Enrico Fermi in Santa Croce, Florence |publisher=gotterdammerung.org |accessdate=10 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,26473,00.html |title=''Time'' 100 Persons of the Century |date=6 June 1999 |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century  physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. The historian of physics, [[C. P. Snow]], wrote that "if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine him discovering [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford's]] atomic nucleus, and then developing [[Bohr model|Bohr's theory]] of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole".{{sfn|Snow|1981|p=79}}

Fermi was known as an inspiring teacher, and was noted for his attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation of his lectures.{{sfn|Ricci|2001|pp=297–302}} Later, his lecture notes were transcribed into books.{{sfn|Ricci|2001|p=286}} His papers and notebooks are today in the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fermi.lib.uchicago.edu/fermicollection.htm |title=Enrico Fermi Collection |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Weisskopf]] noted how Fermi "always managed to find the simplest and most direct approach, with the minimum of complication and sophistication."{{sfn|Salvini|2001|p=5}} Fermi's ability and success stemmed as much from his appraisal of the art of the possible, as from his innate skill and intelligence. He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the "[[Fermi problem|Fermi method]]", and is widely taught.{{sfn|Von Baeyer|1993|pp=3–8}}

Fermi was fond of pointing out that [[Alessandro Volta]], working in his laboratory, could have had no idea where the study of electricity would lead.{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=242}} Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.{{sfn|Salvini|2001|p=17}}

[[GE Power]]'s offshore wind business is a joint venture with [[Alstom]], created in 2015 when most of that company's other electrical power and generation assets were acquired. GE's stake in the joint venture is 50 % plus 1 share.

Formerly known as '''Alstom Wind''', originally '''Alstom Ecotècnia''', the company was the wind power company of energy infrastructure company [[Alstom]], within its 'Power' operating division, from 2010 to 2015. The company originated as '''Ecotècnia S.c.c.l.''', a Spanish wind power equipment manufacturing and installation company established in 1981, acquired by Alstom 2007 for €350 million.

The subsidiary's main product is the 6MW 'Haliade' offshore wind turbine, one of the [[List of most powerful wind turbines|most powerful turbines]] on Earth]]

==History==

===Ecotècnia, 1987-2007===
[[File:Badaia - Parque Eólico -BT- 01.jpg|thumb|Detail of a wind turbine Alstom-Ecotècnica Eco80 in the Spanish Basque Country]]
Ecotècnia was a manufacturer and installer of wind turbines established in 1981, headquartered in [[Barcelona]], Spain. In 1999 it became part of the Basque-based cooperative [[Mondragon Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ecotècnia S.c.c.l, "Perfil Corporativo", 2003, company website&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's first wind generator was a 30&amp;nbsp;kW machine, developed by 1984 with funding assistance from the Spanish Science Ministry. In 1991 the company developed a 150&amp;nbsp;kW machine, and in 1992 won its first commercial project - for fifty 150&amp;nbsp;kW turbines at [[Tarifa]], Spain.&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;{{citation| url = http://evolution.skf.com/spanish-turbines-catch-winds-of-change/| title =Spanish turbines catch winds of change| date = 15 May 2002| work = evolution.skf.com| author = Elizabeth Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular demands of installing wind turbines in mountainous regions in Spain which included poor road access and blustery (high [[turbulence]]) conditions led to specific design features of Ecotècnia's turbines - including a modular construction of the turbine (three components: rotor and shaft; mainframe and yaw system; and the drive train - each less than 30t), as well as isolation of the gearbox from the main drive, reducing non-torque gearbox loads.&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;

In 2005 the company's estimate world market share (by installed capacity) was 2.1%.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt; By 2007 the company had installed over wind farms with over 1GW total of rate power;&lt;ref name="in"/&gt; the company had increased the power output of its wind turbine offering from 30&amp;nbsp;kW in 1984 to 1.67MW by 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Alstom and Ecotècnia, June 2008, "Evolución tecnológica", p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 1990s the company installed wind farms using its ''ECO20'' 150&amp;nbsp;kW model, from 1995 to 2000 the company's primary models were the ''ECO44'' (640&amp;nbsp;kW) and ''ECO48'' (750&amp;nbsp;kW) models.&lt;ref name="in"/&gt; After 2003 most of the company's installations used its 1.67MW [[IEC-1400-1]] class II ''ECO74'',&lt;ref name="e74"&gt;{{citation| archivedate=29 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129141237/http://www.ecotecnia.com/ing/ecotecnia_74_english.pdf | url=http://www.ecotecnia.com/ing/ecotecnia_74_english.pdf| work = www.econtecnia.com| title= Technical characteristics: 74/1.6| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and class IIIA ''ECO80'',&lt;ref name="e80"&gt;{{citation| archivedate=29 November 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129141319/http://www.ecotecnia.com/ing/ecotecnia_80_english.pdf| url=http://www.ecotecnia.com/ing/ecotecnia_80_english.pdf| work = www.econtecnia.com| title=Technical Characteristics: 80/1.6| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; three blade turbine models;&lt;ref name="in"/&gt; both typically used a mechanically isolated [[Winergy AG]] PEAB 4390.2 [[planetary gearbox]] driving a [[DFIG|doubly fed induction generator]] (typically [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Siemens]], Winergy sourced) with [[IGBT]] inverter control, driven by individually pitch controlled [[LM Wind Power|LM manufactured blades]].&lt;ref name="s1"&gt;{{citation| url = https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20475%20Wind%20Power%20Systems/Modern%20Wind%20Generators.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121218194007/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20475%20Wind%20Power%20Systems/Modern%20Wind%20Generators.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 18 December 2012| title = Modern Wind Generators| author = M.

[[File:Saturn Storm December 2010.jpg|thumb|The storm in December, 2010]] 
The '''Great White Spot''', also known as '''Great White Oval''', on [[Saturn]], named by analogy to [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], are periodic storms that are large enough to be visible by telescope from Earth by their characteristic white appearance. The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide.

The [[Cassini-Huygens|''Cassini'' orbiter]] was able to track the 2010-2011 instance of the storm,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-cassini-saturns-great-white-spots-02696.html Cassini Helps Solve Saturn’s Mysterious Great White Spots | Space Exploration | Sci-News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance because of an increase in radio and plasma interference, or the Great Springtime Storm.&lt;ref name="wired-2012"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2012/10/saturn-largest-hottest-vortex/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassini data has revealed a loss of [[acetylene]] in the white clouds, an increase of [[phosphine]], and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/122329429.html Dissecting Saturn's Big Storm] - SkyandTelescope.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After the visible aspects of the storm subsided, in 2012 a "belch" of heat and [[ethylene]] was emitted from two hotspots that merged.&lt;ref name="wired-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/25/world/saturn-gas-storm/ NASA: Rare, enormous gas storm detected on Saturn - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The phenomenon is somewhat periodic at 28.5-year intervals, when Saturn's [[northern hemisphere]] tilts most toward the Sun. The following is a list of recorded sightings.

{{wikisourcepar|Littell's Living Age/Volume 136/Issue 1752/Bright Spot on Saturn|an account of Hall's use of the Great White Spot to calculate Saturn's rotation.}}
* 1876 – Observed by [[Asaph Hall]].  He used the white spots to determine the planet's period of rotation.
* 1903 – Observed by [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward Barnard]].
* 1933 – Observed by [[Will Hay]], comic actor and amateur astronomer. Until recent times the most celebrated observation.
* 1960 – Observed by JH Botham ([[South Africa]]).
* 1990 – Observed by Stuart Wilber, from 24 September through November.
* 1994 – Studied by ground-based observers and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1994/53/text/ HubbleSite - NewsCenter - Hubble Observes A New Saturn Storm (12/21/1994) – Release Text]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2006 – Observed by Erick Bondoux and Jean-Luc Dauvergne.
* 2010 – First observed by Anthony Wesley,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/space/vast-storm-rampages-across-saturn.html Vast Storm Rampages Across Saturn: Discovery News]&lt;/ref&gt; photographed by [[Cassini space probe]] 2010-2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

That none were recorded before 1876 is a mystery, in some ways akin to the long observational gap of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries; the 1876 Great White Spot (GWS) was extremely prominent, being visible in apertures as small as 60&amp;nbsp;mm.  It is not known if the earlier record was simply poor, or if the 1876 &lt;abbr title="Great White Spot"&gt;GWS&lt;/abbr&gt; was truly a first for the telescopic era.  Some believe that neither scenario is likely.&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Mark Kidger described three significant GWS patterns:
#The GWSs alternate in latitude, with one apparition being limited to the North Temperate Zone (NTZ) or higher, and the following being limited to the Equatorial Zone (EZ). For instance, the 1960 GWS was high-latitude, and the 1990 GWS was equatorial.
#The high-latitude GWSs recur at a slightly shorter interval than the equatorial GWSs (~27 versus ~30 years).
#The high-latitude GWSs tend to be much less prominent than their equatorial counterparts.

Based on these apparent regularities, in 1992 Kidger forecasted (incorrectly, given the 2010-11 storm) that the next GWS would occur in the North Temperate Zone in 2016, and would probably be less spectacular than the 1990 GWS.&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and causes==
A "classic" Great White Spot is a spectacular event, in which a brilliant white storm enlivens Saturn's usually bland atmosphere; all the major ones have occurred in the planet's northern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; They typically begin as discrete, literal "spots", but then rapidly expand in [[longitude]], as the 1933 and 1990 GWSs did; in fact, the latter eventually lengthened enough to encircle the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 187-189&lt;/ref&gt;

Though computer modeling had by the early 1990s suggested these massive atmospheric upwellings were caused by thermal instability,&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 two Caltech planetary scientists proposed a more detailed mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caltech.edu/news/explaining-saturn-s-great-white-spots-46500 Explaining Saturn’s Great White Spots | Caltech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is that as Saturn's upper atmosphere undergoes seasonal cooling, it first gets less dense as the heavier water rains out, passes a density minimum, and then gets more dense as the remaining hydrogen and helium continue to cool.  Low-density upper-layer gases tend to suppress [[convection]], but high-density upper layers are unstable and cause a thunderstorm when they break into lower layers.  The theory is that the storms are significantly delayed from the winter solstice due to the time it takes for the very large atmosphere to cool.  The team proposes that similar storms are not seen on Jupiter because that planet has less water vapor in its upper atmosphere.

Saturn's rings block the view of the northern hemisphere from Earth during the winter solstice, so historical data on the GWS is unavailable during this season,&lt;ref&gt;Kidger (1992) p. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Cassini space probe]] has been able to observe the whole planet since it arrived shortly after the winter solstice in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saturn-archive.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/introduction/ Cassini Solstice Mission: Introduction] [https://web.archive.org/web/20160525004007/https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/about-the-mission/overview/ archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="796">The '''Grid Trade Master Agreement''' (GTMA) is an agreement for [[New Electricity Trading Arrangements|trading electricity]] within the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foa.co.uk/documentation/gtma/gtmajune2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normally used either when a power station has excess electricity, which it wishes to "sell back" to the [[power grid]], or when the electricity company wishes to buy surplus power to meet a surge in demand, or reduction in supply.

Although electricity is a non-tangible asset, these agreements are used in order to trade [[guarantees]] to provide power for a certain length of time.

In [[spacecraft propulsion]], a '''Hall-effect thruster''' ('''HET''') is a type of [[ion thruster]] in which the [[propellant]] is accelerated by an [[electric field]]. [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] thrusters trap electrons in a [[magnetic field]] and then use the electrons to ionize propellant, efficiently accelerate the [[ion]]s to produce [[thrust]], and neutralize the ions in the plume. Hall-effect thrusters (based on the discovery by [[Edwin Hall]]) are sometimes referred to as '''Hall thrusters''' or '''Hall-current thrusters'''. Hall thrusters are often regarded as a moderate [[specific impulse]] (1,600{{nbsp}}s) [[space propulsion]] technology. The Hall-effect thruster has benefited from considerable theoretical and experimental research since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hofer, Richard R.|title=Development and Characterization of High-Efficiency, High-Specific Impulse Xenon Hall Thrusters|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20040084644|work=NASA/CR—2004-21309|publisher=NASA STI Program|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xenon hall thruster.jpg|thumb|6-kW Hall thruster in operation at the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].]]

Hall thrusters operate on a variety of propellants, the most common being [[xenon]].  Other propellants of interest include [[krypton]], [[argon]], [[bismuth]], [[iodine]], [[magnesium]], and [[zinc]].

Hall thrusters are able to accelerate their exhaust to [[effective exhaust velocity|speeds]] between 10 and 80&amp;nbsp;km/s (1,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;s [[specific impulse]]), with most models operating between 15 and 30&amp;nbsp;km/s (1,500–3,000&amp;nbsp;s specific impulse).

The thrust produced by a Hall thruster varies depending on the power level. Devices operating at 1.35&amp;nbsp;kW produce about 83&amp;nbsp;mN of thrust. High-power models have demonstrated up to 5.4&amp;nbsp;N in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/38444-mars-thruster-design-breaks-records.html|title=Ion Thruster Prototype Breaks Records in Tests, Could Send Humans to Mars|author=|date=|website=space.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320082645/https://www.space.com/38444-mars-thruster-design-breaks-records.html|archivedate=20 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power levels up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW have been demonstrated by xenon Hall thrusters.

{{asof|2009}}, Hall-effect thrusters ranged in input [[Power (physics)|power]] levels from 1.35 to 10 kilowatts and had [[exhaust velocity|exhaust velocities]] of 10–50 kilometers per second, with [[thrust]] of 40–600 [[millinewton]]s and [[efficiency]] in the range of 45–60 percent.&lt;ref name="Choueiri"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = New Dawn for Electric Rockets|last = Choueiri|first = Edgar Y.|journal = Scientific American|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0209-58|issue = |volume = 300|pages = 58–65|date = 2009|bibcode = 2009SciAm.300b..58C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applications of Hall-effect thrusters include control of the orientation and position of orbiting [[satellite]]s and use as a main propulsion engine for medium-size robotic space vehicles.&lt;ref name="Choueiri"/&gt;

== History ==
Hall thrusters were studied independently in the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].  They were first described publicly in the US in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1 = G.|first2 = J.|first3 = T.|last1 = Janes|last2 = Dotson|last3 = Wilson|title = Momentum transfer through magnetic fields|conference = Proceedings of third symposium on advanced propulsion concepts|volume = 2|date = 1962|location = Cincinnati, OH, USA|pages = 153–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;{{cite conference|first1 = RG.|last1 = Meyerand|title = Momentum Transfer Through the Electric Fields|conference = Proceedings of Third Symposium on Advanced Propulsion Concepts|volume = 1|date = 1962|pages = 177–190|location = Cincinnati, OH, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seikel"&gt;{{cite conference|first1 = GR.|last1 = Seikel|title = Generation of Thrust – Electromagnetic Thrusters|conference = Proceedings of the NASA-University Conference on the Science and Technology of Space Exploration|volume = 2|date = 1962|pages = 171–176|location = Chicago, IL, USA|url = https://archive.org/stream/nasa_techdoc_19630001628/19630001628}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hall thruster was first developed into an efficient propulsion device in the Soviet Union.  In the US, scientists focused instead on developing [[gridded ion thruster]]s.

Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:
*thrusters with wide acceleration zone, SPT ({{lang-ru|СПД, стационарный плазменный двигатель}}; {{lang-en|SPT}}, Stationary Plasma Thruster) at [[OKB Fakel|Design Bureau Fakel]]
*thrusters with narrow acceleration zone, DAS ({{lang-ru|ДАС, двигатель с анодным слоем}}; {{lang-en|TAL}}, Thruster with Anode Layer), at the [[TsNIIMash|Central Research Institute for Machine Building]] (TsNIIMASH).

[[Image:Russian stationary plasma thrusters.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet and Russian SPT thrusters]]
The SPT design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fluid.ippt.gov.pl/sbarral/hall.html |title=Hall thrusters |date=2004-01-14 |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040228215222/http://fluid.ippt.gov.pl/sbarral/hall.html |archivedate=February 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morozov_PPR"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The conceptual development of stationary plasma thrusters|last = Morozov|first = A.I.|date = March 2003|journal = Plasma Physics Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1134/1.1561119|pages = 235–250|publisher = Nauka/Interperiodica|bibcode = 2003PlPhR..29..235M |issue = 3|volume = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first SPT to operate in space, an SPT-50 aboard a Soviet [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor spacecraft]], was launched December 1971. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPT engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPT engines, SPT-50 and SPT-60 was 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;mN respectively. In 1982, SPT-70 and [[SPT-100]] were introduced, their thrusts being 40 and 83&amp;nbsp;mN, respectively. In the post-Soviet [[Russia]] high-power (a few [[kilowatt]]s) SPT-140, SPT-160, SPT-200, T-160  and low-power (less than 500 W) SPT-35 were introduced.&lt;ref name="NK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/198/35.shtml|title=Native Electric Propulsion Engines Today|publisher=Novosti Kosmonavtiki|date=1999|issue=7|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606033558/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/198/35.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet and Russian TAL-type thrusters include the D-38, D-55, D-80, and D-100.&lt;ref name="NK"/&gt;

Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists from NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Glenn Research Center]], and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], under the support of the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]], visited Russian laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPT-100 (i.e., a 100&amp;nbsp;mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. No failures have ever occurred on orbit.  Hall thrusters continue to be used on Russian spacecraft and have also flown on European and American spacecraft.  [[Space Systems/Loral]], an American commercial satellite manufacturer, now flies Fakel SPT-100's on their GEO communications spacecraft.

Since their introduction to the west in the early 1990s, Hall thrusters have been the subject of a large number of research efforts throughout the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia (with many smaller efforts scattered in various countries across the globe).  Hall thruster research in the US is conducted at several government laboratories, universities and private companies. Government and government funded centers include NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]], the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (Edwards AFB, CA), and [[The Aerospace Corporation]].  Universities include the [http://www.afit.edu/PA/news.cfm?article=101&amp;a=news US Air Force Institute of Technology], [[University of Michigan]], [[Stanford University]], [[The Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Michigan Technological University]], and [[Georgia Tech]]. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as [https://www.ihi.co.jp/en/ IHI] in Japan, [[Aerojet]] and [[Busek]] in the USA, [[SNECMA]] in France, [http://www.lajp.org.ua/ LAJP] in Ukraine, and [http://www.sitael.com/ SITAEL] in Italy.

The first use of Hall thrusters on lunar orbit was the European Space Agency (ESA) lunar mission [[SMART-1]] in 2003.

On a western satellite Hall thrusters were first demonstrated on the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) STEX spacecraft, which flew the Russian D-55.  The first American Hall thruster to fly in space was the [[Busek]] BHT-200 on [[TacSat-2]] technology demonstration spacecraft.  The first flight of an American Hall thruster on an operational mission, was the [[Aerojet]] BPT-4000, which launched August 2010 on the military [[Advanced Extremely High Frequency]] GEO communications satellite. At 4.5&amp;nbsp;kW, the BPT-4000 is also the highest power Hall thruster ever flown in space.  Besides the usual stationkeeping tasks, the BPT-4000 is also providing orbit raising capability to the spacecraft.  Several countries worldwide continue efforts to qualify Hall thruster technology for commercial uses.

== Operation ==
The essential working principle of the Hall thruster is that it uses an [[electrostatic potential]] to accelerate ions up to high speeds.  In a Hall thruster, the attractive negative charge is provided by an electron plasma at the open end of the thruster instead of a grid.  A radial magnetic field of about 100–300&amp;nbsp;[[gauss (unit)|G]] (0.01–0.03&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]]) is used to confine the electrons, where the combination of the radial magnetic field and axial electric field cause the electrons to drift in azimuth thus forming the Hall current from which the device gets its name.

[[Image:Wfm hall thruster.svg|400px|thumb|Hall thruster. Hall thrusters are largely axially symmetric. This is a cross-section containing that axis.]]
A schematic of a Hall thruster is shown in the adjacent image. An [[electric potential]] between 150 and 800 volts is applied between the [[anode]] and [[cathode]].

The central spike forms one pole of an [[electromagnet]] and is surrounded by an annular space, and around that is the other pole of the electromagnet, with a radial magnetic field in between.

The propellant, such as [[xenon]] gas, is fed through the anode, which has numerous small holes in it to act as a gas distributor.  Xenon propellant is used because of its high [[atomic weight]] and low [[ionization potential]].  As the neutral xenon atoms diffuse into the channel of the thruster, they are ionized by collisions with circulating high-energy electrons (typically 10–40&amp;nbsp;eV, or about 10% of the discharge voltage).  Once ionized, the xenon ions typically have a charge of +1, though a small fraction (~20%) have +2.

The xenon ions are then accelerated by the [[electric field]] between the anode and the cathode.  For discharge voltages of 300&amp;nbsp;V, the ions reach speeds of around 15&amp;nbsp;km/s (9.3 mps) for a specific impulse of 1,500 seconds (15&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg).  Upon exiting, however, the ions pull an equal number of electrons with them, creating a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] plume with no net charge.

The radial magnetic field is designed to be strong enough to substantially deflect the low-mass electrons, but not the high-mass ions, which have a much larger [[gyroradius]] and are hardly impeded.  The majority of electrons are thus stuck orbiting in the region of high radial magnetic field near the thruster exit plane, trapped in '''E'''×'''B''' (axial electric field and radial magnetic field).  This orbital rotation of the electrons is a circulating [[Hall effect|Hall current]], and it is from this that the Hall thruster gets its name.  Collisions with other particles and walls, as well as plasma instabilities, allow some of the electrons to be freed from the magnetic field, and they drift towards the anode.

About 20–30% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic efficiency of the thruster; the other 70–80% of the current is in the ions.  Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to ionize almost all of the xenon propellant, allowing mass use of 90–99%.  The mass use efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while the discharge current efficiency is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% × 70%).  Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs.

Compared to chemical rockets, the thrust is very small, on the order of 83&amp;nbsp;mN for a typical thruster operating at 300&amp;nbsp;V, 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW.  For comparison, the weight of a coin like the [[quarter (U.S. coin)|U.S. quarter]] or a 20-cent [[Euro coin]] is approximately 60&amp;nbsp;mN.  As with all forms of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], thrust is limited by available power, efficiency, and [[specific impulse]].

However, Hall thrusters operate at the high [[specific impulse]]s that is typical for electric propulsion. One particular advantage of Hall thrusters, as compared to a gridded ion thruster, is that the generation and acceleration of the ions takes place in a quasi-neutral plasma, so there is no [[Space charge|Child-Langmuir charge (space charge)]] [[saturation current|saturated current]] limitation on the thrust density.  This allows much smaller thrusters compared to gridded ion thrusters.

Another advantage is that these thrusters can use a wider variety of propellants supplied to the anode, even oxygen, although something easily ionized is needed at the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.permanent.com/space-transportation-electric.html#how-russ|title = Hall-Effect Stationary Plasma thrusters|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-16|website = Electric Propulsion for Inter-Orbital Vehicles|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130717081003/http://www.permanent.com/space-transportation-electric.html#how-russ|archivedate = 2013-07-17|df = }}[http://www.permanent.com/t-el-iov.htm#how-russ &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010015756/http://www.permanent.com/t-el-iov.htm |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cylindrical Hall thrusters==
Although conventional (annular) Hall thrusters are efficient in the [[kilowatt]] power regime, they become inefficient when scaled to small sizes.  This is due to the difficulties associated with holding the performance scaling parameters constant while decreasing the channel size and increasing the applied [[magnetic field]] strength. This led to the design of the cylindrical Hall thruster.  The cylindrical Hall thruster can be more readily scaled to smaller sizes due to its nonconventional discharge-chamber geometry and associated [[magnetic field]] profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Y.

==External discharge Hall thruster==
Sputtering erosion of discharge channel walls and pole pieces that protect the magnetic circuit causes failure of thruster operation. Therefore, annular and cylindrical Hall thrusters have limited lifetime. Although magnetic shielding has been shown to dramatically reduce discharge channel wall erosion, pole piece erosion is still a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2014-3899|title=Pole-piece Interactions with the Plasma in a Magnetically Shielded Hall Thruster|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative, an unconventional Hall&amp;nbsp;thruster design called external discharge Hall thruster or external discharge plasma thruster (XPT) has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2016-4951|title=Preliminary Investigation of an External Discharge Plasma Thruster|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/549895/1/SA6000036090.pdf|title=Numerical Investigation of an External Discharge Hall Thruster Design Utilizing Plasma-lens Magnetic Field|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814095202/https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/549895/1/SA6000036090.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ltu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1037721&amp;dswid=1358|title=Low–voltage External Discharge Plasma Thruster and Hollow Cathodes Plasma Plume Diagnostics Utilising Electrostatic Probes and Retarding Potential Analyser|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829163334/http://ltu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1037721&amp;dswid=1358|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; External discharge Hall thruster does not possess any discharge channel walls or pole pieces. Plasma discharge is produced and sustained completely in open space outside the thruster structure, and thus erosion free operation is achieved.

In [[algebra]], a '''linear topology''' on a left ''A''-module ''M'' is a [[topology]] on ''M'' that is invariant under translations and admits a fundamental system of neighborhood of 0 that consists of submodules of ''M''. If there is such a topology, ''M'' is said to be '''linearly topologized'''. If ''A'' is given a discrete topology, then ''M'' becomes a [[topological module|topological ''A''-module]] with respect to a linear topology.

'''Louis-Élisabeth de la Vergne, comte de Tressan''' (4 November 1705, [[Le Mans]] - 31 October 1783, from a fall from a carriage en route to [[Saint-Leu-la-Forêt]]) was a French soldier, physician, scientist, medievalist and writer, best known for his adaptations of "[[Romance (heroic literature)|romans chevaleresques]]" of the [[Middle Ages]], which contributed to the rise of the [[Troubadour style]] in the French arts.

== Biography ==
Aged 13, he was the companion of the young [[Louis XV]], then lieutenant-général and king's aide de camp at the [[battle of Fontenoy]]. He was made governor of [[Toul]] and was summoned by [[Stanisław Leszczyński|king Stanislas]] to his court at  [[Lunéville]], where he received the title of grand marshal.

The first director of the Société Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in 1751 and a member of several other academies in France and abroad, he was elected a member of the [[French academy of sciences|Académie des sciences]] in 1749 and of the [[Académie française]] in 1780.

A friend of [[Voltaire]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon|Buffon]], he frequented the [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of  [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin|Mme de Tencin]] and composed several odes as well as adaptations of chivalric romances, which he translated and adapted from Spanish and [[Old French]], into editions which would be re-issued several times.  He was also the author of one of the first treatises on electricity in French, and collaborated on volumes VI and VII of the ''[[Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D’Alembert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Kafker, Frank A.: ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).''

The '''Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{zh|c=龍門核能發電廠|p=Lóngmén Hénéng Fādiànchǎng|l=Dragon Gate Nuclear Power Plant}}) (formerly '''Gongliao Nuclear Power Plant''' and '''Fourth Nuclear Power Plant''', often abbreviated as: {{zh|t=核四|p=Hésì|l=Nuke 4}}), located nearby [[Fulong Beach]], [[Gongliao District]], [[New Taipei City]], is [[Taiwan]]'s fourth [[nuclear power plant]], consisting of two [[ABWR]]s each of 1,300&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MWe]] net. It is owned by [[Taiwan Power Company]] (Taipower). It was intended to be the first of these advanced [[Generation III reactors]] built [[ABWR#Deployments|outside Japan]]. In 2014 construction of the plant was deferred.

The preceding four reactors in Japan were completed in four to five years. Taipower, however, did not award the contract as a turnkey plant, but hired General Electric to build the reactors, [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] to supply the turbines and the generators, and other contractors for the rest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.aec.gov.tw/english/nuclear/psar/lm_document_psar_01_04.pdf |title=Lungmen Units 1&amp;2 Preliminary Safety Analysis Report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |publisher=Atomic Energy Council |location=Taipei |chapter=1.4 Identification of Agents and Contractors |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; making the project very difficult to manage.

All these have resulted in significant cost overruns, while in 2011 the Taiwan [[Atomic Energy Council]] (AEC) criticized Taipower's management of the project.&lt;ref name=WNA-tw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Others/Nuclear-Power-in-Taiwan/ |title=Nuclear Power In Taiwan |publisher=World Nuclear Association |date=February 2013 |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction has been delayed by legal, regulatory and political delays.&lt;ref name=wnn-20140801&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Lungmen-1-passes-pre-operational-tests-0108144.html |title=Lungmen 1 passes pre-operational tests |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|2014-08-01|mdy}} |work=World Nuclear News |accessdate={{date|2014-11-24|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed 2014 national referendum to decide the fate of the power plant&lt;ref name=tt-20140430&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/30/2003589237 |title=NUCLEAR POWER DEBATE: Proposal for referendum on fuel rods gets support |author=Lee, I-chia |date={{date|2014-04-30|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-24|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected from the ballot for contradictory and confusing language, despite gathering more than 120,000 signatures.&lt;ref name=tt-20140823&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/08/23/2003598052 |title=Committee rejects referendum proposal |author1=Loa, Iok-sin |author2=Lin, Sean |date={{date|2014-08-23|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-24|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018, Taipower started shipping unused fuel rods back to the [[US]]. Taipower aims to remove all fuel rods from the plant by 2020. The ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party]] plans to shut down all nuclear plants in Taiwan by 2025. The removal of the fuel rods may mean that the plant's construction will never be restarted. &lt;ref&gt;http://m.focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201809050007.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://m.focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201807040018.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Fourth Nuclear Power Plant was first proposed in 1978,&lt;ref name=Lassen00&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2000/09/10/0000052791/1 |title=Power play |author1=Lassen, Jonathan |date={{date|2000-09-10|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taipower selected the ABWR in 1996 after a competitive bidding process.&lt;ref name=PTdg12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/lungmen/ |title=Lungmen (Dragon Gate) Nuclear Project, Taiwan |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s), no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website=Power Technology |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor is designed by [[General Electric]], but is supported by [[Hitachi]], [[Shimizu Corporation]], [[Toshiba]], and other American, Taiwanese, and other Chinese and international companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Status report 97 - Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) |url=https://aris.iaea.org/sites/..%5CPDF%5CABWR.pdf |publisher=IAEA |accessdate=15 July 2014 |chapter=12.3 Entities involved (Taiwan, China) |quote=The Lungmen project is supported by the GE Team, including: Black &amp; Veatch, Hitachi, Shimizu, Toshiba, and other US, Taiwan, China and international participants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Construction of the plant began in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/NuclearDatabase/reactordetails.aspx?id=27570&amp;rid=8C21AF2F-C273-40F3-971A-C43C114982D0&amp;country=Taiwan |title=Lungmen-2, Taiwan |website=World Nuclear Association |year= 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to be completed in 2004. Delays in construction (some for political reasons) have increased the cost of the project. Costs have also increased from increases in the costs of raw materials from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Min|title=Nuclear Energy Development in Asia Problems and Prospects|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-22150-5|pages=182|edition=Energy, Climate and the Environment Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[921 earthquake]] in 1999 prompted three legislators to inspect construction progress; they cited rusty rebar and potential seawater seepage into the plant's foundation as potential issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/10/29/0000008580 |title=Activists ask for delay of nuke plant |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|1999-10-29|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] was elected along with other [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) legislators in March 2000 on an anti-nuclear platform which included stopping plant construction.&lt;ref name=Lassen00 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiu01&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/05/08/0000084816 |title=Construction delays condemned |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2001-05-08|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; DPP legislators called for a halt to the project in April 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2000/04/09/0000031590 |title=Nuclear plant in question |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2000-04-09|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the suspension of construction in October 2000 by [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Chang Chun-hsiung]].&lt;ref name=TThalt00 /&gt; Contractors were idled for 111 days from 2000 October 27 to 14 February 2001. This delay caused a 576-day delay towards commercial operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Min|title=Nuclear Energy Development in Asia Problems and Prospects|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-22150-5|pages=180|edition=Energy, Climate and the Environment Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taipower constructed a [[wharf]] in 2003 to accommodate delivery of heavy components, such as the reactor vessel. The wharf was beset with construction delays and may have contributed to local beach erosion, prompting further protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/10/0000205404 |title=Taipower wants to import a nuclear reactor in June |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2003-05-10|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/07/03/2003057825 |title=Government considers redesigning wharf |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2003-07-03|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each reactor vessel delivery was greeted with activist protests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/07/07/2003178012 |title=Activists protest Japan reactor |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2004-07-07|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction delays resulted in the vessels being stored longer than expected, with Unit 1's reactor vessel not installed until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/03/16/2003246440 |title=Old reactor unit sparks concern |author1=Chiu, Yu-tzu |date={{date|2005-03-16|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of the plant was carried out by [[Stone &amp; Webster]] (S&amp;W), but Taipower canceled its contract with S&amp;W in 2007, leading to protracted litigation from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/03/10/2003497827 |title=Taipower must pay US$29m: court |author1=Tang, Chia-ling |date={{date|2011-03-10|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, aboriginal artifacts were found at the construction site, prompting calls to halt construction again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/04/28/2003471695 |title=Aboriginal artifacts found at site of nuclear plant |author1=Huang, Shelley |date={{date|2010-04-28|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taipower was fined by the AEC twice, in 2008 and 2011, for completing design changes without first obtaining approval from the plant's designer, General Electric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/11/08/2003517784 |title=Taipower fined by AEC NT$15 million |author1=Lee, I-chia |date={{date|2011-11-08|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://www.aec.gov.tw/english/nuclear/files/2012-01.pdf |title=Overview of Recent Regulatory Activities in Taiwan |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Atomic Energy Council, Department of Nuclear Regulation |page=27 |date={{date|2012-05-19|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-12-04|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taipower later stated the changes were executed to stay on schedule, and approval was later obtained from GE for 97% of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/01/21/2003581790 |title=Taipower mulling filing an appeal |author1=Lee, I-chia |date={{date|2014-01-21|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporary cancellation by the Government and other project management difficulties caused significant delays, pushing the price tag of the plant to more than US$7.5 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name=PTdg12 /&gt; {{as of|2014}}, the total price tag was close to US$10 billion, or NT$300 billion.&lt;ref name=wnn-20140801 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/04/26/2003588911 |title=Ma and Su discuss nuclear plant, remain far apart |author1=Shih Hsiu-chuan |date={{date|2014-04-26|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the plant completed its safety tests required before operation can begin. 126 systems were tested including cooling, shutdown, containment, control and power generation. [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] [[Chang Chia-juch]] said, "Passing the rigorous review illustrates the high standards of care invested in the design and construction of the facility." The reactor will be closed until the status is decided by referendum. In the meantime, the reactor costs 1.3 billion NT Dollars a year to maintain in a mothballed state.&lt;ref name=wnn-20140801 /&gt;

===2013 and 2014 referendums===
Environmental groups called for a [[Referendums in the Republic of China|national referendum]] in April 2011, following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/04/12/2003500553 |title=Groups call for nuclear referendum |author=Chang, Rich |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2011-04-12|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; By obtaining the signatures of a certain percentage of registered voters, or by legislative action, a referendum may be referred to the national ballot for voter action. However, due to the politically sensitive nature of the Fourth Nuclear Plant issue, legislatively-referred and voter-referred referendums have failed to enter the national ballot.

Because of the controversy over the plant, in February 2013 the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)-led government proposed that a referendum should be issued, which would allow the people of the country to decide the fate of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/02/26/2003555734 |title=Nuclear referendum receives go-ahead |author=Shih, Hsiu-chuan |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-02-26|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed referendum was sponsored by 32 KMT lawmakers led by Lee Ching-hua&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/04/20/2003560199 |title=Nuclear referendum question protested |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-04-20|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked "Do you agree that the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should be halted and that it not become operational?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/03/08/2003556550 |title=KMT unveils text of nuclear referendum |author=Shih, Hsiu-chuan |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-03-08|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Referendums must have good voter turnout (greater than 50% of registered voters must participate in the referendum vote), and a majority of participating voters must vote yes in order for the referendum to become binding, meaning that poor voter turnout would ensure referendum defeat (and in the case of the Lee referendum, continued construction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/09/2003556653 |title=Nuclear Power Debate: Academics slam referendum question |author=Shan, Shelley |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-03-09|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition DPP claimed that getting better than 50% voter turnout in a non-Presidential election year was too difficult, and barricaded the legislative chamber to prevent a vote to place the Lee referendum on the national ballot. This led to [[Legislative violence#Taiwan|a scuffle]] when KMT legislators attempted to break through the barricade, and the Lee referendum was not voted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Taiwanese_nuclear_vote_turns_violent-0208135.html |title=Taiwanese Nuclear Vote Turns Violent |work=World Nuclear News |date={{date|2013-08-02|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2013-10-29|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following legislative session, protesters called on the government to withdraw the Lee referendum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/09/18/2003572423 |title=Activists want no referendum and no nuclear plant |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-09-18|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was subsequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/09/11/2003571849 |title=KMT's Lee withdraws nuclear poll proposal |author1=Shih, Hsiu-chuan |author2=Wang, Chris |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2013-09-11|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A competing referendum was launched in 2012 by [[National Taiwan University]] professor [[Kao Cheng-yan]], initially as a local referendum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/07/10/2003537394 |title=Anti-nuclear-group plans rock fest signature drive |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2012-07-10|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-26|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then a national one in July 2014, once sufficient signatures had been gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201407150037.aspx |title=Referendum on fourth nuclear plant passes initial threshold |author1=Tang, Pei-chun |author2=Su, Justine |author3=Wu, Lilian |newspaper=Focus Taiwan News Channel |date={{date|2014-07-15|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-26|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the Kao referendum was formulated to require positive action: "Do you agree to allow Taiwan Power Co to insert fuel rods into the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City for a test run" so poor voter turnout would result in referendum defeat, and thus create binding opposition to starting the plant.&lt;ref name=tt-20140430 /&gt;

In April 2014, the government decided to halt construction. The first reactor was sealed after the completion of safety checks, and construction of the second reactor was halted. A final decision on whether to proceed with construction would be subject to another referendum.&lt;ref name=reuters-20140428&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/27/taiwan-nuclear-idUKL3N0NJ08C20140427 |title=Taiwan to halt construction of fourth nuclear power plant |work=Reuters(UK) |agency=Reuters |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling KMT stated the purpose of a new referendum was to have the people decide the plant's fate while weighing the consequences of not bringing a major power source on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/23/2003588689 |title=Nuclear plant ‘must be seen in context’ |author=Hsiao, Alison |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2014-04-23|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-11-25|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity prices are estimated to rise by 14–40%, and electricity rationing could be imposed as early as 2021.&lt;ref name=TT20140429&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/29/2003589160 |title=NUCLEAR POWER DEBATE: Scrapping plant would ruin Taipower: Duh |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Completely cancelling the plant would force Taipower to book the construction budget as a total loss and force it into insolvency.&lt;ref name=TT20140429 /&gt;

Meanwhile, also in April 2014, the opposition DPP planned to introduce special legislation to bypass the provisions of the Referendum Act, allowing a simple majority vote (with no threshold of participation) to decide the plant's fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/17/2003588237 |title=DPP plans new law to resolve nuclear dispute |author=Wang, Chris |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Jiang Yi-huah]] cited the prior 2000 precedent when construction was interrupted by executive order which was later ruled unconstitutional&lt;ref name=TT20140422&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/04/22/2003588590 |title=Jiang rejects DPP nuclear statute |author=Wang, Chris |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the reason why he rejected the proposed special legislation. The Executive Yuan stated the plant could start operations if the referendum on halting construction was not held, assuming safety tests were passed first.&lt;ref name=TT20140422 /&gt; Former DPP chairman [[Lin Yi-hsiung]] went on a hunger strike for two weeks to oppose continued construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/05/01/2003589291 |title=Lin ends anti-nuclear hunger strike |author1=Wang, Chris |author2=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a popular poll, which favored lowering the threshold of participation and opposed continued construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/30/2003589235 |title=NUCLEAR POWER DEBATE: Majority wants no plebiscite threshold |author=Wang, Chris |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=30 April 2014 |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed Kao referendum was rejected by the Executive Yuan Referendum Review Committee in August 2014, citing the language as confusing and contradictory, since the reason given for the referendum is in opposition to nuclear power, while the referendum itself asks to start a nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name=tt-20140823 /&gt; Undaunted, supporters of the Kao referendum vowed in October 2014 to initiate another referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/10/17/2003602286 |title=Groups plan second referendum |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=CNA |date={{date|2014-10-17|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-24|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past polls in Taiwan have showed more support for nuclear power among educated than uneducated people. The China Times poll taken in 2000 showed 60% support among those with higher degrees, and only 40% among those with only primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Min|title=Nuclear Energy Development in Asia Problems and Prospects|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-22150-5|pages=183|edition=Energy, Climate and the Environment Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed 3 year construction deferment===

The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed in August 2014 that construction be halted for three years until a national referendum could be held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2014/08/01/2003596370 |title=MOEA unveils three-year nuclear power plant plan |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 August 2014 |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Taipower estimating the three-year cost of sealing Unit 1 as less than {{dollarsign|TWD|lk=on}}2&amp;nbsp;billion.

In September 2014 Taiwan Power Co. submitted its plan to the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) to mothball Unit 1 and halt construction on Unit 2 of the No. 4 nuclear power plant for three years, beginning in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2014/12/327432.html |title=Taiwan ready to defer construction of new nuclear power plant |author=Ko, Shu-ling |date=15 December 2014 |publisher=Kyodo News |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, written in accordance with the April 2014 government directive to halt construction, underwent several revisions until its final submission in January 2015; the AEC approved Taipower's final plan in February, and it will take effect in July 2015 and run through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/02/04/2003610768 |title=AEC approves plan to shutter fourth nuclear facility |author=Lin, Sean |date=4 February 2015 |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 126 systems which passed safety testing, 80 will remain in operation, 14 require periodic testing to ensure they can support their safety functions and 32 will be kept in low-humidity storage.

In September 2015 GE started [[International Court of Arbitration]] proceedings over withheld payments.&lt;ref name=wnn-20151214&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-GE-seeks-arbitration-over-Lungmen-payments-1412154.html |title=GE seeks arbitration over Lungmen payments |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=14 December 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
A Generation III nuclear reactor has a 72-hour capability of passive cooling to prevent damage to its core should the plant face a total blackout after an emergency shut down. If core overheating and meltdown became unavoidable, these reactors have core catchers that will trap the molten fuel and stop the nuclear reaction (although Lungmen, as other ABWR does not have a core catcher but rely on passive cooling of the corium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.tw/english/nuclear/psar/lm_document_psar_19_04.pdf |title=Preliminary Safety Analysis Report, Assessment of Severe Accident Mitigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Finally, a tight containment ensures that no evacuation zone is required around a Generation III nuclear power plant.

The ABWR was designed to a 0.3G earthquake acceleration standard with the Lungmen units seismic hardening increased to 0.4G.

===Reliability===
Some custom made power plants have lower reliability in the first few years of operation. Some parts may prove unsuitable and need replacement or modifications may be necessary. ABWR uses standardized parts to avoid this, but the 3rd and 4th units displayed low reliability (45% - 70%). It is believed this experience provided knowledge that will give better results in future units. The first two units built, [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki Kariwa]] 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/KASHIWAZAKI%20KARIWA-6|title=Kashiwazaki Kariwa-6, Japan |website=World Nuclear Association |year=2017 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/KASHIWAZAKI%20KARIWA-7 |title=Kashiwazaki Kariwa-7, Japan |website=World Nuclear Association |year=2017 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; fared much better than the following two, [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant|Hamaoka]] 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/HAMAOKA-5 |title=Hamaoka-5, Japan |website=World Nuclear Association |year=2017 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shika Nuclear Power Plant|Shika]] 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/SHIKA-2 |title=Shika-2, Japan |website=World Nuclear Association |year=2017 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microcar''' is a French [[microcar]] manufacturer.  The company was founded in 1984 as a division of [[Beneteau|Bénéteau group]], a major [[sailboat]] manufacturer.  Production moved to a new custom-built factory in September 2000. In September 2008, Microcar was acquired by [[Ligier|Ligier Automobiles]] in a deal backed by the Italian private equity firm 21 Investimenti Partners. The merger created Europe's second-biggest manufacturer of microcars, and largest maker of [[quadricycle]]s, or "sans permis" (license-exempt) vehicles. The Microcar and Ligier brands are to retain their separate identities and production facilities. Phillipe Ligier, son of company founder [[Guy Ligier]], serves as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the expanded Ligier Automobiles.

== Current models ==
[[File:Microcar M.Go Electric 001.JPG |thumb|Microcar M.Go Electric at the 2008 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]
[[File:Microcar MC2.JPG|thumb|Microcar MC1]]
The current model range consists solely of the M.Go model introduced in 2009. The M.Go is available in conventional, diesel-engined S, S PACK, MICA, SXI, and Sport trim levels, as well as full electric.

Prior to the M.Go, Microcar was known for their long-running MC Series models, sold as the MC1 and MC2. Both where available as a 2-seat, or 4-seat long wheel base version. The long wheel base being 40mm longer than the short Virgo models. The company also sold a small commercial vehicle called the Sherpa, which was a badge-engineered Ligier X-Pro. The Sherpa was discontinued after the Ligier merger, and the MC has been dropped in favor of the new M.Go. The M.Go was produced with a petrol engine for the UK market.

== Electric vehicles ==
From 2006 to 2010, the long-wheelbase version of Microcar's MC Series was used as the basis for the ZENN EV assembled in Canada by [[ZENN Motor Company]] with an electric drivetrain. It was marketed in the U.S. and Canada under the ZENN brand as a "[[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]"(NEV), with its top speed governed to {{convert|25|mph||abbr=on}}. Microcar began distributing the ZENN in Europe during 2007 under its own brand, as the Microcar ZENN. ZENN Motor purchased engineless, rolling chassis from Microcar and installed their own electric motor and drivetrain. The ZENNs retailed for $16,900 while actual cost was $65,000. Microcar brought electric vehicle production fully in-house with the M.Go Electric in 2009, and ZENN ceased production of its MC-based vehicle in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auto123.com/en/news/green-wheels/canadas-maya-300-the-first-lithium-ion-full-electric-car-sold-in-north-america?model=MAYA+300&amp;make=ELECTROVAYA&amp;artid=105281&amp;pg=2 |title=Canada's Maya 300: the first lithium-ion full electric car sold in North America! - Green Wheels |publisher=Auto123 |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morindone''' is an [[Anthraquinones|anthraquinone compound]] obtained from various ''[[Morinda]]'' [[species]], especially ''[[Morinda tinctoria|M. tinctoria]]'', but also ''[[Morinda citrifolia|M. citrifolia]]''. Its principal use is as a [[dye]], but it has also been investigated for anticancer and microbial uses.

== Preparation ==
Morindone is obtained from the root bark of ''M. tinctoria'' or related species in two stages. In the first step, small roots of immature plants are boiled in alcohol to obtain [[morindin]], a yellowish substance which can also be used in dyeing. Further heating brings about [[hydrolysis]] of two [[glucose]] [[monomer]]s through [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], leaving intensely red crystals.

''M. tinctoria'' is extensively grown in [[India]] for commercial production. Moridin content in the roots peaks in two to three years and drops off considerably after that; some attempts have been made to speed up production using tissue cultures.

==Use as a dye==
Morindone requires a [[mordant]], and the color obtained varies depending on the substance used. Aluminum mordants give a red color, while iron and chromium produce duskier shades. The traditional mordant used in Java, jirak bark (''[[Symplocos fasciculata]]''), is rich in aluminum salts.

Compared to modern dyestuffs, morindone is not as fast or as stable. Since it can be readily cultivated, however, interest in it remains high. Recent research has examined cell culture as a means of increasing yields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1870">'''Northern Electricity Distribution Company''' ('''NEDCO''') is an electricity distribution utility company in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=iounhj/&gt; The company is a subsidiary of the [[Volta River Authority]], the main electricity generation company in the country.&lt;ref name=iounhj&gt;{{cite web|title=New Electricity Company Launched In Northern Region|url=http://northernghana.com/news/i/?n=2353|publisher=northernghana.com|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is the sole supplier of electricity to the three Northern Regions of Ghana: [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region]], [[Upper East Region]] and [[Upper West Region]] and part of the Asante and Volta Regions. The [[Electricity Company of Ghana]] supplies the other regions.&lt;ref name="oijo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nedco.com.gh/news.php | title=NEWS | publisher=nedco.com.gh | accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NEDCO was established in 2005 as part of the [[government of Ghana]]'s policy to reform the country's energy sector. The policy also gave birth to [[Ghana Grid Company]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=iounhj/&gt;

==Operational footprint==
The operations of NEDCO cover over sixty percent of the total land area of Ghana. Its operations extend into the northern parts of [[Volta Region]] and [[Ashanti Region]]. It also supplies power to [[Dapaong]] in [[Togo]], as well as the border towns of [[Po, Burkina Faso|Po]], [[Leo, Burkina Faso|Leo]] and [[Yuoga]] in [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref name="oiujoj"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thechronicle.com.gh/vranedco-board-inaugurated/ | title=VRA/NEDCo board inaugurated | publisher=thechronicle.com.gh | accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is part of the Wikipedia summary of [[Oil Megaprojects]]—see that page for further details.  2005 saw 23 projects come on stream with an aggregate capacity of {{convert|3.951|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} when full production was reached (which may not have been in 2005).

'''Olivier van Noort''' (1558 – 22 February 1627) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchant captain and the first Dutchman to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the world.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivier van Noort was born in 1558 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. He left [[Rotterdam]] on 2 July 1598 with four ships and a plan to attack Spanish possessions in the Pacific and to trade with [[China]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Netherlands and Spain. His ships were poorly equipped, especially in the way of armament and the crews were unruly.

Nonetheless, Van Noort sailed through the [[Magellan Strait]], and captured a number of ships (Spanish and otherwise) along the Pacific coast of South America.&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt; He lost two ships on the way due to a storm, including his largest ship, the ''Hendrick Frederick'', which was wrecked on [[Ternate]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt; In November and December 1600, he established a berth for his two remaining sailboats, ''Mauritius'' and ''Eendracht'', in the surroundings of [[Corregidor Island]] at [[Manila Bay]] in the [[Philippines]]. From there he engaged in what were perceived by the Spanish as pirate activities, targeting the sailing route to and from Manila. This situation was ended after the naval combat of [[Fortune Island (Philippines)|Fortune Island]] on December 14, 1600. The Spanish lost their flagship, the galleon [[San Antonio (ship)|''San Antonio'']] (its wreck would be found in 1992 and yield a treasure in [[porcelain]] and gold pieces) but the Spanish captured the Dutch ''Eendracht'', making van Noort's position untenable and forcing him to retire from the Philippines.

Van Noort returned to Rotterdam via what would become the [[Dutch East Indies]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 26 August 1601 with his last ship, the ''Mauritius'', and 45 of originally 248 men. The venture barely broke even, but was the inspiration for more such expeditions. The united [[Dutch East India Company]] was formed a few months later.

Van Noort's voyage is also told in the book, The Golden Keys&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Koning#Children.27s books&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] 1956, 1970) by [[Hans Koning]], a fictionalized retelling of the voyage of van Noort, and a previous well known voyage of [[Gerrit de Veer]].

[[File:Boeing EC-135C (717-166), USA - Air Force AN1155085.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing EC-135]]C Looking Glass]]
'''Looking Glass''' (or '''Operation Looking Glass''') is the code name for an airborne [[command and control]] center operated by the United States. In more recent years it has been more officially referred to as the '''ABNCP''' (Airborne [[command post|Command Post]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minot.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/954496/looking-glass-usstratcoms-airborne-command-post Looking Glass: USSTRATCOM's Airborne Command Post By Airman 1st Class J.T. Armstrong, Public Affairs / Published September 23, 2016.  ''the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP). ..According to Konowicz, the ABNCP is dual purposed. While it primarily functions as a communications relay platform for submarines with its two trailing antenna wires, it also serves as an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS).] and [https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/ec-135.htm EC-135, Looking Glass. Federation of American Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides command and control of [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear forces]] in the event that ground-based command centers have been destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable. In such an event, the [[general officer]] aboard the Looking Glass serves as the [[Airborne Emergency Action Officer]] (AEAO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minot.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/954496/looking-glass-usstratcoms-airborne-command-post Looking Glass: USSTRATCOM's Airborne Command Post By Airman 1st Class J.T. Armstrong, Public Affairs / Published September 23, 2016  ''Evans sits on alert as an Airborne Emergency Action Officer in command of the battle staff. He remembers first visiting Minot AFB was in the fall of 1986. “The mission hasn’t changed much and neither has its importance,” said Evans.'']&lt;/ref&gt; and by law assumes the authority of the [[National Command Authority]] and could command execution of nuclear attacks. The AEAO is supported by a battle staff of approximately 20 people, with another dozen responsible for the operation of the aircraft systems. The name Looking Glass, which is another name for a mirror, was chosen for the Airborne Command Post because the mission operates in parallel with the underground command post at [[Offutt Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ E-6B Airborne Command Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The code name "Looking Glass" came from the aircraft's ability to "mirror" the command and control functions of the underground command post at [[Strategic Air Command]] headquarters.

Operation Looking Glass was initiated by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Strategic Air Command]] in 1961 and operated by the [[34th Air Refueling Squadron]], [[Offutt AFB]], [[Nebraska]]. In August 1966 the mission transferred to the [[38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron]], the [[2nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron]] in April 1970, to the [[7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron]] in July 1994, and to the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]]'s [[Strategic Communications Wing One]] in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997.

The [[Strategic Air Command]] began the Looking Glass mission on February 3, 1961, using [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]]C&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sasmuseum.com/2008/11/21/ec-135-looking-glass/ Strategic Air &amp; Space Museum: EC-135: Looking Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; airplanes from the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) based at its [[headquarters]] at [[Offutt Air Force Base|Offutt AFB]], [[Nebraska]] backed up by aircraft flying with the [[Second Air Force]] / [[913th Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale AFB]] Louisiana, [[Eighth Air Force]] / [[99th Air Refueling Squadron]] at [[Westover Air Force Base|Westover AFB]], Massachusetts, and [[Fifteenth Air Force]] / [[22d Air Refueling Squadron]], [[March Air Force Base|March AFB]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft were airborne 24 hours a day for over 29 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0900/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0900/stories/0901_0124.html Flying with the A-Bomb on Board: Looking Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; until July 24, 1990, when "The Glass" ceased continuous airborne alert, but remained on ground or airborne alert 24 hours a day.

Looking Glass mirrors ground-based command, control, and communications located at the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]] Global Operations Center (GOC) at [[Offutt Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]] Looking Glass aircraft were equipped with the [[Airborne Launch Control System]], capable of transmitting launch commands to U.S. ground-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) in the event that the ground launch control centers were rendered inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104466/lgm-30g-minuteman-iii/ LGM-30G Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf ALCS Article, page 13]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Looking Glass was also designed to help ensure [[Continuity of government|continuity and reconstitution of the US government]] in the event of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on [[North America]]. Although the two types of aircraft are distinct, the ''Doomsday Plane'' nickname is also frequently associated with the E-4 "Nightwatch" Advanced Airborne Command Post mission and aircraft.

The Looking Glass was the anchor in what was known as the World Wide Airborne Command Post (WWABNCP) network.  This network of specially equipped EC-135 aircraft would launch from ground alert status and establish air-to-air wireless network connections in the event of a U.S. national emergency. Members of the WWABNCP network included: 
#[[Operation Silk Purse]] for the Commander in Chief, [[U.S. European Command]] (USCINCEUR), based at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom (callsign Seabell); 
#Operation "Scope Light" for the Commander in Chief, [[U.S. Atlantic Command]] (CINCLANT), based at Langley AFB, VA; 
#Operation "Blue Eagle" for the Commander in Chief, [[U.S. Pacific Command]] (USCINCPAC), based at Hickam AFB, HI; and 
#Operation "Nightwatch" which supported the President of the United States and were based at Andrews AFB, Maryland. In the early 1970s the [[E-4B]] aircraft replaced the EC-135s on this mission.&lt;ref&gt;[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Auxiliary (EAST Aux) and Western Auxiliary (West Aux) Command Posts were also part of the WWABNCP ("wah-bin-cop") network and were capable of assuming responsibility for Looking Glass as the anchor. The West Aux [[906th Air Refueling Squadron]] was based at [[Minot AFB]], [[North Dakota]], and moved to the [[4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron]] at [[Ellsworth AFB]], [[South Dakota]], in April 1970 and the East Aux mission [[301st Air Refueling Squadron]] was based at [[Lockbourne AFB]], [[Ohio]], and moved to the [[3rd Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron]] at [[Bunker Hill AFB|Grissom AFB]], [[Indiana]], in April 1970. After 1975, East Aux was assumed from the Looking Glass backup ground alert aircraft launched from Offutt AFB. In June 1992, United States Strategic Command took over the Looking Glass mission from the Strategic Air Command, as SAC was disbanded and Strategic Command assumed the nuclear deterrence mission. &lt;ref&gt;[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 116-117]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
On October 1, 1998 the [[United States Navy]] fleet of [[E-6 Mercury|E-6Bs]] replaced the EC-135C in performing the "Looking Glass" mission, previously carried out for 37 years by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Unlike the original Looking Glass aircraft, the E-6Bs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft, not the military-only KC-135. The E-6B provides the National Command Authority with the same capability as the EC-135 fleet to control the nation's [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) force, [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]-capable bombers and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; With the assumption of this mission, a [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]] battle staff now flies with the [[TACAMO]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacamo.navy.mil/wing/index.asp TACAMO - Take Charge And Move Out&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629112942/http://www.tacamo.navy.mil/wing/index.asp |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]] Global Operations Center (GOC) is unable to function in its role, the E-6B Looking Glass can assume command of all U.S. [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]-capable forces. Flying aboard each ABNCP is a crew of 22, which includes an air crew, a Communications Systems Officer and team, an Airborne Emergency Action Officer (an Admiral or General officer), a Mission Commander, a Strike Advisor, an [[Airborne Launch Control System]]/Intelligence Officer, a Meteorological Effects Officer, a Logistics Officer, a Force Status Controller, and an Emergency Actions NCO. In addition to being able to direct the launch of ICBMs using the [[Airborne Launch Control System]], the E-6B can communicate [[Emergency Action Messages]] (EAM) to nuclear submarines running at depth by extending a 2½-mile-long trailing wire antenna (TWA) for use with the [[Survivable Low Frequency Communications System]] (SLFCS), as the EC-135C could.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some speculation that the "mystery plane" seen flying over the [[White House]] on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], was some newer incarnation of Looking Glass. However, as indicated by retired Major General [[Donald Shepperd]], speaking on [[CNN]] on September 12, 2007, the plane circling the White House on 9/11 resembled an [[E-4B]] which was likely launched from Nightwatch ground alert at [[Andrews Air Force Base]].

{{Infobox oxygen}}
'''Oxygen''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''O''' and [[atomic number]] 8. It is a member of the [[chalcogen]] [[Group (periodic table)|group]] on the [[periodic table]], a highly [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] [[nonmetal]], and an [[oxidizing agent]] that readily forms [[oxide]]s with most elements as well as with other [[chemical compound|compounds]].  By mass, oxygen is the third-[[Abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the universe, after [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].  At [[standard temperature and pressure]], two atoms of the element [[chemical bond|bind]] to form [[Allotropes of oxygen#Dioxygen|dioxygen]], a colorless and odorless [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the formula {{chem|O|2}}. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. As compounds including oxides, the element makes up almost half of the [[Earth's crust]].

Dioxygen is used in [[cellular respiration]] and many major classes of [[organic molecule]]s in [[living organism]]s contain oxygen, such as [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[fat]]s, as do the major constituent [[inorganic compound]]s of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of [[water]], the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by [[photosynthesis]], which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form ([[allotropes of oxygen|allotrope]]) of oxygen, [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), strongly absorbs ultraviolet [[UVB]] radiation and the high-altitude [[ozone layer]] helps protect the [[biosphere]] from [[ultraviolet radiation]]. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of [[smog]] and thus a pollutant.

Oxygen was isolated by [[Sendivogius|Michael Sendivogius]] before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], in [[Uppsala]], in 1773 or earlier, and [[Joseph Priestley]] in [[Wiltshire]], in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element.  The name ''oxygen'' was coined in 1777 by [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.

Common uses of oxygen include production of [[steel]], [[plastics]] and [[textiles]], [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|brazing, welding and cutting]] of steels and other [[metals]], [[rocket propellant]], [[oxygen therapy]], and [[life support system]]s in [[aircraft]], [[submarines]], [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] and [[underwater diving|diving]].

==Etymology==
The name ''oxygen'' was coined in 1777 by [[Antoine Lavoisier]], whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] and [[corrosion]].  Its name derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ὀξύς ''oxys'', "acid", literally "sharp", referring to the [[Taste#Sourness|sour taste]] of [[acid]]s and -γενής ''-genes'', "producer", literally "begetter", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.

==History==
===Early experiments===

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between [[combustion]] and air was conducted by the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BCE [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writer on mechanics, [[Philo of Byzantium]]. In his work ''Pneumatica'', Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Story of Human Error|first = Joseph |last = Jastrow|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tRUO45YfCHwC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171|page= 171 |date = 1936|publisher = Ayer Publishing|isbn = 978-0-8369-0568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the [[classical element]] [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later [[Leonardo da Vinci]] built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]].&lt;ref name="ECE499"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p.499.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Robert Boyle]] proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist [[John Mayow]] (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called ''spiritus nitroaereus''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mayow, John|volume=17|pages=938–939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects.&lt;ref name="WoC"&gt;{{cite book|title=World of Chemistry|chapter=John Mayow|date=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|chapter-url=http://www.bookrags.com/John_Mayow|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''World of Chemistry'' contributors|isbn=978-0-669-32727-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.

Mayow observed that [[antimony]] increased in weight when heated, and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work ''Tractatus duo'' in the tract "De respiratione".&lt;ref name="WoC"/&gt;

===Phlogiston theory===
{{Main|Phlogiston theory}}

[[Robert Hooke]], [[Ole Borch]], [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], and [[Pierre Bayen]] all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a [[chemical element]].&lt;ref name="NBB299"&gt;[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.299&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and [[corrosion]] called the ''phlogiston theory'', which was then the favored explanation of those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Best | first1 = Nicholas W. | year = 2015 | title = Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' I: Against Phlogiston Theory | journal = [[Foundations of Chemistry]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 137–151 | doi=10.1007/s10698-015-9220-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1667 by the German alchemist [[J. J. Becher]], and modified by the chemist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] by 1731,&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite book| title = The last sorcerers: The path from alchemy to the periodic table
| last = Morris| first = Richard| date = 2003|publisher = Joseph Henry Press|location = Washington, D.C.|isbn = 978-0-309-08905-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form, or [[calx]].&lt;ref name="ECE499"/&gt;

Highly combustible materials that leave little [[residue (chemistry)|residue]], such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.&lt;ref name="ECE499"/&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:PriestleyFuseli.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Joseph Priestley]] is usually given priority in the discovery.|alt=A drawing of an elderly man sitting by a table and facing parallel to the drawing. His left arm rests on a notebook, legs crossed.]]

Polish [[Alchemy|alchemist]], [[philosopher]], and [[physician]] [[Sendivogius|Michael Sendivogius]] in his work ''De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti'' (1604) described a substance contained in air, referring to it as 'cibus vitae' (food of life&lt;ref name="Marples"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marples|first1=Frater James A.|title=Michael Sendivogius, Rosicrucian, and Father Of Studies of Oxygen|url=http://www.masonic.benemerito.net/msricf/papers/marples/marples-michael.sendivogius.pdf |publisher=Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis, Nebraska College |accessdate=2018-05-25 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and this substance is identical with oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bugaj"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bugaj|first1= Roman|title= Michał Sędziwój - Traktat o Kamieniu Filozoficznym |journal=Biblioteka Problemów |date=1971 |volume=164 |pages=83–84 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=d0gaAQAAMAAJ |language=pl |issn=0137-5032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sendivogius, during his experiments performed between 1598 and 1604, properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous byproduct released by the [[thermal decomposition]] of [[potassium nitrate]]. In Bugaj’s view, the [[List of purification methods in chemistry|isolation]] of oxygen and the proper association of the substance to that part of air which is required for life, lends sufficient weight to the discovery of oxygen by Sendivogius.{{r|Bugaj}} This discovery of Sendivogius was however frequently denied by the generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him.{{r|Marples}}

It is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]. He had produced oxygen gas by heating [[Mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]] and various [[nitrate]]s in 1771–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/8/oxygen |title=Oxygen  |publisher=RSC.org |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECE499"/&gt; Scheele called the gas "fire air" because it was then the only known [[Oxidizing agent|agent]] to support combustion. He wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript titled ''Treatise on Air and Fire'', which he sent to his publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.&lt;ref name="NBB300"&gt;[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman [[Joseph Priestley]] focused sunlight on [[mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]] (HgO) contained in a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named "dephlogisticated air".&lt;ref name="ECE500"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while [[breathing]] it. After breathing the gas himself, Priestley wrote: "The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of [[Atmosphere of Earth|common air]], but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards."&lt;ref name="NBB299"/&gt; Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air," which was included in the second volume of his book titled ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]''.&lt;ref name="ECE499"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An Account of Further Discoveries in Air|first = Joseph |last = Priestley |journal = Philosophical Transactions |date = 1775 |volume = 65 |pages = 384–94 |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1775.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.

The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier|Antoine Laurent Lavoisier]] later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also dispatched a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774, that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt;

===Lavoisier's contribution===
Lavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on [[oxidation]] and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works.&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt; He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a [[chemical element]].
[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] discredited the phlogiston theory.|alt=A drawing of a young man facing towards the viewer, but looking on the side. He wear a white curly wig, dark suit and white scarf.]]
In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when [[tin]] and air were heated in a closed container.&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt; He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book ''Sur la combustion en général'', which was published in 1777.&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt; In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and ''azote'' (Gk. ''{{lang|grc|ἄζωτον}}'' "lifeless"), which did not support either. ''Azote'' later became ''[[nitrogen]]'' in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt;

Lavoisier renamed 'vital air' to ''oxygène'' in 1777 from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''{{lang|grc|ὀξύς}} (oxys)'' ([[acid]], literally "sharp", from the taste of acids) and ''-γενής (-genēs)'' (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids.&lt;ref name="mellor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parks|first=G. D.|last2=Mellor|first2=J. W.|date=1939|title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry|edition=6th |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemists (such as Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard (hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry), but by then the name was too well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oxygen'' entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled "Oxygen" in the popular book ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1791) by [[Erasmus Darwin]], grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt;

===Later history===
[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert H. Goddard]] and a liquid oxygen-gasoline [[rocket]]|alt=A metal frame structure stands on the snow near a tree. A middle-aged man wearing a coat, boots, leather gloves and a cap stands by the structure and holds it with his right hand.]]

[[John Dalton]]'s original [[Atomic theory#Earliest empirical evidence|atomic hypothesis]] presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the [[atomic mass]] of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Interactive Textbook of PFP96 |chapter= Do We Take Atoms for Granted?|chapterurl=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/Contents.html |first=Dennis |last=DeTurck |last2=Gladney|first2=Larry|last3=Pietrovito|first3=Anthony| publisher=University of Pennsylvania|date=1997|accessdate=January 28, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117230939/http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Chemistry|first=Henry Enfield |last=Roscoe |last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|page=38|date=1883|publisher=D. Appleton and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;These results were mostly ignored until 1860. Part of this rejection was due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] towards atoms of the same element, and part was due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade]] method, Swiss chemist and physicist [[Raoul Pictet|Raoul Pierre Pictet]] [[evaporation|evaporated]] liquid [[sulfur dioxide]] in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris announcing his discovery of [[liquid oxygen]].&lt;ref name="BES707"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|last=Daintith|first=John|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0287-6|page=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two days later, French physicist [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.&lt;ref name="BES707"/&gt; Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Zygmunt Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Louis Paul Cailletet: The liquefaction of oxygen and the emergence of low-temperature research  |first =Faidra |last = Papanelopoulou |journal =Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |date = 2013|volume = 67 |issue=4|pages = 355–73|doi = 10.1098/rsnr.2013.0047 |pmc=3826198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 Scottish chemist [[James Dewar]] was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study.&lt;ref name="NBB303"&gt;[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.303&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then [[distillation|distilled]] the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately.&lt;ref name="HPAM"&gt;{{cite book|title=How Products are Made|chapter=Oxygen|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|date=2002|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/oxygen|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''How Products are Made'' contributors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene [[welding]] was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of [[acetylene]] and compressed {{chem|O|2}}. This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.&lt;ref name="HPAM"/&gt;

In 1923, the American scientist [[Robert H. Goddard]] became the first person to develop a [[rocket engine]] that burned liquid fuel; the engine used [[gasoline]] for fuel and liquid oxygen as the [[oxidizer]]. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56&amp;nbsp;m at 97&amp;nbsp;km/h on March 16, 1926 in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]], US.&lt;ref name="HPAM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddard-1926 |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000132.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108225824/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000132.html |archivedate=November 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally, possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scrippso2.ucsd.edu/|title=Atmospheric Oxygen Research|author=Scripps Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Properties and molecular structure===
[[File:Oxygen molecule orbitals diagram.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Orbital diagram, after Barrett (2002),&lt;ref name=Barrett2002/&gt; showing the participating atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom, the molecular orbitals that result from their overlap, and the [[Aufbau principle|aufbau]] filling of the orbitals with the 12 electrons, 6 from each O atom, beginning from the lowest energy orbitals, and resulting in covalent double bond character from filled orbitals (and cancellation of the contributions of the pairs of σ and σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and {{pi}} and {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbital pairs).]]
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|O|2}}, referred to as dioxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/chemistry/oxygen.html|title=Oxygen Facts|publisher=Science Kids|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''dioxygen'', two oxygen atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bound]] to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent [[double bond]] that results from the filling of [[molecular orbitals]] formed from the [[atomic orbital]]s of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a [[bond order]] of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or [[Aufbau principle|Aufbau]], filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and {{pi}} overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest {{pi}} and {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals.&lt;ref name=Barrett2002&gt;Jack Barrett, 2002, "Atomic Structure and Periodicity, (Basic concepts in chemistry, Vol. 9 of Tutorial chemistry texts), Cambridge, U.K.:Royal Society of Chemistry, p. 153, {{ISBN|0854046577}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0854046577] accessed January 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination of cancellations and σ and {{pi}} overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic [[ground state]]. An [[electron configuration]] with two unpaired electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled {{pi}}* orbitals in the diagram) that are of equal energy—i.e., [[degenerate orbitals|degenerate]]—is a configuration termed a [[spin triplet]] state. Hence, the ground state of the {{chem|O|2}} molecule is referred to as [[triplet oxygen]].&lt;ref name="BiochemOnline"&gt;{{cite web|work=Biochemistry Online|url=http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/oxphos/oldioxygenchem.html |title=Chapter 8: Oxidation-Phosphorylation, the Chemistry of Di-Oxygen|first=Henry|last=Jakubowski|accessdate=January 28, 2008|publisher=Saint John's University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;An orbital is a concept from [[quantum mechanics]] that models an electron as a [[Wave–particle duality|wave-like particle]] that has a spatial distribution about an atom or molecule.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are [[antibonding]], and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.&lt;ref name="Weiss2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = H.

It is also the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass).&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt; Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes).&lt;ref name="ECE500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBB298"&gt;[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Figures given are for values up to {{convert|50|mi|km}} above the surface&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is unusual among the planets of the [[Solar System]] in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: [[Mars]] (with 0.1% {{chem|O|2}} by volume) and [[Venus]] have much less. The {{chem|O|2}} surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.

The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the [[oxygen cycle]]. This [[biogeochemical cycle]] describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[Decomposition|decay]], and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of {{chem|O|2}} at lower temperatures (see [[#Physical properties|Physical properties]]) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.&lt;ref&gt;From The Chemistry and Fertility of Sea Waters by H.W.

[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatologists]] measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the [[Animal shell|shells]] and [[skeleton]]s of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]). [[Seawater]] molecules that contain the lighter [[isotope]], oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name="NBB304"&gt;[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.304&lt;/ref&gt; During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate.&lt;ref name="NBB304"/&gt; Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of [[ice core]] samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.

[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Planetary geologists]] have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[meteorite]]s, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the [[Sun]], believed to be the same as those of the [[Nebular hypothesis|primordial solar nebula]]. Analysis of a [[silicon]] wafer exposed to the [[solar wind]] in space and returned by the crashed [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis spacecraft]] has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's [[Protoplanetary disk|disk of protoplanetary material]] prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hand|first = Eric|title = The Solar System's first breath|journal = Nature|volume = 452|page = 259|date = March 13, 2008|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/452259a.html|doi = 10.1038/452259a|accessdate =March 18, 2009|pmid = 18354437|issue = 7185|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..259H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Air separation|Oxygen evolution|Fractional distillation}}

One hundred&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;tonnes of {{chem|O|2}} are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods.&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt; The most common method is [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air, with {{chem|N|2}} [[distillation|distilling]] as a vapor while {{chem|O|2}} is left as a liquid.&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt;

The other primary method of producing {{chem|O|2}} is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical [[zeolite]] molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;93% {{chem|O|2}}.&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt; Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as [[pressure swing adsorption]]. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-[[cryogenics|cryogenic]] technologies (see also the related [[vacuum swing adsorption]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html|title=Non-Cryogenic Air Separation Processes|date=2003|accessdate=December 16, 2007|publisher=UIG Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen gas can also be produced through [[electrolysis of water]] into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. A similar method is the electrocatalytic {{chem|O|2}} evolution from oxides and [[oxoacid]]s. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through [[ceramic]] membranes based on [[zirconium dioxide]] by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure {{chem|O|2}} gas.&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt;

== Storage ==
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|Oxygen and [[MAPP gas]] compressed gas cylinders with regulators]]
[[Oxygen storage]] methods include high pressure [[oxygen tank]]s, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one [[litre|liter]] of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840&amp;nbsp;liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and {{convert|20|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt; Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through [[heat exchanger]]s, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]].&lt;ref name="NBB300"/&gt;

{{Main|Oxygen therapy}}

Uptake of {{chem|O|2}} from the air is the essential purpose of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], so oxygen supplementation is used in [[medicine]]. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart.

===Life support and recreational use===
[[File:Wisoff on the Arm - GPN-2000-001069.jpg|thumb|Low pressure pure {{chem|O|2}} is used in [[space suit]]s.]]

An application of {{chem|O|2}} as a low-pressure [[breathing gas]] is in modern [[space suit]]s, which surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of {{chem|O|2}}. This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.&lt;ref name="pmid11541018"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morgenthaler GW|author2=Fester DA|author3=Cooley CG| title=As assessment of habitat pressure, oxygen fraction, and EVA suit design for space operations|journal=Acta Astronautica |volume= 32|issue=1|pages=39–49|date=1994|pmid=11541018|doi=10.1016/0094-5765(94)90146-5|bibcode = 1994AcAau..32...39M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2730484"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webb JT|author2= Olson RM|author3=Krutz RW|author4=Dixon G|author5=Barnicott PT|title=Human tolerance to 100% oxygen at 9.5 psia during five daily simulated 8-hour EVA exposures|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=60|issue=5|pages=415–21|date=1989|pmid=2730484|doi=10.4271/881071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and [[Surface-supplied diving|surface-supplied]] [[underwater divers]] and [[submarine]]rs also rely on artificially delivered {{chem|O|2}}. Submarines, submersibles and [[atmospheric diving suits]] usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure. Breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure. [[Ambient pressure]] divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth. Pure or nearly pure {{chem|O|2}} use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to [[rebreathers]], or [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]] at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth, or less),&lt;ref name="Acott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acott|first=C.|title=Oxygen toxicity: A brief history of oxygen in diving|journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal|volume=29|issue=3|date=1999 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6014|accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Longphre"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longphre|first=J.

Deeper diving requires significant dilution of {{chem|O|2}} with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to prevent [[oxygen toxicity]].&lt;ref name="Acott"/&gt;

People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized [[fixed-wing aircraft]] sometimes have supplemental {{chem|O|2}} supplies.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The reason is that increasing the proportion of oxygen in the breathing gas at low pressure acts to augment the inspired {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure nearer to that found at sea-level.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of {{chem|O|2}} automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates [[chemical oxygen generator]]s above each seat, causing [[oxygen mask]]s to drop. Pulling on the masks "to start the flow of oxygen" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the [[sodium chlorate]] inside the canister.&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt; A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the [[exothermic]] reaction.

Oxygen, as a mild [[euphoria|euphoric]], has a history of recreational use in [[oxygen bar]]s and in [[sport]]s. Oxygen bars are establishments found in the United States since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal {{chem|O|2}} exposure for a minimal fee.&lt;ref name="FDA-O2Bars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/2002/602_air.html| title=Oxygen Bars: Is a Breath of Fresh Air Worth It?|last=Bren|first=Linda|work=FDA Consumer magazine|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=November–December 2002|accessdate=December 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018041754/http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/2002/602_air.html|archivedate=October 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional athletes, especially in [[American football]], sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance.

[[Smelting]] of [[iron ore]] into [[steel]] consumes 55% of commercially produced oxygen.&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt; In this process, {{chem|O|2}} is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which removes [[sulfur]] impurities and excess [[carbon]] as the respective oxides, {{chem|SO|2}} and {{chem|CO|2}}. The reactions are [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], so the temperature increases to 1,700&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt;

Another 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt; [[Ethylene]] is reacted with {{chem|O|2}} to create [[ethylene oxide]], which, in turn, is converted into [[ethylene glycol]]; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products, including [[antifreeze]] and [[polyester]] polymers (the precursors of many [[plastic]]s and [[fabric]]s).&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt;

Most of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, [[gas welding|metal cutting and welding]], as an oxidizer in [[rocket fuel]], and in [[water treatment]].&lt;ref name="NBB301"/&gt; Oxygen is used in [[oxyacetylene welding]] burning [[acetylene]] with {{chem|O|2}} to produce a very hot flame.

The [[oxidation state]] of oxygen is −2 in almost all known compounds of oxygen. The oxidation state −1 is found in a few compounds such as [[peroxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 ([[superoxide]]s), −1/3 ([[ozonide]]s), 0 ([[Allotropes of oxygen|elemental]], [[hypofluorous acid]]), +1/2 ([[dioxygenyl]]), +1 ([[dioxygen difluoride]]), and +2 ([[oxygen difluoride]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]: [http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf ''Red Book.''] p.&amp;nbsp;73 and 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is an oxide of [[hydrogen]] and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are [[covalent bonding|covalently bonded]] to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=P.|last=Maksyutenko|first2=T.

The interactions between the different [[dipole]]s of each molecule cause a net attraction force.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|left|Oxides, such as [[iron oxide]] or [[rust]], form when oxygen combines with other elements.|alt=A rusty piece of a bolt.]]
Due to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms [[chemical bond]]s with almost all other elements to give corresponding [[oxide]]s. The surface of most metals, such as [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]], are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal and slows further [[corrosion]]. Many oxides of the [[transition metal]]s are [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, with slightly less metal than the [[chemical formula]] would show. For example, the mineral [[Iron(II) oxide|FeO]] ([[wüstite]]) is written as {{chem|Fe|1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''|O}}, where ''x'' is usually around 0.05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lesley E.|last=Smart|last2=Moore|first2=Elaine A. |title=Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction|edition=3rd |publisher=CRC Press|date=2005|page=214|isbn=978-0-7487-7516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}). The [[Earth's crust]]al [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is composed in large part of oxides of [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|silica]] {{chem|SiO|2}}, as found in [[granite]] and [[quartz]]), aluminium ([[aluminium oxide]] {{chem|Al|2|O|3}}, in [[bauxite]] and [[corundum]]), iron ([[iron(III) oxide]] {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, in [[hematite]] and [[rust]]), and [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[limestone]]). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex [[silicate]]s (in [[silicate minerals]]). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.

Water-[[solubility|soluble]] silicates in the form of {{chem|Na|4|SiO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|SiO|3}}, and {{chem|Na|2|Si|2|O|5}} are used as [[detergent]]s and [[adhesive]]s.&lt;ref name="ECE507"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p.507&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen also acts as a [[ligand]] for transition metals, forming [[transition metal dioxygen complexes]], which feature metal–{{chem|O|2}}.  This class of compounds includes the [[heme]] proteins [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crabtree|first=R.|title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2001|page=152|isbn=978-0-471-18423-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with [[platinum hexafluoride|{{chem|PtF|6}}]], which oxidizes oxygen to give O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate]].&lt;ref name="ECE505"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p.505&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): [[alcohol]]s (R-OH); [[ether]]s (R-O-R); [[ketone]]s (R-CO-R); [[aldehyde]]s (R-CO-H); [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-COOH); [[ester]]s (R-COO-R); [[Organic acid anhydride|acid anhydrides]] (R-CO-O-CO-R); and [[amide]]s ({{chem|R-C(O)-NR|2}}). There are many important organic [[solvent]]s that contain oxygen, including: [[acetone]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]], [[furan]], [[tetrahydrofuran|THF]], [[diethyl ether]], [[1,4-Dioxane|dioxane]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[dimethylformamide|DMF]], [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[acetic acid]], and [[formic acid]]. Acetone ({{chem|(CH|3|)|2|CO}}) and [[phenol]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|OH}}) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: [[glycerol]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[citric acid]], [[acetic anhydride]], and [[acetamide]]. [[Epoxide]]s are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all [[biomolecule]]s that are important to (or generated by) life.

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds at or below room temperature in a process called [[autoxidation]].&lt;ref name="ECE506"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p.506&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[organic compound]]s that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of {{chem|O|2}}. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include [[ethylene oxide]] and [[peracetic acid]].&lt;ref name="ECE507"/&gt;

==Safety and precautions==
The [[NFPA 704]] standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of [[hyperoxia]] from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.&lt;ref name=nfpa&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rivcoeh.org/Portals/0/documents/guidance/hazmat/bep_nfparatings.pdf|publisher =Riverside County Department of Environmental Health |accessdate=August 22, 2017 |title =NFPA 704 ratings and id numbers for common hazardous materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen gas ({{chem|O|2}}) can be [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]] at elevated [[partial pressure]]s, leading to [[convulsion]]s and other health problems.&lt;ref name="Acott" /&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Since {{chem|O|2}}'s partial pressure is the fraction of {{chem|O|2}} times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur either from high {{chem|O|2}} fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure, or a combination of both.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECE511"&gt;[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook &amp; Lauer 1968]], p.511&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilo[[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]&amp;nbsp;(kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure of about 21&amp;nbsp;kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on [[mechanical ventilator]]s, since gas supplied through [[oxygen mask]]s in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% {{chem|O|2}} by volume (about 30&amp;nbsp;kPa at standard pressure).&lt;ref name="NBB299"/&gt;

Breathing pure {{chem|O|2}} in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]], causes no damage due to the low total pressures used.&lt;ref name="pmid11541018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Wade|first = Mark|date = 2007|url = http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm|title = Space Suits|publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213122134/http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm |archivedate = December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of spacesuits, the {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30&amp;nbsp;kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalrph.com/martin_4_most2.htm |title=The Four Most Important Equations In Clinical Practice |last=Martin |first=Lawrence |website=GlobalRPh |publisher=David McAuley |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and [[central nervous system]] can also occur in deep [[scuba diving]] and [[surface supplied diving]].&lt;ref name="NBB299"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acott"/&gt; Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure more than 60&amp;nbsp;kPa can eventually lead to permanent [[pulmonary fibrosis]].&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilmshurst P |title=Diving and oxygen |journal=BMJ |volume=317 |issue=7164 |pages=996–9 |date=1998 |pmid=9765173 |pmc=1114047 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7164.996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to a {{chem|O|2}} partial pressures greater than 160&amp;nbsp;kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers).

===Combustion and other hazards===
[[File:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the [[Apollo 1]] Command Module. Pure {{chem|O|2}} at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss of the [[Apollo 1]] crew.|alt=The inside of a small spaceship, charred and apparently destroyed.]]
Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. [[Fire]] and [[explosion]] hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and [[fuel]]s are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion.&lt;ref name="Weiss2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astm-tpt"&gt;{{cite conference|editor1-last=Werley|editor1-first=Barry L.|date=1991|work=Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems|title=ASTM Technical Professional training|publisher=[[ASTM International]] Subcommittee G-4.05|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.&lt;ref name="Weiss2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2015" /&gt;

Concentrated {{chem|O|2}} will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.&lt;ref name="astm-tpt" /&gt; [[Steel]] pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and [[liquid oxygen]] will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of {{chem|O|2}} systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized.&lt;ref name="astm-tpt" /&gt; The fire that killed the [[Apollo 1]] crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure {{chem|O|2}} but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the {{frac|1|3}} normal pressure that would be used in a mission.{{refn|No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified, although some evidence points to an arc from an electrical spark.&lt;ref&gt;(Report of Apollo 204 Review Board NASA Historical Reference Collection, NASA History Office, NASA HQ, Washington, DC)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}}&lt;ref name="chiles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiles|first=James R.|date=2001|title=Inviting Disaster: Lessons from the edge of Technology: An inside look at catastrophes and why they happen|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc.|isbn=978-0-06-662082-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as [[wood]], [[petrochemical]]s, and [[asphalt]] can cause these materials to [[Detonation|detonate]] unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.&lt;ref name="astm-tpt" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15597">'''Plasma actuators''' are a type of [[actuator]] currently being developed for aerodynamic [[flow control (fluid)|flow control]]. [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] actuators impart force in a similar way to [[ionocraft]].

The working of these actuators is based on the formation of a low-temperature plasma between a pair of asymmetric [[electrode]]s by application of a high-voltage AC signal across the electrodes. Consequently, air molecules from the air surrounding the electrodes are ionized, and are accelerated through the electric field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameswgregory.com/plasma.html James W. Gregory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Streamwise.JPG|thumb|Glow of plasma actuator discharges]]

==Introduction==
Plasma actuators operating at the atmospheric conditions are promising for flow control, mainly for their physical properties, such as the induced body force by a strong electric field and the generation of heat during an electric arc, and the simplicity of their constructions and placements. In particular, the recent invention of glow discharge plasma actuators by Roth (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = J. R. | year = 2003 | title = Aerodynamic flow acceleration using paraelectric and peristaltic electrohydrodynamic effects of a one-atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (OAUGDP) | doi = 10.1063/1.1564823 | journal = Physics of Plasmas | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 1166–1172 | bibcode = 2003PhPl...10.2117R }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can produce sufficient quantities of glow discharge plasma in the atmosphere pressure air helps to yield an increase in flow control performance.

[[File:SpanwiseActuatorYVelocity.jpg|thumb|Local flow speed induced by a plasma actuator]]

==Power supply and electrode layouts==
Either a [[direct current]] (DC) or an [[alternating current]] (AC) power supply or a microwave microdischarge can be used for different configurations of plasma actuators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = E. | year = 2007 | title = Airflow control by non-thermal plasma actuators | url = | journal = J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 605–636 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/40/3/s01| bibcode = 2007JPhD...40..605M}}&lt;/ref&gt; One schematic of an AC power supply design for a [[dielectric barrier discharge]] plasma actuator is given here as an example. The performance of plasma actuators is determined by dielectric materials and power inputs, later is limited by the qualities of [[MOSFET]] or [[IGBT]].
[[File:Power Plasma.tiff|thumb|Driving circuits (E-type) of a power supply]]

The driving waveforms can be optimized to achieve a better actuation (induced flow speed). However, a sinusoidal waveform may be more preferable for the simplicity in power supply construction. The additional benefit is the relatively less [[electromagnetic interference]]. [[Pulse width modulation]] can be adopted to instantaneously adjust the strength of actuation.&lt;ref name="huang_IEEE"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = X. | last2 = Chan | first2 = S. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | year = 2007 | title = An atmospheric plasma actuator for aeroacoustic applications | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 693–695 | doi=10.1109/tps.2007.896781| bibcode = 2007ITPS...35..693H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulation of the encapsulated electrode and distributing the encapsulated electrode throughout the dielectric layer has been shown to alter the performance of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator. Locating the initial encapsulated electrode closer to the dielectric surface results in induced velocities higher than the baseline case for a given voltage. In addition, Actuators with a shallow initial electrode are able to more efficiently impart momentum and mechanical power into the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rasool Erfani | first1 = Zare-Behtash H. | last2 = Hale | first2 = C. | last3 = Kontis | first3 = K. | year = 2015 | title = Development of DBD plasma actuators: The double encapsulated electrode | doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2014.12.016 | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 109 | issue = | pages = 132–143 | bibcode = 2015AcAau.109..132E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No matter how much funding has been invested and the number of various private claims of a high induced speed, the maximum, average speed induced by plasma actuators on an atmospheric pressure conviction, without any assistant of mechanical amplifier (chamber, cavity etc.), is still less than 10&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name="huangPoF2" /&gt;

==Influence of temperature==
When dealing with real life aircraft equipped with plasma actuators, it is important to consider the effect of temperature. The temperature variations encountered during a flight envelope may have adverse effects in actuator performance. It is found that for a constant peak-to-peak voltage the maximum velocity produced by the actuator depends directly on the dielectric surface temperature. The findings suggest that by changing the actuator temperature the performance can be maintained or even altered at different environmental conditions. Increasing dielectric surface temperature can increase the plasma actuator performance by increasing the momentum flux whilst consuming slightly higher energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rasool Erfani | first1 = Zare-Behtash H. | last2 = Kontis | first2 = K. | year = 2012 | title = Plasma actuator: Influence of dielectric surface temperature | doi = 10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2012.04.023 | journal = Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 258–264 | url = http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/84620/1/84620.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flow control applications==
Some recent applications of plasma actuation include high-speed flow control using localized arc filament plasma actuators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samimy | first1 = M. | last2 = Kim | first2 = J. H. | last3 = Kastner | first3 = J. | last4 = Adamovich | first4 = I. | last5 = Utkin | first5 = Y. | year = 2007 | title = Active control of high-speed and high-Reynolds-number jets using plasma actuators | url = | journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics | volume = 578 | issue = | pages = 305–330 | doi=10.1017/s0022112007004867| bibcode = 2007JFM...578..305S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and low-speed flow control using dielectric barrier discharges&lt;ref name="huang_JSV"&gt;Huang, X., Zhang, X., and Li, Y. (2010) Broadband Flow-Induced Sound Control using Plasma Actuators, Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol 329, No 13, pp.&amp;nbsp;2477–2489.&lt;/ref&gt; and sliding discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Y. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = X. | last3 = Huang | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = The Use of Plasma Actuators for Bluff Body Broadband Noise Control | url = | journal = Experiments in Fluids | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 367–377 | doi=10.1007/s00348-009-0806-3| bibcode = 2010ExFl...49..367L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present research of plasma actuators is mainly focused on three directions: (1) various designs of plasma actuators; (2) flow control applications; and (3) control-oriented modeling of flow applications under plasma actuation. In addition, new experimental and numerical methods&lt;ref name="EdPLA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peers | first1 = Ed | last2 = Huang | first2 = Xun | last3 = Ma | first3 = Zhaokai | year = 2010 | title = A numerical model of plasma effects in flow control | url = | journal = Physics Letters A | volume = 374 | issue = 13–14| pages = 1501–1504 | doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2009.08.046| bibcode = 2010PhLA..374.1501P }}&lt;/ref&gt; are being developed to provide physical insights.

===Vortex generator===
A plasma actuator induces a local flow speed perturbation, which will be developed downstream to a vortex sheet. As a result, plasma actuators can behave as [[vortex generators]]. The difference between this and traditional vortex generation is that there are no mechanical moving parts or any drilling holes on aerodynamic surfaces, demonstrating an important benefit of plasma actuators. Three dimensional actuators such as [[Serpentine geometry plasma actuator]] generate streamwise oriented vortices&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Arnob, and Subrata Roy. "Three-dimensional plasma actuation for faster transition to turbulence." Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics 50.42 (2017): 425201.&lt;/ref&gt;, which are useful to control the flow&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Jin-Jun, Kwing-So Choi, Li-Hao Feng, Timothy N. Jukes, and Richard D. Whalley. "Recent developments in DBD plasma flow control." Progress in Aerospace Sciences 62 (2013): 52-78.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:StreamwiseActuatorOpen-loop3D.jpg|thumb|Plasma induced flow field]]

===Active noise control===
[[Active noise control]] normally denotes noise cancellation, that is, a noise-cancellation speaker emits a sound wave with the same amplitude but with inverted phase (also known as antiphase) to the original sound. However, active noise control with plasma adopts different strategies. The first one uses the discovery that sound pressure could be attenuated when it passes through a [[plasma sheet]].
The second one, and being more widely used, is to actively suppress the flow-field that is responsible to flow-induced noise (also known as [[aeroacoustics]]), using plasma actuators. It has been demonstrated that both tonal noise&lt;ref name="huangPoF2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = X. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = X. | year = 2008 | title = Streamwise and Spanwise Plasma Actuators for Flow-Induced Cavity Noise Control | url = | journal = Physics of Fluids | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 037101–037101–10 | doi=10.1063/1.2890448| bibcode = 2008PhFl...20c7101H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadband noise&lt;ref name="huang_JSV" /&gt; (difference can refer to [[tonal versus broadband]]) can be actively attenuated by a carefully designed plasma actuator.

===Supersonic and Hypersonic flow control===
Plasma has been introduced to hypersonic flow control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shang | first1 = J.S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plasma actuators for hypersonic flow control | url = | journal = Progress in Aerospace Sciences | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 642–668 | doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2005.11.001| bibcode = 2005PrAeS..41..642S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, plasma could be much easier generated for hypersonic vehicle at high altitude with quite low atmospheric pressure and high surface temperature. Secondly, the classical aerodynamic surface has little actuation for the case.

Interest in plasma actuators as active flow control devices is growing rapidly due to their lack of mechanical parts, light weight and high response frequency. The characteristics of a [[dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD) plasma actuator when exposed to an unsteady flow generated by a [[shock tube]] is examined. A Study shows that not only is the shear layer outside of the shock tube affected by the plasma but the passage of the shock front and high-speed flow behind it also greatly influences the properties of the plasma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rasool Erfani | first1 = Zare-Behtash H. | last2 = Kontis | first2 = K. | year = 2012 | title = Influence of Shock Wave Propagation on Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Actuator Performance | doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/45/22/225201 | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume =  45| issue = 22| pages =  225201| bibcode = 2012JPhD...45v5201E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight control===
Plasma actuators could be mounted on the airfoil to control flight attitude and thereafter flight trajectory. The cumbersome design and maintenance efforts of mechanical and hydraulic transmission systems in a classical rudder can thus be saved. The price to pay is that one should design a suitable high voltage/power electric system satisfying EMC rule. Hence, in addition to flow control, plasma actuators hold potential in top-level flight control, in particular for UAV and extraterrestrial planet (with suitable atmospheric conditions) investigations.

On the other hand, the whole flight control strategy should be reconsidered taking account of characteristics of plasma actuators. One preliminary roll control system with DBD plasma actuators is shown in the figure.&lt;ref name="huang_JA"&gt;Wei, Q. K., Niu, Z. G., Chen, B. and Huang, X.*, "Bang-Bang Control Applied in Airfoil Roll Control with Plasma Actuators", ''AIAA Journal of Aircraft'', 2012, accepted (arXiv:1204.2491)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rudless.tiff|thumb|DBD Plasma actuators deployed on a NACA 0015 airfoil to do rudderless flight control]]
It can be seen that plasma actuators deployed on the both sides of an airfoil. The roll control can be controlled by activating plasma actuators according to the roll angle feedback.
After studying various feedback control methodologies, the [[bang–bang control]] method was chosen to design the roll control system based on plasma actuators. The reason is that bang-bang control is time optimal and insensitive to plasma actuations, which quickly vary in difference atmospheric and electric conditions.

==Modeling==
Various numerical models have been proposed to simulate plasma actuations in flow control. They are listed below according to the computational cost, from the most expensive to the cheapest.

The most important potential of plasma actuators is its ability to bridge fluids and electricity. A modern closed-loop control system and the following information theoretical methods can be applied to the relatively classical aerodynamic sciences. A control-oriented model for plasma actuation in flow control has been proposed for a cavity flow control case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = Xun | last2 = Chan | first2 = Sammie | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Xin | last4 = Gabriel | first4 = Steve | year = 2008 | title = Variable structure model for flow-induced tonal noise control with plasma actuators | url = | journal = AIAA Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 241–250 | doi=10.2514/1.30852| bibcode = 2008AIAAJ..46..241H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2755">'''Plasma contactors''' are devices used on [[spacecraft]] in order to prevent accumulation of [[electrostatic]] [[electric charge|charge]] through the expulsion of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] (often [[Xenon]]).

An electrical [[contactor]] is an electrically controlled switch which closes a power or high voltage [[electrical circuit]].  A plasma contactor changes the electrically insulating vacuum into a conductor by providing movable electrons and [[Positive ions|positive gas ions]].  This conductive path closes a [[phantom loop]] circuit to discharge or neutralize the [[static electricity]] that can build up on a spacecraft.

Space contains regions with varying concentrations of charged particles such as the [[plasma sheet]], and a static charge builds up as the spacecraft moves between these regions, or as the electrical potential varies within such a region.

Static electricity may also build up on a spacecraft as a result of space [[radiation]], including sunlight, depending on the materials used on the surfaces of the spacecraft.

A plasma contactor is mounted on the Z1 segment of the [[International Space Station]] [[Integrated Truss Structure]].

[[File:White, Brown, Red &amp; Wild rice.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A mixture of brown, white, and red indica rice, also containing [[wild rice]], ''Zizania'' species]]
'''Rice''' is the [[seed]] of the [[Poaceae|grass]] species ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' (Asian rice) or ''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'' (African rice). As a [[cereal|cereal grain]], it is the most widely consumed [[staple food]] for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5 million [[tonne]]s in 2014), after [[sugarcane]] (1.9 billion tonnes) and [[maize]] (1.0 billion tonnes).&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

[[File:Oryza sativa of Kadavoor.jpg|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'' with small [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] flowers]]
Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the [[Food energy|calories]] consumed worldwide by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bruce D. (1998) ''The Emergence of Agriculture''. Scientific American Library, A Division of HPHLP, New York, {{ISBN|0-7167-6030-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.

[[File:Brown rice cooked.JPG|thumb|Cooked brown rice from Bhutan]]
[[File:Rice grains (IRRI).jpg|thumb|Rice can come in many shapes, colors and sizes.]]
Rice, a [[Monocotyledon|monocot]], is normally grown as an [[annual plant]], although in tropical areas it can survive as a [[perennial]] and can produce a [[ratoon]] crop for up to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/riceIPM/IPM_Information/PestEcologyBasics/CropGrowthAndPestDamage/RicePlantHowItGrows/The_Rice_plant_and_How_it_Grows.htm |title=The Rice Plant and How it Grows |website=International Rice Research Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106224427/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/riceIPM/IPM_Information/PestEcologyBasics/CropGrowthAndPestDamage/RicePlantHowItGrows/The_Rice_plant_and_How_it_Grows.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.

[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]
The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.

The name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.

==Etymology==
First used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word "rice" derives from the [[Old French]] ''ris'', which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''riso'', in turn from the [[Latin]] ''oriza'', which derives from the Greek ὄρυζα (''oruza''). The [[Greek language|Greek]] word is the source of all European words (cf. Welsh ''reis'', German ''Reis'', Lithuanian ''ryžiai'', Serbo-Croatian ''riža'', Polish ''ryż'', Dutch ''rijst'', Hungarian ''rizs'', Romanian ''orez'', Spanish ''arroz'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=rice rice], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=rice | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] | accessdate=March 13, 2014 | edition=English, online | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rice }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fruza ὄρυζα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Greek word is unclear. It is sometimes held to be from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word (''arisi''), or rather Old Tamil ''arici''.&lt;ref name=witzel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzel |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Witzel |title=Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan |journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies |year=1999 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=26 |url=http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206073939/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorley|first=John|title=The development of trade between the [[Roman Empire]] and the East under Augustus|doi=10.1017/S001738350001706X|jstor=642851|journal=Greece &amp; Rome|year=1969|volume=16|issue=2|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Witzel, Michael |year=2009|volume= 34|issue= 6|pages= 829–833|doi=10.1007/s12038-009-0096-1|pmid=20093735|journal=Journal of Biosciences |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2009/Witzel_fulltext |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403220809/http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2009/Witzel_fulltext |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-03 |title=The linguistic history of some Indian domestic plants}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagrees with the notion that Old Tamil ''arici'' is the source of the Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian]] *''wariñci'' instead. Mayrhofer&lt;ref name=EWA&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayrhofer|first=Manfred|title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen|volume=2|year=1996|publisher=Universitätsverlag Winter|location=Heidelberg|isbn=3-8253-4550-5|page=598|authorlink=Manfred Mayrhofer|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types *''vrīz-'' or *''vrinj-'' (Source of the modern Persian word ''Berenj''), but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in [[Sanskrit]] ''vrīhí-''). [[P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar]] assumed that the Sanskrit ''vrīhí-'' is derived from the Tamil ''arici'', while [[Ferdinand Kittel]] derived it from the Dravidian root ''variki''. However, R. Swaminatha Aiyar believes that the Sanskrit ''vrīhí-'' is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] root, and the Old Tamil ''arici'' is also of Indo-European origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Swaminatha Aiyar |title=Dravidian Theories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-dIbnuJCjUC&amp;pg=PA108 |year=1987 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0331-2 |pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The rice plant can grow to {{convert|1|–|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. It has long, slender leaves {{convert|50|–|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|–|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad. The small [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous [[inflorescence]] {{convert|30|–|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The edible seed is a grain ([[caryopsis]]) {{convert|5|–|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|–|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.

==Cooking==
[[File:Tteumul.jpg|thumb|[[bap (food)|tteumul]], water from the washing of rice]]
The varieties of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/articles/guide-to-rice.aspx|accessdate=July 24, 2014|title=Guide to Rice|editor=Fine Cooking|publisher=Fine Cooking}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grains of long-grain rice (high in [[amylose]]) tend to remain intact after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in [[amylopectin]]) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arròs negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice – Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].

[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.

===Preparation===
[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]
[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]&lt;br&gt;B: [[Brown rice]]&lt;br&gt;C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]&lt;br&gt;D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]&lt;br&gt;E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:無洗米|無洗米]]), "Polished and ready to boil rice", literally, non-wash rice&lt;br&gt;(1): [[Chaff]]&lt;br&gt;(2): [[Bran]]&lt;br&gt;(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]&lt;br&gt;(4): [[Cereal germ]]&lt;br&gt;(5): [[Endosperm]]]]

Rice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.

Rice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.

Brown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread| url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html | accessdate=February 12, 2004|author1=Shoichi Ito  |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. }}&lt;/ref&gt; activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].

Rice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water similar to the volume of rice. With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]]  and [[Afghanistan]]  or [[biryani]] in [[India]]  and [[Pakistan]] .

===Dishes===
{{main|List of rice dishes}}
In [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Medieval Islamic texts spoke of medical uses for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Watson|Watson]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Rice may also be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.

==Food==
===Nutrition===
Rice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 [[calories]] and contains no [[micronutrient]]s in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table). Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of [[B vitamins]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]] (10–17% DV) per 100 gram amount (table).

A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors. It depends on the strain of rice, such as [[white rice|white]], [[brown rice|brown]], [[red rice|red]], and [[black rice|black]] (or purple) varieties having different prevalence across world regions.&lt;ref name="who2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guideline: Fortification of rice with vitamins and minerals as a public health strategy |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272535/9789241550291-eng.pdf?ua=1 |publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241550291 |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rice in human nutrition|year=1993|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|author=Juliano, Bienvenido O. |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0567E/T0567E00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) guideline showed that [[food fortification|fortification]] of rice to reduce [[malnutrition]] may involve different micronutrient strategies, including [[iron]] only, iron with [[zinc]], [[vitamin A]], and [[folic acid]], or iron with other [[B vitamins|B-complex vitamins]], such as [[thiamin]], [[niacin]], [[vitamin B6]], and [[pantothenic acid]].&lt;ref name=who2018/&gt; A [[systematic review]] of [[clinical research]] on the efficacy of rice fortification showed the strategy had the main effect of reducing the risk of [[iron deficiency]] by 35% and increasing blood levels of [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref name=who2018/&gt; The guideline established a major recommendation: "Fortification of rice with iron is recommended as a public health strategy to improve the iron status of populations, in settings where rice is a staple food."&lt;ref name=who2018/&gt;

Rice grown experimentally under elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels, similar to those predicted for the year 2100 [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|as a result of human activity]], had less iron, zinc, and protein, as well as lower levels of thiamin, [[riboflavin]], folic acid, and pantothenic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wishart|first=Skye|date=July–August 2018|title=Second-rate grains|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/second-rate-grains/|journal=New Zealand Geographic|volume=|issue=152|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As arsenic is a natural element in soil, water, and air, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) monitors the levels of arsenic in foods, particularly in rice products used commonly for infant food.&lt;ref name="fda-ars"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/metals/ucm319870.htm|title=Arsenic in Rice and Rice Products|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=April 24, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While growing, rice plants tend to absorb arsenic more readily than other food crops, requiring expanded testing by the FDA for possible arsenic-related risks associated with rice consumption in the United States.&lt;ref name=fda-ars/&gt; In April 2016, the FDA proposed a limit of 100 parts per billion (ppb) for inorganic arsenic in infant [[rice cereal]] and other foods to minimize exposure of infants to arsenic.&lt;ref name=fda-ars/&gt; For water contamination by arsenic, the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a lower standard of 10 ppb.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/chemical-contaminant-rules|title=Chemical Contaminant Rules|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=April 24, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Is Australia the home of rice?

From East Asia (particularly from China), rice was spread to Southeast and South Asia across the caravan routes of the central Asian steppes.&lt;ref name="nature1"/&gt; Because Buddhist monks were vegetarian, they carried rice with them across the steppes. Thus, a Buddhist text called the Aggañña Sutta stated that "rice grows as long as Buddhism spreads."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Terms for the Study of Buddhism|last=Lopez Jr.|first=Donald S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice was introduced to Europe through Western Asia, and to the Americas through European colonization.

There have been many debates on the origins of the domesticated rice. Genetic evidence published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (PNAS) shows that all forms of Asian rice, both ''indica'' and ''japonica'', spring from a single domestication that occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago in China of the wild rice ''[[Oryza rufipogon]]''.&lt;ref name="pnas1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molina | first1 = J. | last2 = Sikora | first2 = M. | last3 = Garud | first3 = N. | last4 = Flowers | first4 = J.

Morphological studies of rice [[phytolith]]s from the Diaotonghuan archaeological site clearly show the transition from the collection of wild rice to the cultivation of domesticated rice. The large number of wild rice phytoliths at the Diaotonghuan level dating from 12,000–11,000 [[Before Present|BP]] indicates that wild rice collection was part of the local means of subsistence. Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000–8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard MacNeish|MacNeish R. S.]] and Libby J. eds.

==Regional history==

=== Africa ===
{{Main|Oryza glaberrima}}
[[File:Ambositra 04.jpg|thumb|right|Rice crop in Madagascar]]
African rice has been cultivated for 3500 years. Between 1500 and 800 BC, ''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'' propagated from its original centre, the [[Niger River]] [[river delta|delta]], and extended to Senegal. However, it never developed far from its original region. Its cultivation even declined in favour of the Asian species, which was introduced to East Africa early in the common era and spread westward.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, Gregory [ed.] (2006).

Today, the majority of all rice produced comes from China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, Philippines, Korea and Japan. [[Asian people|Asian]] farmers still account for 87% of the world's total rice production.

====Nepal====
Rice is the major food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Nepal]]. In the [[Terai]], most rice varieties are cultivated during the [[Monsoon of South Asia|rainy season]]. The principal rice growing season, known as "Berna-Bue Charne", is from June to July when water is sufficient for only a part of the fields; the subsidiary season, known as "Ropai, is from April to September, when there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields. Farmers use irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The [[Banaue]] Rice Terraces ({{lang-fil|Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe}}) are 2,000-year-old [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] that were carved into the mountains of [[Ifugao]] in the [[Philippines]] by ancestors of the [[Igorot|indigenous people]].

The terraces are located approximately 1500 meters (5000&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient [[irrigation]] system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.&lt;ref name="tourism.gov.ph"&gt;[http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 Department of Tourism: Ifugao Province] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302155750/http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=famousefor&amp;province=74 |date=March 2, 2009 }}. Accessed September 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The terraces are found in the province of Ifugao and the Ifugao people have been its caretakers. Ifugao culture revolves&lt;ref name = "“Vietnam &amp; the Philippines. Wonders of the Asian World "&gt;'' World Heritage Sites and Schlessinger Media and {{ISBN|9781417103423}}''&lt;/ref&gt; around rice and the culture displays an elaborate array of celebrations linked with agricultural rites from rice cultivation to rice consumption. The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called ''tango'' or ''tungul'' (a [[day of rest]]) entails a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practise during the festivities.

The Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also&lt;ref name="tourism.gov.ph"/&gt; been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao’s rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members.

====Sri Lanka====
Rice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as "Maha", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as "Yala", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent.

Traditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.

====Thailand====
{{main|Rice production in Thailand}}
Rice is the main export of Thailand, especially white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).&lt;ref&gt;The genetic wonder of Thai rice, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and five kinds of wild rice cultivates.&lt;ref&gt;Science and technology with Thai rice, National center for genetic engineering, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In each region of the country there are different rice seed types. Their use depends on weather, atmosphere, and topography.&lt;ref name="The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998"&gt;The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern region has both low lands and high lands. The farmers' usual crop is non-glutinous rice&lt;ref name="The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998"/&gt; such as Niew Sun Pah Tong rice. This rice is naturally protected from leaf disease, and its paddy (unmilled rice) ({{lang-th|ข้าวเปลือก}}) has a brown color.&lt;ref&gt;Punkhao (Niew San Pah Tong), www.brrd.in.th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The northeastern region is a large area where farmers can cultivate about 36 million square meters of rice. Although most of it is plains and dry areas,&lt;ref name="The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998"&gt;The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; white jasmine rice 105—the most famous Thai rice—can be grown there. White jasmine rice was developed in [[Chonburi Province]] first and after that grown in many areas in the country, but the rice from this region has a high quality, because it's softer, whiter, and more fragrant.&lt;ref&gt;The genetic wonder of Thai rice, p. 110,1998&lt;/ref&gt; This rice can resist drought, acidic soil, and alkaline soil.&lt;ref&gt;Punkhao (Khao Dawk Mali 105), www.brrd.in.th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The central region is mostly composed of plains. Most farmers grow Jao rice.&lt;ref name="The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998"/&gt; For example, Pathum Thani 1 rice which has qualities similar to white jasmine 105 rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch and the cooked rice has fragrant grains also.&lt;ref&gt;Punkhao (Pathum Thani 1), www.brrd.in.th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern region, most farmers transplant around boundaries to the flood plains or on the plains between mountains. Farming in the region is slower than other regions because the rainy season comes later.&lt;ref&gt;The ecology of life, p.45, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The popular rice varieties in this area are the Leb Nok Pattani seeds, a type of Jao rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch and it can be processed to make noodles.&lt;ref&gt;Punkhao ( Leb Nok Pattani), www.brrd.in.th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Companion plant====
One of the earliest known examples of [[companion plant]]ing is the growing of rice with [[Azolla]], the mosquito fern, which covers the top of a fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.

Rice was known to the Classical world, being imported from Egypt, and perhaps west Asia. It was known to Greece (where it is still cultivated in Macedonia and Thrace) by returning soldiers from Alexander the Great's military expedition to Asia. Large deposits of rice from the first century AD have been found in Roman camps in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Sallare, Robert (1993), ''The Ecology of the Ancient Greek World'', Cornell Univ. Press, p. 23, {{ISBN|0801426154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Al-Andalus|Moors]] brought Asiatic rice to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 10th century. Records indicate it was grown in [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and [[Majorca]]. In Majorca, rice cultivation seems to have stopped after the Christian [[Reconquesta|conquest]], although historians are not certain.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

Muslims also brought rice to [[Sicily]] with cultivation starting in the 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9781578086801|author=S. D. Sharma |chapter=11 History Of Rice in Europe|title=Rice: Origin, Antiquity and History|year=1957|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was an important crop&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt; long before it is noted in the plain of [[Pisa]] (1468) or in the Lombard plain (1475), where its cultivation was promoted by [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, and demonstrated in his model farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521045414.005|author=Darby, H.C. |chapter=The face of Europe on the eve of the great discoveries|title=The New Cambridge Modern History|volume=1|year=1957|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later propagating to all the continents during the age of European exploration.

In European Russia, a short-grain, starchy rice similar to the Italian varieties, has been grown in the [[Krasnodar Krai]], and known in Russia as "Kuban Rice" or "Krasnodar Rice". In the [[Russian Far East]] several ''japonica'' cultivars are grown in [[Primorye]] around the [[Khanka lake]]. Increasing scale of rice production in the region has recently brought criticism towards growers' alleged bad practices in regards to the environment.

===Caribbean and Latin America===

Most of the rice used today in the cuisine of the Americas is not native, but was introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]] at an early date. However, there are at least two native (endemic) species of rice present in the Amazon region of South America, and one or both were used by the indigenous inhabitants of the region to create the domesticated form [[Oryza sp.]], some 4000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0322-4 "Evidence for mid-Holocene rice domestication in the Americas", Hilbert et al, ''Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution'' (2017), doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0322-4, Published online: 9 October 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1694, rice arrived in [[South Carolina]], probably originating from Madagascar.&lt;ref name="slaveryinamerica.org"/&gt; Tradition (possibly apocryphal) has it that pirate [[John Thurber]] was returning from a slave-trading voyage to Madagascar when he was blown off course and put into [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] for repairs.

In the United States, [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] South Carolina and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] grew and amassed great wealth from the slave labor obtained from the [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].

From the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.

Rice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as 'Carolina Gold'. The [[cultivar]] has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolinagoldricefoundation.org/ Carolina Gold Rice Foundation].

=== Australia ===
Rice was one of the earliest crops planted in Australia by British [[settlers]], who had experience with rice plantations in the Americas and India.

Although attempts to grow rice in the well-watered north of Australia have been made for many years, they have consistently failed because of inherent iron and [[manganese]] toxicities in the soils and destruction by [[Pest (organism)|pests]].

In the 1920s, it was seen as a possible [[irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] crop on soils within the [[Murray-Darling Basin]] that were too heavy for the cultivation of fruit and too infertile for wheat.&lt;ref name="Wadham, Sir Samuel p. 246"&gt;Wadham, Sir Samuel; Wilson, R. Kent and Wood, Joyce; ''Land Utilization in Australia'', Melbourne University Press (1957) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Because irrigation water, despite the extremely low runoff of temperate Australia,&lt;ref&gt;See McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'' {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was (and remains) very cheap, the growing of rice was taken up by agricultural groups over the following decades. Californian varieties of rice were found suitable for the climate in the [[Riverina]],&lt;ref name="Wadham, Sir Samuel p. 246"/&gt; and the first mill opened at [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] in 1951.

[[File:ABS-5439.0-InternationalMerchandiseImportsAustralia-StandardInternationalTradeClassificationCustomsValue-042Rice-A1828736L.svg|thumb|right|Monthly value ([[Australian dollar|A$ millions]]) of rice imports to Australia since 1988]]
Even before this Australia's rice production greatly exceeded local needs,&lt;ref name="Wadham, Sir Samuel p. 246" /&gt; and rice exports to Japan have become a major source of foreign currency. Above-average rainfall from the 1950s to the middle 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Meteorology; ''Climatic Atlas of Australia: Rainfall'', Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Victoria (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged the expansion of the Riverina rice industry, but its prodigious water use in a practically waterless region began to attract the attention of environmental scientists. These became severely concerned with declining flow in the [[Snowy River]] and the lower [[Murray River]].

Although rice growing in Australia is highly profitable due to the cheapness of land, several recent years of severe drought have led many to call for its elimination because of its effects on extremely fragile aquatic ecosystems. The Australian rice industry is somewhat opportunistic, with the area planted varying significantly from season to season depending on water allocations in the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] irrigation regions.

[[Australian Aboriginal]] people have harvested native rice varieties for thousands of years, and there are ongoing efforts to grow commercial quantities of these species.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2014-05-15/native-australian-wild-rice-indigenous/5455764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://alpinerice.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===

[[File:NP India burning 48 (6315309342).jpg|thumb|Burning of rice residues after harvest, to quickly prepare the land for [[wheat]] planting, around [[Sangrur]], [[Punjab, India]].]]

In 2016, world production of paddy rice was 741 million [[tonne]]s, led by China and India with a combined 50% of this total (table).&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt; Other major producers were [[Indonesia]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Vietnam]] (table).

Rice is a major food staple and a mainstay for the rural population and their food security. It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than 1 hectare. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population. Developing countries account for 95% of the total production, with China and India alone responsible for nearly half of the world output.&lt;ref name=FAORice1/&gt;

Many rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank – FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure. Some sources claim the post-harvest losses to exceed 40%.&lt;ref name=FAORice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable rice production for food security|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=2003|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y4751E/y4751e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MISSING FOOD: The Case of Postharvest Grain Losses in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=The World Bank|date=April 2011|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/MissingFoods10_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do these losses reduce food security in the world, the study claims that farmers in developing countries such as China, India and others lose approximately US$89 billion of income in preventable post-harvest farm losses, poor transport, the lack of proper storage and retail. One study claims that if these post-harvest grain losses could be eliminated with better infrastructure and retail network, in India alone enough food would be saved every year to feed 70 to 100 million people over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basavaraja |first1=H. |last2=Mahajanashetti |first2=S.B. |last3=Udagatti |first3=Naveen C |date=2007 |title=Economic Analysis of Post-harvest Losses in Food Grains in India: A Case Study of Karnataka |journal=Agricultural Economics Research Review |volume=20 |pages=117–126|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/47429/2/8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div id="white_rice"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Processing===

The seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a [[rice huller]] to remove the [[chaff]] (the outer husks of the grain). At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].

Either by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.

In some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.

[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.

Raw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]].&lt;ref name=PenaginiDilillo2013&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Penagini F, Dilillo D, Meneghin F, Mameli C, Fabiano V, Zuccotti GV|title=Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4553–65|date=Nov 18, 2013|pmid=24253052|pmc=3847748|doi=10.3390/nu5114553|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days – gaba rice).

Processed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.

Rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.&lt;ref name="Protein content"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G. Wu, Chunhai Shia and Xiaoming Zhanga | year=2003|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=75|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice, like other cereal [[caryopsis|grains]], can be [[Puffed rice|puffed (or popped)]]. This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm³. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.

{{Further|Paddy field}}
&lt;!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section --&gt;
Unmilled rice, known as "paddy" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.

A familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.

===Distribution===
Because of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008) ''From Parastatals to Private Trade''.

===Trade===
World trade figures are very different from those for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally.&lt;ref name=cendrowski2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cendrowski |first1=Scott |date=August 12, 2013 |title=The Rice Rush |journal=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |pages=9–10 |type=paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; In economic terms, the global rice trade was a small fraction of 1% of world mercantile trade. Many countries consider rice as a strategic food staple, and various governments subject its trade to a wide range of controls and interventions.

Developing countries are the main players in the world rice trade, accounting for 83% of exports and 85% of imports. While there are numerous importers of rice, the exporters of rice are limited. Just five countries – Thailand, Vietnam, China, the United States and India – in decreasing order of exported quantities, accounted for about three-quarters of world rice exports in 2002.&lt;ref name=FAORice1/&gt; However, this ranking has been rapidly changing in recent years. In 2010, the three largest exporters of rice, in decreasing order of quantity exported were Thailand, Vietnam and India. By 2012, India became the largest exporter of rice with a 100% increase in its exports on year-to-year basis, and Thailand slipped to third position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/10/30/india-and-the-price-of-rice/#axzz2d3SGzLpN India and the Price of Rice] The Financial Times (London), October 30, 2012{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/928481/rcs-12j.pdf Rice Outlook 2012/2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620115109/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/928481/rcs-12j.pdf |date=June 20, 2013 }} Nathan Childs, US Dept of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Thailand, Vietnam and India accounted for nearly 70% of the world rice exports.

The primary variety exported by Thailand and Vietnam were [[Jasmine rice]], while exports from India included aromatic [[Basmati]] variety. China, an exporter of rice in early 2000s, was a net importer of rice in 2010 and will become the largest net importer, surpassing Nigeria, in 2013.&lt;ref name=cendrowski2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Rice Trade |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |url=http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/psdreport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=BVS&amp;hidReportRetrievalID=677&amp;hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] report, the world's largest exporters of rice in 2012 were India (9.75 million tonnes), Vietnam (7 million tonnes), Thailand (6.5 million tonnes), Pakistan (3.75 million tonnes) and the United States (3.5 million tonnes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/india-is-worlds-largest-rice-exporter-usda/1023491/0 India is world's largest rice exporter: USDA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514233220/http://www.financialexpress.com/news/india-is-worlds-largest-rice-exporter-usda/1023491/0 |date=May 14, 2013 }}. The Financial Express (October 29, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Major importers usually include Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brazil and some African and [[Persian Gulf]] countries. In common with other West African countries, Nigeria is actively promoting domestic production. However, its very heavy import duties (110%) open it to smuggling from neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Agritrade''[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Rice/Stakeholders-call-for-intensified-consultations-on-Nigerian-rice-sector-trade Shareholders call for intensified consultation on Nigerian rice sector trade]&lt;/ref&gt; Parboiled rice is particularly popular in Nigeria. Although China and India are the two largest producers of rice in the world, both countries consume the majority of the rice produced domestically, leaving little to be traded internationally.

===World's most productive rice farms and farmers===
The average world yield for rice was 4.3 tonnes per hectare, in 2010.

Australian rice farms were the most productive in 2010, with a nationwide average of 10.8 tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAOSTAT: Production-Crops, 2010 data |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=2011 |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906230329/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Longping of China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center, China, set a world record for rice yield in 2010 at 19 tonnes per hectare on a demonstration plot. In 2011, this record was surpassed by an Indian farmer, Sumant Kumar, with 22.4 tonnes per hectare in Bihar. Both these farmers claim to have employed newly developed rice breeds and [[System of Rice Intensification]] (SRI), a recent innovation in rice farming. SRI is claimed to have set new national records in rice yields, within the last 10 years, in many countries. The claimed Chinese and Indian yields have yet to be demonstrated on seven-hectare lots and to be reproducible over two consecutive years on the same farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Scientist’s Perspective on Experience with SRI in CHINA for Raising the Yields of Super Hybrid Rice |year=2010 |author=Yuan, L.P. |url=http://ciifad.cornell.edu/sri/proc1/sri_06.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120010557/http://ciifad.cornell.edu/sri/proc1/sri_06.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian farmer sets new world record in rice yield|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=December 18, 2011|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/759471/fccp-holds-talks-cultural-concerns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots heroes lead Bihar's rural revolution|publisher=India Today|date=January 10, 2012 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/grassroots-heroes-lead-rural-revolution-of-bihar/1/168028.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103002917/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/grassroots-heroes-lead-rural-revolution-of-bihar/1/168028.html|archivedate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System of Rice Intensification|publisher=Cornell University|year=2011|url=http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price ==
In late 2007 to May 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries (particularly Australia), increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production. Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices. In late April 2008, prices hit 24 [[US cent]]s a [[pound (mass)|pound]], twice the price of seven months earlier.&lt;ref name=cyclone&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7387251.stm "Cyclone fuels rice price increase"], ''BBC News'', May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period of 2007 to 2013, the Chinese government has substantially increased the price it pays domestic farmers for their rice, rising to {{currency|500}} per metric ton by 2013.&lt;ref name=cendrowski2013/&gt; The 2013 price of rice originating from other southeast Asian countries was a comparably low {{currency|350}} per metric ton.&lt;ref name=cendrowski2013/&gt;

On April 30, 2008, Thailand announced plans for the creation of the [[Organisation of Rice Exporting Countries]] (OREC) with the intention that this should develop into a price-fixing [[cartel]] for rice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2008-04-30/mekong-nations-to-form-rice-pricefixing-cartel/38466 "Mekong nations to form rice price-fixing cartel"], Radio Australia, April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/archive-laonews/conversations/topics/14473 "PM floats idea of five-nation rice cartel"], ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, little progress had been made by mid-2011 to achieve this.

As of 2009 world food consumption of rice was 531.6 million metric tons of paddy equivalent (354,603 of milled equivalent), while the far largest consumers were China consuming 156.3 million metric tons of paddy equivalent (29.4% of the world consumption) and India consuming 123.5 million metric tons of paddy equivalent (23.3% of the world consumption).&lt;ref name=con/&gt; Between 1961 and 2002, per capita consumption &lt;!-- where? --&gt;of rice increased by 40%.

Rice is the most important crop in Asia.

A 2010 study found that, as a result of rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century, the rice yield growth rate has decreased in many parts of Asia, compared to what would have been observed had the temperature and solar radiation trends not occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001222107 |author1=Welch, Jarrod R. |author2=Vincent, J.R. |author3=Auffhammer, M. |author4=Dobermann, A. |author5=Moya, P. |author6=Dawe, D. |title=Rice yields in tropical/subtropical Asia exhibit large but opposing sensitivities to minimum and maximum temperatures |journal=Proc.

The study was based on records from 227 farms in Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, India, China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The mechanism of this falling yield was not clear, but might involve increased respiration during warm nights, which expends energy without being able to photosynthesize.

===Rainfall===

===Temperature===
Rice requires high temperature above {{convert|20|C}} but not more than {{convert|35|to|40|C}}. Optimum temperature is around 30&amp;nbsp;°C (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and 20&amp;nbsp;°C (T&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rao|first1=G.S.L.H.V.

===Solar radiation===
The amount of solar radiation received during the 45 days leading up to harvest determines final crop output.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

===Atmospheric water vapor===
High water vapor content (in humid tropics) subjects unusual stress which favors the spread of fungal and bacterial diseases.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

===Wind===
Light wind transports CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the leaf canopy but strong wind causes severe damage and may lead to sterility (due to pollen dehydration, spikelet sterility, and abortive endosperms).&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

=== Nematodes ===
Several [[nematode]] species infect rice crops, causing diseases such as Ufra (Ditylenchus dipsaci), White tip disease (Aphelenchoide bessei), and root knot disease (Meloidogyne graminicola). Some nematode species such as ''Pratylenchus'' spp. are most dangerous in upland rice of all parts of the world. Rice root nematode (''[[Hirschmanniella oryzae]]'') is a migratory endoparasite which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the vigor of plants and increase the plants' susceptibility to other pests and diseases.

Rice plants produce their own chemical defenses to protect themselves from pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant’s resistance to some types of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04057.x|title=The broad-leaf herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid turns rice into a living trap for a major insect pest and a parasitic wasp|year=2012|last1=Xin|first1=Zhaojun|last2=Yu|first2=Zhaonan|last3=Erb|first3=Matthias|last4=Turlings|first4=Ted C.

Botanicals, so-called "natural pesticides", are used by some farmers in an attempt to control rice pests. Botanicals include extracts of leaves, or a mulch of the leaves themselves. Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'') over the surface of fields after planting. This practice probably helps the soil retain moisture and thereby facilitates seed germination. Farmers also claim the leaves are a natural fertilizer and helps suppress weed and insect infestations.&lt;ref&gt;Jahn, GC, C Pol, B Khiev, S Pheng, and N Chhorn. (1999).

Among rice cultivars, there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15666746|year=2004|last1=Jahn|first1=GC|last2=Domingo|first2=I|last3=Almazan|first3=ML|last4=Pacia|first4=J|title=Effect of rice bug Leptocorisa oratorius (Hemiptera: Alydidae) on rice yield, grain quality, and seed viability|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1923–7|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|doi=10.1603/0022-0493-97.6.1923|last5=Pacia|first5=Jocelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khiev, B. |author2=Jahn, G.C. |author3=Pol, C. |author4=Chhorn N. |title=Effects of simulated pest damage on rice yields |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/effects-of-simulated-pest-damage-on-rice-yields/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203044018/http://www.mendeley.com/research/effects-of-simulated-pest-damage-on-rice-yields/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 3, 2012 |journal=IRRN |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=27–8 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests.&lt;ref&gt;Brar, D.S.; Khush, G.S.

The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt; Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kogan, M. |author2=Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's "non-preference" modality of resistance |journal=Bull. Entomol. Soc. Am. |volume=24 |pages=175–6 |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the use of pest-resistant rice varieties selects for pests that are able to overcome these mechanisms of resistance. When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. Rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance. Mutants of popular rice varieties are regularly screened by plant breeders to discover new sources of durable resistance.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18459427|doi=10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[575:CAIORT]2.0.CO;2|year= 2008|volume= 101|pages= 575–83|title= Categories and Inheritance of Resistance toNilaparvata lugens(Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in Mutants of Indica Rice 'IR64'|last1= Sangha|first1= Jatinder Singh|last2= Chen|first2= Yolanda H.|last3= Palchamy|first3= Kadirvel|last4= Jahn|first4= Gary C.|last5= Maheswaran|first5= M.|last6= Adalla|first6= Candida B.|last7= Leung|first7= Hei|journal= Journal of Economic Entomology|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu, L., Z.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic weeds===
Rice is parasitized by the weed [[eudicot]] ''[[Striga hermonthica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Yoshida, Satoko; Maruyama, Shinichiro; Nozaki, Hisayoshi | author4=Shirasu, Ken | year= 2010 | journal=Science| volume=328 | page=1128 | doi=10.1126/science.1187145 | issue=5982| pmid=20508124| title=Horizontal Gene Transfer by the Parasitic Plant ''Stiga hermanthica''| bibcode=2010Sci...328.1128Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is of local importance for this crop.

==Ecotypes and cultivars==
{{Main|List of rice varieties}}
[[File:Rice diversity.jpg|thumb|right|Rice seed collection from [[IRRI]]]]

While most rice is bred for crop quality and productivity, there are varieties selected for characteristics such as texture, smell, and firmness. There are four major categories of rice worldwide: [[Indica rice|indica]], [[japonica rice|japonica]], [[Aromatic rice|aromatic]] and [[glutinous rice|glutinous]]. The different varieties of rice are not considered interchangeable, either in food preparation or agriculture, so as a result, each major variety is a completely separate market from other varieties. It is common for one variety of rice to rise in price while another one drops in price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf |title=The U.S. Rice Export Market |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] |date=November 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113063236/http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice cultivars also fall into groups according to environmental conditions, season of planting, and season of harvest, called ecotypes. Some major groups are the Japan-type (grown in Japan), "buly" and "tjereh" types (Indonesia); "aman" (main winter crop), "aus" ("aush", summer), and "boro" (spring) (Bengal and Assam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T.

The largest collection of rice cultivars is at the [[International Rice Research Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irri.org |title=Home |publisher=Irri.org |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Philippines, with over 100,000 rice accessions&lt;ref&gt;[http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=9960&amp;lang=en The International Rice Genebank – conserving rice].

Biol. |volume=35 |issue=1–2 |pages=61–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9291960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice [[cultivar]]s are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as "glutinous rice" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to "gluten") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.

Indian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (ਬਾਸਮਤੀ) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.

Aromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.

High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.

Draft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005|work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html?referrer=email }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice. The declaration was sponsored by more than 40 countries.

== Biotechnology ==

=== High-yielding varieties ===
The high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created intentionally during the [[Green Revolution]] to increase global food production. This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. The first "Rice Car", IR8 was produced in 1966 at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] which is based in the Philippines at the [[University of the Philippines]]' Los Baños site. IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named "Peta" and a Chinese variety named "Dee Geo Woo Gen."&lt;ref name="ir8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Rice Varieties |accessdate=July 13, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713032524/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2006 }}. IRRI Knowledge Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have identified and cloned many genes involved in the [[gibberellin]] signaling pathway, including GAI1 ([[Gibberellin]] Insensitive) and SLR1 (Slender Rice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092804 |author=Yamaguchi, S. |title=Gibberellin Metabolism and its Regulation |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=59 |pages=225–251 |year=2008|pmid=18173378 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disruption of [[gibberellin]] signaling can lead to significantly reduced stem growth leading to a dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.

=== Future potential ===
As the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the "Green Revolution" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of "[[New Rices for Africa]]" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology "from Africa, for Africa". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].

=== Golden rice ===
{{Main|Golden rice}}
Rice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]]. German and Swiss researchers have [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] rice to produce [[beta-carotene]], the precursor to vitamin A, in the rice kernel. The beta-carotene turns the processed (white) rice a "gold" color, hence the name "golden rice." The beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in humans who consume the rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/PDFs/ASNonGR.pdf |title=Researchers Determine That Golden Rice Is an Effective Source of Vitamin A |publisher=[[American Society for Nutrition]] |year=2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some rice strains produce beta-carotene in the hull, no non-genetically engineered strains have been found that produce beta-carotene in the kernel, despite the testing of thousands of strains. Additional efforts are being made to improve the quantity and quality of other nutrients in golden rice.&lt;ref name="gcgh"&gt;Grand Challenges in Global Health, [http://www.grandchallenges.org/ImproveNutrition/Challenges/NutrientRichPlants/Pages/Rice.aspx Engineering Rice for High Beta Carotene, Vitamin E and Enhanced Fe and Zn Bioavailability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618155046/https://www.grandchallenges.org/ImproveNutrition/Challenges/NutrientRichPlants/Pages/Rice.aspx |date=June 18, 2012 }}, grandchallenges.org.

=== Expression of human proteins ===
[[Ventria Bioscience]] has [[genetically modified]] rice to [[gene expression|express]] [[lactoferrin]], [[lysozyme]] which are [[proteins]] usually found in [[breast milk]], and [[human serum albumin]], These proteins have [[Antiviral protein|antiviral]], [[antibacterial]], and [[Antifungal protein|antifungal]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news070514-17 |journal=Nature |title=Rice with human proteins to take root in Kansas |author=Marris, Emma |date=May 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in [[oral rehydration solution]]s which are used to treat [[diarrhea]]l diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse [[anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:BIOM.0000027714.56331.b8 |author=Bethell DR, Huang J |title=Recombinant human lactoferrin treatment for global health issues: iron deficiency and acute diarrhea |journal=Biometals |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=337–42 |year=2004|pmid=15222487 |last2=Huang }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood-tolerant rice===
Due to the varying levels that water can reach in regions of cultivation, [[Deepwater rice|flood tolerant varieties]] have long been developed and used. [[Flooding]] is an issue that many rice growers face, especially in South and [[South East Asia]] where flooding annually affects 20 million hectares.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Debrata | first1 = P. | last2 = Sarkar | first2 = R.K. | year = 2012 | title = Role of Non-Structural Carbohydrate and its Catabolism Associated with Sub 1 QTL in Rice Subjected to Complete Submergence | url = | journal = Experimental Agriculture | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 502–512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding of more than about a week,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/swarna-sub1-flood-resistant-rice-variety/article2494126.ece  Swarna Sub1: flood resistant rice variety]" The Hindu (2011).

===Drought-tolerant rice===
[[Drought]] represents a significant environmental stress for rice production, with 19–23 million hectares of rainfed rice production in South and South East Asia often at risk.&lt;ref name="irri.org"&gt;"[http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=9952:drought-submergence-an Drought, submergence and salinity management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101131821/http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=9952%3Adrought-submergence-an |date=November 1, 2013 }}" International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).

===Salt-tolerant rice===

{{further|Crop tolerance to seawater}}

[[Soil salinity]] poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season.&lt;ref name="irri.org"/&gt; For example, roughly 1 million hectares of the coastal areas of [[Bangladesh]] are affected by saline soils.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=10379&amp;Itemid=100242&amp;lang=en Less salt, please] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101133710/http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=10379&amp;Itemid=100242&amp;lang=en |date=November 1, 2013 }}" Fredenburg, P.

(2012). Retrieved September 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress has been made, however, in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species ''Oryza coarctata'' is one example.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;"[https://www.integratedbreeding.net/news/breakthrough-salt-resistant-rice-research-single-baby-rice-plant-may-hold-future-extending-rice Breakthrough in salt-resistant rice research – single baby rice plant may hold the future to extending rice farming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102081913/https://www.integratedbreeding.net/news/breakthrough-salt-resistant-rice-research-single-baby-rice-plant-may-hold-future-extending-rice |date=November 2, 2013 }}" Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP) (2013). Retrieved October 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''O. coarctata'' is capable of successful growth in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but lacks the ability to produce edible rice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Developed by the [[International Rice Research Institute]], the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] variety can utilise specialised leaf glands that allow for the removal of salt into the atmosphere. It was initially produced from one successful [[embryo]] out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then [[Backcrossing|backcrossed]] to IR56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from ''O. coarctata''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Extensive trials are planned prior to the new variety being available to farmers by approximately 2017–18.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:rice egypt.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The irrigated rice (paddy) crop in Egypt has a salt tolerance of ECe=5.5 dS/m beyond which the yield declines.&lt;ref&gt;On line collection of salt tolerance data of agricultural crops obtained from measurements in farmers' fields [https://www.waterlog.info/croptol.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

When the problem of [[soil salinity]] arises it will be opportune to select salt tolerant varieties (IRRI &lt;ref&gt;[[International Rice Research Institute]], Rice Breeding Course, Breeding for salt tolerance in rice, on line: [http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/ricebreedingcourse/Breeding_for_salt_tolerance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; or to resort to [[soil salinity control]].

Soil salinity is often measured as the electric conductivity (EC) of the extract of a saturated soil paste (ECe). The EC units are usually expressed in millimho/cm or dS/m. The critical ECe value of 5.5 dS/m in the figure, obtained from measurements in farmers' fields, indicates that the rice crop is slightly salt sensitive.

===Environment-friendly rice===

Producing rice in [[Paddy field|paddies]] is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by [[Methanogen|methanogenic bacteria]]. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots. Researchers have recently reported in ''Nature'' that putting the [[barley]] gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schnürer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602–606|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meiosis and DNA repair==
Rice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants. Meiosis is a key stage of the sexual cycle in which diploid cells in the [[ovule]] (female structure) and the [[Stamen|anther]] (male structure) produce haploid cells that develop further into gametophytes and [[Gamete#Plants|gametes]]. So far, 28 meiotic genes of rice have been characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Q | last2 = Li | first2 = Y | last3 = Shen | first3 = Y | last4 = Cheng | first4 = Z | year = 2014 | title = Ten years of gene discovery for meiotic event control in rice | url = | journal = J Genet Genomics | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 125–37 | doi = 10.1016/j.jgg.2014.02.002 | pmid = 24656233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of rice gene OsRAD51C showed that this gene is necessary for [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombinational repair]] of DNA, particularly the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = D | last2 = Miao | first2 = C | last3 = Li | first3 = Y | last4 = Wang | first4 = H | last5 = Liu | first5 = X | last6 = Yu | first6 = H | last7 = Cheng | first7 = Z | year = 2014 | title = OsRAD51C is essential for double-strand break repair in rice meiosis | url = | journal = Front Plant Sci | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 167 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2014.00167 | pmid = 24847337 | pmc = 4019848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice gene OsDMC1 was found to be essential for pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deng | first1 = ZY | last2 = Wang | first2 = T | date = Sep 2007 | title = OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa | url = | journal = Plant Mol Biol. | volume = 65 | issue = 1–2| pages = 31–42 | doi = 10.1007/s11103-007-9195-2 | pmid = 17562186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rice gene OsMRE11 was found to be required for both synapsis of homologous chromosomes and repair of double-strand breaks during meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ji | first1 = J | last2 = Tang | first2 = D | last3 = Wang | first3 = M | last4 = Li | first4 = Y | last5 = Zhang | first5 = L | last6 = Wang | first6 = K | last7 = Li | first7 = M | last8 = Cheng | first8 = Z | date = Oct 2013 | title = MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis | url = | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 122 | issue = 5| pages = 363–76 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-013-0421-1 | pmid = 23793712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural roles of rice==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Beeld van Dewi Sri de rijstgodin TMnr 60016918.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient statue of [[Dewi Sri]] from Java (c. 9th century)]]
Rice plays an important role in certain religions and popular beliefs. In many cultures relatives will scatter rice during or towards the end of a [[wedding]] ceremony in front of the bride and groom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101127053611/http://ourweddingday.com/advice/Traditions/Origins-of-Wedding-Traditions/1058.aspx Origins of Wedding Traditions]. Ourweddingday.com (November 4, 2012). Retrieved on September 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pounded rice ritual]] is conducted during weddings in [[Nepal]]. The bride gives a leafplate full of pounded rice to the groom after he requests it politely from her.&lt;ref&gt;Laura M. Ahearn (2011), ''Living Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology,'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]] rice wine, popularly known as ''[[tapuy]]'', is used for important occasions such as weddings, rice harvesting ceremonies and other celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Tapuy Cookbook &amp; Cocktails,'' Philippine Rice Research Institute (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dewi Sri]] is the traditional rice goddess of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese people]] in [[Indonesia]]. Most rituals involving Dewi Sri are associated with the mythical origin attributed to the rice plant, the staple food of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunda.org/sundanese/myths.htm |title=Early Mythology – Dewi Sri |publisher=Sunda.org |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/mrtaufik/blog/2008/03/01/mitos-nyi-pohaci-sanghyang-asri-dewi-sri |title=(Indonesian) Mitos Nyi Pohaci/Sanghyang Asri/Dewi Sri |publisher=My.opera.com |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]] a similar rice deity is known as ''[[Phosop]]''; she is a deity more related to ancient local folklore than a goddess of a structured, mainstream religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6002651/On_the_Role_of_Food_Habits_in_the_Context_of_the_Identity_and_Cultural_Heritage_of_South_and_South_East_Asia|title=On the Role of Food Habits in the Context of the Identity and Cultural Heritage of South and South East Asia|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same female rice deity is known as ''Po Ino Nogar'' in [[Cambodia]] and as ''Nang Khosop'' in [[Laos]]. Ritual offerings are made during the different stages of rice production to propitiate the Rice Goddess in the corresponding cultures.

A [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] is held in certain Asian countries to mark the beginning of the rice planting season. It is still honored in the kingdoms of [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">A '''single-atom transistor''' is a device that can open and close an electrical circuit by the controlled and reversible repositioning of one single atom. The single-atom transistor was invented and first demonstrated in 2004 by Prof. Thomas Schimmel and his team of scientists at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (former University of Karlsruhe).&lt;ref&gt;F.-Q. Xie, L. Nittler, Ch. Obermair, Th. Schimmel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 128303 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; By means of a small electrical voltage applied to a control electrode, the so-called ''gate electrode'', a single silver atom is reversibly moved in and out of a tiny junction, in this way closing and opening an electrical contact.

Therefore, the single-atom transistor works as an atomic switch or atomic relay, where the switchable atom opens and closes the gap between two tiny electrodes called ''source'' and ''drain''.&lt;ref&gt;F.-Q. Xie, Ch. Obermair and Th. Schimmel, Solid State Communications 132, 437 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.-Q. Xie, R. Maul, A. Augenstein, Ch. Obermair, E.B. Starikov, G. Schön, Th. Schimmel, W. Wenzel, Nano Lett. 8 (12), 4493 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Obermair, F.-Q. Xie, Th. Schimmel, Europhysics News 41/4, 25-28 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The single-atom transistor opens perspectives for the development of future atomic-scale logics and quantum electronics.

At the same time, the device of the Karlsruhe team of researchers marks the lower limit of miniaturization, as feature sizes smaller than one atom cannot be produced lithographically. The device represents a quantum transistor, the conductance of the source-drain channel being defined by the rules of quantum mechanics. It can be operated at room temperature and at ambient conditions, i.e. neither cooling nor vacuum are required.&lt;ref&gt;F.-Q. Xie, R. Maul, Ch. Obermair, G. Schön, W. Wenzel, Th. Schimmel, Advanced Materials 22, 2033 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Few atom transistors have been developed at Waseda University and at Italian CNR by Takahiro Shinada and Enrico Prati, who observed the Anderson-Mott transition in miniature by employing arrays of only two, four and six individually implanted [[Arsenic|As]] or [[Phosphorus|P]] atoms.&lt;ref&gt;E. Prati, M. Hori, F. Guagliardo, G. Ferrari, T. Shinada, Anderson-Mott transition in arrays of a few dopant atoms in a silicon transistor, Nature Nanotechnology 7, pp. 443–447 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2381">In [[Sewage treatment|treatment of sewage]] one process used is the [[activated sludge]] process in which air is passed through a mixture of sewage and old sludge to allow the micro-organisms to break down the organic components of the sewage.  Sludge is continually drawn off as new sewage enters the tank and this sludge must then be settled so that the supernatant (the remaining liquid) can be separated to pass on to further stages of treatment.

'''Sludge bulking''' occurs when the sludge fails to separate out in the [[sedimentation tank]]s. The main cause of sludge bulking is the growth of filamentous [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of environmental engineering calculations|author=C. C. Lee and Shun Dar Lin|pages=1.550|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2007|isbn13=9780071475839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filamentous [[microorganism]]s grow in long strands that have much greater volume and surface area than conventional floc and are very slow to settle. Under certain growing conditions, filamentous organisms predominate. There is little robust scientific evidence that can be used to avoid sludge bulking but what there is indicates that over-loading works, having a carbohydrate rich input and having too low a recycle rate may all contribute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

To avoid sludge bulking some of the flow that enters the reactor can be bypassed, recycle ratio can be increased, lime or soda can be added to the reactor or the re-aeration rate increased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2083">'''Snapback''' is a mechanism in a [[bipolar transistor]] in which [[avalanche breakdown]] or [[impact ionization]] provides a sufficient base current to turn on the transistor. It is used intentionally in the design of certain [[Electrostatic Discharge|ESD]] protection devices integrated onto semiconductor chips. It can also be a parasitic failure mechanism when activated inadvertently, outwardly appearing much like [[latchup]] in that the chip seems to suddenly blow up when a high voltage is applied.

Snapback is initiated by a small current from collector to base. In the case of ESD protection devices, this current is caused by [[avalanche breakdown]] due to a sufficiently large voltage applied across the collector-base junction. In the case of parasitic failures, the initiating current may result from inadvertently turning on the bipolar transistor and a sufficiently large voltage across the collector and base causing [[impact ionization]], with some of the generated carriers then acting as the initiating current as they flow into the base. Once this initiating current flows into the base, the transistor turns on and the collector voltage decreases to the snapback holding voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertrand|first1=G|title=Analysis and Compact Modeling of a Vertical Grounded-Base n-p-n Bipolar Transistor Used as ESD Protection in a Smart Power Technology|journal=IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS|date=September 2001|volume=36|issue=9|page=1373}}&lt;/ref&gt; This voltage happens at the point where the processes of base current generation and the bipolar transistor turning on are in balance: the collector-emitter current of the bipolar transistor decreases the collector voltage, which results in a lower electric field, which results in a smaller impact ionization or avalanche current and thus smaller base current, which weakens the bipolar action.

The '''South Malawi montane forest-grassland mosaic''' is an [[ecoregion]] of [[Malawi]]. 

The ecoregion covers a region of highlands and plateaus that includes [[Mount Mulanje]] in the southeast and the lower [[Shire Highlands]] to the northeast and east, with the Tuchila Plain between them. The Shire Highlands includes the [[Zomba Plateau]] in the north and the [[Thyolo Mountains]] (1,462 m) to the south. 

The low valley of the [[Shire River]], part of the [[African Rift Valley]] system, bounds the Shire Highlands to the northwest, west, and southwest. The valley of the [[Ruo River]], a tributary of the Shire, bounds the ecoregion on the south and southeast. The Phalombe Plain and the valley of [[Lake Chilwa]] lie to the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;"South Malawi montane forest-grassland mosaic". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 23 June 2018. [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecoregion enjoyed lush forests, fertile soils, ample water, and mild climate, and is one of the most densely populated regions of Malawi. [[Blantyre]], Malawi's second-largest city, is in the Shire Highlands. [[Tea]] is grown commercially in the highlands, especially around [[Thyolo]] and [[Mulanje]], and is one of Malawi's chief exports.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in the ecoregion include:
* [[Malosa Forest Reserve]]
* [[Michiru Mountain Conservation Area]]
* [[Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve]]

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7803">A '''void''' is a pore that remains unoccupied in a [[composite material]].  A void is typically the result of an imperfection from the processing of the material and is generally deemed undesirable.  Because a void is a non-uniformity in a composite material, it can affect the mechanical properties and lifespan of the composite.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D2734-09, Standard Test Methods for Void Content of Reinforced Plastics, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2009, www.astm.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Voids can act as a crack nucleation site as well as allow moisture to penetrate the composite and contribute to [[anisotropy]] of the composite .&lt;ref&gt;Hull, D., &amp; Clyne, T. (1996). Fiber Architecture - Voids. In An introduction to composite materials (2nd ed., pp. 55-56). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an issue because crack formation and propagation can create unpredictable behavior in the [[laminate]].  For aerospace applications, a void content of approximately 1% is appropriate for performance while other grades of composites can have between 3%-5% void content.  A small change in the percentage of void content may not seem like a large problem however for a loaded carbon fiber laminate composite, a 1%-3% increase in void content can reduce the mechanical properties of the composite by up to 20% &lt;ref name=lacovara&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lacovara | first1 = Bob | year = 2013 | title = Why out of Autoclave Processing Is Good for the Composites Industry | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001043619290186X | journal = High-Performance Composites | volume =  23| issue = | pages = 261–265| doi=10.1016/0010-4361(92)90186-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Void content in composites is represented as a ratio, also called [[void ratio]], where the volume of voids, solid material, and bulk volume are taken into account.  Void ratio can be calculated by the formula below where e is the void ratio of the composite, V&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the voids, and V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the bulk material.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Void Ratio}(e)=\frac{V_v}{V_t-V_v}&lt;/math&gt;

==Formation of Voids==
Voids are considered defects in composite structures and there are several types of voids that can form in composites depending on the fabrication route and matrix type.&lt;ref name=lacovara /&gt; Among other factors that can influence the quantity and location of voids are [[pre-preg]] impregnation, surface morphology, curing parameters, compaction pressure, fiber bridging, excessive [[resin]] bleed, and the thickness of layup .&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, B., &amp; Gammon, L. (2004). Void Analysis of Composite Materials. In ASM Handbook, Volume 9: Metallography and Microstructures (Vol. 9). ASM International.  http://products.asminternational.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/hbk/do/highlight/content/V09_2004/D07/A09/s0504737.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A resin with a high [[viscosity]] will likely produce voids in a composite. It is difficult for a resin or matrix with a high viscosity to penetrate the original void spaces between adjacent fibers. This will cause voids to form close the fiber surface. Preventing these voids becomes a more daunting task when the fibers are packed tightly together in a composite &lt;ref name=shakya&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shakya | first1 = N. | last2 = Roux | first2 = J. | last3 = Jeswani | first3 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Effect of Resin Viscosity in Fiber Reinforcement Compaction in Resin Injection Pultrusion Process | url = | journal = Applied Composite Materials | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1173–1193 | doi=10.1007/s10443-013-9320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high void proportion can be obtained in a composite due to errors in processing as well. If the temperature used for curing is too low for the particular matrix used, complete [[degassing]] might not occur. However, if the temperature used for curing is too high for a particular matrix, [[gelation]] might occur too rapidly and voids may still be present .&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Yokota, Process controlled curing of resin matrix composites, SAMPE J., I4(4), (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a laminate composite is cured at a temperature that is too low for the particular matrix used, the resin viscosity could remain high and hinder removing the void spaces between individual plies &lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harper | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Miller | first2 = N. A. | last3 = Yap | first3 = S. C. | year = 1993 | title = The Influence of Temperature and Pressure During the Curing of Prepreg Carbon Fiber Epoxy Resin | url = | journal = Polymer-Plastics Technology and Engineering | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 269–275 | doi = 10.1080/03602559308019234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some resins can cure at room temperature while other resins require temperatures up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C, but curing above or below the required temperature for a particular matrix can increase the amount of voids present in a composite. If the injection pressure in a resin injection [[pultrusion]] process is not high enough, the resin or matrix might not be able to penetrate the fiber bed to completely wet out the fibers without voids.&lt;ref name=shakya /&gt;  Entrapped air or bubbles can be formed in the resin during resin mixing. If these bubbles are not removed before the wetting of the fibers or curing of the composite, the bubbles could become voids that can be found throughout the final composite structure.&lt;ref name=harper /&gt;

==Reduction of Voids==

Because voids are viewed as defects in composite materials, many methods are applied for reducing voids in composites. Traditionally, using vacuum bagging system and autoclave under pressure and heat will minimize or prevent voids from forming. 
 
The vacuum bagging system combined with [[autoclave]] is a common method used in industrial processes to achieve a low void content for thermoset composites. Vacuum evacuation is the way reducing exciting amount of voids by physically transporting the voids out of the resin and fiber network through vacuum lines, and it is influenced by the viscosity of resin. Autoclave pressure is used to assist vacuum in removing trapped air and excess resin while at the same time preventing volatiles from coming out of the resin at high temperatures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boey | first1 = F.Y.C | last2 = Lye | first2 = S.W | year = 1992 | title = Void reduction in autoclave processing of thermoset composites: Part 1: High pressure effects on void reduction | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001043619290186X | journal = Composites | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 261–265 | doi=10.1016/0010-4361(92)90186-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Optimization of injection flow rate is often calculated to minimize voids in Resin Transfer Molded (RTM) composites. During the injection phase, a liquid resin impregnates the fibers before curing and solidification, often creating voids in the part during the injection. Through an algorithm between fluid flow velocity (v) and the percentages of macro-voids (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and micro-voids (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;V_1= -32.28-11.8\cdot \log(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_2= 6.35+2.35 \cdot \log(v)&lt;/math&gt;

an optimized rate can be obtained and the voids in RTM composites can be reduced, thus improving properties of the composite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruiz | first1 = E | last2 = Achim | first2 = V | last3 = Soukane | first3 = S | last4 = Trochu | first4 = F | last5 = Bréard | first5 = J | year = 2006 | title = Optimization of injection flow rate to minimize micro/macro-voids formation in resin transfer molded composites | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S02663538050022 | journal = Composites Science and Technology | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 475–486 | doi=10.1016/j.compscitech.2005.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''voltage doubler''' is an electronic circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges in such a way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice the voltage is produced at the output as at its input.

The simplest of these circuits are a form of [[rectifier]] which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage.  The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input.  DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching.  They frequently also require a switching element that can be controlled directly, such as a [[transistor]], rather than relying on the voltage across the switch as in the simple AC-to-DC case.

Voltage doublers are a variety of [[voltage multiplier]] circuit.  Many, but not all, voltage doubler circuits can be viewed as a single stage of a higher order multiplier: cascading identical stages together achieves a greater voltage multiplication.

==Voltage doubling rectifiers==

===Villard circuit===
[[File:Villard circuit.svg|upright 0.7|right|thumb|'''Figure 1'''. Villard circuit]]
The '''Villard circuit''', due to [[Paul Ulrich Villard]],&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{citation |first=P. |last=Villard |year=1901 |url=https://archive.org/stream/journaldephysiq62physgoog#page/n35/mode/2up |title=Transformateur à haut voltage. A survolteur cathodique |trans-title=High-voltage transformer.  Cathodic voltage booster |language=French |journal=Journal de Physique Théorique et Appliquée |series=4th series |volume=10 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.1051/jphystap:019010010002801}}.  Villard's voltage booster appears in Fig. 1 on p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; consists simply of a capacitor and a diode. While it has the great benefit of simplicity, its output has very poor [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] characteristics. Essentially, the circuit is a diode [[clamp (circuit)|clamp]] circuit. The capacitor is charged on the negative half cycles to the peak AC voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;pk&lt;/sub&gt;).  The output is the superposition of the input AC waveform and the steady DC of the capacitor.  The effect of the circuit is to shift the DC value of the waveform.  The negative peaks of the AC waveform are "clamped" to 0&amp;nbsp;V (actually −''V''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, the small forward bias voltage of the diode) by the diode, therefore the positive peaks of the output waveform are 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;pk&lt;/sub&gt;. The peak-to-peak ripple is an enormous 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;pk&lt;/sub&gt; and cannot be [[Rectifier#Rectifier output smoothing|smoothed]] unless the circuit is effectively turned into one of the more sophisticated forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kind|Feser|2001|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the circuit (with diode reversed) used to
supply the negative high voltage for the magnetron in a microwave oven.

===Greinacher circuit===
[[File:Greinacher circuit.svg|upright 0.93|left|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Greinacher circuit]]
The '''Greinacher''' voltage doubler is a significant improvement over the Villard circuit for a small cost in additional components.  The ripple is much reduced, nominally zero under open-circuit load conditions, but when current is being drawn depends on the resistance of the load and the value of the capacitors used.  The circuit works by following a Villard cell stage with what is in essence a [[peak detector]] or [[envelope detector]] stage.  The peak detector cell has the effect of removing most of the ripple while preserving the peak voltage at the output. The Greinacher circuit is also commonly known as the [[Rectifier#Half-wave rectification|half-wave]] voltage doubler.&lt;ref name="textbooks"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Voltage quadrupler.svg|thumb|right|upright 1.12|'''Figure 3'''. Voltage quadrupler – two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities]]
This circuit was first invented by [[Heinrich Greinacher]] in 1913 (published 1914&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{citation |first=H. |last=Greinacher |author-link=Heinrich Greinacher |year=1914 |title=Das Ionometer und seine Verwendung zur Messung von Radium- und Röntgenstrahlen |trans-title=The ionometer and its application to the measurement of radium- and Röntgen rays |language=German |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |pages=410–415 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090815022;view=1up;seq=450}}.  Greinacher's voltage doubler appears in Fig. 4 on p. 412.  He used chemical (electrolytic) rectifiers, which are denoted "Z" (''Zellen'', cells).&lt;/ref&gt;) to provide the 200–300&amp;nbsp;V he needed for his newly invented [[ionometer]], the 110&amp;nbsp;V AC supplied by the [[Zurich]] power stations of the time being insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Mehra, p.&amp;nbsp;284&lt;/ref&gt;  He later extended this idea into a cascade of multipliers in 1920.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{citation |last=Greinacher |first=H. |authorlink=Heinrich Greinacher |year=1921 |title=Über eine Methode, Wechselstrom mittels elektrischer Ventile und Kondensatoren in hochgespannten Gleichstrom umzuwandeln |trans-title=On a method to transform a.c. current via electrical diodes and capacitors into high-voltage d.c. current |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=195–205 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101065883751;view=1up;seq=205 |doi=10.1007/bf01328615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kind|Feser|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=p&gt;In 1919, a year before Greinacher published his voltage multiplier, the German Moritz Schenkel published a multi-stage voltage multiplier.

* A condensed version of Schenkel's article — with an illustration of the circuit — appeared in:  "Eine neue Schaltung für die Erzeugung hoher Gleichspannungen," ''Polytechnische Schau'', '''334''' :  203-204 (1919).  Available on-line at:  [http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj334/ar334053 Polytechnisches Journal].&lt;/ref&gt;  This cascade of Greinacher cells is often inaccurately referred to as a Villard cascade.  It is also called a [[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft–Walton multiplier]] after the [[particle accelerator]] machine built by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], who independently discovered the circuit in 1932.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{citation |first=J.

The concept in this topology can be extended to a voltage quadrupler circuit by using two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities driven from the same AC source.  The output is taken across the two individual outputs.  As with a bridge circuit, it is impossible to simultaneously ground the input and output of this circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryder|1970|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delon circuit{{anchor|Delon circuit}}===
[[File:Bridge voltage doubler.svg|thumb|left|upright 0.93|'''Figure 4'''. Bridge (Delon) voltage doubler]]
The '''Delon circuit''' uses a [[Topology (electronics)#Bridge topology|bridge topology]] for voltage doubling;&lt;ref group=p&gt;Jules Delon (1876-1941) was an engineer for the French company ''Société française des câbles électriques Berthoud-Borel''.  He used a mechanical rectifier, which was based on a rotating commutator (''contact tournant'').  
*  His apparatus was exhibited at the 1908 ''Exposition d'électricité'' in Marseille, France:  Georges Tardy (August 15, 1908) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fBJLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Contact tournant de la Société  française des câbles électriques Systeme Berthoud-Borel"], ''L'Electricien:  Revue Internationale de l'Electricité et de ses Applications'', 2nd series, '''36''' (920) :  97-98.  (Article includes photograph of machine.)  The equipment was used to test insulation on high-voltage commercial power lines.
*  The operation of Delon's bridge rectifier is also explained (with schematic) in:  E. von Rziha and Josef Seidener, ''Starkstromtechnik:  Taschenbuch für Elektrotechniker'' (High-current technology:  A Pocket book for Electrical Engineers), 5th ed., vol. 1, (Berlin, Germany:  Wilhelm Ernst &amp; Sohn, 1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SxQ0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA710#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 710-711.]
*  Delon's name and dates appear in:  Friedrich Heilbronner, [http://www.vde.com/de/Ausschuesse/Geschichte-Elektrotechnik/Documents/ETer_A-Z_2013-11%28Nov%29-11.pdf Internationale Liste von Elektrotechnikern (2013)], pp. 14-15.  Brief obituary of Jules Delon, ''Technica'' (Journal of the ''Association des anciens eleves de l'ecole centrale Lyonnaise'' (Association of the Alumni of the Central School of Lyon)), 2nd series, no. 25, page 24 (December 1941).  Available on-line at:  [http://histoire.ec-lyon.fr/index.php?id=1726&amp;image=TE1941_025_ING00034.jpg&amp;v=&amp;Pv=#navArticle Technica.]  See also Delon's U.S. patents no. 1,740,076, no. 1,837,952, and no. 1,995,201.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently it is also called a [[Rectifier#Full-wave rectification|full-wave]] voltage doubler.&lt;ref name="textbooks"/&gt; This form of circuit was, at one time, commonly found in [[cathode ray tube]] television sets where it was used to provide an  [[Extra high tension]] (EHT) supply. Generating voltages in excess of 5&amp;nbsp;kV with a [[transformer]] has safety issues in terms of domestic equipment and in any case is uneconomical. However, black and white television sets required an e.h.t. of 10&amp;nbsp;kV and colour sets even more. Voltage doublers were used to either double the voltage on an e.h.t winding on the mains transformer or were applied to the waveform on the line [[flyback transformer|flyback coils]].&lt;ref&gt;Kories and Schmidt-Walter, p.615&lt;br /&gt;Millman and Halkias, p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;br /&gt;Wharton and Howorth, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit consists of two half-wave peak detectors, functioning in exactly the same way as the peak detector cell in the Greinacher circuit.  Each of the two peak detector cells operates on opposite half-cycles of the incoming waveform.  Since their outputs are in series, the output is twice the peak input voltage.

==Switched capacitor circuits==
[[File:Simple SC doubler schematic.svg|thumb|right|upright 1.4|'''Figure 5.''' Switched capacitor voltage doubler achieved by simply switching charged capacitors from parallel to series]]
It is possible to use the simple diode-capacitor circuits described above to double the voltage of a DC source by preceding the voltage doubler with a [[chopper (electronics)|chopper circuit]].  In effect, this converts the DC to AC before application to the voltage doubler.&lt;ref&gt;McComb, pp.148-150&lt;/ref&gt;  More efficient circuits can be built by driving the switching devices from an external clock so that both functions, the chopping and multiplying, are achieved simultaneously.  Such circuits are known as [[switched capacitor]] circuits.  This approach is especially useful in low-voltage battery-powered applications where integrated circuits require a voltage supply greater than the battery can deliver.  Frequently, a clock signal is readily available on board the integrated circuit and little or no additional circuitry is needed to generate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, perhaps the simplest switched capacitor configuration is that shown schematically in figure 5.  Here two capacitors are simultaneously charged to the same voltage in parallel.  The supply is then switched off and the capacitors are switched into series.  The output is taken from across the two capacitors in series resulting in an output double the supply voltage.  There are many different switching devices that could be used in such a circuit, but in integrated circuits [[MOSFET]] devices are frequently employed.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charge pump doubler schematic.svg|thumb|left|'''Figure 6.''' Charge-pump voltage doubler schematic]]
Another basic concept is the [[charge pump]], a version of which is shown schematically in figure 6.  The charge pump capacitor, C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, is first charged to the input voltage.  It is then switched to charging the output capacitor, C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;, in series with the input voltage resulting in C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; eventually being charged to twice the input voltage.  It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; to pump a small amount of charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;.  While C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] on the output voltage.  This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the discharge time is shorter, and is also easier to filter.  Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification.  The practical maximum clock frequency in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of kilohertz.&lt;ref&gt;Zumbahlen, p.741&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dickson charge pump===
[[File:Dickson doubler.svg|thumb|right|'''Figure 7.''' Dickson charge-pump voltage-doubler]]
The Dickson charge pump, or [[Dickson multiplier]], consists of a cascade of diode/capacitor cells with the bottom plate of each capacitor driven by a [[clock pulse]] train.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{citation |first=John F. |last=Dickson |date=July 1976 |title=On-chip high-voltage generation in MNOS integrated circuits using an improved voltage multiplier technique |journal=IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=374–378 |doi=10.1109/jssc.1976.1050739}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circuit is a modification of the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier but takes a DC input with the clock trains providing the switching signal instead of the AC input.  The Dickson multiplier normally requires that alternate cells are driven from clock pulses of opposite phase.  However, since a voltage doubler, shown in figure 7, requires only one stage of multiplication only one clock signal is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|p=226}}&lt;br /&gt;Yuan, pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dickson multiplier is frequently employed in integrated circuits where the supply voltage (from a battery for instance) is lower than that required by the circuitry.  It is advantageous in integrated circuit manufacture that all the semiconductor components are of basically the same type. [[MOSFET]]s are commonly the standard logic block in many integrated circuits.  For this reason the diodes are often replaced by this type of transistor, but wired to function as a diode - an arrangement called a diode-wired MOSFET.  Figure 8 shows a Dickson voltage doubler using diode-wired n-channel enhancement type MOSFETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|p=226}}&lt;br /&gt;Yuan, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dickson MOSFET doubler.svg|thumb|eft|'''Figure 8.''' Dickson voltage doubler using diode-wired MOSFETs]]
There are many [[Modified Dickson multiplier|variations and improvements]] to the basic Dickson charge pump.  Many of these are concerned with reducing the effect of the transistor drain-source voltage.  This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery.  With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors.  For a circuit using discrete components the [[Schottky diode]] would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state.  However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=228–232}}&lt;br /&gt;Yuan, 14-21&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, an [[alkaline battery]] cell has a nominal voltage of {{nowrap|1.5 V}}.  A voltage doubler using ideal switching elements with zero voltage drop will output double this, namely {{nowrap|3.0 V}}.  However, the drain-source voltage drop of a diode-wired MOSFET when it is in the on state must be at least the gate threshold voltage which might typically be {{nowrap|0.9 V}}.&lt;ref&gt;Liou ''et al.'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt;  This voltage "doubler" will only succeed in raising the output voltage by about {{nowrap|0.6 V}} to {{nowrap|2.1 V}}.  If the drop across the final smoothing transistor is also taken into account the circuit may not be able to increase the voltage at all without using multiple stages.  A typical Schottky diode, on the other hand, might have an on state voltage of {{nowrap|0.3 V}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|Taylor|2003|p=17/27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A doubler using this Schottky diode will result in a voltage of {{nowrap|2.7 V}}, or at the output after the smoothing diode, {{nowrap|2.4 V}}.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-coupled switched capacitors===
[[File:Cross-coupled SC voltage doubler.svg|thumb|'''Figure 9.''' Cross-coupled switched-capacitor voltage doubler]]
Cross-coupled switched capacitor circuits come into their own for very low input voltages.  Wireless battery driven equipment such as pagers, bluetooth devices and the like may require a single-cell battery to continue to supply power when it has discharged to under a volt.&lt;ref&gt;Peluso ''et al.'', pp.36-37&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When clock &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \ &lt;/math&gt; is low transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is turned off.  At the same time clock &lt;math&gt;\phi_2 \ &lt;/math&gt; is high turning on transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in capacitor C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being charged to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \ &lt;/math&gt; goes high the top plate of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is pushed up to twice ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  At the same time switch S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; closes so this voltage appears at the output.  At the same time Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is turned on allowing C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to charge.  On the next half cycle the roles will be reversed: &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \ &lt;/math&gt; will be low, &lt;math&gt;\phi_2 \ &lt;/math&gt; will be high, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will open and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will close.  Thus, the output is supplied with 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; alternately from each side of the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Campardo ''et al.'', p.377&lt;br /&gt;Peluso ''et al.'', p.36&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss is low in this circuit because there are no diode-wired MOSFETs and their associated threshold voltage problems.  The circuit also has the advantage that the ripple frequency is doubled because there are effectively two voltage doublers both supplying the output from out of phase clocks.  The primary disadvantage of this circuit is that stray capacitances are much more significant than with the Dickson multiplier and account for the larger part of the losses in this circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Peluso ''et al.'', p.36&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|2006|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
