      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6655">'''Arizona Financial Text System (AZFinText)''' is a textual-based quantitative financial prediction system written by [[Robert P. Schumaker]] of [[University of Texas at Tyler]] and [[Hsinchun Chen]] of the [[University Of Arizona|University of Arizona]]. 

==System==
This system differs from other systems in that it uses financial text as one of its key means of predicting stock price movement. This reduces the information lag-time problem evident in many similar systems where new information must be transcribed (e.g., such as losing a costly court battle or having a product recall), before the quant can react appropriately. AZFinText overcomes these limitations by utilizing the terms used in financial news articles to predict future stock prices twenty minutes after the news article has been released.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., (2006). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/AMCIS%20-%20Textual%20Analysis%20of%20Stock%20Market%20Prediction%20Using%20Financial%20News%20Articles.pdf Textual Analysis of Stock Market Prediction Using Financial News Articles]. ''12th Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS-2006)'', Aug 2006. Acapulco, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is believed that certain article terms can move stocks more than others.  Terms such as ''factory exploded'' or ''workers strike'' will have a depressing effect on stock prices whereas terms such as ''earnings rose'' will tend to increase stock prices.  

When a human trading expert sees certain terms, they will react in a somewhat predictable fashion.  AZFinText capitalizes on the arbitrage opportunities that exist when investment experts over and under-react to certain news stories. By analyzing breaking financial news articles and focusing on specific parts of speech, portfolio selection, term weighting and even article sentiment, the AZFinText system becomes a powerful tool and is a radically different way of looking at stock market prediction.

== Overview of research ==
The foundation of AZFinText can be found in the ACM TOIS article.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen H., (2009). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1462198.1462204 Textual Analysis of Stock Market Prediction Using Breaking Financial News]. ''Association for Computing Machinery Transactions on Information Systems'', 27(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Within this paper, the authors tested several different prediction models and linguistic textual representations.  From this work, it was found that using the article terms and the price of the stock at the time the article was released was the most effective model and using proper nouns was the most effective textual representation technique.  Combining the two, AZFinText netted a 2.84% trading return over the five-week study period.

AZFinText was then extended to study what combination of peer organizations help to best train the system.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen, H., (2009). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1570564 A Quantitative Stock Prediction System based on Financial News]. ''Information Processing and Management'', 45(5): 571-583.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the premise that [[IBM]] has more in common with [[Microsoft]] than [[General Motors|GM]], AZFinText studied the effect of varying peer-based training sets.  To do this, AZFinText trained on the various levels of [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] and evaluated the results.  It was found that sector-based training was most effective, netting an 8.50% trading return, outperforming [[Jim Cramer]], Jim Jubak and DayTraders.com during the study period.  AZFinText was also compared against the top 10 quantitative systems and outperformed 6 of them.

A third study investigated the role of portfolio building in a textual financial prediction system.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R. and Chen, H., (2008). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1331274 Evaluating a News-Aware Quantitative Trader: The Effects of Momentum and Contrarian Stock Selection Strategies]. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 59(2): 247-255.&lt;/ref&gt; From this study, Momentum and Contrarian stock portfolios were created and tested.  Using the premise that past winning stocks will continue to win and past losing stocks will continue to lose, AZFinText netted a 20.79% return during the study period.  It was also noted that traders were generally overreacting to news events, creating the opportunity of abnormal returns. 

A fourth study looked into using author sentiment as an added predictive variable.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., Zhang, Y. and Huang, C., (2008). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/IIMA%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20Financial%20News%20Articles.pdf Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles]. ''20th Annual Conference of International Information Management Association'', Oct. 2009.  Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the premise that an author can unwittingly influence market trades simply by the terms they use, AZFinText was tested using tone and polarity features.  It was found that Contrarian activity was occurring within the market, where articles of a positive tone would decrease in price and articles of a negative tone would increase in price.

A further study investigated what article verbs have the most influence on stock price movement.&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, R., (2010). [http://www.robschumaker.com/publications/SM%20-%20An%20Analysis%20of%20Verbs%20in%20Financial%20News%20Articles%20and%20their%20Impact%20on%20Stock%20Price.pdf  An Analysis of Verbs in Financial News Articles and their Impact on Stock Price]. ''NAACL Workshop on Social Media and Computational Linguistics'', June 2010. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; From this work, it was found that ''planted'', ''announcing'', ''front'', ''smaller'' and ''crude'' had the highest positive impact on stock price.

== Notable publicity ==
AZFinText has been the topic of discussion by numerous media outlets.  Some of the more notable ones include the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Slashdot]], [[Technology Review|MIT's Technology Review]], [[Motley Fool]], Crossing Wall Street, [[WBIR]] in Knoxville, TN and Motherboard TV.

'''Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III ibni Almarhum Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III''' was the 7th [[Sultan of Johor]] who reigned from 1623 to 1677. Known as "Raja Bujang" before his accession, he was a son of the 5th Sultan, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah III]] and a nephew of the 6th Sultan, [[Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/malacca4.htm|title=Ruling House of Malacca-Johor|publisher=Christopher Buyers|date=October 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruler of Pahang and Sultan of Johor-Pahang==
In 1615, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah III]] signed a peace treaty with the [[Portuguese Malacca]], and as a sign of gratitude, the Portuguese recognised Raja Bujang as the ruler of Pahang, replacing [[Alauddin Riayat Shah of Pahang|Alauddin Riayat Shah]] who was deposed earlier in 1615 by the Acehnese. However, the appointment was not recognised by [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] of Acheh, which later invaded Pahang and forced Raja Bujang to flee to the islands of [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]]. At the same time, the Achehnese waged war with the new Sultan of Johor, [[Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah]] who was also forced to flee to Lingga. As the Achehnese attacks continued, Raja Bujang and Sultan Abdullah fled once again to [[Tambelan archipelago]]. When Sultan Abdullah died in 1623, Acheh reconciled with Raja Bujang and appointed him as the new Sultan of Johor and Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Gopinath, 1991, ms 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invasion of Malacca==

The strength of Acheh was brought to an end with a disastrous campaign against Malacca in 1629, when the combined Portuguese and Johor forces managed to destroy the fleet and 19,000 Achehnese troops according to Portuguese account.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;*D. G. E. Hall, ''A History of South-east Asia''. London: Macmillan, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Johor later grew stronger and formed an alliance with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to attack the [[Portuguese Malacca]] and conquered it on January 14, 1641, ending the triangular war. Subsequently in the following month, [[Iskandar Thani]] of Acheh died and was succeeded by Queen [[Taj ul-Alam]]. Her reign marks the beginning of decline of Acheh position as a regional power. 

In 1641, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III moved to the mainland Johor and established his new capital in Makam Tauhid. He spent two years of his reign in Makam Tauhid before he crossed the Damar river to establish his new capital in [[Pasir Raja]] (also known as Batu Sawar) in October 1642. 

[[Jambi]] emerged as a regional economic and political power in the early 17th century.  Initially there was an attempt of an alliance between Johor and Jambi with a promised marriage between the heir Raja Muda and daughter of the ''Pengeran'' of Jambi.  However, the Raja Muda married instead the daughter of the [[Laksamana]], who was concerned about the dilution of power from such an alliance and so offered his own daughter for marriage.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRaJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Crossroads (2nd Edn): A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore |author= Jim Baker| publisher=Marshall Cavendish International (Asia) Pte Ltd|isbn=978-9814516020 |pages=64–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance broke down, and between 1666-1679, a long war erupted and Jambi successfully sacked the Johor capital in Batu Sawar in 1673. Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III fled to Pahang and made it as his administration centre for four years before he died in [[Kuala Pahang]] in 1677.

Marshall became the most powerful figure in the Jesuit mission in Maryland, eventually becoming the [[Procurator (canon law)|Procurator]] of the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen of Maryland during the [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWQb_GWZcWcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=adam+marshall+sj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MUKrvmnQlx&amp;sig=fd77qekCUgJ_AwFxO6C-MRKifKU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix_Im3tL7dAhURhuAKHVAoDH84ChDoATAOegQIAxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=adam%20marshall%20sj&amp;f=false|title=Shaping American Catholicism: Maryland and New York, 1805–1915|last=Curran|first=Robert Emmett|publisher=[[Catholic University of America Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9780813219677|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=62|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916020635/https://books.google.com/books?id=BWQb_GWZcWcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=adam+marshall+sj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MUKrvmnQlx&amp;sig=fd77qekCUgJ_AwFxO6C-MRKifKU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix_Im3tL7dAhURhuAKHVAoDH84ChDoATAOegQIAxAB%23v=onepage&amp;q=adam%20marshall%20sj&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=adam%20marshall%20sj&amp;f=false|archive-date=September 16, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, he was stationed at Washington Seminary (which later became [[Gonzaga College High School]]) and was placed in charge of the worldly affairs of the Jesuit mission in Maryland. In the beginning of 1824, Marshall was appointed the second president of Washington Seminary, succeeding [[Anthony Kohlmann]]. During his presidency, the students of the Seminary partook in the first civic procession in Washington by joining in the commemoration of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] of 1824.

During [[World War II]], some members of the [[United States military]] mutilated dead Japanese service personnel in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of operations. The mutilation of Japanese service personnel included the taking of body parts as "war souvenirs" and "[[war trophies]]". Teeth and [[human skull|skulls]] were the most commonly taken "trophies", although other body parts were also collected.

The phenomenon of "trophy-taking" was widespread enough that discussion of it featured prominently in magazines and newspapers, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] himself was reportedly given, by U.S. Representative [[Francis E. Walter]], a gift of a letter-opener made of a Japanese soldier's arm (Roosevelt later ordered that the gift be returned and called for its proper burial).{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=65}}{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} The behavior was officially prohibited by the U.S. military, which issued additional guidance as early as 1942 condemning it specifically.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Nonetheless, the behavior continued throughout the war in the Pacific Theater, and has resulted in continued discoveries of "trophy skulls" of Japanese [[combatants]] in American possession, as well as American and Japanese efforts to [[repatriate]] the remains of the Japanese dead.

==Trophy-taking==
[[File:AWM 072837.jpg|thumb|upright|PT-341, Alexishafen, New Guinea, April 30, 1944]]
A number of firsthand accounts, including those of American servicemen, attest to the taking of "trophies" from the corpses of Imperial Japanese troops in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]]. Historians have attributed the phenomenon to a campaign of dehumanization of the Japanese in the U.S. media, to various racist tropes latent in American society, to the depravity of warfare under desperate circumstances, to the inhuman cruelty of Imperial Japanese forces, lust for revenge, or any combination of those factors.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The taking of so-called "trophies" was widespread enough that, by September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ordered that "No part of the enemy's body may be used as a souvenir", and any American servicemen violating that principle would face "stern disciplinary action".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fussell. ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War''. 1990, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophy skulls are the most notorious of the souvenirs. Teeth, ears and other such body parts were occasionally modified, for example by writing on them or fashioning them into utilities or other artifacts.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Eugene Sledge]] relates a few instances of fellow Marines extracting gold teeth from the Japanese, including one from an enemy soldier who was still alive.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the Japanese wasn't dead. He had been wounded severely in the back and couldn't move his arms; otherwise he would have resisted to his last breath. The Japanese's mouth glowed with huge gold-crowned teeth, and his captor wanted them. He put the point of his [[Ka-Bar|kabar]] on the base of a tooth and hit the handle with the palm of his hand. Because the Japanese was kicking his feet and thrashing about, the knife point glanced off the tooth and sank deeply into the victim's mouth. The Marine cursed him and with a slash cut his cheeks open to each ear. He put his foot on the sufferer's lower jaw and tried again. Blood poured out of the soldier's mouth. He made a gurgling noise and thrashed wildly. I shouted, “Put the man out of his misery.” All I got for an answer was a cussing out. Another Marine ran up, put a bullet in the enemy soldier's brain, and ended his agony. The scavenger grumbled and continued extracting his prizes undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;(''[[With the Old Breed|With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]]''. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[U.S. Marine]] veteran Donald Fall attributed the mutilation of enemy corpses to hatred and desire for vengeance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the second day of Guadalcanal we captured a big Jap bivouac with all kinds of beer and supplies&amp;nbsp;... But they also found a lot of pictures of Marines that had been cut up and mutilated [[Battle of Wake Island#War crimes|on Wake Island]]. The next thing you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts with safety pins. They issued an order reminding Marines that mutilation was a [[court-martial]] offense&amp;nbsp;... You get into a nasty frame of mind in combat. You see what's been done to you. You'd find a dead Marine that the Japs had booby-trapped. We found dead Japs that were booby-trapped. And they mutilated the dead. We began to get down to their level.{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|right|thumb|Front line warning sign using a Japanese soldier's skull on [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]] October 1944]]

Another example of mutilation was related by Ore Marion, a U.S. Marine who suggested,
&lt;blockquote&gt;We learned about savagery from the Japanese&amp;nbsp;... But those sixteen-to-nineteen-year old kids we had on the Canal were fast learners&amp;nbsp;... At daybreak, a couple of our kids, bearded, dirty, skinny from hunger, slightly wounded by bayonets, clothes worn and torn, wack off three Jap heads and jam them on poles facing the 'Jap side' of the river&amp;nbsp;... The colonel sees Jap heads on the poles and says, 'Jesus men, what are you doing? You're acting like animals.' A dirty, stinking young kid says, 'That's right Colonel, we are animals. We live like animals, we eat and are treated like animals–what the fuck do you expect?'{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 1, 1943, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a photograph taken by [[Ralph Morse]] during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]] showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. Marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. ''Life'' received letters of protest from people "in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy." The editors responded that "war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reminders." However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the amount of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://greyfalcon.us/restored/War.htm War, Journalism, and Propaganda]"&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Morse recounted that when his platoon came upon the tank with the head mounted on it, the sergeant warned his men not to approach it as it might have been set up by the Japanese in order to lure them in for a look. He feared that the Japanese might have a mortar tube zeroed in on it. Morse recalled the scene in this way, "'Everybody stay away from there,' the sergeant says, then he turns to me. 'You,' he says, 'go take your picture if you have to, then get out, quick.' So I went over, got my pictures and ran like hell back to where the patrol had stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3518085/life-behind-the-picture-skull-on-a-tank-guadalcanal-1942/|title=Guadalcanal: Rare and Classic Photos From a Pivotal WWII Campaign|author=Ben Cosgrove|date=Feb 19, 2014|work=TIME.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1943, the U.S. High Command expressed alarm over recent newspaper articles, for example one where a soldier made a string of beads using Japanese teeth, and another about a soldier with pictures showing the steps in preparing a skull, involving cooking and scraping of the Japanese heads.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}

In 1944, the American poet [[Winfield Townley Scott]] was working as a reporter in [[Rhode Island]] when a sailor displayed his skull trophy in the newspaper office. This led to the poem ''The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull'', which described one method for preparation of skulls (the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with [[caustic soda]]).{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

[[Charles Lindbergh]] refers in his diary entries to several instances of mutilations. For example, in the entry for August 14, 1944, he notes a conversation he had with a Marine officer, who claimed that he had seen many Japanese corpses with an ear or nose cut off.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the case of the skulls however, most were not collected from freshly killed Japanese; most came from already partially or fully skeletonised Japanese bodies.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Lindbergh also noted in his diary his experiences from an air base in New Guinea, where according to him the troops killed the remaining Japanese stragglers "as a sort of hobby" and often used their leg-bones to carve utilities.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Moros during World War II|Moro Muslim guerillas on Mindanao fought against Japan in World War II]]. The [[Moro people|Moro Muslim]] [[Datu]] Pino sliced the ears off Japanese soldiers and cashed them in with the American guerilla leader  [[Wendell Fertig|Colonel Fertig]] at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and 20 centavos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iI_WAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Keats 1990], p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G8p3AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears McClintock 1992], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nL5BwIi7TJ0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Tucci 2009], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent of practice===
According to Weingartner it is not possible to determine the percentage of U.S. troops that collected Japanese body parts, "but it is clear that the practice was not uncommon".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Harrison only a minority of U.S. troops collected Japanese body parts as trophies, but "their behaviour reflected attitudes which were very widely shared".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Dower, most U.S. combatants in the Pacific did not engage in "souvenir hunting" for bodyparts.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The majority had some knowledge that these practices were occurring, however, and "accepted them as inevitable under the circumstances".{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The incidence of soldiers collecting Japanese body parts occurred on "a scale large enough to concern the Allied military authorities throughout the conflict and was widely reported and commented on in the American and Japanese wartime press".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=818}} The degree of acceptance of the practice varied between units. Taking of teeth was generally accepted by [[enlisted men]] and also by officers, while acceptance for taking other body parts varied greatly.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the experience of one serviceman turned author, Weinstein, ownership of skulls and teeth were widespread practices.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|pp=822, 823}}

When interviewed by researchers former servicemen have related to the practice of taking gold teeth from the dead – and sometimes also from the living – as having been widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/03/humanities.highereducation Film exposes Allies' Pacific war atrocities Horrific footage shot during battle with Japanese shows execution of wounded and bayoneting of corpses.] Jason Burke The Observer, Sunday June 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement between historians over what the more common forms of '[[War trophy|trophy hunting]]' undertaken by U.S. personnel were. [[John W. Dower]] states that ears were the most common form of trophy that was taken, and skulls and bones were less commonly collected. In particular he states that "skulls were not popular trophies" as they were difficult to carry and the process for removing the flesh was offensive.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=65}} This view is supported by Simon Harrison.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In contrast, [[Niall Ferguson]] states that "boiling the flesh off enemy [Japanese] skulls to make souvenirs was not an uncommon practice. Ears, bones and teeth were also collected".{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}}

The collection of Japanese body parts began quite early in the campaign, prompting a September 1942 order for disciplinary action against such souvenir taking.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Harrison concludes that since this was the first real opportunity to take such items (the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]), "Clearly, the collection of body parts on a scale large enough to concern the military authorities had started as soon as the first living or dead Japanese bodies were encountered."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} When Charles Lindbergh passed through customs at Hawaii in 1944, one of the customs declarations he was asked to make was whether or not he was carrying any bones. He was told after expressing some shock at the question that it had become a routine point.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=71}} This was because of the large number of souvenir bones discovered in customs, also including “green” (uncured) skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

In 1984, Japanese soldiers' remains were repatriated from the [[Mariana Islands]]. Roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} Likewise it has been reported that many of the Japanese remains on [[Iwo Jima]] are missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} It is possible that the souvenir collection of remains continued also in the immediate post-war period.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

===Context===
According to Simon Harrison, all of the "trophy skulls" from the World War II era in the forensic record in the U.S., attributable to an ethnicity, are of Japanese origin; none come from Europe{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}} (a seemingly rare exception to this rule was the case of a German soldier scalped by an American soldier, falsely attributed to a [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribal custom.&lt;ref&gt;"The taking and displaying of human body parts as trophies by Amerindians", Chacon and Dye, page 625 {{ISBN|9780387483030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films shot by the Special Film Project 186&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ch_Amy0YGI Chasing Hitler] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; near Prague, Czechoslovakia, on May 8, 1945, display an M4 Sherman with a skull and bones fixed to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/film/display/detail.php?file_num=4686|title=LIBERATED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WOUNDED AND DEAD GERMANS; POWS|publisher=Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Skulls from World War II, and also from the [[Vietnam War]], continue turning up in the U.S., sometimes returned by former servicemen or their relatives, or discovered by police. According to Harrison, contrary to the situation in average head-hunting societies, the trophies do not fit in American society. While the taking of the objects was socially accepted at the time, after the war, when the Japanese in time became seen as fully human again, the objects for the most part became seen as unacceptable and unsuitable for display. Therefore, in time they and the practice that had generated them were largely forgotten.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

Australian soldiers also mutilated Japanese bodies at times, most commonly by taking gold teeth from corpses.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} This was officially discouraged by the [[Australian Army]].{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Johnston states that "one could argue that greed rather than hatred was the motive" for this behavior, but "utter contempt for the enemy was also present".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Australians are also known to have taken gold teeth from German corpses, "but the practice was obviously more common in the South-West Pacific".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} "The vast majority of Australians clearly found such behaviour abhorrent, but "some of the soldiers who engaged in it were not 'hard cases'.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} According to Johnston, Australian soldiers' "unusually murderous behavior" towards their Japanese opponents (such as killing prisoners) was caused by racism, a lack of understanding of Japanese military culture and, most significantly, a desire to take revenge against the murder and mutilation of Australian prisoners and native New Guineans during the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] and subsequent battles.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=81–100}}

From the [[Burma Campaign]], there are recorded instances of British troops removing gold teeth and displaying Japanese skulls as trophies.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Moreman "The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941–45", p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==

===Dehumanization===

In the U.S., there was a widely propagated view that the Japanese were subhuman.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} There was also popular anger in the U.S. at the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]], amplifying pre-war racial prejudices.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}} The U.S. media helped propagate this view of the Japanese, for example describing them as "yellow vermin".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} In an official [[U.S. Navy]] film, Japanese troops were described as "living, snarling rats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Japanese were alternatively described and depicted as "mad dogs", "yellow vermin", termites, apes, monkeys, insects, reptiles and bats etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of underlying [[American racism]], which was added to by [[American propaganda during World War II#Anti-Japanese|U.S. wartime propaganda]], hatred caused by the Japanese [[war of aggression]], and both real and also fabricated [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese atrocities]], led to a general loathing of the Japanese.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Although there were objections to the mutilation from among other military jurists, "to many Americans the Japanese adversary was no more than an animal, and abuse of his remains carried with it no [[Social stigma|moral stigma]].{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=66, 67}}

According to [[Niall Ferguson]]: "To the historian who has specialized in German history, this is one of the most troubling aspects of the Second World War: the fact that Allied troops often regarded the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians&amp;nbsp;— as ''[[Untermensch]]en''."{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=182}} Since the Japanese were regarded as animals, it is not surprising that Japanese remains were treated in the same way as animal remains.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}}

Simon Harrison comes to the conclusion in his paper, "Skull trophies of the Pacific War: transgressive objects of remembrance", that the minority of U.S. personnel who collected Japanese skulls did so because they came from a society that placed much value in hunting as a symbol of masculinity, combined with a de-humanization of the enemy.

War correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]], on a trip to Saipan after the [[Battle of Saipan|invasion]], claimed that the men who actually fought the Japanese did not subscribe to the wartime propaganda: "Soldiers and Marines have told me stories by the dozen about how tough the Japs are, yet how dumb they are; how illogical and yet how uncannily smart at times; how easy to rout when disorganized, yet how brave&amp;nbsp;... As far as I can see, our men are no more afraid of the Japs than they are of the Germans. They are afraid of them as a modern soldier is afraid of his foe, but not because they are slippery or rat-like, but simply because they have weapons and fire them like good, tough soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/erniepyle/1945/02/26/the-illogical-japs/|title=The Illogical Japs|author=Ernie Pyle|publisher=Rocky Mountain News|date=February 26, 1945|accessdate=17 October 2016|via=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brutalization===
Some writers and veterans state that body parts trophy and souvenir taking was a side effect of the brutalizing effects of a harsh campaign.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

Harrison argues that, while brutalization could explain part of the mutilations, this explanation does not explain servicemen who, even before shipping off for the Pacific, proclaimed their intention to acquire such objects.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} According to Harrison, it also does not explain the many cases of servicemen collecting the objects as gifts for people back home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison concludes that there is no evidence that the average serviceman collecting this type of souvenirs was suffering from "[[combat fatigue]]". They were normal men who felt this was what their loved ones wanted them to collect for them.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Skulls were sometimes also collected as souvenirs by non-combat personnel.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

A young Marine recruit, who had arrived on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] with his buddy Al in 1944, after the island was secure, provides an eyewitness account. After a brief firefight the night before, he and a small group of other Marines find the body of a straggler who had apparently shot himself:

:"I would have guessed that the dead Japanese was only about fourteen years old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan who would receive word that her son had been killed in battle. Then one of the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his arm around my shoulder. He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al he had tears running down his face."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Petty, ''Saipan: Oral Histories of the Pacific War'', McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|0-7864-0991-6}}, p 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge===
[[File:Anti-Japan2.png|thumb|upright|News of the [[Bataan Death March]] sparked outrage in the US, as shown by this propaganda poster]]

Bergerud writes that U.S. troops hostility towards their Japanese opponents largely arose from incidents in which Japanese soldiers committed war crimes against Americans, such as the [[Bataan Death March]] and other incidents conducted by individual soldiers. For instance, Bergerud states that the U.S. Marines on Guadacanal were aware that the Japanese had beheaded some of the Marines captured on [[Wake Island]] prior to the start of the campaign. However this type of knowledge did not necessarily lead to revenge mutilations; one Marine states that they falsely thought the Japanese had not taken any prisoners at Wake Island, and therefore as revenge they killed all Japanese that tried to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coleman Jersey "Hell's islands: the untold story of Guadalcanal", p. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Asia and the Pacific War|Allied war crimes during World War II]])

According to one Marine, the earliest account of U.S. troops wearing ears from Japanese corpses he recounts took place on the second day of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in August 1942 and occurred after photos of the mutilated bodies of Marines on Wake Island were found in Japanese engineers' personal effects. The account of the same Marine also states that Japanese troops booby-trapped some of their own dead as well as some dead Marines, and also mutilated corpses; the effect on Marines being "We began to get down to their level".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}} According to Bradley A. Thayer, referring to Bergerud and interviews conducted by Bergerud, the behaviors of American and Australian soldiers were affected by "intense fear, coupled with a powerful lust for revenge".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=185}}

Weingartner writes however that U.S. Marines were intent on taking [[gold teeth]] and making keepsakes of Japanese ears already while en route to Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=556}}

===Souvenirs and bartering===
Factors relevant to the collection of body parts were their economic value, the desire both of the "folks back home" for a souvenir and of the servicemen themselves to have a keepsake when they returned home.

Some of the collected souvenir bones were modified, e.g. turned into letter-openers, and may be an extension of [[trench art]].{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

Pictures showing the "cooking and scraping" of Japanese heads may have formed part of the large set of Guadalcanal photographs sold to sailors which were circulating on the U.S. West-coast.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} According to Paul Fussel, pictures showing this type of activity, i.e. boiling human heads; "were taken (and preserved for a lifetime) because the Marines were proud of their success".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

According to Weingartner, some of the U.S. Marines who were about to take part in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] were already while en route looking forward to collecting Japanese gold teeth for necklaces and to preserving Japanese ears as souvenirs.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}}

In many cases (and unexplainable by battlefield conditions) the collected body parts were not for the use of the collector but were instead meant to be gifts to family and friends at home,{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} in some cases as the result of specific requests from home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Newspapers reported of cases such as a mother requesting permission for her son to send her an ear or a bribed chaplain that was promised by an underage youth "the third pair of ears he collected".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} A better-known example of those servicemen who left for battle already planning to send home a trophy is the ''Life Magazine'' picture of the week, whose caption begins:
:"When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends ..."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}}

Another example of this type of press is ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'', that in early 1943 published a cartoon showing the parents of a soldier receiving a pair of ears from their son.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} In 1942 [[Alan Lomax]] recorded a blues song where a black soldier promises to send his child a Japanese skull, and a tooth.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison also makes note of the Congressman that gave President Roosevelt a letter-opener carved out of bone as examples of the social range of these attitudes.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}
[[File:Pacific war.jpg|thumb|Skull stewing-Pacific War]]
Trade sometimes occurred with the items, such as "members of the Naval Construction Battalions stationed on Guadalcanal selling Japanese skulls to merchant seamen" as reported in an Allied intelligence report from early 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}} Sometimes teeth (particularly the less common gold teeth) were also seen as a trade-able commodity.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

==U.S. reaction==
"Stern disciplinary action" against human remains souvenir taking was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet as early as September 1942.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In October 1943 General [[George C. Marshall]] radioed General [[Douglas MacArthur]] about "his concern over current reports of atrocities committed by American soldiers".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} In January 1944 the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive against the taking of Japanese body parts.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} Simon Harrison writes that directives of this type may have been effective in some areas, "but they seem to have been implemented only partially and unevenly by local commanders".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}
[[File:LIFE May 1944 Jap Skull.jpg|thumb|upright|May 22, 1944 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' Picture of the Week, "Arizona war worker writes her Navy boyfriend a thank-you-note for the Jap skull he sent her"]]

On May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' published a photo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=May 22, 1944 |author1=Inc, Time |title=Picture of the Week |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |page=35 |issn=0024-3019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an American girl with a Japanese skull sent to her by her naval officer boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;The image depicts a young blond at a desk gazing at a skull. The caption says: "When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends, and inscribed: "This is a good Jap&amp;nbsp;– a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach." Natalie, surprised at the gift, named it [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]]. The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters ''Life'' received from its readers in response to this photo were "overwhelmingly condemnatory"{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=58}} and the Army directed its Bureau of Public Relations to inform U.S. publishers that "the publication of such stories would be likely to encourage the enemy to take reprisals against American dead and prisoners of war".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=60}} The junior officer who had sent the skull was also traced and officially reprimanded.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} This was done reluctantly however, and the punishment was not severe.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=65, 66}}

The ''Life'' photo also led to the U.S. Military taking further action against the mutilation of Japanese corpses. In a memorandum dated June 13, 1944, the Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] asserted that "such atrocious and brutal policies" in addition to being repugnant also were violations of the laws of war, and recommended the distribution to all commanders of a directive pointing out that "the maltreatment of enemy war dead was a blatant violation of the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded]], which provided that: After each engagement, the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead, and to protect them against pillage and maltreatment." Such practices were in addition also in violation of the unwritten customary rules of land warfare and could lead to the death penalty.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}} The Navy JAG mirrored that opinion one week later, and also added that "the atrocious conduct of which some U.S. servicemen were guilty could lead to retaliation by the Japanese which would be justified under international law".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}}

On June 13, 1944, the press reported that President Roosevelt had been presented with a letter-opener made out of a Japanese soldier's arm bone by [[Francis E. Walter]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressman.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Supposedly, the president commented, "This is the sort of gift I like to get", and "There'll be plenty more such gifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&amp;dat=19440613&amp;id=WPgoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2176,4582411|title=Jones-Clayton Forces Behind Texas Revolt|work=The ''Nevada Daily Mail''|date=Jun 13, 1944|author=Drew Pearson|department=THE WASHINGTON MERRY-GO-ROUND}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks later it was reported that it had been given back with the explanation that the President did not want this type of object and recommended it be buried instead. In doing so, Roosevelt was acting in response to the concerns which had been expressed by the military authorities and some of the civilian population, including church leaders.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}

In October 1944, the Right Rev. [[Henry St. George Tucker (bishop)|Henry St. George Tucker]], the [[List of presiding bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], issued a statement which deplored "'isolated' acts of desecration with respect to the bodies of slain Japanese soldiers and appealed to American soldiers as a group to discourage such actions on the part of individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Tucker Deplores Desecration of Foe; Mutilation of Japanese Bodies Contrary to Spirit of Army, He Says of 'Isolated' Cases |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/14/archives/tucker-deplores-desecration-of-foe-mutilation-of-japanese-bodies.html|work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=The Morals of Victory |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932499,00.html?promoid=googlep |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 23, 1944 |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese reaction==
News that President Roosevelt had been given a bone letter-opener by a congressman was widely reported in Japan. The Americans were portrayed as "deranged, primitive, racist and inhuman". This reporting was compounded by the previous May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine picture of the week publication of a young woman with a skull trophy, which was reprinted in the Japanese media and presented as a symbol of American barbarism, causing national shock and outrage.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Colin: ''Afterlives of the Saints''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin P. Hoyt]] in ''Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict'' argues that two U.S. media reports of Japanese skulls and bones being sent home were exploited by Japanese [[propaganda]] very effectively, and this coupled to the [[Shinto]] religion, which places much higher emotional value on the treatment of human remains, contributed to a preference to death over surrender and occupation, shown, for example, in the mass civilian suicides on Saipan and Okinawa after the Allied landings.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 357–361&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoyt, "The thought of a Japanese soldier's skull becoming an American ashtray was as horrifying in Tokyo as the thought of an American prisoner used for bayonet practice was in New York."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Some historians argue that a similar pattern of Asian dehumanization persisted in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though, like World War II, Asians were on both sides of those wars. In Vietnam, the supposed "[[Mere Gook Rule]]" allowed soldiers to harm or kill South Vietnamese citizens with little fear of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q3vpJ3ePH4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kill+anything+that+moves&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY64a5-NvQAhUM7GMKHYEgAo4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805086911|location=|pages=50–51, 144, 191, 197, 226|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Android 18'''|人造人間18号|Jinzōningen Jū Hachi Gō|lit. "Artificial Human #18"|lead=yes}}, born as '''Lazuli''' (ラズリ Razuri) is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Android 18 makes her debut in chapter #349 The Androids Awake! (目覚めた17号、18号, Mezameta Jūnanagō, Jūhachigō), first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' on November 12, 1991.

She and her twin brother, [[Android 17]], were forcibly turned into [[cyborg]]s by [[Dr. Gero]] to serve his vendetta against [[Goku]]. The present-timeline version of the character has very little to no interest in fulfilling Gero's orders and becomes a major character in the series after marrying Goku's best friend [[Krillin]].

In an alternate timeline, Android 18 is a ruthless killer who started a reign of terror along with Android 17 over Earth that lasted for twenty years until they are destroyed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]].

== Appearances ==
=== In ''Dragon Ball'' ===
Prior to their introductions and present in both timelines, Androids #17 and #18 were converted into androids by Dr. Gero with the intent of murdering Goku. In the main timeline, Android 18 is activated by Dr. Gero along with Android 17 after he returns to his laboratory following his unsuccessful attempt to defeat Goku's allies.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball'' manga, volume 29, chapter 349&lt;/ref&gt; After Gero is killed by Android 17, Android 18 activates Android 16 following surviving a blast meant to kill her from Trunks and the three begin their quest to find and kill Goku.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 30, chapter 350&lt;/ref&gt; When they encounter [[Vegeta]], Android 18 decides to fight him and easily bests him in battle, receiving only damages to her clothing and breaking his arm.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball'' manga, volume 30, chapter 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 30, chapter 353&lt;/ref&gt; When Trunks, [[Tenshinhan]] and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] become involved, she and Android 17 easily defeat the trio.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 30, chapter 354&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving to continue her quest, she kisses [[Krillin]] on the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 30, chapter 355&lt;/ref&gt; The androids go to Goku's home and do not discover him there, leading them to journey to [[Kame-Sennin]]'s house, but they do not find him there either due to his having departed not long before.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball' manga, volume 31, chapter 366&lt;/ref&gt; 18 watches Android 17's battle against Piccolo, at one point becoming impatient and offering her assistance to her brother's decline, until [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] arrives, who reveals his intent to absorb the pair.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 31, chapter 367&lt;/ref&gt; Piccolo is dispatched by Cell&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 31, chapter 370&lt;/ref&gt; and Android 17 is absorbed,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball'' manga, volume 31, chapter 372&lt;/ref&gt; Android 18 nearly being convinced to be absorbed as well by Cell's impersonation of Android 17 until he mistakenly mischaracterizes him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 31, chapter 373&lt;/ref&gt; Androids 18 and 16 are given time to escape thanks to Tenshinhan holding Cell back.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 32, chapter 374&lt;/ref&gt; She and Android 16 hide on an island after this,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball'' manga, volume 32, chapter 375&lt;/ref&gt; where she refuses to leave his side and watches Vegeta's fight against Cell before Krillin approaches her with a remote to turn her off. He destroys it, realizing his love for her, and Android 18 is soon afterwards absorbed by Cell who blinds everyone with {{nihongo4|Solar Flare|太陽拳|Taiyōken}}, allowing him to reach his final form.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 32, chapter 381&lt;/ref&gt; For the next ten days, until the Cell Games tournament that Cell sets up following his disillusion with the strength of both Vegeta and Trunks, 18 remains trapped and unconscious inside of his body. However, a strong blow from [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] causes him to regurgitate her. After Gohan defeats Cell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Save the World|series=Dragon Ball Z|date=June 30, 1993|number=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 222&lt;/ref&gt; she is healed and declines Krillin's advances for the time-being, despite him using the Dragon Balls to have her self-destruct device removed.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=One More Wish|date=July 14, 1993|series=Dragon Ball Z|number=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the alternate-timeline, Androids #18 and #17 are mass murderers whereas the main timeline versions of the pair never killed innocents. They are identical in appearance to the versions of the two in the present timeline, Android 18 wearing the ensemble she wore in the main timeline upon her activation by Dr. Gero. Within the months of their release, shortly after the death of Goku, they kill their timeline's versions of Piccolo, Vegeta, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien and Yajirobe, Gohan managing to escape. Several years later, they kill Gohan and then nearly kill Trunks three years later when he confronts the pair during one of their killing sprees. When Trunks returns from the past, now vastly stronger than he was in their previous encounter as a result of his training, she shows interest in finally ending his life after he confronts her and Android 17, but is killed by him instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Free the Future|number=194|series=Dragon Ball Z|date=July 21, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, she has married Krillin and has a daughter with him named {{nihongo4|Marron|マーロン|Māron}}. She convinces Krillin to participate in the 25th Tenka'ichi Budōkai for the money along with her. Thanks to a lack of interest in being exposed as super-powered, she disguises her strength in hitting the Punching Machine, hitting it lightly and thereby altering who she is matched to fight. During the competition, she competes against Goten and Trunks when the pair enter the competition as {{nihongo4|Mighty Mask|マイティマスク|Maiti Masuku}}, having stolen the identity of another competitor. After the duo reveal themselves by transforming into Super Saiyans, Android 18 wins the match by default,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 38, chapter 453&lt;/ref&gt; advancing to the next round against Mr. Satan, who she outclasses in strength, but throws the fight nonetheless after she secretly arranged to have the prize money shared with him so as not to ruin his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 38, chapter 454&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Majin Boo]] is released, thanks to the energy used by both Goku and Vegeta while the two fought, Android 18 joins the others in searching for the Dragon Balls to resurrect everyone killed by Vegeta and resides at [[Dende (Dragon Ball)|Dende]]'s while taking refuge. After Boo finds them the following day, kills the majority of people on Earth and escapes the Room of Spirit and Time, leaving Gotenks and Piccolo inside, Android 18 is killed alongside her daughter when they are simultaneously turned into chocolate, being eaten by him afterward.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 25, chapter 300&lt;/ref&gt; She is later brought back to life and gives energy to Goku's ''Genki-dama'',&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 26, chapter 320&lt;/ref&gt; successfully destroying Majin Boo.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 26, chapter 322&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, 18 is last seen attending another Tenkaichi Budōkai.&lt;ref&gt;"Even Stronger!! Goku's Dream is Super-Huge". Dragon Ball Z. Episode 291. January 31, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Toriyama's films and ''Dragon Ball Super'' ===
Android 18 appears in four ''Dragon Ball Z'' films; she briefly appears at the beginning of the [[Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13|seventh]];&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly|eleventh]], Android 18 tries to retrieve money from [[Mr. Satan]] that he owed her from their deal that she would lose the tournament so she would not publicly upstage him, later fighting against Bio-Broly along with Krillin, Goten and Trunks and saves civilians from being killed by him;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly''&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|fourteenth]], Android 18 is present at Bulma's birthday party, attempting to fight Beerus following him being enraged by Boo taking his pudding, but being defeated with a single strike to the neck;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|fifteenth]], she shaves Krillin's head before he goes off to fight a resurrected [[Freeza]], being killed after Freeza destroys the planet but having her death undone when the timeline is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2015 |title = Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|format = [[DVD]] |publisher = Funimation|url=http://shop.funimation.com/Resurrection-F-Collectors-Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the events of the last two films, she informs Krillin of a supposed space picnic, leading to his investigation into the matter and she later travels off Earth to watch the tournament between the fighters from her universe and those of Universe 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title="The Match Begins!

''Dragon Ball Super''. Episode 75. January 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Android 18 jumps off and grabs him, telling him that the rest is up to him before kicking him back to the arena while descending to her own elimination. She apologizes to Universe 7 for being eliminated and tells Android 17 he better not lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=All-Out War!

Android #18, along with Android #17, were conceived after Akira Toriyama's former editor [[Kazuhiko Torishima]] expressed disapproval with [[Android 19|Androids #19]] and [[Android 20|#20]] as villains. Following their introduction into the series, Torishima soon afterward became dissatisfied with her and #17 as well, resulting in the creation of [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]].&lt;ref name="ST2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |page=6 |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illustrations"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL　大全集 1 COMPLETE　ILLUSTRATION |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–207 |isbn=4-08-782751-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama stated that he was pleased with Android #18 because she was a type of girl he had not drawn before, and that he liked her slanted eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集 4 WORLD　GUIDE |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=146–147 |isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he revealed her real name was {{nihongo4|Lazuli|ラズリ|Razuri}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Scott|title="Dragon Ball" Creator Reveals Android No. 17 and 18's Names|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/05/02/dragon-ball-creator-reveals-android-no-17-and-18s-names|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yūsuke Watanabe, who wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', had originally written the film to take place at Android #18 and Krillin's wedding, but Akira Toriyama wrote it to take place at [[Bulma]]'s birthday party. Watanabe thought Toriyama made the change because he wanted fans to imagine the wedding for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;DVD &amp; Blu-ray Vision, issue #4, March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In promotional material for ''Battle of Gods'', Toriyama drew her with purple hair.&lt;ref&gt;''V-Jump'', issue #5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dorkly.com/post/75634/dragon-ball-z-facts|title=12 Surprising Facts You Might Not Have Known About Dragon Ball Z|date=September 11, 2015|first=Tristan|last=Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
Android #18, at the time of her introduction, has shoulder length blonde hair, retaining it for most of the series and ''Dragon Ball Super''. Her hairstyle is shown to have changed ten years after the defeat of Majin Buu, becoming shorter. She has this same hairstyle in ''Dragon Ball GT''.

Android #18 is introduced wearing a denim jacket and skirt, dark blue leggings, brown boots and a black shirt with black and white sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 13, chapter 155&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving at Goku's home, she gains a new outfit, first seen when she is depicted going through his wife Chi-Chi's closet; a white short sleeve shirt underneath a black vest, a pair of blue green jeans, black gloves with a ring on the left arm and black flats with orange socks. It is never stated where the outfit originated for nor where she acquired it.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 15, chapter 172&lt;/ref&gt; During the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, she wears a black shirt with black and white sleeves, blue jeans, and black flats with orange socks.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 20, chapter 236&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Battle of Gods'', her clothing changes again; she wears a black shirt with purple sleeves, light blue jeans, a pearl necklace with a thunder pendant embedded on it and black flats with white socks. Her attire remains mostly unchanged for the sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|Resurrection 'F']]'' apart from her no longer wearing the necklace and wearing blue boots. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Android 18 is shown with two different outfits. The first is a red long sleeve turtleneck with black pants and red high heels with earrings. The second is a purple blazer with a pink undershirt and matching pants alongside the same red heels and earrings from earlier.

=== Voice actors ===
[[File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg|thumb|Colleen Clinkenbeard was the voice of Android 18 during Meredith McCoy's hiatus.]]
In the Japanese version of the entire ''Dragon Ball'' anime series and subsequent related media, Android 18 is voiced by [[Miki Itō]].

In English, Android 18 is voiced by [[Meredith McCoy]] in the Funimation dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'' except for ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'', where she is voiced by [[Colleen Clinkenbeard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-07/dragon-ball-z-kai-buu-saga-to-air-on-toonami/.109619|title=Dragon Ball Z Kai's Buu Saga to Air on Toonami|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]],'' Meredith has returned to the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-04/dragon-ball-super-new-opening-sequence-previewed-in-screenshots/.111849|title=Dragon Ball Super's New Opening Sequence Previewed in Screenshots|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abilities ==
Following her conversion into a cyborg, Android 18 possesses superhuman strength, durability, speed and reflexes.&lt;ref name=chapter159&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 159&lt;/ref&gt; She also has the ability to fly.&lt;ref name=chapter157&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 157&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to her conversion into a cyborg, she has eternal youth and unlike the other characters in the series, has energy that is not detectable with ''Ki Sense'',  which causes them to not be directly found using the standard method of identifying a warrior and their strength.

In regards to her strength, upon her introduction, the main timeline version of Android 18 is shown to be able to defeat Vegeta and Trunks in their Super Saiyan forms, Piccolo and Tenshinhan, Trunks stating afterward that she is stronger than her counterpart in his timeline. This effectively makes her one of the stronger characters in the series at the time, Android 17 being said to be slightly stronger and Android 16 having more strength than both of them. Regardless, she still can easily overwhelm all of the heroes, as can her alternate timeline counterpart. However, her advantage in strength falters by the time she encounters Cell who in his first form, after absorbing a large portion of the human population and effectively increasing his power, fights on par with Android 16 and easily subdues both him and Android 18 in his second form. By the time seven years pass after Cell's defeat, Android 18 is now outclassed by Gohan, Vegeta and Piccolo, though still is stronger than the other characters. Since then, Android 18 has been easily bested by Boo and Beerus, though still is one of the most powerful characters on Earth.

She is capable of using the {{nihongo|''Power Blitz''|パワーブリッツ|Pawā Burittsu}}, a sphere energy wave she fires after drawing back her hand which is either pink or blue in color as well as a rapid-fire variation called {{nihongo|''Infiniti Bullet''|インフィニティバレット|Infiniti Barrette}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 420&lt;/ref&gt; Android 18 also possess {{nihongo|High-Pressure Energy Wave|高圧縮エネルギー波|Koasshuku Enerugī-Ha}}. Android 18 after the defeat of Cell gains the ability to use the {{nihongo|''Kienzan''|気円斬||lit. "Energy Disc Razor", renamed "Destructo Disc" in the English anime dub}}, an attack where she creates an electric floating disc by putting her hand in the air, it is also one of Krillin's main techniques. Android 18 has several moves she performs with Android 17. Alongside him, she performs the {{nihongo|''Accel Dance''|アクセルダンス|Akuseru Dansu}}, a move where the two cyborgs relentlessly beat an opponent before knocking them to the ground and following it up with firing their {{nihongo|''Photon Strike''|フォトンストライク|Foton Sutorīku|renamed "Sadistic Dance" in the English anime dub}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks''&lt;/ref&gt; Another attack of the duo is {{nihongo|''Non-stop Violence''|ノンストップバイオレンス|Non Sutoppu Baiorensu}} where the pair simultaneously fire ''Photon Strike'' and ''High-Pressure Energy Wave''.

== Reception ==
Android 18 is a generally well-liked character, praised for her status as the sole female character to physically compete with the male cast for a time as well as her personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://d20crit.com/strong-women-in-geek-culture-part-1-android-18/|title=Strong Women in Geek Culture, Part 1: Android 18|date=October 30, 2015|publisher=d20crit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-8|title=Dragon Ball Z Season 8 DVD Set|date=March 4, 2008|publisher=Anime News Network|first=Theron|last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 poll among Japanese fans, Android 18 was voted the tenth most popular character in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dragon Ball Forever |year=2004 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |isbn=4-08-873702-4|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her relationship with Krillin has also been met with favorability among commentators.

Android 18 has made several appearances in music. Her voice actress [[Meredith McCoy]] recorded vocals for a theme song by [[Bruce Faulconer]] for Android 18, the track being named after her. The American soundtrack also had a 2003 release titled ''Dragonball Z American Soundtrack Best of Dragonball Z: Android 18'', dedicated to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faulconer.com/pages/a18.html|title= ''Android 18''|accessdate= February 2, 2009|publisher= Faulconer Productions Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band Seraphim has a song titled "Android 18", describing her mixture of human and machine. Android 18 is also referenced in the song "Blessing" by [[Chance the Rapper]] when the lyricist raps that he laughs when Krillin mentions blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/the-17-best-1990s-2000s-references-on-chance-the-rappers-new-mixtape-coloring-book|title=The 18 best '90s kid moments on Chance the Rapper's new mixtape|date=May 13, 2016|publisher=USA Today|first=Charlotte|last=Wilder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android 18 also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show "Death Battle". In the episode, her weapons, skills and abilities were analyzed against the "[[Marvel Comics]]" hero "[[Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers)]]". In the end, Android 18 proved herself the better fighter and beat her opponent.

Her first appearance in a ''Dragon Ball'' game was ''[[Dragon Ball Z III: Ressen Jinzōningen]]''. She is a playable character in most ''Dragon Ball Z'' fighting games, including the ''Budokai'' series and ''Raging Blast'' series.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast 2]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Android 18 is the only playable android in both ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai - Another Road]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai - Another Road''&lt;/ref&gt; having an original story in ''Shin Budokai'' where she defeats Freeza, who intended to kidnap her so she could assist him in his acquiring of the Dragon Balls on Namek and has her programming to terminate Goku erased after summoning Shenlong.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 arcade game ''[[Dragon Ball Heroes]]'', after Super 17 is defeated by Android 18, Gohan, Vegeta and Goku, she is forcefully merged with her brother by Towa to power him up against the three Saiyans.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Heroes'' God Mission series fifth mission&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her role as a playable character, she has also served as a boss in other games.&lt;ref&gt;''Legacy of Goku 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 game ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse]]'', Androids 17 and 18 experience an increase in power from Demigra and attack Trunks in the alternate timeline, the possible fatality of Trunks through their encounter causing him to start disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=February 24, 2015|quote='''Supreme Kai of Time:''' Trunks...

'''Anisogamy''' (also called [[heterogamy]]) is the form of [[sexual reproduction]] that involves the union or fusion of two [[gamete]]s, which differ in size and/or form. (The related adjectives are ''anisogamous'' and  ''anisogamic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anisogamy | title=Anisogamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller gamete is considered to be male ([[sperm|sperm cell]]), whereas the larger gamete is regarded as female ([[egg cell]]).

There are several types of anisogamy. Both gametes may be [[flagellum|flagellated]] and therefore [[motility|motile]]. Alternatively, both of the gametes may be non-flagellated. The latter situation occurs in some algae and plants. In the [[red algae|red alga]] ''[[Polysiphonia]]'', non-motile eggs are fertilized by non-motile sperm. In [[flowering plant]]s, the gametes are non-motile cells within [[gametophyte]]s.

The form of anisogamy that occurs in [[animal]]s, including [[human]]s, is [[oogamy]], where a large, non-motile egg ([[ovum]]) is fertilized by a small, motile sperm ([[spermatozoon]]). The egg is optimized for longevity, whereas the small sperm is optimized for motility and speed. The size and resources of the egg cell allow for the production of [[pheromone]]s, which attract the swimming sperm cells.&lt;ref Name=Dusenbery&gt;{{Cite book |last= Dusenbery |first=David B. |year=2009 |title= Living at Micro Scale |chapter=Chapter 20 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |isbn=978-0-674-03116-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anisogamy and sexual dimorphism==
Anisogamy is a fundamental concept of [[sexual dimorphism]] that helps explain phenotypic differences between sexes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;De Lisle SP, Rowe L. Independent evolution of the sexes promotes amphibian diversification. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences''. 2015;282(1803):20142213. {{DOI|10.1098/rspb.2014.2213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most species a male and female sex exist, both of which are optimized for reproductive potential.  Due to their differently sized and shaped gametes, both males and females have developed physiological and behavioral differences that optimize the individual’s [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since most egg laying females typically must bear the offspring and have a more limited reproductive cycle, this typically makes females a [[limiting factor]] in the reproductive success rate of males in a species. This process is also true for females selecting males, and assuming that males and females are selecting for different traits in partners, would result in phenotypic differences between the sexes over many generations. This hypothesis, known as the [[Bateman's principle|Bateman’s Principle]], is used to understand the evolutionary pressures put on males and females due to anisogamy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fritzsche K, Arnqvis G. HOMAGE TO BATEMAN: SEX ROLES PREDICT SEX DIFFERENCES IN SEXUAL SELECTION. ''Evolution'' [serial online]. July 2013;67(7):1926-1936. Available from: Academic Search Alumni Edition, Ipswich, MA. Accessed October 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although this assumption has criticism, it is a generally accepted model for sexual selection within anisogamous species. The selection for different traits depending on sex within the same species is known as sex-specific selection, and accounts for the differing phenotypes found between the sexes of the same species. This sex-specific selection between sexes over time also lead to the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, which assist males and females in reproductive success.

In most species, both sexes choose mates based on the available phenotypes of potential mates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These phenotypes are species specific, resulting in varying strategies for successful sexual reproduction. For example, large males are sexually selected for in elephant seals for their large size helps the male fight off other males, but small males are sexually selected for in spiders for they can mate with the female more quickly while avoiding [[sexual cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Danielson-François, Chueh Hou, Nina Cole, I-Min Tso, Scramble competition for moulting females as a driving force for extreme male dwarfism in spiders, Animal Behaviour, Volume 84, Issue 4, October 2012, Pages 937-945, {{ISSN|0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the large range of sexually selected phenotypes, most anisogamous species follow a set of predictable desirable traits and selective behaviors based on general reproductive success models.

===Female phenotypes===

For [[Internal fertilization|internal fertilizers]], female investment is high in reproduction since they typically expend more energy throughout a single reproductive event.  This can be seen as early as [[oogenesis]], for the female sacrifices gamete number for gamete size to better increase the survival chances of the potential zygote; a process more energetically demanding than [[spermatogenesis]] in males.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Keyne Monro, Dustin J. Marshall Unravelling anisogamy: egg size and ejaculate size mediate selection on morphology in free-swimming sperm&lt;/ref&gt;  Oogenesis occurs in the [[ovary]], a female specific organ that also produces hormones to prepare other female-specific organs for the changes necessary in the reproductive organs to facilitate egg delivery in external fertilizers, and zygote development in internal fertilizers. The egg cell produced is not only large, but sometimes even immobile, requiring contact with the more mobile sperm to instigate fertilization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since this process is very energy-demanding and time consuming for the female, [[mate choice]] is often integrated into the female’s behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females will often be very selective of the males they choose to reproduce with, for the phenotype of the male can be indicative of the male’s physical health and heritable traits.  Females employ mate choice to pressure males into displaying their desirable traits to females through [[Courtship display|courtship]], and if successful, the male gets to reproduce. This encourages males and females of specific species to invest in courtship behaviors as well as traits that can display physical health to a potential mate.  This process, known as [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; results in the development of traits to ease reproductive success rather than individual survival, such as the inflated size of a termite queen. It is also important for females to select against potential mates that may have a [[sexually transmitted infection]], for the disease could not only hurt the female’s reproductive ability, but also damage the resulting offspring.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Davies, N. B., Krebs, J. R., &amp; West, S. A. (2012). ''An introduction to behavioural ecology''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not uncommon in males, females are more associated with [[parental care]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;'''Formhage, L., &amp; Jennions, M. (n.d.). Coevolution of parental investment and sexually selected'''&lt;/ref&gt; Since females are on a more limited reproductive schedule than males, a female often invests more in protecting the offspring to sexual maturity than the male. Like mate choice, the level of parental care varies greatly between species, and is often dependent on the number of offspring produced per sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In most species such as ''Drosophila melanogaster,'' females can utilize [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakadera | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koene | first2 = J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Reproductive strategies in hermaphroditic gastropods: Conceptual and empirical approaches | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 91 | issue = 6| pages = 367–381 | doi = 10.1139/cjz-2012-0272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a process by which the female can store excess sperm from a mate, and fertilize her eggs long after the reproductive event if mating opportunities drop or quality of mates decreases.  By being able to save sperm from more desirable mates, the female gains more control over its own reproductive success, thus allowing for the female to be more selective of males as well as making the timing of fertilization potentially more frequent if males are scarce.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Male phenotypes===

For males of all species, the sperm cells they produce are optimized for ensuring [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of the female egg. These sperm cells are created through spermatogenesis, a form of [[gametogenesis]] that focuses on developing the most possible gametes per sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Spermatogenesis occurs in the [[Testicle|testes]], a male specific organ that is also produces hormones that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics. Since the male’s gametes are energetically cheap and abundant in every ejaculation, a male can greatly increase his sexual success by mating far more frequently than the female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Sperm, unlike egg cells, are also mobile, allowing for the sperm to swim towards the egg through the female’s sexual organs.  [[Sperm competition]] is also a major factor in the development of sperm cells.  Only one sperm can fertilize an egg, and since females can potentially reproduce with more than one male before fertilization occurs, producing sperm cells that are faster, more abundant, and more viable than that produced by other males can give a male reproductive advantage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since females are often the limiting factor in a species reproductive success, males are often expected by the females to search and compete for the female, known as [[intraspecific competition]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This can be seen in organisms such as bean beetles, as the male that searches for females more frequently is often more successful at finding mates and reproducing.  In species undergoing this form of selection, a fit male would be one that is fast, has more refined sensory organs, and spatial awareness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some secondary sex characteristics are not only meant for attracting mates, but also for competing with other males for copulation opportunities.  Some structures, such as antlers in deer, can provide benefits to the male’s reproductive success by providing a weapon to prevent rival males from achieving reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, other structures such as the large colorful tail feathers found in male peacocks, are a result of [[Fisherian runaway|Fisherian Runaway]] as well as several more species specific factors.  Due to females selecting for specific traits in males, over time, these traits are exaggerated to the point where they could hinder the male’s survivability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  However, since these traits greatly benefit sexual selection, their usefulness in providing more mating opportunities overrides the possibility that the trait could lead to a shortening of its lifespan through predation or starvation.  These desirable traits extend beyond physical body parts, and often extend into courtship behavior and [[nuptial gift]]s as well.

Although some behaviors in males are meant to work within the parameters of cryptic female choice, some male traits work against it.  Strong enough males, in some cases, can force themselves upon a female, forcing fertilization and overriding female choice.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friesen | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Uhrig | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Mason | first3 = R. T. | last4 = Brennan | first4 = P. L. R. | year = 2016 | title = Female behaviour and the interaction of male and female genital traits mediate sperm transfer during mating | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 952–964 | doi = 10.1111/jeb.12836 | pmid = 26809830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this can often be dangerous for the female, an [[Evolutionary arms race|Evolutionary Arms Race]] between the sexes is often an outcome.

==Evolution==
Anisogamy is the phenomenon of [[fertilization]] of large gametes ([[egg cells]], ova) by (or with) small [[gametes]] ([[sperm]] cells: spermatozoa or spermatia). Gamete size difference is the fundamental difference between [[female]]s and [[male]]s.

The three main theories for the evolution of anisogamy are gamete competition, gamete limitation, and intracellular conflicts, but the last of these three is not well supported by current evidence.&lt;ref name="Lessels09"&gt;Lessells C.M., Snook R.R., Hosken D.J. 2009 The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sperm: selection for a small, motile gamete mating type. In Sperm biology: An evolutionary perspective (eds. Birkhead T.R., Hosken D.J., Pitnick S.), pp. 43-67. London, Academic press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both gamete competition and gamete limitation assume that anisogamy originated through disruptive selection acting on an ancestral isogamous population with external fertilization, due to a trade-off between larger gamete number and gamete size (which in turn affects zygote survival), because the total resource one individual can invest in reproduction is assumed to be fixed.&lt;ref name="LehtonenParker14"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lehtonen | first1 = J. | last2 = Parker | first2 = G.A. | year = 2014 | title = Gamete competition, gamete limitation, and the evolution of the two sexes | url = | journal = Molecular Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 12| pages = 1161–1168 | doi = 10.1093/molehr/gau068 | pmid = 25323972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first formal, mathematical theory proposed to explain the evolution of anisogamy was based on gamete limitation:&lt;ref name="Kalmus32"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalmus | first1 = H | year = 1932 | title = Über den Erhaltungswert der phänotypischen (morphologischen) Anisogamie und die Entstehung der ersten Geschlechtsunterschiede | url = | journal = Biol Zentralbl | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 716–736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this model assumed that natural selection would lead to gamete sizes that result in the largest population-wide number of successful fertilizations.&lt;ref name="Kalmus32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scudo | first1 = F.M. | year = 1967 | title = Adaptive value of sexual dimorphism - I, anisogamy | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 285–291 | doi=10.2307/2406676| pmid = 28556138 | jstor = 2406676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dusenbery | first1 = D.B. | year = 2000 | title = Selection for high gamete encounter rates explains the success of male and female mating types | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 202 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.1999.1017| pmid = 10623494 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.408.1475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is assumed that a certain amount of resources provided by the gametes are needed for the survival of the resulting zygote, and that there is a trade-off between the size and number of gametes, then this optimum was shown to be one where both small (male) and large (female) gametes are produced. However, these early models assume that natural selection acts mainly at the population level, something that is today known to be a very problematic assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Williams G.C., 1966, "Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thoughts". Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mathematical model to explain the evolution of anisogamy via individual level selection, and one that became widely accepted was the theory of gamete or sperm competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Baker | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Smith | first3 = V.G.F. | year = 1972 | title = The origin and evolution of gamete dimorphism and the male-female phenomenon | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 529–553 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(72)90007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | year = 1978 | title = Selection on non-random fusion of gametes during evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 1–28 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(78)90177-7| pmid = 567721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | year = 1982 | title = Why are there so many tiny sperm? Sperm competition and the maintenance of two sexes | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 96 | issue = 2| pages = 281–294 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, selection happens at the individual level: those individuals that produce more (but smaller) gametes also gain a larger proportion of fertilizations simply because they produce a larger number of gametes that 'seek out' those of the larger type. However, because zygotes formed from larger gametes have better survival prospects, this process can again lead to the divergence of gametes sizes into large and small (female and male) gametes. The end result is one where it seems that the numerous, small gametes compete for the large gametes that are tasked with providing maximal resources for the offspring.

Some recent theoretical work has challenged the gamete competition theory, by showing that gamete limitation by itself can lead to the divergence of gamete sizes even under selection at the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Sethian | first2 = J.A. | year = 1985 | title = Gamete motion, search, and the evolution of anisogamy, oogamy, and chemotaxis | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1fw153sc| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 125 | issue = 1| pages = 74–101 | doi=10.1086/284329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iyer | first1 = P. | last2 = Roughgarden | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Gametic conflict versus contact in the evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 461–472 | doi = 10.1016/j.tpb.2008.02.002 | pmid = 18485981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = J.-N. | year = 2010 | title = Cooperation and the evolution of anisogamy | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 264 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.01.019 | pmid=20097207}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is possible, it has also been shown that gamete competition and gamete limitation are the ends of a continuum of selective pressures, and they can act separately or together depending on the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lehtonen | first1 = J. | last2 = Kokko | first2 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Two roads to two sexes: unifying gamete competition and gamete limitation in a single model of anisogamy evolution | url = | journal = Behav Ecol Sociobiol | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 445–459 | doi = 10.1007/s00265-010-1116-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These selection pressures also act in the same direction (to increase gamete numbers at the expense of size) and at the same level (individual selection). Theory also suggests that gamete limitation could only have been the dominant force of selection for the evolutionary origin of the sexes under quite limited circumstances, and the presence on average of just one competitor can makes the 'selfish' evolutionary force of gamete competition stronger than the 'cooperative' force of gamete limitation even if gamete limitation is very acute (approaching 100% of eggs remaining unfertilized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Lehtonen | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Gamete evolution and sperm numbers: sperm competition versus sperm limitation | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 281 | issue = 1791| page = 1791 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.0836 | pmid=25100694 | pmc=4132674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is then a relatively sound theory base for understanding this fundamental transition from isogamy to anisogamy in the evolution of reproduction, which is predicted to be associated with the transition to multicellularity. In fact, Hanschen et al (2018) demonstrate that anisogamy evolved from isogamous multicellular ancestors and that anisogamy would subsequently drive secondary sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some comparative empirical evidence for the gamete competition theories exists,&lt;ref name="Lessels09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowlton | first1 = N | year = 1974 | title = A note on the evolution of gamete dimorphism | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 283–285 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker G.A., 2011, "The origin and maintenance of two sexes (anisogamy), and their gamete sizes by gamete competition". ''The evolution of anisogamy'' (eds. Togashi T., Cox P.A.), pp. 17-74. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is difficult to use this evidence to fully tease apart the competition and limitation theories because their testable predictions are similar.&lt;ref name="LehtonenParker14"/&gt; It has also been claimed that some of the organisms used in such comparative studies do not fit the theoretical assumptions well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randerson | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Hurst | first2 = L.D. | year = 2001 | title = The uncertain evolution of the sexes | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 571–579 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02270-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A valuable model system to the study of the evolution of anisogamy is the volvocine algae, which group of [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]] is quite unique for its extant species exhibit a diversity of mating systems ([[isogamy]] and anisogamy) in addition to its extremes in both [[Unicellular organism|unicellularity]] and [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] with a diversity of forms in species of intermediate ranges of sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferris|first=Patrick|last2=Olson|first2=Bradley J.S.C.|last3=De Hoff|first3=Peter L.|last4=Douglass|first4=Stephen|last5=Diaz-Cano|first5=David Casero|last6=Prochnik|first6=Simon|last7=Geng|first7=Sa|last8=Rai|first8=Rhitu|last9=Grimwood|first9=Jane|date=2010-04-16|title=Evolution of an Expanded Sex Determining Locus in Volvox|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880461/|journal=Science|volume=328|issue=5976|pages=351–354|doi=10.1126/science.1186222|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2880461|pmid=20395508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine algae have been closely studied to understand the trajectories of such diversified reproductive systems,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Togashi|first=Tatsuya|last2=Bartelt|first2=John L.|last3=Yoshimura|first3=Jin|last4=Tainaka|first4=Kei-ichi|last5=Cox|first5=Paul Alan|date=2012|title=Evolutionary trajectories explain the diversified evolution of isogamy and anisogamy in marine green algae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=34|pages=13692–13697|doi=10.1073/pnas.1203495109|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3427103|pmid=22869736}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolution of sex and mating types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herron|first=Matthew D.|date=2016|title=Origins of multicellular complexity: Volvox and the volvocine algae|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1213–1223|doi=10.1111/mec.13551|issn=1365-294X|pmc=5765864|pmid=26822195}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the adaptiveness and stability of anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=P.

'''''Anybody's Nightmare''''' is a single [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] [[crime drama]] [[film]], based on the true story of the imprisonment of Sheila Bowler, that broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 7 October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/04/gender.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred [[Patricia Routledge]] as Bowler, a 62-year-old music teacher who was wrongly arrested, tried and convicted for the murder of her husband's 89-year-old aunt Florence Jackson in 1993 after she drowned in the [[river Brede]] in [[East Sussex]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotimes.com/film/znyq/anybodys-nightmare/&lt;/ref&gt; The film chronicles the investigation, [[trial]] and the subsequent four years of Sheila's sentence in [[Holloway Prison|Holloway]] and [[Bullwood Hall|Bullwood Prison]] before her successful appeal in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/carlton-makes-film-of-sheila-bowler-case/1168924.article Carlton makes film of Sheila Bowler case], ''Broadcast Now'', 1 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film depicts Sheila's son Simon (Thomas Arnold) and daughter Jane (Georgina Sutcliffe)'s quest for justice, as they are aided by friend of the family, Angela Devlin (Nicola Redmond), whose real-life book on the case, first published in 1998, was the basis of the film. The film also co-starred [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]] as prosecution barrister Anthony Glass QC, alongside [[Malcolm Sinclair (actor)|Malcolm Sinclair]] as Nicholas Purnell QC and William Armstrong as Jeremy Roberts QC, Bowler's defence lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b85de2415&lt;/ref&gt; The initial broadcast of the film drew 9.11 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30/&lt;/ref&gt; The film is often repeated on satellite and cable channels [[True Movies|True Movies 1]] and [[True Movies 2]], with the occasional broadcast on [[True Entertainment]]. Notably, the film is Patricia Routledge's last acting role on television to date.

==Plot==
Sheila Bowler ([[Patricia Routledge]]) is a 62-year-old music teacher living in [[Rye, East Sussex]]. One weekend, she goes to collect her late husband's auntie, Florence Jackson (Jean Ainslie), from the care home where she is living. On the drive back home, Sheila's car suffers a puncture. She makes the decision to leave Florence in the car to walk to a nearby cottage to call for help. Upon her return, Sheila discovers that Florence has disappeared. The police are called, but despite an overnight search, no trace of Florence is discovered. Early the next day, divers pull a body from the nearby [[river Brede]], which is confirmed to be that of Florence.

[[File:Carbone lewis.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Lewis structure]] of a [[carbon]] atom, showing its four [[valence electrons]]]]

[[Carbon]] is a key component of all known [[life]] on [[Earth]], representing approximately 45-50% of all dry biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/forestry/17111/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[molecule]]s are made up of [[carbon]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] with other [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] and frequently also with [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]]. Carbon is abundant on Earth. It is also lightweight and relatively small in size, making it easier for enzymes to manipulate carbon molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is frequently assumed in [[astrobiology]] that if life exists elsewhere in the [[universe]], it will also be carbon-based.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics refer to this assumption as [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref name =darling&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/carbon-based_life.html |title=Carbon-based life |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=David|last=Darling |publisher=Encyclopedia of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;"There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes." {{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorus", per [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 2008 lecture, "carbon [...] has the richest chemistry." &lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Hawking|title=Life in the Universe, 50th anniversary celebration of NASA|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/05/stephen-hawking-on-non-carbon-based-alien-life.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important characteristics of carbon as a basis for the [[chemistry]] of life are, that it has four valence bonds, and that the energy required to make or break a bond is at an appropriate level for building molecules, which are stable and reactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms; this allows the building of arbitrarily long complex molecules and [[polymers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other candidates==
There are not many other elements which even appear to be promising candidates for supporting life, for example, processes such as [[metabolism]]. The most frequently suggested alternative is [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is in the same group in the [[Periodic Table]] of [[chemical element|elements]], and has four [[valence bond theory|valence bonds]], and bonds to itself, generally in the form of [[crystal lattice]]s rather than long chains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is considerably more electropositive than carbon. Silicon compounds do not readily [[Recombination_(chemistry)|recombine]] into different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support lifelike processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The most notable groups of chemicals used in the processes of living organisms include:

* [[Protein]]s, which are the building blocks from which the structures of living organisms are constructed (this includes almost all [[enzyme]]s, which [[catalyst|catalyse]] organic chemical reactions)
* [[Nucleic acid]]s, which carry [[Genetics|genetic]] information
* [[Carbohydrate]]s, which store energy in a form that can be used by living [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* [[Lipid]]s, which also store energy, but in a more concentrated form, and which may be stored for extended periods in the bodies of animals

==Fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Silicon has been a theme of non-carbon-based-life since it is somewhat similar to carbon in its chemical characteristics.  
In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], when man-made machines cross from non-living to living, this new form would be an example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as "silicon-based life". Another example of "silicon-based life" is the episode "The Devil in the Dark" from [[Star Trek: The Original Series]], in which a living rock creature's biochemistry is based on silicon. Also in The X-Files episode "Firewalker" where silicon based organism was discovered in a volcano.

In the [[2010_(film)|movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1984)]] a character argues, "Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002895/quotes|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This quote may be the basis of [[Steve Jobs]]'s quip when he introduced [[Carbon (API)|Carbon within MacOS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC '98|url=http://www.noteskey.com/events/1998_05.html|website=NotesKey|date = May 11, 1998|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Carbon. All life forms will be based on it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7683">A '''chemically defined medium''' is a [[growth medium]] suitable for the [[in vitro]] [[cell culture]] of [[human cells|human]] or [[animal cells]] in which all of the chemical components are known. Standard cell culture media are commonly supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination.

There is a clear distinction between serum-free media and chemically defined media. Serum-free media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum albumin (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, chemically defined media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a chemically defined medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either [[fetal bovine serum]], [[bovine serum albumin]] or [[human serum albumin]]. To achieve this, chemically defined media is commonly supplemented with recombinant versions of albumin and growth factors, usually derived from rice or ''E. coli'', or synthetic chemical such as the polymer [[polyvinyl alcohol]] which can reproduce some of the functions of BSA/HSA.

The constituents of a chemically defined media include: a basal media (such as DMEM, F12, or RPMI 1640, containing amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, buffers, antioxidants and energy sources), which is supplemented with recombinant albumin, chemically defined lipids, recombinant [[insulin]] and/or zinc, recombinant [[transferrin]] or iron, [[selenium]] and an antioxidant [[thiol]] such as [[2-mercaptoethanol]] or [[1-thioglycerol]]. Chemically defined media that are designed for the cultivation of cells in suspension additionally contain suitable [[Surfactant|surfactants]] such as [[Poloxamer|poloxamers]] in order to reduce shear stress caused by shaking and stirring.

==The advantages of chemically defined media==

* Avoidance of batch to batch variation of bovine serum or albumin, which causes inconsistency in growth-promoting properties. 
* Low protein content, which can hinder product purification. 
* Elimination of the risk of contaminants—viruses, mycoplasma, prions from animal-derived products which may be transmitted to the end product used by humans, e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. 
* Elimination of factors that may interfere with hormones or growth factors when studying their interaction with cells. 
* Removal of concerns regarding the limited availability of fetal bovine serum, with periods of world shortages. 
* Reduced cost: fetal calf serum can account for up to 85% of the over-all cost of the medium when calculated for large-scale cultures.  
* There are increasing concerns about animal suffering inflicted during serum collection that add an ethical imperative to move away from the use of serum wherever possible.

Chemically defined media also allows researchers who are studying in the field of cell physiology (especially extracellular) and or molecule–cell interactions to eliminate any variables that may arise due to the effects of unknown components in the medium. 

==Classes of media==
Animal culture media can be divided into six subsets based on the level of defined media (Jayme and Smith, 2000): From lowest definition to highest these are:

* Serum-containing media (commonly 10-20% FBS)
* Reduced-serum media (commonly 1-5% FBS)
* Serum-free media (synonymous with Defined media) 
* Protein-free media (no protein but contains undefined peptides from plant hydrolysates)
* Chemically-defined media (with only recombinant proteins and/or hormones)
* Protein-free, chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents, but can contain synthetic peptides/hormones)
* Peptide-free, protein-free chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents)

==Misuse of the term chemically defined media==
The term chemically defined media is often misused in the literature to refer to serum albumin-containing media. The term 'defined media' can also be used to describe this type of media. Media formulations containing the media supplement B27 (supplied by [[Invitrogen]]) are often erroneously referred to as chemically defined media (e.g. Yao et al., 2006) despite this product containing bovine serum albumin (Chen et al., 2008) using the above definitions this type of media is referred to as serum-free media. Peptide-free, protein-free, chemically defined media are rarely successfully formulated except for [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|CHO]] and insect cells.

==Other variants of serum-free/defined media include==
Animal protein-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, but potentially animal-derived insulin and lipids.

Xeno-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, human insulin, and chemically defined lipids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14933">'''Computational auditory scene analysis''' (CASA) is the study of [[auditory scene analysis]] by computational means.&lt;ref name="wangbrown06"&gt;Wang, D. L. and Brown, G. J. (Eds.) (2006). ''Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles, algorithms and applications''. IEEE Press/Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, CASA systems are "machine listening" systems that aim to separate mixtures of sound sources in the same way that human listeners do. CASA differs from the field of [[blind signal separation]] in that it is (at least to some extent) based on the mechanisms of the human [[auditory system]], and thus uses no more than two microphone recordings of an acoustic environment.  It is related to the [[cocktail party problem]].

==Principles==
Since CASA serves to model functionality parts of the auditory system, it is necessary to view parts of the biological auditory system in terms of known physical models. Consisting of three areas, the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory periphery acts as a complex transducer that converts sound vibrations into action potentials in the auditory nerve.  The [[outer ear]] consists of the external ear, [[ear canal]] and the [[ear drum]]. The outer ear, like an acoustic funnel, helps locating the sound source.&lt;ref name = "warren"&gt;Warren, R.(1999). ''Auditory Perception: A New Analysis and Synthesis''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The ear canal acts as a resonant tube (like an organ pipe) to amplify frequencies between 2–5.5&amp;nbsp;kHz with a maximum amplification of about 11&amp;nbsp;dB occurring around 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name = "wiener"&gt;Wiener, F.(1947), "On the diffraction of a progressive wave by the human head". ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', '''19''', 143&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; As the organ of hearing, the [[cochlea]] consists of two membranes, Reissner’s and the [[basilar membrane]]. The basilar membrane moves to audio stimuli through the specific stimulus frequency matches the resonant frequency of a particular region of the basilar membrane. The movement the basilar membrane displaces the inner hair cells in one direction, which encodes a half-wave rectified signal of action potentials in the spiral ganglion cells.  The axons of these cells make up the auditory nerve, encoding the rectified stimulus. The auditory nerve responses select certain frequencies, similar to the basilar membrane. For lower frequencies, the fibers exhibit "phase locking". Neurons in higher auditory pathway centers are tuned to specific stimuli features, such as periodicity, sound intensity, amplitude and frequency modulation.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; 
There are also neuroanatomical associations of ASA through the posterior cortical areas, including the posterior superior temporal lobes and the [[posterior cingulate]].  Studies have found that impairments in ASA and segregation and grouping operations are affected in patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name = "goll"&gt;Goll, J., Kim, L. (2012), "Impairments of auditory scene analysis in Alzheimer's disease", ''Brain'' '''135 (1)''', 190&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Architecture==

===Cochleagram===
As the first stage of CASA processing, the cochleagram creates a time-frequency representation of the input signal. By mimicking the components of the outer and middle ear, the signal is broken up into different frequencies that are naturally selected by the cochlea and hair cells. Because of the frequency selectivity of the basilar membrane, a [[filter bank]] is used to model the membrane, with each filter associated with a specific point on the basilar membrane.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

Since the hair cells produce spike patterns, each filter of the model should also produce a similar spike in the [[impulse response]].  The use of a [[gammatone filter]] provides an impulse response as the product of a gamma function and a tone. The output of the gammatone filter can be regarded as a measurement of the basilar membrane displacement. Most CASA systems represent the firing rate in the auditory nerve rather than a spike-based.  To obtain this, the filter bank outputs are half-wave rectified followed by a square root.  (Other models, such as automatic gain controllers have been implemented). The half-rectified wave is similar to the displacement model of the hair cells. 
Additional models of the hair cells include the Meddis hair cell model which pairs with the gammatone filter bank, by modeling the hair cell transduction.&lt;ref name = "meddis"&gt;Meddis, R., Hewitt, M., Shackleton, T. (1990). "Implementation details of a computational model of the inner hair-cell/auditory nerve synapse". ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America''  '''87(4)''' 1813&amp;ndash;1816.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the assumption that there are three reservoirs of transmitter substance within each hair cell, and the transmitters are released in proportion to the degree of displacement to the basilar membrane, the release is equated with the probability of a spike generated in the nerve fiber.  This model replicates many of the nerve responses in the CASA systems such as rectification, compression, spontaneous firing, and adaptation.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

===Correlogram===
Important model of pitch perception by unifying 2 schools of pitch theory:&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

* Place theories (emphasizing the role of resolved harmonics)
* Temporal theories (emphasizing the role of unresolved harmonics)

The correlogram is generally computed in the time domain by autocorrelating the simulated auditory nerve firing activity to the output of each filter channel.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;  By pooling the autocorrelation across frequency, the position of peaks in the summary correlogram corresponds to the perceived pitch.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

===Cross-Correlogram===
Because the ears receive audio signals at different times, the sound source can be determined by using the delays retrieved from the two ears.&lt;ref name = "jeffress"&gt;[[Lloyd A. Jeffress|Jeffress, L.A.]] (1948). "A place theory of sound localization". ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', '''41''' 35&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; By cross-correlating the delays from the left and right channels (of the model), the coincided peaks can be categorized as the same localized sound, despite their temporal location in the input signal.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; 
The use of interaural cross-correlation mechanism has been supported through physiological studies, paralleling the arrangement of neurons in the auditory [[midbrain]].&lt;ref name = "yin"&gt;Yin, T., Chan, J. (1990). "Interaural time sensitivity in medial superior olive of cat"  ''Journal Neurophysiology'', '''64(2)''' 465&amp;ndash;488.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-Frequency Masks===
To segregate the sound source, CASA systems mask the cochleagram.  This mask, sometimes a [[Wiener filter]], weighs the target source regions and suppresses the rest.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; The physiological motivation behind the mask results from the auditory perception where sound is rendered inaudible by a louder sound.&lt;ref name = "moore"&gt;Moore, B. (2003). ''An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing'' (5th ed.). Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resynthesis===
A resynthesis pathway reconstructs an audio signal from a group of segments.  Achieved by inverting the cochleagram, high quality resynthesized speech signals can be obtained.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Monaural CASA===
Monaural sound separation first began with separating voices based on frequency.  There were many early developments based on segmenting different speech signals through frequency.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; Other models followed on this process, by the addition of adaption through state space models, batch processing, and prediction-driven architecture.&lt;ref name = "Ellis"&gt;Ellis, D (1996). "Predication-Driven Computational Auditory Scene Analysis". PhD thesis, MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of CASA has improved the robustness of ASR and speech separation systems.&lt;ref name = "li"&gt;Li, P., Guan, Y. (2010). "Monaural speech separation based on MASVQ and CASA for robust speech recognition" ''Computer Speech and Language'', '''24''', 30&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binaural CASA===
Since CASA is modeling human auditory pathways, binaural CASA systems better the human model by providing sound localization, auditory grouping and robustness to reverberation by including 2 spatially separated microphones. With methods similar to cross-correlation, systems are able to extract the target signal from both input microphones.&lt;ref name = "bodden"&gt;Bodden, M. (1993). "Modeling human sound-source locations and cocktail party effect" ''Acta Acustica''  '''1''' 43&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "lyon"&gt;Lyon, R.(1983). "A computational model of binaural locations and separation".  ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing'' 1148&amp;ndash;1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural CASA Models===
Since the biological auditory system is deeply connected with the actions of neurons, CASA systems also incorporated neural models within the design. Two different models provide the basis for this area. Malsburg and Schneider proposed a [[neural network]] model with oscillators to represent features of different streams (synchronized and desynchronized).&lt;ref name = "vdm"&gt;Von der Malsburg, C., Schneider, W. (1986). "A neural cocktail-party processor". ''Biological Cybernetics''  '''54''' 29&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang also presented a model using a network of excitatory units with a global inhibitor with delay lines to represent the auditory scene within the time-frequency.&lt;ref name = "wangseg"&gt;Wang, D.(1994). "Auditory stream segregation based on oscillatory correlation". ''Proceedings of the IEEE International Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processings'', 624&amp;ndash;632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wangprim"&gt;Wang, D.(1996), "Primitive auditory segregation based on oscillatory correlation". ''Cognitive Science'' '''20''', 409&amp;ndash;456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of Musical Audio Signals===
Typical approaches in CASA systems starts with segmenting sound-sources into individual constituents, in its attempts to mimic the physical auditory system.  However, there is evidence that the brain does not necessarily process audio input separately, but rather as a mixture.&lt;ref name = "bregman2"&gt;Bregman, A (1995). "Constraints on computational models of auditory scene analysis as derived from human perception". ''The Journal of the Acoustical Society of Japan (E)'', '''16(3)''', 133&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of breaking the audio signal down to individual constituents, the input is broken down of by higher level descriptors, such as chords, bass and melody, beat structure, and chorus and phrase repetitions. These descriptors run into difficulties in real-world scenarios, with monaural and binaural signals.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; Also, the estimation of these descriptors is highly dependent on the cultural influence of the musical input. For example, within Western music, the melody and bass influences the identity of the piece, with the core formed by the melody.  By distinguishing the frequency responses of melody and bass, a fundamental frequency can be estimated and filtered for distinction.&lt;ref name = "Goto"&gt;Goto, M.(2004). "A real-time music-scene-description system: predominate-F0 estimation for detecting melody and bass lines in real-world audio signals". ''Speech Communication'', '''43''', 311&amp;ndash;329.&lt;/ref&gt; Chord detection can be implemented through pattern recognition, by extracting low-level features describing harmonic content.&lt;ref name = "zb"&gt;Zbigniew, R., Wieczorkowska, A.(2010). "Advances in Music Information Retrieval". ''Studies in Computational Intelligence'',  '''274''' 119&amp;ndash;142.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The techniques utilized in music scene analysis can also be applied to [[speech recognition]], and other environmental sounds.&lt;ref name = "masudak"&gt;Masuda-Katsuse, I (2001). "A new method for speech recognition in the presence of non-stationary, unpredictable and high-level noise". ''Proceedings Eurospeech'', 1119&amp;ndash;1122.&lt;/ref&gt; Future bodies of work include a top-down integration of audio signal processing, such as a real-time beat-tracking system and expanding out of the signal processing realm with the incorporation of auditory psychology and physiology.&lt;ref name = "gotodrum"&gt;Goto, M (2001). "An Audio-based real-time beat tracking system for music with or without drum sounds". ''Journal of New Music Research'', '''30(2)''': 159&amp;ndash;171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural Perceptual Modeling===
While many models consider the audio signal as a complex combination of different frequencies, modeling the auditory system can also require consideration for the neural components.  By taking a holistic process, where a stream (of feature-based sounds) correspond to neuronal activity distributed in many brain areas, the perception of the sound could be mapped and modeled. Two different solutions have been proposed to the binding of the audio perception and the area in the brain.  Hierarchical coding models many cells to encode all possible combinations of features and objects in the auditory scene.&lt;ref name = "decharm"&gt;deCharms, R., Merzenich, M, (1996). "Primary cortical representation of sounds by the coordination of action-potential timing". ''Nature'', '''381''', 610&amp;ndash;613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wangtime"&gt;Wang, D.(2005). "The time dimension of scene analysis". ''IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks'', '''16(6)''', 1401&amp;ndash;1426.&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal or oscillatory correlation addressing the binding problem by focusing on the synchrony and desynchrony between neural oscillations to encode the state of binding among the auditory features.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; These two solutions are very similar to the debacle between place coding and temporal coding. While drawing from modeling neural components, another phenomenon of ASA comes into play with CASA systems: the extent of modeling neural mechanisms.  The studies of CASA systems have involved modeling some known mechanisms, such as the bandpass nature of cochlear filtering and random auditory nerve firing patterns, however, these models may not lead to finding new mechanisms, but rather give an understanding of purpose to the known mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "bregman"&gt;Bregman, A.(1990). ''Auditory Scene Analysis''. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">A '''cooling board''' was a perforated wooden platform on which a dead body would be temporarily stored and prepared for a funeral. Ice was placed beneath it to keep the body chilled, slowing the decomposition process. Holes in the cooling board, which could be made of cane latticework rather than a solid wooden plank, allowed blood and other fluids to drain from the body. It could also be used to display the body for a viewing if the casket was not delivered in time.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Afterlife: Encounters in the Customs of Mourning|author=Kate Sweeney|pages=4–5|publisher=University of George Press|date=2014|ISBN=978-0-8203-4600-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal embalming tables replaced cooling boards as modern refrigeration became available.

The cooling board is referred to in a number of [[blues]] songs, such as "Cooling Board Blues" by [[Blind Willie McTell]].&lt;ref name="Sweeney" /&gt;

[[Son House]] also makes a reference to a cooling board in his "[[Death Letter]]".

:''So, I grabbed up my suitcase, and took off down the road.''
:''When I got there she was layin on a coolin' board.''

A cooling board is also found in a song, "Thank You, Master (For My Soul)",  by the late [[Donnie Hathaway]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricsbox.com/donny-hathaway-lyrics-thank-you-master-for-my-soul-dmwlvqr.html "Thank You, Master (For My Soul)"] at Lyricsbox&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:'' 'cause the walls of my room was not the walls of my grave
:''my bed was not my cooling board (y'all don't know what i'm talkin' 'bout)''

Benjamin B. French witnessed Abraham Lincoln's remains, after transfer from the Peterson House to the White House, being "taken from the box in which they were enclosed, all limp and warm, and laid upon the floor, and then stretched upon the cooling board."&lt;ref&gt;Marling (2008) ''Ice: Great Moments in the History of Hard, Cold Water'' {{ISBN|978-0-87351-628-0}}.

The '''credibility thesis''' is a proposed [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] theoretical framework for understanding how societal [[institution]]s or social rules come about and evolve. It posits that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form.&lt;ref name=ho2014&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=September 2014 |title= The "credibility thesis" and its application to property rights: (In)Secure land tenure, conflict and social welfare in China |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837713001889 |journal= Land Use Policy |publisher= |volume=40 |issue= |pages=13–27 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.09.019 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, institutional development is [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]] and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneously ordered]] and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility,&lt;ref name=Grabel&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grabel |first= Ilene |last2= |first2= |date= |title= The political economy of 'policy credibility': the new-classical macroeconomics and the remaking of emerging economies |url= http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/1.abstract |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1093/cje/24.1.1|access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve rather than their theoretical or ideological form. The credibility thesis can be applied to explain, for example, why purported institutional improvements do not take hold as part of [[structural adjustment]] programs, while other economies in the developing world deliver growth despite absence of clear and strong market mechanisms such as indisputable private property rights or clearly delineated and registered [[land tenure]].

== Postulates of the credibility thesis ==
According to the credibility thesis, institutional persistence, meaning the survival and change of particular institutions through time is determined by the function of the institution and [[Actant|actors]]' expectations of the institution to play that function. The Credibility Thesis has put forward “that what ultimately determines the performance of institutions is not their form in terms of formality, privatization, or security, but their spatially and temporally defined function. In different wording, institutional function presides over form; the former can be expressed by its credibility, that is, the perceived social support at a given time and space.”&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In this sense, the thesis predicts that institutions that persist over time likely are credible, thus functional. If not, they would have changed or gone extinct. This principle holds for whatever form an institution may assume, regardless whether it is formal or informal, public or private, secure or insecure.

A typical example is [[sharecropping]], which has been regarded as economically inefficient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Issawi|first= Charles|last2= |first2= |date= |title= Farm Output under Fixed Rents and Share Tenancy|url= |journal= Land Economics|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 74–77|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "second-best".&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1974 p=219"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stiglitz | first=Joseph E. | title=Incentives and Risk Sharing in Sharecropping | journal=The Review of Economic Studies | publisher=Oxford University Press | volume=41 | issue=2 | year=1974 | page=219 | url=https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2296714 | doi=10.2307/2296714 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its persistence throughout time has challenged this premise,&lt;ref name="Byres 1983 pp. 7–40"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Byres | first=T.

Changes in institutional arrangements, such as changes from informal [[land tenure]] and [[Housing#Informal housing in developing countries|informal housing]] to a formalized real estate market or gradually declining prevalence of formal marriage or [[Custom (law)|customary rights]], are brought about by rule-making in a multi-actor playing field, where even the strongest actors cannot fully dictate institutional arrangements.In effect, when powerful actors exogenously impose institutions that contradict the evolutionary flow of endogenously emerged functions, the newly designed arrangements will invariably develop into "empty institutions" and "non credible" institutions.&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1145–1176"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Empty institutions, non-credibility and pastoralism: China's grazing ban, mining and ethnicity | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Taylor &amp; Franci | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1145–1176 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1239617 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1239617 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An institution that appears stable and unchanging over time is often alleged to exist in an equilibrium wherein actors' conflicting interests on what form the institution should take are locked in a [[frozen conflict]]. For example, whether land holdings should be registered in a cadastre or if informal exchange of payment for use rights can suffice as confirmation of a land sale, constitute two possible institutional arrangements and either can be beneficial to different actors' interests. That no actor perceives an immediate opportunity to change the arrangement to their advantage is a sign of the credibility of the assignment and the source of the equilibrium of institutional arrangement. However, in actuality disequilibrium characterises institutional arrangements and equilibrium is transitory and rare. What is perceived as persistence of institutions is, in fact, the occurrence of infinitesimally small institutional changes over time under a veneer of apparent stability. In this context, the credibility thesis is predicated upon the notion of dynamic disequilibrium. It is also why in this respect the credibility theory is juxtaposed to [[structural functionalism]], which is based on presupposed societal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Parsons 1985 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Parsons | first=Talcott | title=Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution : selected writings | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-226-64749-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons 1964 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Parsons | first=Talcott | title=The Social system | publisher=Free Press Collier Macmillan | location=New York London | year=1964 | isbn=0-02-924190-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of underlying postulates for the credibility thesis have been proposed:&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=An endogenous theory of property rights: opening the black box of institutions | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1121–1144 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1253560 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1253560 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Institutions are the resultant of unintentional development. Although actors have intentions, there is no agency that can externally or exogenously design institutions, as actors' actions are part of the same endogenous game.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=19 December 2013 |title= In defense of endogenous, spontaneously ordered development: institutional functionalism and Chinese property rights |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |journal= Journal of Peasant Studies |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1087–1118 |doi= 10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions emerge as an unanticipated outcome of actors' multitudinous interactions, in effect, are the result of an autonomous, ''Unintended Intentionality''.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Unmaking China's Development | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2017-10-13 | isbn=978-1-316-14561-6 | doi=10.1017/9781316145616 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Institutional change is driven by disequilibrium. Contrary to the notion that institutions settle around equilibrium, actors' interactions are seen as an ever-changing and conflicting process in which stable status is never reached. One could see it as a "Dynamic Disequilibrium" or institutional change as perpetual alteration, yet, with alternating speeds of change; sometimes, imperceptibly slow, sometimes, sudden and with shocks.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;
* Institutional Form is subordinate to Function. In other words, functional adaptation as evident through the use and disuse of institutions over time and space is what matters for understanding their role in development, not their appearance.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt;

"Given that all involved actors are constantly interested in changing institutional design, credibility cannot be measured by directly asking respondents whether they find an institution credible.

Instead it has to be operationalized through [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]], such as the level of conflict that an institution generates, the extent of 'institutional robustness' expressed as a function of institutional lifespan and flexibility, the degree to which an institution facilitates or frustrates overall [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], political and [[Culture change|cultural change]], and the extent to which an institution fulfils the functions it ought to perform in the eyes of social actors." &lt;ref name="KremerLieshout2009"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ho|first=Peter|editor-last=Kremer | editor-first=Monique | title=Doing good or doing better: development policies in a globalizing world | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | location=Amsterdam | year=2009 |chapter=Beyond Development Orthodoxy: Chinese Lessons in Pragmatism and Institutional Change| isbn=978-90-8964-107-6 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ''opening of the black box'' of institutions is possible using [[Multimethodology|mixed methods]] to describe institutions in detail over time and space, which serves as an ''archaeology of institutions''. The archaeology of institutions can be understood as "an approach by which the change of institutions is meticulously recorded, interpreted and studied through the collection of data from every possible source, regardless of whether that is socio-economic, historical, ethno-anthropological, geographical, psychological or legal-political." &lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; An example of this, is the history of China's titling&lt;ref name="Ho2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Peter|title=Myths of tenure security and titling: Endogenous, institutional change in China's development|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=47|year=2015|pages=352–364|issn=0264-8377|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and housing ownership.&lt;ref name="PeterHo2017Cities"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Who owns China's housing?

The proxies that can be used to measure credibility include the following:

* Actors' aggregate perceptions of institutions, which can be operationalized according to the FAT Institutional Framework (in other words, an assessment of Formal, Actual and Targeted institutions);&lt;ref name="Nor-Hisham Ho 2016 pp. 1177–1205" /&gt;

*Speed of institutional change through an institutional archaeology of temporal changes in the formal property rights structure.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;

When credibility is assessed through these proxies, a better sense can be obtained of the current function that institutions fulfil for a group of actors. In result, one is likely better positioned to predict institutional interventions that might rally social support. Depending on the level of credibility, these can be envisioned as positioned on a gradient from condoning or non-intervention to co-opting, facilitating, prohibiting and ordaining.

The CSI Checklist (Credibility Scales and Intervention)&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; was developed for this purpose.

Apart from studying credibility in real-life situations, the particular premises of the theory – endogeneity, dis-equilibrium, and functional adaptation – make it also suitable for simulation in [[agent-based model]]s.

== Emergence of the theory ==
The question of credibility first emerged along with concern about certain institutional interventions failing. In the mid-20th century [[Vilhelm Aubert]] noted that the Housemaid Law in Norway had been implemented but flaunted by all involved actors.&lt;ref name="Aubert"/&gt; The concept of credibility was initially coined as an ''explanandum'' for the success and failure of Western monetary, anti-inflationary policies in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; A concern for the credibility of policy emerged in the latter half of the 20th century in response to frequently observed failures of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[structural adjustment]]s in the developing world associated with the [[Washington Consensus]]. Institutional reform, such as privatization, failed to deliver the predicted economic growth, not because of lacking credible commitment on part of actors but due to the absence of endogenous credibility.&lt;ref name = Grabel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao Rokpelnis 2016 pp. 1206–1223"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zhao | first=Heng | last2=Rokpelnis | first2=Karlis | title=Local perceptions of grassland degradation in China: a socio-anthropological reading of endogenous knowledge and institutional credibility | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1206–1223 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1192609 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1192609 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the growth of the Chinese economy despite lack of many institutions considered to be essential for economic growth indicated that institutional arrangements do not necessarily determine economic outcomes, and also at the same time economic development does not automatically lead to [[teleology|teleologically]] predetermined institutional forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/growth-0|title= Autocracy or democracy?|author=L.P. |date= |website= economist.com |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-18|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/g20/topics/anti-corruption/issues-paper-on-corruption-and-economic-growth.htm|title= Issues paper on corruption and economic growth |author= OECD |date= |website= oecd.org |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-20|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly striking in the case of [[Real estate in China|real estate sector]] in China.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"/&gt; In this context, there is a growing body of research suggesting one should focus on the function or quality of institutional performance rather than their form.&lt;ref name="Aron2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=J.|title=Growth and Institutions: A Review of the Evidence|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|volume=15|issue=1|year=2000|pages=99–135|issn=0257-3032|doi=10.1093/wbro/15.1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AgrawalEtAl2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Agrawal | first=Arun | last2=Wollenberg | first2=E. | last3=Persha | first3=L. | title=Governing agriculture-forest landscapes to achieve climate change mitigation | journal=Global Environmental Change | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=29 | year=2014 | issn=0959-3780 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.10.001 | pages=270–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dixon | first=Adam D. | title=Function before form: macro-institutional comparison and the geography of finance | journal=Journal of Economic Geography | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2012-01-19 | issn=1468-2710 | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbr043 | pages=579–600}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ha-Joon Chang: “a big problem that dogs the current orthodox literature on development is its inability to clearly distinguish between the forms and functions of institutions.”&lt;ref name="Chang2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Chang | title=Institutional change and economic development | publisher=United Nations University Press | publication-place=New York, NY | year=2007 | isbn=978-92-808-1143-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''credibility thesis'' was put forth by Peter Ho in 2014.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In a review of the credibility thesis, Delilah Griswold contended that "credibility is a powerful metric by which to understand and evaluate tenure systems. Importantly, understanding the credibility of a given institution requires analysis outside of theory and politics, analysis that is locally and temporally specific and multilayered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/when-it-comes-to-the-efficacy-of-property-rights-function-can-be-more-important-than-form|title= With efficacy of property rights, function can be more important than form|last1= Griswold|first1= Delilah|last2= |first2= |date= {{date|2015-07-09}}|website= Yale Environment Review|publisher= |access-date={{date|2015-11-18}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryosurgery initiates inflammation and leaves tumor-specific antigens intact, which may induce an anti-tumor immune response.{{cite journal | year = 2005 |title = Immunologic response to cryoablation of breast cancer. | pmc=4115762 | pmid=25083502 | doi=10.3978/j.issn.2227-684X.2014.03.04 | volume=3 | journal=Gland Surg | pages=88–93 |vauthors=Tarkowski R, Rzaca M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cryoablation of tumors is a way of achieving [[autologous]], [[in-vivo]] tumor [[lysate]] vaccine and treat [[metastatic]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;Not only does it represent an alternative to surgical intervention, but it also creates a tumor-specific immune response stimulated by damaged cells. This cryoimmunologic response may contribute to controlling metastases far from the primary breast tumor. {{cite journal | year = 2016 |title = Harnessing ultrasound-guided cryoablation for breast cancer. | url=http://appliedradiology.com/articles/harnessing-ultrasound-guided-cryoablation-for-breast-cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;We report the case of a patient with lung and bone metastases of RCC whose lung metastases disappeared after reconstruction using the resected specimen treated by liquid nitrogen for the bone metastasis. This 60-year-old female had a left RCC with multiple lung metastases and a left femoral bone metastasis at the time of diagnosis. After left nephrectomy followed by [[immunotherapy]], we performed tumour excision and reconstruction with frozen recycled autograft. The lung metastases had disappeared by 10 months after surgery, while serum levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin-12 had increased. We postulate that the antitumour activity resulted from [[immunotherapy]]  plus cryotreatment of her bone metastasis and believe that this case supports continued research into [[immunotherapy]]  for cancer.{{cite journal | year = 2011 |title = Cryotreatment against Metastatic Renal Cell Bone Tumour Reduced Multiple Lung Metastases | url=http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/31/9/2927.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cryoablation alone may produce an insufficient immune response, depending on various factors, such as high freeze rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010 |title = Rate of freeze alters the immunologic response after cryoablation of breast cancer.| journal = J Urol | pmid=20033323 | doi=10.1245/s10434-009-0846-1 | volume=17 | pages=1187–93 |vauthors=Sabel MS, Su G, Griffith KA, Chang AE }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining cryotherapy with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 |title = More Than Just Tumor Destruction: Immunomodulation by Thermal Ablation of Cancer.| journal = Clin Dev Immunol. | doi=10.1155/2011/160250 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2011%2F160250 | volume=2011 | pages=1–19 | pmid=22242035 | pmc=3254009 | last1 = Haen | first1 = SP | last2 = Pereira | first2 = PL | last3 = Salih | first3 = HR | last4 = Rammensee | first4 = HG | last5 = Gouttefangeas | first5 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Immunological effects resulting from the cryoablation of tumors was first observed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A relationship between thermal therapies and the immune system has been recognized since the 1960s, when an antibody response was seen following cryotherapy. The abscopal effect of cryotherapy has been reported as early as the 1970s [55, 56]. The concept of “cryoimmunology” originated in the 1960s when it was observed that serum anti-tumor antibodies develop after cryoablation [24, 57]. Anecdotal reports of the abscopal effect of cryotherapy in humans followed shortly thereafter in the 1970s. {{cite journal | year = 2016 |title = Thermal Ablative Therapies and Immune Checkpoint Modulation: Can Locoregional Approaches Effect a Systemic Response.| journal = Gastroenterol Res Pract | doi=10.1155/2016/9251375 | volume=2016 | pages=1–11 | author=Mehta Amol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1967 |title = Studies in cryo-immunology.| journal = Immunology | pmc=1409203 | pmid=4960713 | volume=12 | pages=395–410 |vauthors=Yantorno C, Soanes WA, Gonder MJ, Shulman S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1960s, Tanaka treated metastatic breast cancer patients with cryotherapy and reported cryoimmunological reaction resulting from cryotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1982 |title = Immunological aspects of cryosurgery in general surgery.| journal = Cryobiology | author = Tanaka| pmid=7105777 | volume=19 | pages=247–62 | doi=10.1016/0011-2240(82)90151-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 |title = The Use of Cryosurgery for Breast Cancer | url=http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=211464 | journal = Arch Surg | language = en|author = Richard J.

Aimed at promoting the new technology, the ISC was founded in Austria in 1972. The technology matured with each passing day after over 30 years of development. In recent years, in particular, China, with its greater economic development and scientific and technological progress, has been playing a leading role in the world in terms of both theoretical research and clinical application of cryotherapy. As an efficient medical method for treating tumors, cryotherapy has been adopted by more and more medical institutions in China and has achieved remarkable cancer-treating effectiveness.{{cite web | year = 2015 |title = China: New Chair of the International Society of Cryosurgery (ISC)| url=http://www.fudacancerhospital.org/fudanews/20150723185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross-Paul says that while to date there have been several dozen patients treated by cryoablation for breast tumors by Dr. Peter Littrup, a pioneer in the cryotherapy field, the Chinese, who began using cryoablation to treat breast cancer about the same time as Littrup, have treated more than 3,800 women using the method. “The fact that these tremendous advances in China have not been duplicated in the U.S. is disturbing,” Ross-Paul said.{{cite web | year = 2016 |title = Minimally Invasive Breast Cancer Cryotherapy Largely Ignored in U.S., Says Advocate and 13-Year Survivor| url=http://www.fudacancerhospital.org/fudanews/20150723185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, American researchers and medical professionals, started to explore cryoimmunotherapy for systemic treatment of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2015 |title = In situ immunization via non-surgical ablation to prevent local and distant tumor recurrence. | pmid=25949901 | doi=10.4161/2162402X.2014.989762 | volume=4 | pmc=4404795 | journal=Oncoimmunology | pages=e989762 |vauthors=Veenstra JJ, Gibson HM, Freytag S, Littrup PJ, Wei WZ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of actions==
Cryoablation of tumor induces necrosis of tumor cells. The immunotherapeutic effect of [[cryoablation]] of tumor is the result of the release of intracellular tumor antigens from within the necrotized tumor cells. The released tumor antigens help activate anti-tumor T cells, which destroy remaining malignant cells. Thus, [[cryoablation]] of tumor elicits a systemic anti-tumor immunologic response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2015 |title = Cryo-thermal therapy elicits potent anti-tumor immunity.| url =http://www.nature.com/articles/srep27136 | doi=10.1038/srep27136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cryosurgery initiates inflammation and leaves tumor-specific antigens intact, which may induce an anti-tumor immune response.{{cite journal | year = 2005 |title = Immunologic response to cryoablation of breast cancer. | author = Sabel | pmc=4115762 | pmid=25083502 | doi=10.3978/j.issn.2227-684X.2014.03.04 | volume=3 | journal=Gland Surg | pages=88–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2005 |title = Combined Dendritic Cell Cryotherapy of Tumor Induces Systemic Antimetastatic Immunity.| url =http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/11/13/4955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting immunostimulation from cryoablation may not be sufficient to induce sustained, systemic regression of metastases, and can be synergised with the combination of [[immunotherapy]] treatment and [[vaccine adjuvants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2016 |title = Thermal Ablative Therapies and Immune Checkpoint Modulation: Can Locoregional Approaches Effect a Systemic Response.| journal = Gastroenterol Res Pract | doi=10.1155/2016/9251375 | volume=2016 | pages=1–11 | author=Mehta Amol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various adjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatments can be combined with cryoablation to sustain systemic anti-tumor response with regression of metastases, including:

* Injection of immunomodulating drugs (i.e.: therapeutic antibodies) and vaccine adjuvants (saponins) directly into the cryoablated, necrotized tumor lysate, immediately after cryoablation 
* Administration of autologous immune enhancement therapy, including: dendritic cell therapy, CIK cell therapy

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''cystocele''', also known as a '''prolapsed bladder''', is a medical condition in which a woman's [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] bulges into her [[vagina]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Cystocele (Prolapsed Bladder)|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004190143/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|archivedate=4 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fir2014/&gt; Some may have no symptoms.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt; Other may have trouble starting urination, [[urinary incontinence]], or [[frequent urination]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Complications may include recurrent [[urinary tract infection]]s and [[urinary retention]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=hami&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamid|first=Rizwan|last2=Losco|first2=Giovanni|date=2014-09-01|title=Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Associated Cystitis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11884-014-0249-4|journal=Current Bladder Dysfunction Reports|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=175–180|doi=10.1007/s11884-014-0249-4|issn=1931-7212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cystocele and a [[urethrocele|prolapsed urethra]] often occur together and is called a cystourethrocele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/pelvic-relaxation-syndromes/cystoceles,-urethroceles,-enteroceles,-and-rectoceles|title=Cystoceles, Urethroceles, Enteroceles, and Rectoceles – Gynecology and Obstetrics – Merck Manuals Professional Edition|last=|first=|date=February 2017|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycstocele can negatively affect [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/6000/6022.asp?index=15468|title=Cystocele (Fallen Bladder)|website=www.clevelandclinic.org|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Donna Y.|last2=Rutman|first2=Matthew|last3=Rodriguez|first3=Larissa|last4=Raz|first4=Shlomo|date=2005-09-01|title=Correction of cystocele|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05760.x/abstract|journal=BJU International|language=en|volume=96|issue=4|pages=691–709|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410x.2005.05760.x|issn=1464-410X|pmid=16104940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes include [[childbirth]], [[constipation]], [[chronic cough]], heavy lifting, [[hysterectomy]], [[genetics]], and being [[overweight]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name =Bag2016&gt;{{Cite book |title=Atlas of pelvic anatomy and gynecologic surgery |last=Baggish |first=Michael S. |publisher=Elsevier |last2=Karram |first2=Mickey M. |year=2016 |isbn=9780323225526 |edition=4th |location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=599–646|oclc=929893382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647&gt;{{Cite book |title=Williams gynecology |last=Williams |first=J.

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
If the cystocele causes few symptoms, avoiding heavy lifting or straining may be all that is recommended.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; In those with more significant symptoms a vaginal [[pessary]], [[pelvic muscle exercise]]s, or surgery may be recommended.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; The type of surgery typically done is known as a [[colporrhaphy]].&lt;ref name=Umek2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern-Elenskaia|first=Ksenia|last2=Umek|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Bodner-Adler|first3=Barbara|last4=Hanzal|first4=Engelbert|date=2017-12-06|title=Anterior colporrhaphy: a standard operation?

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of a cystocele may include:

* a vaginal bulge
* the feeling that something is falling out of the vagina
* the sensation of pelvic heaviness or fullness&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2016"/&gt;
* difficulty starting a urine stream
* a feeling of incomplete urination
* frequent or urgent urination&lt;ref name="Henry2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt;
* fecal incontinence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* frequent urinary tract infections&lt;ref name="hami" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2016"/&gt;
* back and pelvic pain
* fatigue
* painful sexual intercourse&lt;ref name="Henry2016"/&gt;
* bleeding&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A bladder that has dropped from its normal position and into the vagina can cause some forms of incontinence and incomplete emptying of the bladder.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt;

===Complications===
Complications may include [[urinary retention]], recurring urinary tract infections and incontinence.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hami" /&gt; The anterior vaginal wall may actually protrude though the vaginal introitus (opening). This can interfere with sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt; Recurrent urinary tract infections are common for those who have urinary retention.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, though cystocele can be treated, some treatments may not alleviate troubling symptoms, and further treatment may need to be performed. Cystocele may effect the quality of life, women who have cystocele tend to avoid leaving their home and social situations. The resulting incontinence puts women at risk of being placed in a nursing home or long term care facility.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Cause ==
A cystocele occurs when the muscles, [[fascia]], [[tendon]]s and [[connective tissue]]s between a woman’s bladder and vagina weaken, or detach.&lt;ref name="Bag2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delorme2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamblin|first=Géry|last2=Delorme|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Cosson|first3=Michel|last4=Rubod|first4=Chrystèle|date=2016-09-01|title=Cystocele and functional anatomy of the pelvic floor: review and update of the various theories|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2832-4|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1297–1305|doi=10.1007/s00192-015-2832-4|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of cystocele that can develop can be due to one, two or three vaginal wall attachment failures: the midline defect, the paravaginal defect, and the transverse defect. The midline defect is a cystocele caused by the overstretching of the vaginal wall; the paravaginal defect is the separation of the vaginal connective tissue at the [[Tendinous arch of pelvic fascia|arcus tendineus fascia pelvis]]; the transverse defect is when the [[Pubocervical ligament|pubocervical fascia]] becomes detached from the top (apex) of the vagina.&lt;ref name="Bag2016" /&gt; There is some pelvic prolapse in 40–60% of women who have given birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Dudley|last2=Thiagamoorthy|first2=Gans|last3=Cardozo|first3=Linda|date=January 2018|title=Review: Post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378512217307818|journal=Maturitas|volume=107|pages=39–43|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.07.011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womhealth.org.au/conditions-and-treatments/genital-prolapse-fact-sheet|title=Genital prolapse fact sheet {{!}} Women's Health Queensland Wide|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=womhealth.org.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muscle injuries have been identified in women with cystocele.

Some women with connective tissue disorders are predisposed to developing anterior vaginal wall collapse. Up to one third of women with [[Marfan syndrome]] have a history of vaginal wall collapse. [[Ehlers–Danlos syndromes|Ehlers-Danlos]] syndrome in women is associated with a rate of 3 out of 4.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt;

Connective tissue disorders predispose women to developing cystocele and other pelvic organ prolapse. The tissues tensile strength of the vaginal wall decreases when the structure of the collagen fibers change and become weaker.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
There are two types of cystocele. The first is distension. This is thought to be due to the overstretching of the vaginal wall and is most often associated with aging, menopause and vaginal delivery. It can be observed when the rugae are less visible or even absent. The second type is displacement. Displacement is the detachment or abnormal elongation of supportive tissue.&lt;ref name="walters2013" /&gt;

The initial assessment of cystocele can include a [[Pelvic examination|pelvic exam]] to evaluate leakage of urine when the women is asked to bear down or give a strong cough ([[Valsalva maneuver]]), and the anterior vaginal wall measured and evaluated for the appearance of a cystocele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zilinskas|first=Gwendolyn Brooke|date=January 2018|title=Female Urinary Incontinence|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405799117301202|journal=Physician Assistant Clinics|volume=3|issue=1|pages=69–82|doi=10.1016/j.cpha.2017.08.010|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/44/recordset/18975/value/44|title=Anterior Colporrhaphy {{!}} GLOWM|website=www.glowm.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman has difficulty emptying her bladder, the clinician may measure the amount of urine left in the woman’s bladder after she urinates called the postvoid residual. This is measured by [[ultrasound]]. A [[voiding cystourethrogram]] is a test that involves taking x-rays of the bladder during urination. This [[x-ray]] shows the shape of the bladder and lets the doctor see any problems that might block the normal flow of urine.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt; A urine culture and sensitivity test will assess the presence of a urinary tract infection that may be related to urinary retention.&lt;ref name="Henry2016"/&gt; Other tests may be needed to find or rule out problems in other parts of the urinary system.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt; Differential diagnosis will be improved by identifying possible inflammation of the [[Skene's gland]]s and [[Bartholin's gland|Bartholin gland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/pelvic-relaxation-syndromes/cystoceles,-urethroceles,-enteroceles,-and-rectoceles|title=Cystoceles, Urethroceles, Enteroceles, and Rectoceles - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading===
A number of scales exist to grade the severity of a cystocele.

The [[Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System|pelvic organ prolapse quantification]] (POP-Q) assessment, developed in 1996, quantifies the descent of the cystocele into the vagina.&lt;ref name="Hof2012p647" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and their descent.&lt;ref name="Hof2012p647" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System&amp;nbsp;is used as the second most used system and assigns the classifications as mild (grade 1) when the bladder droops only a short way into the vagina; (grade 2) cystocele, the bladder sinks far enough to reach the opening of the vagina; and (grade 3) when the bladder bulges out through the opening of the vagina.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persu|first=C|last2=Chapple|first2=CR|last3=Cauni|first3=V|last4=Gutue|first4=S|last5=Geavlete|first5=P|date=2011-02-15|title=Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP–Q) – a new era in pelvic prolapse staging|journal=Journal of Medicine and Life|volume=4|issue=1|pages=75–81|issn=1844-122X|pmc=3056425|pmid=21505577|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classifications ===
Cystocele can be further described as being apical, medial, lateral, or mediolateral.

'''Apical cystocele''' is located upper third of the vagina. The structures involved are the [[Pelvic fascia|endopelvic fascia]] and [[ligament]]s. The [[cardinal ligament]]s and the [[uterosacral ligament]]s suspend the upper vaginal-dome. The cystocele in this region of the vagina is thought to be due to a cardinal ligament defect.&lt;ref name="delorme2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name = walters2013&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery|last=Walters|first=Mark D|last2=Karram|first2=Mickey M|publisher=Saunders|year=2014|isbn=978-0323113779|location=|pages=326–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medial cystocele''' forms in the mid-vagina and is related to a defect in the suspension provided by to a sagittal suspension system defect in the uterosacral ligaments and [[Pubocervical ligament|pubocervical fascia]]. Thee pubocervical fascia may thin or tear and create the cystocele. An aid in diagnosis is the creation of a 'shiny' spot on the epithelium of the vagina. This defect can be assessed by MRI.&lt;ref name="delorme2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name = walters2013/&gt;

'''Lateral cystocele''' forms when both the pelviperineal muscle and its ligamentous–fascial develop a defect. The ligamentous– fascial creates a 'hammock-like' suspension and support for the lateral sides of the vagina. Defects in this lateral support system results in a lack of bladder support. Cystocele that develops laterally is associated with an anatomic imbalance between anterior vaginal wall and the [[Tendinous arch of pelvic fascia|arcus tendineus fasciae]] pelvis – the essential ligament structure.&lt;ref name="delorme2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name = walters2013/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Cystocele may be mild enough not to result in symptoms that are troubling to a woman. In this case, steps to prevent it from worsening include:
*smoking cessation
*losing weight
*pelvic floor strengthening
*treatment of a chronic cough
*maintaining healthy bowel habits
**eating [[dietary fiber|high fiber foods]]
**avoiding constipation and straining&lt;ref name=whgov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment options range from no treatment for a mild cystocele to [[surgery]] for a more extensive cystocele.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; If a cystocele is not bothersome, the clinician may only recommend avoiding heavy lifting or straining that could cause the cystocele to worsen. If symptoms are moderately bothersome, the doctor may recommend a [[pessary]], a device placed in the vagina to hold the bladder in place and to block protrusion.&lt;ref name="Henry2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Mayo Clinic|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cystocele/DS00665/DSECTION=7|title=Cystocele|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment can consist of a combination of non-surgical and surgical management. Treatment choice is also related to age, desire to have children, severity of impairment, desire to continue sexual intercourse and other diseases that a woman may have.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt;

=== Non-surgical===
Cystocele is often treated by non-surgical means:
* Pessary – This is a removable device inserted into the vagina to support the anterior vaginal wall. Pessaries come in many different shapes and sizes. There are sometimes complications with the use of a pessary.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt;
* Pelvic floor muscle therapy – Pelvic floor exercises to strengthen vaginal support can be of benefit. Specialized physical therapy can be prescribed to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2016" /&gt; 
* Dietary changes – Ingesting high fiber foods will aid in promoting [[Defecation|bowel movement]]s.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt;
* Estrogen – intravaginal administration helps to prevent pelvic muscle atrophy&lt;ref name="Henry2016" /&gt;

=== Surgery ===
The surgery to repair the anterior vaginal wall may be combined with other procedures that will repair the other points of pelvic organ support such as anterior-posterior repair and anterior colporrhaphy.&lt;ref name="Henry2016" /&gt; Treatment of cystocele often accompanies the more invasive hysterectomy.&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt; Since the failure rate in cystocele repair remains high, additional surgery may be needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who have surgery to repair a cystocele have a 17% of needing another operation within the next ten years.&lt;ref name="rahn" /&gt;

The surgical treatment of cystocele will depend on the cause of the defect and whether it occurs at the top (apex), middle, or lower part of the anterior vaginal wall. The type of surgery will also depend on the type of damage that exists between supporting structures and the vaginal wall.&lt;ref name="Bag2016" /&gt; One of the most common surgical repairs is [[colporrhaphy]].&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt; This surgical procedure consists of making a longitudinal folding of the vaginal tissue, suturing it into place and creating a stronger point of resistance to the intruding bladder wall. [[Surgical mesh]] is sometimes used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name=Hof2012p647/&gt; It has a 10–50% failure rate.&lt;ref name="uc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt; In some cases a surgeon may choose to use [[surgical mesh]] to strengthen the repair.&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt;

During surgery, the repair of the vaginal wall consists of folding over and then suturing the existing tissue between the vagina and bladder to strengthen it.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Umek2017/&gt; This tightens the layers of tissue to promote the replacement of the pelvic organs into their normal place. The surgery also provides more support for the bladder. This surgery is done by a surgeon specializing in gynecology and is performed in a hospital. [[Anesthesia]] varies according to the needs of each woman. Recovery may take four to six weeks.&lt;ref name="NIH2014" /&gt; Other surgical treatment may be performed to treat cystocele. Support for the vaginal wall is accomplished with the paravaginal defect repair. This is a surgery, usually [[Laparoscopy|laproscop]]ic, that is done to the ligaments and fascia through the abdomen. The lateral ligaments and supportive structures are repaired, sometimes shortened to provide additional support to the vaginal wall.&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt;

[[Sacrocolpopexy]] is a procedure that stabilizes the vaginal vault (the uppermost portion of the vagina) and is often chosen as the treatment for cystocele, especially if previous surgeries were not successful. The procedure consists of attaching the vaginal vault to the sacrum. It has a success rate of 90%.&lt;ref name="hoff2" /&gt; Some women choose not to have surgery to close the vagina. This surgery, called [[colpocleisis]], treats cystocele by closing the vaginal opening. This can be an option for women who no longer want to have vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="whgov" /&gt;

If an [[enterocele]]/[[sigmoidocele]], or prolapse of the rectum/colon, is also present, the surgical treatment will take this concurrent condition into account while planning and performing the repairs.&lt;ref name="Bag2016" /&gt; Estrogen that is administered vaginally before surgical repair can strengthen the vaginal tissue providing a more successful outcome when mesh or sutures are used for the repair.

After surgery, a woman is instructed to restrict her activities and monitor herself for signs of infection such as an elevated temperature, discharge with a foul odor and consistent pain. Clinicians may recommend that sneezing, coughing, and constipation are to be avoided.

Recurrent surgery on the pelvic organs may not be due to a failure of the surgery to correct the cystocele. Subsequent surgeries can be directly or indirectly relating to the primary surgery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prolapse can occur at a different site in the vagina. Further surgery after the initial repair can be to treat complications of mesh displacement, pain, or bleeding. Further surgery may be needed to treat incontinence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One goal of surgical treatment is to restore the vagina and other pelvic organs to their anatomically normal positions. This may not be the outcome that is most important to the woman being treated who may only want relief of symptoms and an improvement in her quality of life. The International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) has recommended that the data collected regarding the success of cystocele and pelvic organ repairs include the presence or absence of symptoms, satisfaction and Quality of Life. Other measures of a successful outcome should include perioperative data, such as operative time and hospital stay. [[Quality of life (healthcare)|Standardized Healthcare Quality of Life]] should be part of the measure of a successful resolution of cystocele. Data regarding short- and long-term complications is included in the recommendations of the IUGA to better assess the risk–benefit ratio of each procedure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Current investigations into the superiority of using biological grafting versus native tissue or surgical mesh indicates that using grafts provides better results.&lt;ref name=mahe2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004014.pub6/abstract|title=Surgery for women with anterior compartment prolapse|last=Maher|first=Christopher|last2=Feiner|first2=Benjamin|last3=Baessler|first3=Kaven|last4=Christmann-Schmid|first4=Corina|last5=Haya|first5=Nir|last6=Brown|first6=Julie|date=2016-11-30|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|access-date = 28 December 2017|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004014.pub6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
A large study found a rate of 29% over the lifetime of a woman. Other studies indicate a recurrence rate as low as 3%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse and 81% of these are to correct cystocele.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-27|title=Cystocele Repair: Overview, Technique, Periprocedural Care|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1848220-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Umek2017" /&gt; Cystocele occurs most frequently compared to the prolapse of other pelvic organs and structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cystocele is found to be three times as common as vaginal vault prolapse and twice as often as posterior vaginal wall defects. The incidence of cystocele is around 9 per 100 women-years. The highest incidence of symptoms occurs between ages of 70 and 79 years. Based on population growth statistics, the number of women with prolapse will increase by a minimum of 46% by the year 2050 in the US. Surgery to correct prolapse after hysterectomy is 3.6 per 1,000 women-years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Matthew D.|last2=Maher|first2=Christopher|date=2013-11-01|title=Epidemiology and outcome assessment of pelvic organ prolapse|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-013-2169-9|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=24|issue=11|pages=1783–1790|doi=10.1007/s00192-013-2169-9|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Hippocrates treatment for prolapse.png|thumb|The ancient Greek method for treating cystocele]]
Notable is the mention of cystocele in many older cultures and locations.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt; In 1500 B.C. Egyptians wrote about the “falling of the womb”. In 400 B.C. a Greek physician documented his observations and treatments:

"After the patient had been tied to a ladder-like frame, she was tipped upward so that her head was toward the bottom of the frame. The frame was then moved upward and downward more or less rapidly for approximately 3–5 min. As the patient was in an inverted position, it was thought that the prolapsing organs of the genital tract would be returned to their normal position by the force of gravity and the shaking motion."&lt;ref name="lens"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lensen|first=E. J. M.|last2=Withagen|first2=M. I. J.|last3=Kluivers|first3=K. B.|last4=Milani|first4=A. L.|last5=Vierhout|first5=M. E.|date=2013-10-01|title=Surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse: a historical review with emphasis on the anterior compartment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-013-2074-2|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=24|issue=10|pages=1593–1602|doi=10.1007/s00192-013-2074-2|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]] had his own theories regarding the cause of prolapse. He thought that recent childbirth, wet feet, 'sexual excesses', exertion, and fatigue may have contributed to the condition. [[Polybus (physician)|Polybus]], Hippocrates's son-in-law, wrote: "a prolapsed uterus was treated by using local astringent lotions, a natural sponge packed into the vagina, or placement of half a pomegranate in the vagina." In 350 A.D., another practitioner named Soranus described his treatments which stated that the pomegranate should be dipped into vinegar before insertion. Success could be enhanced if the woman was on bed rest and reduced intake of fluid and food. If the treatment was still not successful, the woman's legs were tied together for three days.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In 1521, [[Jacopo Berengario da Carpi|Berengario da Carpi]] performed the first surgical treatment for prolapse. This was to tie a rope around the prolapse, tighten it for two days until it was no longer viable and cut it off. Wine, aloe, and honey were then applied to the stump.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In the 1700s, a Swiss gynecologist, Peyer, published a description of a cystocele. He was able to describe and document both cystocele and uterine prolapse. In 1730, Halder associated cystocele with childbirth. During this same time, efforts began to standardize the terminology that is still familiar today. In the 1800s, the surgical advancements of anesthesia, suturing, suturing materials and acceptance of Joseph Listers theories of antisepsis improved outcomes for women with cystocele. The first surgical techniques were practiced on female cadavers. In 1823, Geradin proposed that an incision and resection may provide treatment. In 1830, the first dissection of the vagina was performed by Dieffenbach on a living woman. In 1834, Mendé proposed that dissecting and repair of the edges of the tissues could be done. In 1859, Huguier proposed the amputation of the cervix was going to solve the problem for elongation.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In 1866, a method of correcting a cystocele was proposed that resembled current procedures. Sim subsequently developed another procedure that did not require the full-thickness dissection of the vaginal wall. In 1888, another method of treating anterior vaginal wall Manchester combined an anterior vaginal wall repair with an amputation of the cervix and a perineorrhaphy. In 1909, White noted the high rate of recurrence of cystocele repair. At this time it was proposed that reattaching the vagina to support structures was more successful and resulted in less recurrence. This same proposal was proposed again in 1976 but further studies indicated that the recurrence rate was not better.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In 1888, treatments were tried that entered the abdomen to make reattachments. Some did not agree with this and suggested an approach through the inguinal canal. In 1898, further abdominal approaches were proposed. No further advances have been noted until 1961 when reattachment of the anterior vaginal wall to Cooper's ligament began to be used. Unfortunately, posterior vaginal wall prolapse occurred in some patients even though the anterior repair was successful.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In 1955, using mesh to support pelvic structures came into use. In 1970, tissue from pigs began to be used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall in surgery. Beginning in 1976, improvement in suturing began along with the surgical removal of the vagina being used to treat prolapse of the bladder. In 1991, assumptions about the detailed anatomy of the pelvic support structures began to be questioned regarding the existence of some pelvic structures and the non-existence of others. More recently, the use of stem cells, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery are being used to treat cystocele.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11258">'''Cytoplasmic incompatibility''' ('''CI''') is a phenomenon that results in [[sperm]] and [[ovum|eggs]] being unable to form viable offspring. The effect arises from changes in the [[gamete]] cells caused by intracellular parasites like ''[[Wolbachia]]'', which infect a wide range of insect species. As the reproductive incompatibility is caused by bacteria that reside in the cytoplasm of the host cells, it is referred to as cytoplasmic incompatibility.  In 1971, Janice Yen and A. Ralph Barr of UCLA demonstrated the etiologic relationship of ''Wolbachia'' infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility in ''Culex'' mosquitos when they found that eggs were killed when the sperm of ''Wolbachia''-infected males fertilized infection-free eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yen |first=J. H. |last2=Barr |first2=A. R. |year=1971 |title=New hypothesis of the cause of cytoplasmic incompatibility in ''Culex pipiens'' |journal=Nature |volume=232 |pages=657–658 |doi=10.1038/232657a0 |pmid=4937405 |issue=5313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==

[[Image:Uni bidirectional ci.png|thumb|right|500px|'''Unidirectional CI:''' Mating of infected males and uninfected females results in CI. All other crosses are compatible. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Bidirectional CI:''' Mating of males infected with ''Wolbachia'' strain I and females infected by ''Wolbachia'' strain II (and vice versa) results in CI. ]]

CI occurs when a ''Wolbachia'' infected male mates with a female that is infected by another ''Wolbachia'' strain (bidirectional CI) or is uninfected (unidirectional CI). 
Any other combination of un-/infected male/female crosses are compatible. An infected female is compatible with any infected or uninfected male of the same ''Wolbachia'' strain. On the other hand an uninfected female is only compatible with an uninfected male. In other words, if the male is infected by a CI-inducing strain of ''Wolbachia'' that is non-existent in its mate, it is an incompatible cross.&lt;ref name="Werren" /&gt; Hosts can be cured from ''Wolbachia'' infection by antibiotic use.

In [[diploid]] organisms CI leads to embryonic mortality. In contrast, CI in [[haplodiploid]] hosts may lead to haploid (and thus male) offspring. The closely related species of the wasp ''Nasonia'' show embryonic mortality as well as male development among incompatible crosses. In ''N. vitripennis'', however, the vast majority of the CI embryos are converted into males.&lt;ref&gt;Tram, U, Fredrick, K, Werren, J, Sullivan, W (2006). "Paternal chromosome segregation during the first mitotic division determines ''Wolbachia''-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype", ''J. Cell Sci.'' 119, 10.1242/jcs.03095. http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/119/17/3655&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cellular mechanism ==
There are two distinguished events that lead to the CI inducing manipulation.  The first occurs inside the ''Wolbachia'' infected male during [[spermatogenesis]] and is called modification. Because ''Wolbachia'' are absent from mature sperm and appear to be excluded during the individualization process, the modification must occur before the conclusion of spermatogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snook | first1 = R | last2 = Cleland | first2 = S | last3 = Wolfner | first3 = M | last4 = Karr | first4 = T | year = 2000 | title = Offsetting Effects of Wolbachia Infection and Heat Shock on Sperm Production in Drosophila simulans: Analyses of Fecundity, Fertility and Accessory Gland Proteins | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/155/1/167 | journal = Genetics | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 167–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The second event, called rescue, takes place inside the fertilized egg where ''Wolbachia'' presence prevents CI from occurring. As long as the ''Wolbachia'' strains in egg and sperm cells correspond, harmful effects cannot be observed on a cellular level.

A major consequence of CI is the delayed entry into mitosis of the male [[pronucleus]]. As a secondary consequence, stemming from this asynchrony,  the paternal chromosomes do not properly condense and align on the metaphase plate during the first [[mitosis]]. As a consequence, only the maternal chromosome segregate normally, producing haploid embryos.&lt;ref name="Tram" /&gt; The rescue of CI by infected eggs leads to the restoration of synchrony between the female and the male pronucleus.&lt;ref name="Tram"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tram | first1 = U | last2 = Sullivan | first2 = W | year = 2002 | title = Role of delayed nuclear envelope breakdown and mitosis in Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompability | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/296/5570/1124 | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = | pages = 1124–1126 | doi=10.1126/science.1070536 | pmid=12004132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lassy | first1 = C | last2 = Karr | first2 = T | year = 1996 | title = Cytological analysis of fertilization and early embryonic development in incompatible crosses of Drosophila simulans | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T9H-3VYTMKV-4/2/b22cf619a1a4f955659c763db4619218 | journal = Mechanisms of Development | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 47–58 | doi=10.1016/0925-4773(96)00527-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanisms of how ''Wolbachia'' perform modification and rescue are unknown. In ''Drosophila'', the earliest effects caused by CI can already be observed during the sperm [[chromatin remodeling]] of the paternal chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landmann | first1 = F | last2 = Orsi | first2 = GA | last3 = Loppin | first3 = B | last4 = Sullivan | first4 = W | year = 2009 | title = Wolbachia-Mediated Cytoplasmic Incompatibility Is Associated with Impaired Histone Deposition in the Male Pronucleus | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 5 | issue = 3| page = e1000343 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also observed that in other host species, the defects caused by CI only occur much later in development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duron | first1 = O | last2 = Weill | first2 = M | year = 2006 | title = Wolbachia infection influences the development of Culex pipiens embryo in incompatible crosses | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 493–500 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800831 | pmid=16639421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary implications ==
CI, as described by Werren,&lt;ref name="Werren"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werren | first1 = J | year = 1997 | title = Biology of Wolbachia | url = http://www.rochester.edu/college/bio/labs/WerrenLab/My%20Papers/1997_Wolbach_AnRevEnt.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 587–609 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.587 | pmid=15012323}}&lt;/ref&gt; results in selection pressure on uninfected females, as infected females can mate both with uninfected males and infected males, but uninfected females cannot mate with infected males. As ''Wolbachia'' are only transmitted by females, this mechanism promotes the spread of ''Wolbachia'' and therefore keeps ''Wolbachia'' from dying out because of incomplete transmission. This has led to discoveries in control of disease transmission by using Wolbachia to control the reproduction of a population by introducing ''Wolbachia''-infected males.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zabalou|first1=Sofia|last2=Riegler|first2=Markus|last3=Theodorakopoulou|first3=Marianna|title=Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility as a means for insect pest population control|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=9 September 2004|volume=101|issue=42|pages=15042–15045|doi=10.1073/pnas.0403853101|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/42/15042.full|pmid=15469918|pmc=524042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen in the Aedes, mosquito, family, in the ''[[Aedes albopictus]]'' and ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' species.

=== Population genetics ===
The infection of a population with CI-inducing ''Wolbachia'' can have different effects on the population's dynamics. At low prevalence of ''Wolbachia'', the probability for an uninfected female to lose progeny because of mating with an infected male is fairly low.
This loss of uninfected individuals is outweighed by the loss of infection due to the incomplete ''Wolbachia'' transmission.
If the prevalence of CI-inducing ''Wolbachia'' is high enough, the probability for an uninfected female to mate with an infected male is high and it is thus preferable for a female to be infected. 
Therefore, there is an ''invasion threshold'' for the spread of ''Wolbachia'' in an uninfected population, which depends on the transmission rate of the infection and the portion of incompatible progeny which survive until they can reproduce (the strength of CI), as well as on the fitness cost of ''Wolbachia'' infection to the female.
Below this threshold the invaders will die out, above this threshold the prevalence will reach a stable equilibrium. Typical thresholds in real populations are around 10% (See Fine&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = P | year = 1978 | title = On the Dynamics of Symbiote-Dependent Cytoplasmic Incompatibility in Culicine Mosquitoes | url = | journal = J Invertebr Pathol | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 10–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stouthamer et al.&lt;ref name="Stouthamer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stouthamer | first1 = R | year = 1999 | title = WOLBACHIA PIPIENTIS: Microbial Manipulator of Arthropod Reproduction | url = | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 71–102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.71 | pmid=10547686}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

As described by Stouthamer, the invasion threshold may be crossed in two ways.&lt;ref name="Stouthamer"/&gt; 
*In small populations, a small number of infected individuals is sufficient to reach the invasion threshold
*In bigger populations, the division of the population into small subpopulations that only exchange a low number of individuals in each generation can lead to an invasion of this subpopulation.

===Speciation===
It is speculated that ''CI'' can lead to "rapid [[speciation]]".&lt;ref name="Werren" /&gt; When two populations of the same species are infected by two ''Wolbachia'' strains A and B, they might be bidirectionally incompatible and crosses between the two populations do not lead to viable offspring. Thus gene flow between these two populations is interrupted, leading to constant segregation in development and, finally, to speciation. The populations develop to a point where incompatibility would be maintained even in absence of ''Wolbachia''.

== Other pathogens ==
''Wolbachia'' are not the only bacteria capable of inducing CI. For example, researchers have found that infection by bacteria of the genus ''[[Cardinium]]'' can also result in CI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gotoh | first1 = T | last2 = Noda | first2 = H | last3 = Ito | first3 = S | year = 2007 | title = Cardinium symbionts cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in spider mites | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 98 | issue = 1| pages = 13–20 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800881 | pmid=17035954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Imagebreeder example.png|thumb|200px|right|An image generated using an [[evolutionary algorithm]]]]

'''Evolutionary art''' is a branch of [[generative art]], in which the artist does not do the work of constructing the artwork, but rather lets a system do the construction.  In evolutionary art, initially generated art is put through an iterated process of selection and modification to arrive at a final product, where it is the artist who is the selective agent.

Evolutionary art is to be distinguished from [[BioArt]], which uses living organisms as the material medium instead of paint, stone, metal, etc.

==Overview==
In common with biological [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]] or [[animal husbandry]], the members of a population undergoing artificial evolution modify their form or behavior over many reproductive generations in response to a selective regime.

In [[interactive evolutionary computation|interactive evolution]] the selective regime may be applied by the viewer explicitly by selecting individuals which are aesthetically pleasing. Alternatively a [[selection pressure]] can be generated implicitly, for example according to the length of time a viewer spends near a piece of evolving art.

Equally, evolution may be employed as a mechanism for generating a dynamic world of adaptive individuals, in which the [[selection pressure]] is imposed by the program, and the viewer plays no role in selection, as in the [[Black Shoals]] project.

[[File:Frederick Wollaston Hutton.gif|right|thumb|Frederick Wollaston Hutton]]

Captain '''Frederick Wollaston Hutton''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], (16 November 1836&amp;nbsp;– 27 October 1905) was an English-New Zealand scientist who applied the theory of [[natural selection]] to explain the origins and nature of the [[natural history]] of [[New Zealand]]. An army officer in early life, he then had an academic career in geology and biology. He became one of the most able and prolific nineteenth century naturalists of New Zealand.

== Biography ==
[[File:Hutton plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque to Hutton in [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]]]]
Hutton was born in [[Gate Burton]], Lincolnshire, England and passed through [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] [[Grammar school]] and the [[Royal Navy|Naval Academy]] at [[Gosport]], Hampshire. He studied [[applied science]] at [[King's College London]] before being commissioned in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] and fighting in the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Hutton"&gt;{{DNZB|Parton|H. N.|2h59|Hutton, Frederick Wollaston|4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton returned to England in 1860, and continued to study geology at [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], being elected to the [[Geological Society of London]] in the same year. Hutton married Annie Gouger Montgomerie in 1863, and resigned his commission in 1866 to travel with his wife and two children to New Zealand, where four more children would follow. They lived initially in [[Waikato]], where Hutton tried his hand at [[flax]] milling, but he soon changed back to geology, joining the Geological Survey of New Zealand in 1866 and becoming Provincial Geologist of [[Otago]] in 1874. At the same time, he was made lecturer in geology at the [[University of Otago]] and curator of the museum there along with Emile Campbell-Browne (1830–1925). Hutton became professor of biology at [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury College]] in 1880, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1892. The following year, he also took on the curatorship of the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]]. Towards the end of his life, Hutton was made president of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]]. He was awarded the [[Clarke Medal]] by the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]] in 1891. He was founding President of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] from 1904 to his death in 1905; he was followed by [[Sir James Hector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/our-council/presidents/ |title=Royal Society  Te Aparangi - Presidents |publisher=[[Royal Society of New Zealand ]] |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked successively at the [[Colonial Museum]], Wellington (1871–1873); [[Otago Museum]], Dunedin (1877–1879); and the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]], Christchurch (1887–1905)

Hutton died on the return voyage from England on 27 October 1905, and was [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] off [[Cape Town]], South Africa. He is commemorated in the [[Hutton Memorial Medal and Research Fund]], awarded for scientific works bearing on the [[zoology]], [[botany]] or geology of New Zealand. [[Hutton's shearwater]] (''Puffinus huttoni''), a sea bird, was named after him.

==Evolution==

In 1860, he wrote a supportive review of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' for the journal, ''[[The Geologist]]''.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse"&gt;Stenhouse, John. (1990). ''Darwin's Captain: F. W. Hutton and the Nineteenth-Century Darwinian Debates''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]'' 23 (3): 411-442.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he wrote an article defending Darwinism in the same journal.&lt;ref name=Geologist1961&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=Frederick Wollaston|title=Some remarks on Mr. Darwin's theory.|journal=The Geologist|date=1861|volume=4|pages=132–136|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/174362#page/142/mode/1up|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton defended Darwin from the criticisms of creationist [[Adam Sedgwick]], which he described as "gross ironical misrepresentations". He wrote that creationism was a "mere assertion, an evasion of the question, a cloak for ignorance."&lt;ref name="Stenhouse"/&gt; 

Throughout his life, Hutton remained a staunch exponent of Darwin's theories of [[natural selection]], and Darwin himself expressed his appreciation in a letter to Hutton.&lt;ref name="Stenhouse"/&gt;

In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=Free thought – Define Free thought at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs.

==Definition==
Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].

Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[The nature of God in Western theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Symbol==
[[Image:Pansy aka.jpg|thumb|The [[pansy]], symbol of freethought]]

The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Monk, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=0-472-06938-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=1-57181-299-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3485-8 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{Main|Organized secularism}}
The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches. The longest continuously operating Freethought congregation in America is the Free Congregation of Sauk County, Wisconsin, which was founded in 1852 and is still active {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}. It affiliated with the [[American Unitarian Association]] (now the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name="Sauk County Freethinkers"&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Free Congregation of Sauk County: The "Freethinkers" Story | publisher = Free Congregation of Sauk County | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | accessdate = 2012-02-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326214734/http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | archivedate = 2012-03-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England.

In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada. HAC, also known as Humanist Canada, operates as an active voice for humanism in Canada{{cn|date=May 2018}} and supports the activities of groups who wish to raise awareness about secular issues.

The [http://www.secularalliance.ca Canadian Secular Alliance] is an active community.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–32 |id= |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Geist''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡaɪst}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun with a degree of importance in [[German philosophy]]. Its [[semantic field]] corresponds to English [[ghost]], [[spirit]], [[mind]], [[intellect]]. Some English translators resort to using "spirit/mind" or "spirit (mind)" to help convey the meaning of the term.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marvin Pate. ''From Plato to Jesus: What Does Philosophy Have to Do with Theology?''. 2011, page 69.
Rosenkranz, Karl. ''Hegel, as the national philosopher of Germany''. 1874, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Geist'' is also a central concept in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s 1807 ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes''). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of [[world history]] of the late 18th century, include  '''''Weltgeist''''' "world-spirit", '''''Volksgeist''''' "national spirit"  and  '''''Zeitgeist'''''   "spirit of the age".

==Etymology and translation==
{{see|Spirit|Pneuma|Psyche (psychology)}}
German ''Geist'' (masculine gender) continues [[Old High German]] ''geist'', attested as the translation of Latin ''spiritus''. 
It is the direct cognate of English ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'', from a [[West Germanic]] ''gaistaz''. Its derivation from a [[PIE root]] ''g̑heis-'' "to be agitated, frightened" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening  (c.f. English [[:wikt:ghastly|ghastly]]) apparitions or [[ghost]]s, and may also have carried the connotation of "ecstatic agitation, ''[[odhr|furor]]''" related to the cult of [[Germanic Mercury]]. 
As the translation of biblical Latin ''spiritus'' (Greek πνεῦμα) "[[pneuma|spirit, breath]]" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the [[Holy Spirit]] (Old English ''sē hālga gāst'' "the Holy Ghost", OHG '' ther heilago geist'', Modern German ''der Heilige Geist'').
The English word is in competition with Latinate ''spirit'' from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;As observed by [[Alexander Gil]], ''The sacred philosophy of the holy scripture: laid down... in... the apostles'' (1635): "The word Ghost in English [...] is as much as athem, or breath; in our new Latin language, a Spirit." Spenser in 1590 could still say ''No knight so rude, I weene, As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost'' (''[[Faerie Queene]]'' II. viii. 26), by "sleeping ghost" referring to the sleeping mind of a living person, not the ghost of a deceased one.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German noun much like English ''spirit'' could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead,  to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the "spirit of wine", i.e. [[ethanol]]. 
However, its special meaning of "[[mind]], [[intellect]]" never shared by English ''ghost'' is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French ''esprit''.
In this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.
''Geist'' could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.
It is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of ''geistlich'' "spiritual, pertaining to religion" vs. ''geistig'' "intellectual, pertaining to the mind" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts  is made by the adjective ''geisterhaft'' "ghostly, spectral".&lt;ref name=Pfeifer&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Geist#et-1 Geist] in Wolfgang Pfeifer, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch'' ([1989] 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[German compounds|compounds]] are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as ''Geistesgegenwart'' = ''présence d'esprit'' ("mental presence, acuity"), ''Geistesabwesenheit'' = ''absence d’esprit'' ("mental absence,  distraction"), ''geisteskrank'' "mentally ill", ''geistreich'' "witty, intellectually brilliant", ''geistlos'' "unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous" etc. 
It is from these developments that certain German compounds containing ''-geist'' have been loaned into English, such as ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

German ''Geist'' in this particular sense of "mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain ''Geist'' as a German loanword.

== Hegelianism ==
''Geist'' is a central concept in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (''Phänomenologie des Geistes'').  According to Hegel, the ''Weltgeist'' ("world spirit") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  ''Weltgeist'' is effected in history through the [[mediation]] of various ''[[Volksgeist]]er'' ("national spirits"), the [[hero|great men]] of history, such as [[Napoleon]], are the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This has led some to claim that Hegel favored the [[great man theory]], although his [[philosophy of history]], in particular concerning the role of the "[[universality (philosophy)|universal]] state" (''Universalstaat'', which means a universal "order" or "statute" rather than "[[State (polity)|state]]"), and of an "End of History" is much more complex.

For Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by ''Geist'' or ''absolute spirit'', by a "ruse of reason" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the [[teleology|teleological]] principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.

''Weltgeist'', the world spirit concept, designates an [[idealism|idealistic]] principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained [[objective reality]] as its product. (See [[metaphysical objectivism]]) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all paid homage, amongst other things, to the [[concept]] of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.

==''Weltgeist''==
{{see|Anima Mundi}}
''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of "secularism, impiety, irreligiosity" (''spiritus mundi''), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of  "man of the world", "mundane or secular person".
Also from the 17th century, ''Weltgeist'' acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of "world-spirit" or "world-soul" (''anima mundi, spiritus universi'') in the sense of [[Panentheism]], a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction  between [[magnetic force|magnet and iron]] or between [[Gravity|Moon and tide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GW16923#XGW16923 Weltgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of ''Weltgeist'' in the sense of ''anima mundi'' became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, ''der Geist'' on its own could refer to this concept, as in [[Christian Thomasius]], ''Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes'' (1709).&lt;ref&gt; Rudolf Eisler''Wörterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe'' (1904),  406ff., 1760f.&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in a ''Weltgeist'' as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of [[Goethe]], in the later part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, ''Geist der Göthezeit'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the  poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the ''Weltgeist'' 
appears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of [[Nature]].
&lt;ref&gt;J. U. von König, ''Gedichte'' (1745) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;
''Weltgeist'' in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of [[God]] and can be attributed agency and will. 
[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], who tended to prefer the form ''Weltengeist'' (as it were "spirit of worlds"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:
:'' O Weltengeist, Bist du so gütig, wie du mächtig bist, Enthülle mir, den du mitfühlend zwar, Und doch so grausam schufst, erkläre mir Das Loos der Fühlenden, die durch mich leiden.''
:"O World-spirit, be as benevolent as you are powerful and reveal to me, whom you have created with compassion and yet cruelly, explain to me the lot of the sentient, who suffer through me"&lt;ref&gt;Herder, "Die Gärten der Hesperiden", ''Ausgewählte Werke'' 1, ed. Kurz (1871), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895)]]
The term was notably embraced by [[Hegel]] and his followers in the early 19th century.
For the 19th century, the term as used by [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Hegel (1807)]] became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing [[world history]]:
:''Im Gange der Geschichte ist das eine wesentliche Moment die Erhaltung eines Volkes [...] das andere Moment aber ist, daß der Bestand eines Volksgeistes, wie er ist, durchbrochen wird, weil er sich ausgeschöpft und ausgearbeitet hat, daß die Weltgeschichte, der Weltgeist fortgeht.''
:"In the course of history one relevant factor is the preservation of a [[Volk|nation]] [...] while the other factor is that the continued existence of a national spirit [''Volksgeist''] is interrupted because it has exhausted and spent itself, so that world history, the world spirit [''Weltgeist''], proceeds."&lt;ref&gt; Hegel, ''Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte''  (ed. 1944), 96f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's description of [[Napoleon]] as "the world-soul on horseback" (''die Weltseele zu Pferde'') became proverbial.
The phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in  a letter written  on 13 October 1806, the day before the [[Battle of Jena]], to his friend   [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt konzentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}
Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', 
Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.&lt;ref&gt;L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''[[Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen]]'', who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes"  (''schlechte Witze'').&lt;ref&gt;''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770],&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Volksgeist''==
{{redirect|National spirit|the racehorse|National Spirit (horse)|the horse race|National Spirit Hurdle}}
{{see|National character|Ethnic essentialism}}
''Volksgeist'' or ''Nationalgeist'' refers to a "spirit" of an individual [[Volk|people (''Volk'')]], its "national spirit" or "national character".
The term ''Nationalgeist'' is used in the 1760s by [[Justus Möser]] and by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The term ''Nation'' at this time is used in the sense of ''[[:wikt:natio#Latin|natio]]'' "nation, ethnic group, race", mostly replaced by the term ''Volk'' after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Mährlein, ''Volksgeist und Recht. Hegels Philosophie der Einheit und ihre Bedeutung in der Rechtswissenschaft'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, Würzburg (2000), 17f.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 19th century, the term ''Volksgeist'' was used by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] in order to express the "popular" sense of [[justice]].
Savigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an ''esprit des nations '' used by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essai sur les mœurs et l’esprit des nations'', 1756.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the ''esprit général'' invoked by  [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vom Geist der Gesetze'', 1748.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel uses the term in his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''.
Based on the Hegelian use of the term, [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in the mid-19th-century established the field of ''Völkerpsychologie'' ("psychology of nations").

In Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. In the history of cultures, [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. In the history of the State or political history, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In the field of law, [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and in the field of psychology [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to [[Romanticism]] as it is commonly known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: ''Volksgeist-Herri Gogoa. Ilustraziotik nazismora'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], "… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist."{{huh|date=March 2018}}{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

==''Zeitgeist''==
{{main article|Zeitgeist}}
{{See also|Multiple discovery|Epochalism}}
The compound ''Zeitgeist''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zeitgeist oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times") similarly to ''Weltgeist'' describes 
an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in [[world history]].
The term is now mostly associated with [[Hegel]], contrasting with Hegel's use of ''Volksgeist'' "national spirit" and ''Weltgeist'' "world-spirit", 
but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to  a [[fad|fashion or fad]] which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=StF&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |author=Eero Saarinen |title=Shaping the Future |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-972-48812-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel in ''[[Phenomenology of the Spirit]]'' (1807) uses both ''Weltgeist'' and ''Volksgeist'' but prefers the phrase ''Geist der Zeiten'' "spirit of the times" over the [[German compound|compound]] ''Zeitgeist''.&lt;ref&gt;
c.f. use of the phrase {{lang|de|der Geist seiner Zeit}} ("the spirit of his time") in  ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit." {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Zeitgeist |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-847-06591-9 &lt;!--|ISBN=1-84706591-0 --&gt;|chapter=Zeitgeist (p. 262)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a  "free and ethical culture".{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, John Shannon. ''Aesthetics &amp; The Philosophy Of Spirit''. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used more widely in the  sense of an intellectual or aesthetic [[fashion]] or [[fad]].
For example, [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 proposition that [[evolution]] occurs by [[natural selection]] has been cited as a case of the ''zeitgeist'' of the epoch, an idea "whose time had come", seeing that his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], was outlining similar models during the same period.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"&gt;Hothersall, D., "History of Psychology", 2004, {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of [[logical positivism]] in the 1920s, leading to a focus on [[behaviorism]] and [[blank-slatism]] over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s,  the  shift from behaviorism to [[post-modernism]] and [[critical theory]]  can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic "zeitgeist".&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
''Zeitgeist'' in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his "theory of [[leadership]]"&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and in other publications describing models of business or industry.
[[Malcolm Gladwell]] argued in his book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.

[[Image:Moc2 166b msss.gif|thumb|200px|Dark dune spots]]

'''Martian geysers''' (or '''{{chem|CO|2}} jets''') are putative sites of small gas and dust eruptions that occur in the [[Planum Australe|south polar region]] of [[Mars]] during the spring thaw. "Dark dune spots" and "spiders" – or araneiforms &lt;ref name=Portyankina2014 &gt;{{cite journal|title=Araneiform|journal=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms |page=1 |date=2014|first=Ganna|last=Portyankina|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_540-1|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_540-1|isbn=978-1-4614-9213-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – are the two most visible types of features ascribed to these eruptions.

They are unlike any terrestrial geological phenomenon. The reflectance ([[albedo]]), shapes and unusual spider appearance of these features have stimulated a variety of hypotheses about their origin, ranging from differences in frosting reflectance, to explanations involving biological processes. However, all current geophysical models assume some sort of jet or [[geyser]]-like activity on Mars.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manrubia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kieffer2000 &gt;{{Cite journal|first=H.

The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear at exactly the same place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated that dark dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) condensing as “[[dry ice]]” and sublimating.&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It was also initially suggested that the dark spots were simply warm patches of bare ground, but thermal imaging during 2006 revealed that these structures were as cold as the ice that covers the area,&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;  indicating they were a thin layer of dark material lying on top of the ice and kept chilled by it.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  However, soon after their first detection, they were discovered to be negative topographical features – i.e. radial troughs or channels of what today are thought to be geyser-like vent systems.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manrubia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieffer2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kieffer2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Portyankina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clathrate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hugh2006 /&gt;

The geysers' two most prominent features (dark dune spots and spider channels) appear at the beginning of the Martian spring on dune fields covered with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 'dry ice'), mainly at the ridges and slopes of the dunes; by the beginning of winter, they disappear. Dark spots' shape is generally round, on the slopes it is usually elongated, sometimes with streams—possibly of water—that accumulate in pools at the bottom of the dunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual change of Martian DDS-seepages|journal=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVI |date=2005|first=A.|last=Horváth|author2=Kereszturi, Á. |author3=Bérczi, Sz. |display-authors=etal|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1128.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andras &gt;{{cite journal|title=Probable Evidences of Recent Biological Activity on Mars: Appearance and Growing of Dark Dune Spots in the South Polar Region|journal=32nd Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Houston, Texas, abstract no.1543|date=12–16 March 2001|first=Tibor|last=Gánti |author2=András Horváth |author3=Szaniszló Bérczi |author4=Albert Gesztesi |author5=Eörs Szathmáry|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2001/pdf/1543.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark dune spots are typically 15 to 46 metres (50 to 150 feet) wide and spaced several hundred feet apart.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  The size of spots varies, and some are as small as 20 m across,&lt;ref name=Malin1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Planetary &gt;{{Cite journal |title=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIII - Morphological Analysis of the Dark Dune Spots on Mars: New Aspects in Biological Interpretation| editors=A.

Time-lapsed imagery performed by NASA confirms the apparent ejection of dark material following the radial growth of spider channels in the ice.&lt;ref name=2006-100 /&gt;  Time-lapsed imaging of a single area of interest also shows that small dark spots generally indicate the position of spider features not yet visible; it also shows that spots expand significantly, including dark fans emanating from some of the spots, which increase in prominence and develop clear directionality indicative of wind action.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;

Some branching ravines modify, some destroy and others create crust in a dynamic near-surface process that extensively reworks the terrain creating and destroying surface layers. Thus, Mars seems to have a dynamic process of recycling of its near surface crust of carbon dioxide. Growth process is rapid, happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars.&lt;ref name=Ness /&gt;  A number of [[Geophysics|geophysical]] models have been investigated to explain the various colors and shapes' development of these geysers on the southern polar ice cap of Mars.

===Atmospheric pressure===
The surface atmospheric pressure on Mars varies annually around: 6.7–8.8 mbar and 7.5–9.7 mbar; daily around 6.4–6.8 mbar. Because of the pressure changes subsurface gases expand and contract periodically, causing a downward gas flow during increase of and expulsion during decrease of atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;  This cycle was first quantified with measurements of the surface pressure, which varies annually with amplitude of 25%.&lt;ref name=Piqueux2003 /&gt;

;Clathrate hydrate model
This model proposes downward gas flow during increase of and upward flow during decrease of atmospheric pressure. In the defrosting process, ices (clathrate) may partly migrate into the soil and partly may evaporate.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ness /&gt;  These locations can be in connection with the formation of dark dune spots and the arms of spiders as gas travel paths.&lt;ref name=clathrate /&gt;

===Carbon dioxide and water cycling===
[[Image:Defrosting Sand.jpg|thumb|200px|Dark dune spots]]
[[Michael C. Malin]], a planetary scientist and designer of the cameras used by the Mars Global Surveyor that obtained the earliest images of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; geyser phenomenon, is studying the images acquired of specific areas and he tracks their changes over a period of a few years. In 2000, he modelled the fans and spots' dynamics as a complex process of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water sublimation and re-precipitation. The typical pattern of defrosting proceeds from the initiation of small, dark spots typically located at the margins of dunes; these spots individually enlarge and eventually all coalesce.&lt;ref name=Malin2000 &gt;{{Cite book| first=Michael C.| last=Malin |author2=K. S. Edgett| contribution=Frosting and Defrosting of Martian Polar Dunes| title=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| publisher=Malin Space Science Systems| date=2000| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1056.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=3 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern the enlargement follows is distinct and characteristic: a dark nuclear spot enlarges slowly, often with a bright outer zone or 'halo'. As these are progressive, centripetal phenomena, each location of the light zone is overtaken by an expanding dark zone. Although initially developed along dune margins, spot formation quickly spreads onto and between dunes. As spring progresses, fan-shaped tails ('spiders') develop from the central spot. Defrosting occurs as the low albedo polar sand heats beneath an optically thin layer of frost, causing the frost to evaporate. This is the dark nucleus of the spots seen on dunes. As the vapor moves laterally, it encounters cold air and precipitates, forming the bright halo. This precipitated frost is again vaporized as the uncovered zone of sand expands; the cycle repeats many times.&lt;ref name=LPS2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Malin2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeng /&gt;

While the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) has not yet formulated a theory or model, they have stated that the process of frost sublimation is not compatible with a few important features observed in the images, and that the location and shape of the spots is at odds with a physical explanation, specifically, because the channels appear to radiate downhill as much as they radiate uphill, defying gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Martian spots warrant a close look | date=13 March 2002 | publisher=European Space Agency | url =http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ASE4YZ9KOYC_FeatureWeek_1.html#subhead2 | accessdate =18 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ASE4YZ9KOYC_FeatureWeek_0.html |title=Martian spots warrant a close look |accessdate=8 September 2009 |date=13 March 2002 |publisher=European Space Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothetical biological origin==
[[Image:DDS MSO.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DDS-MSO hypothesis.]]
A team of Hungarian scientists propose that the dark dune spots and channels may be colonies of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, and as the [[sunlight]] returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesise and heat their immediate surroundings. A pocket of liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly in the thin Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When it has completely melted, they rapidly desiccate and turn black surrounded by a grey aureole.&lt;ref name=Andras /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Pócs, T. |author2=A. Horváth |author3=T.

== Development ==
The God Helmet was not specifically designed to elicit visions of God,&lt;ref name="Ruttan, Persinger &amp; Koren"/&gt; but to test several of Persinger's hypotheses about brain function. The first of these is the Vectorial Hemisphericity Hypothesis,&lt;ref name=PMID_8321608&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Persinger |first1 = M A |title = Vectorial cerebral hemisphericity as differential sources for the sensed presence, mystical experiences and religious conversions |journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills |pmid = 8321608 |pages = 915–30 |issue = 3 Pt 1 |volume = 76 |year = 1993 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.76.3.915}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes that the human sense of self has two components, one on each side of the brain, that ordinarily work together but in which the left hemisphere is usually dominant.&lt;ref name=PMID_12193838&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Persinger |first1 = Michael A |last2 = Healey |first2 = Faye |title = Experimental facilitation of the sensed presence: possible intercalation between the hemispheres induced by complex magnetic fields |journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |pmid = 12193838 |pages = 533–41 |issue = 8 |volume = 190 |year = 2002 |doi = 10.1097/00005053-200208000-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PMID_12661700/&gt; Persinger argues that the two hemispheres make different contributions to a single sense of self, but under certain conditions can appear as two separate 'selves'. Persinger and Koren designed the God Helmet in an attempt to create conditions in which contributions to the sense of self from both cerebral hemispheres is disrupted.

== The device ==
Persinger uses a modified snowmobile helmet that incorporates [[solenoids]] placed over the temporal lobes. This device produces magnetic fields that Persinger describes as "weak but complex"&lt;ref name="weak but complex"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=J. N. |last2=Koren |first2=S.

=== Comparison with TMS ===
Neither the God Helmet, nor technologies derived from it, are examples of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), which uses magnetic fields on the order of one million times stronger than those used in Persinger's lab.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdaleTMS/&gt; Despite this, Persinger reports similar effect sizes with his apparatus.&lt;ref name=Induction_of_Mystical_and_Altered_States/&gt; The magnetic fields employed in TMS and in Persinger's experiments are also very different. TMS uses single, paired, and repetitive pulses of high intensity to penetrate the cranium.&lt;ref name="Burst firing"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Auvichayapat |first1=P |last2=Auvichayapat |first2=N |title=Basic principle of transcranial magnetic stimulation |journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand |volume=92 |issue=11 |pages=1560–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19938752}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Persinger's apparatus uses weak complex magnetic signals patterned after physiological processes, such as one derived from limbic burst firing.&lt;ref name="Richards PM, Persinger MA, Koren SA 1993 71–85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMS principles"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meli |first1=Salvatore C. |last2=Persinger |first2=Michael A. |title=Red Light Facilitates the Sensed Presence Elicited by Application of Weak, Burst-Firing Magnetic Fields Over the Temporal Lobes |journal=International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=68–75 |year=2009 |pmid=19116832 |doi=10.1080/00207450802507689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiences ==
Most reports from Persinger's lab consist of people sensing "presences"; people often interpreted these to be that of angels, a deceased being known to the subject, or a group of beings of some kind. There have also been reports in which the participant has experienced what they perceive as God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The neuropsychiatry of paranormal experiences | author=Persinger, MA | journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry &amp; Clinical Neurosciences | year=2001 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=515–524 | url=https://neurocogconsultants.box.com/s/l9f7tld3yjny4b00eqbq#/s/l9f7tld3yjny4b00eqbq/11/207365383/1583355479/1 | doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.13.4.515 | pmid=11748322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persinger reports that "at least" 80 percent of his participants experience a presence beside them in the room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Experimental Facilitation of the Sensed Presence Is Predicted By The Specific Patterns of the Applied Magnetic Fields, Not By Suggestibility: Re-analysis of 19 Experiments | author=St-Pierre, LS, Persinger, MA | journal=International Journal of Neuroscience | year=2006 | volume=116 | pages=1079–1095 | doi=10.1080/00207450600808800 | pmid=16861170 | issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others report less evocative experiences of "another consciousness or sentient being".&lt;ref name="sentient being"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=J.

=== Anecdotal reports ===
The scientist and science writer [[Richard Dawkins]], appearing in the [[BBC]] science documentary series ''Horizon'', did not have a 'sensed presence' experience,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707080824/http://current.com/items/88832741/richard_dawkins_puts_on_the_god_helmet.htm Video footage, see 3:04-7 and 3:32-43]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead felt at times 'slightly dizzy', 'quite strange' and had sensations in his limbs and changes in his breathing. He summarised his experience as follows: "It pretty much felt as though I was in total darkness, with a helmet on my head and pleasantly relaxed".&lt;ref name=DawkinsVid/&gt; Persinger explained Dawkins' limited results in terms of his low score on a psychological scale measuring temporal lobe sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/godonbrain.shtml BBC Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the experimental psychologist, and former [[parapsychology]] researcher, [[Susan Blackmore]] said: "When I went to Persinger's lab and underwent his procedures I had the most extraordinary experiences I've ever had… I'll be surprised if it turns out to be a [[placebo]] effect."&lt;ref name="NatureNews"/&gt;

Jack Hitt, a journalist from ''Wired'' magazine, visited Persinger's lab in 1999 and expressed confusion over Persinger's post-stimulation debriefing ("One question: Did the red bulb on the wall grow larger or smaller? There was a red bulb on the wall? I hadn't noticed.") and reported: "Many other questions suggest that there were other experiences I should have had, but to be honest, I didn't. In fact, as transcendental experiences go, on a scale of 1 to 10, Persinger's helmet falls somewhere around, oh, 4. Even though I did have a fairly convincing out-of-body experience, I'm disappointed relative to the great expectations and anxieties I had going in."&lt;ref name=Hitt&gt;{{cite news | volume=7 | issue=11 | date=Nov 1999 | title=This Is Your Brain on God | author=Jack Hitt | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/persinger.html | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replication attempts and debate ==
In December 2004 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that a group of Swedish researchers led by Pehr Granqvist, a [[psychologist]] at [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]], had attempted to replicate Persinger's experiments under [[double-blind]] conditions, and were not able to reproduce the effect.&lt;ref name="NatureNews"/&gt; The study was published in ''[[Neuroscience Letters]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=Granqvist/&gt; Granqvist ''et al'' concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any [[religious experience|religious or spiritual experience]] reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Persinger, however, took issue with the Swedish attempt to replicate his work. "They didn't replicate it, not even close," he says.&lt;ref name="NatureNews"/&gt; He argued that the Swedish group did not expose the subjects to magnetic fields for long enough to produce an effect. Granqvist ''et al.'' respond that Persinger agreed with their proposed methodology beforehand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laurentian.ca/Laurentian/Home/Departments/Behavioural+Neuroscience/Correspondence/Email+1.htm?Laurentian_Lang=en-CA|title=Email between Persinger and Granqvist November 2004|access-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807061925/http://www.laurentian.ca/Laurentian/Home/Departments/Behavioural+Neuroscience/Correspondence/Email+1.htm?Laurentian_Lang=en-CA|archive-date=2011-08-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldwebsite.laurentian.ca/neurosci/_news/news.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095746/http://oldwebsite.laurentian.ca/neurosci/_news/news.htm |archive-date=2007-08-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they stand by their replication.&lt;ref name=Larsson/&gt;

The theoretical basis for the God helmet, especially the connection between [[temporal lobe]] function and mystic experiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Persinger |first1=MA |title=Religious and mystical experiences as artifacts of temporal lobe function: a general hypothesis |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=57 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=1255–62 |year=1983 |pmid=6664802 |doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.3f.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Persinger |first1=MA |title=Paranormal and religious beliefs may be mediated differentially by subcortical and cortical phenomenological processes of the temporal (limbic) lobes |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=247–51 |year=1993 |pmid=8451133 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.76.1.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been questioned.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdaleTLE/&gt;

Only one group unconnected to Persinger's lab has so far succeeded in replicating&lt;ref name="Tinoca_Oritz"/&gt; the effects of one of Persinger's early studies.&lt;ref name="Richards_1993"/&gt; They reported that their experiment had ruled out suggestibility as an explanation for Persinger's effects, and that analysis of their subjects’ verbal reports revealed significant differences between the speech of subjects and controls, as well as less robust effects for suggestion and expectation.

Other groups have subsequently found that [[individual differences]] such as strong belief in the paranormal and magical ideation predict some alterations in consciousness and reported "exceptional experiences" when Persinger et al's experimental set-up and procedure are reproduced, but with a sham "God helmet" that is completely inert or a helmet that is turned off. These groups have concluded that psychological factors must have played an important role in prior experiments.&lt;ref name=Simmonds-Moore&gt;{{cite | title=Exceptional Experiences Following Exposure to a Sham “God Helmet”: Evidence for Placebo, Individual Difference, and Time of Day Influences | author=Christine Simmonds-Moore, Donadrian L.

== Related devices and studies ==
Persinger and colleagues also developed a device nicknamed "The Octopus" which uses solenoids around the whole [[brain]], in a circle just above subject's ears. Commercial versions of the God helmet, Octopus and associated devices are sold by Persinger’s research associate Todd Murphy, and he reports that his devices are able to modulate emotional states in addition to enhancing meditation and generating altered states. One experiment found no changes in emotional responses to photographs whether the device was on or off,&lt;ref name=AaenStockdaleMurphy&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Psychologist | author=Craig Aaen-Stockdale | title=Neuroscience for the Soul | url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=25&amp;editionID=215&amp;ArticleID=2097 | year=2012 | volume=25 | issue=7 | pages=520–523 | quote=Murphy claims his devices are able to modulate emotional states in addition to enhancing meditation and generating altered states.

One published attempt to test Persinger's theories regarding the [[Michael Persinger#Tectonic Strain Theory|psychological effects of environmental magnetic fields]], used whole-body exposure to magnetic fields and ultrasound in freely-moving participants to create a "haunted room" within which it was hoped subjects would sense a "presence". The study found that reports of unusual experiences were unrelated with the presence or absence of "complex" environmental electromagnetic fields similar to Persinger's. They concluded that the effects were likely due to suggestibility, though they did not directly measure it.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The "Haunt" project: An attempt to build a "haunted" room by manipulating complex electromagnetic fields and infrasound | author=French, CC., Haque, U., Bunton-Stasyshyn, R., Davis, R. | journal=Cortex | volume=45 | issue=5 | pages=619–629 | year=2009 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.10.011 | pmid=18635163| url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/4209/2/French_et_al_Haunt_accepted.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Coast Survey Schooner ''Hassler''''' was the first iron-hulled [[steamboat|steamship]] used in the service of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast Survey]].

==Ship history==
Plans for a new ship to chart the waters of [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. Pacific Coast]] were drawn up in early 1870 by [[Carlile Pollock Patterson|Carlile Patterson]], the Hydrographic Inspector of the U.S. Coast Survey. Patterson called for an iron-hulled ship of about 325 tons, with a draft of no more than {{Convert|9|ft}} and a top speed of {{Convert|8|kn}}. He required that the ship used no more than 2½ tons of coal per day, and could hold two months provisions for a crew of 37.  The resulting ship was built in 1871 at the [[River Iron Works]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]], under the supervision of [[John H. Dialogue]].  She was a three-masted [[schooner]], equipped with a {{Convert|125|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[steeple compound engine]], and cost $62,000 to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/maritime/expeditions/hassler/innovative.html |title=2007 Hassler Expedition - An Innovative Ship |work=sanctuaries.noaa.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871-72 the ship sailed on the '''''Hassler'' Expedition''', under Commander [[Philip Carrigan Johnson]], brother of the artist [[Eastman Johnson]]. This was the first important scientific expedition sent by the government for [[marine (ocean)|marine]] exploration.  The expedition included Professor [[Louis Agassiz]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz|Elizabeth Agassiz]]; Mrs. Johnson; Dr. [[Franz Steindachner]], [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]]; Dr. Thomas Hill, [[botany|botanist]]; and Count [[Louis François de Pourtalès|L. F. de Pourtalès]], [[Joel Asaph Allen|J. A. Allen]], and others.

The steamer left [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] December 4, 1871, and reached [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in August 1872.  On the way to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] surface observations were made.  Deep-sea dredging was done at [[Barbados]] and along the [[Brazil]]ian coast.  At the [[Strait of Magellan|Straits of Magellan]] frequent stops were made, and at particularly interesting places several days were spent, and inland excursions undertaken, especially to examine [[glacier]]s.  Throughout the route collections were made, with much of this material deposited in the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at [[Harvard University]].  Some of the [[zoological]] results of the expedition were published by Agassiz, [[Theodore Lyman (Massachusetts)|Lyman]], and Pourtalès.

After nearly 25 years in service, mostly around the Alaskan coast, the ''Hassler'' was finally decommissioned on May 25, 1895. In August 1897 she was sold to the McGuire Brothers for $15,700, and renamed '''''Clara Nevada'''''. She sailed from [[Seattle]] on January 26, 1898, with a crew of 40 men, bound for [[Skagway, Alaska]] with 165 passengers heading for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike gold fields]]. Late on February 5, 1898, the ''Clara Nevada'' left Skagway with between 25 and 40 passengers aboard. During the night she struck an uncharted rock several hundred yards north of [[Eldred Rock]] and sank immediately. There were no survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/maritime/expeditions/hassler/last_days.html |title=2007 Hassler Expedition - Hassler/Clara Nevada's last days |work=sanctuaries.noaa.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herman Daniel “Denny” Farrell Jr.''' (February 4, 1932 – May 26, 2018) was an American politician from [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[New York State Assembly]] representing the [[Manhattan]] neighborhoods of [[Harlem#West_Harlem|West Harlem]], [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] from 1975 to 2017.

==Early Life==
Farrell was born February 4, 1932 in Manhattan. His parents, Herman, Sr. and Amy Gladys, owned a dress shop. He graduated from [[George Washington Educational Campus|George Washington High School]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. Before working in politics, he was a cook and an auto mechanic.

He worked for Mayor [[John Lindsay]], then, in 1966, began work as a confidential aide to a state Supreme Court justice.

==Political career==
In 1970, he was elected a Democratic state committeeman.  First elected to the New York Assembly in 1974, Farrell was a longtime Chairman of the powerful Assembly Ways and Means Committee, as well as a member of the Assembly Rules Committee and the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus. He previously served as Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Banks from 1979 to 1994.

Farrell played a pivotal role in the passage of several significant pieces of legislation, including the Omnibus Consumer Protection and Banking Legislation Act, which established a toll-free number at the New York State Banking Department that dispenses information about [[credit card interest]] rates, fees and grace periods, and a mandate for banks to furnish low-cost checking accounts to its customers. He also played an important role in the passage of the Neighborhood Preservation Companies Act, whereby New York State funds community organizations that "provide tenant advocacy."

However, Farrell is most widely known for having been a prominent member of the state (and to a lesser extent, national) [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He was first elected as a Democratic State Committeeman in 1970, serving a two-year term. Subsequently, he was elected as the Leader of the [[Manhattan|New York County]] Democratic Party (1981-2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://manhattandemocrats.org/about/county-leaders New York County Democratic Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice-Chair of the New York State Democratic Party, in which capacity he served for a decade. He was Chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee from 2001 to 2006. He also served as a member of the [[Democratic National Committee]].  Farrell resigned from the State Assembly in September 2017.

===Campaign for Mayor===
Farrell entered the Democratic primary against [[Ed Koch]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1985|1985 election for Mayor]]. Although Farrell’s entry into the race initially created some bad blood, [[David Dinkins]] credited him for paving the way for Dinkins’ victory in [[New York City mayoral election, 1989|1989]].&lt;ref name=''NYDNObit''/&gt;

Farrell’s late entry into the race was a surprise to the party and caused a split between party leaders in Manhattan and the outer boroughs and between black and Latino politicians. At the time, Bronx Borough President [[Herman Badillo]] believed he would win the endorsement of the Coalition for a Just New York, one of the city’s black political organizations, to form a coalition that could unseat Koch.&lt;ref name=''Split''&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/18/nyregion/endorsement-of-farrell-splits-minority-caucus.html |title=Endorsement of Farrell Splits Minority Caucus |publisher=New York Times |date=1985-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He recovered from an attempt by Council President [[Carol Bellamy]] to remove him from the ballot but still fared poorly taking 13% of the vote and finishing third behind Bellamy and Koch.&lt;ref name=''1985Result''&gt;{{cite news |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1985/09/11/nyregion/koch-takes-primary-easily-stein-and-dinkins-also-win-backing-of-city-democrats.html |title=Koch Takes Primary Easily; Stein and Dinkins Also Win Backing of City Democrats |publisher=New York Times |date=1985-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the split, black leaders from around New York City met to settle past differences and focus on uniting for future elections. David Dinkins strength with black voters helped him defeat Koch in 1989 to become mayor.&lt;ref name=''Dinkins''&gt;{{cite news |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/nyregion/blacks-started-dinkin-s-bid-in-a-symbolic-river-crossing.html |title=Blacks Started Dinkin's Bid In a Symbolic River-Crossing |publisher=New York Times |date=1989-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Life==
A pedestrian bridge constructed in [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] in late 2017 was named after Farrell as it is located within his Assembly district.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Kevin, [http://forgotten-ny.com/2018/01/herman-denny-farrell-bridge-washington-heights/ "Herman "Denny" Farrell Bridge"] January 16, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell died of heart failure on May 26, 2018, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=''NYTObit''&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/26/obituaries/herman-denny-farrell-jr.html |title=Herman D.

'''Hugh F. Hanrahan''' (16 January 1947 – 19 May 1999) was a member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] for the [[Edmonton—Strathcona]] [[electoral district]] from 1993 to 1997. His career has been in [[education]] and [[writing]].

Hanrahan was born in [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]], where he would study arts and education at [[St. Francis Xavier University]], then moved to Ottawa to obtain a master's degree in education at the [[University of Ottawa]]. He moved to Edmonton where he was a teacher in the city's Roman Catholic school system for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/1/parlbus/chambus/house/debates/240_1999-06-08/han240_1515-e.htm | work=House of Commons Debates (Hansard) | date=8 June 1999 | title=The Late Hugh Hanrahan | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[35th Canadian Parliament]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] for the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform party]]. He left Canadian politics for health reasons after his term in Parliament ended with the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]]. In May 1999, Hanrahan died suddenly following an acute stomach infection. He was survived by his wife and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Teacher, former MP mourned | publisher=''[[Edmonton Journal]]'' | date=25 May 1999 | page=B2 | first=Johanna | last=Kowal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22123">The '''Human Connectome Project''' ('''HCP''') is a five-year project sponsored by sixteen components of the [[National Institutes of Health]], split between two consortia of research institutions. The project was launched in July 2009&lt;ref name = "NIH_2009-07-15" /&gt; as the first of three Grand Challenges of the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research.&lt;ref name = "NIH_Blueprint" /&gt; On September 15, 2010, the NIH announced that it would award two grants: $30 million over five years to a consortium led by [[Washington University in Saint Louis]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], with strong contributions from Oxford University (FMRIB) and $8.5 million over three years to a consortium led by [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and the [[University of California Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name = "NIH_2010-09-15" /&gt;

The goal of the Human Connectome Project is to build a "network map" ([[connectome]]) that will shed light on the anatomical and functional connectivity within the healthy [[human brain]], as well as to produce a body of data that will facilitate research into [[brain disorder]]s such as [[dyslexia]], [[autism]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name = "BBC_2013-02-16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20285 |title=Human brain mapped in unprecedented detail |journal=Nature |year=2016 |last1=Geddes |first1=Linda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 16, 2018, the project has yet to be officially declared complete.

==WU-Minn-Oxford consortium==
The WU-Minn-Oxford consortium developed improved MRI instrumentation, image acquisition and image analysis methods for mapping the connectivity in the human brain at spatial resolutions significantly better than previously available; using these methods, WI-Minn-Oxford consortium collected a large amount of MRI and behavioral data on 1,200 healthy adults — twin pairs and their siblings from 300 families - using a special 3 Tesla MRI instrument. In addition, it scanned 184 subjects from this pool at 7 Tesla, with higher spatial resolution. The data are being analyzed to show the anatomical and functional connections between parts of the brain for each individual, and will be related to behavioral test data. Comparing the [[connectome]]s and genetic data of genetically [[identical twins]] with fraternal twins will reveal the relative contributions of genes and environment in shaping brain circuitry and pinpoint relevant [[genetic variation]]. The maps will also shed light on how brain networks are organized.

Using a combination of [[Minimally-invasive procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[imaging technologies]], including [[resting state fMRI|resting-state fMRI]] and task-based [[functional MRI]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[EEG]], and [[diffusion MRI]], the WU-Minn will be mapping [[connectome]]s at the macro scale — [[Brain mapping|mapping large brain systems]] that can be divided into anatomically and functionally distinct areas, rather than mapping individual [[neuron]]s.

Dozens of investigators and researchers from nine institutions have contributed to this project. Research institutions include: Washington University in Saint Louis, the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Oxford University]], [[Saint Louis University]], [[Indiana University]], [[D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara]], [[Ernst Strungmann Institute]], [[Warwick University]], Advanced MRI Technologies, and the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$40 Million Awarded to Trace Human Brain’s Connections|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov:80/science-news/2010/40-million-awarded-to-trace-human-brains-connections.shtml|publisher=NIMH|accessdate=March 12, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110052518/http://www.nimh.nih.gov:80/science-news/2010/40-million-awarded-to-trace-human-brains-connections.shtml|archivedate=January 10, 2012|date=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data that results from this research is being made publicly available in an open-source web-accessible neuroinformatics platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humanconnectome.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://db.humanconnectome.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==MGH/Harvard-UCLA consortium==
The MGH/Harvard-UCLA consortium will focus on optimizing MRI technology for imaging the brain’s structural connections using [[diffusion MRI]], with a goal of increasing [[spatial resolution]], quality, and speed. Diffusion MRI, employed in both projects, maps the brain's fibrous long distance connections by tracking the motion of water. Water [[diffusion]] patterns in different types of cells allow the detection of different types of tissues. Using this imaging method, the long extensions of neurons, called [[white matter]], can be seen in sharp relief.&lt;ref name = "UCLA_LNI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Qiuyun|last2=Witzel|first2=Thomas|last3=Nummenmaa|first3=Aapo|last4=Van Dijk|first4=Koene R.

==Behavioral testing and measurement==
To understand the relationship between brain connectivity and behavior better, the Human Connectome Project will use a reliable and well-validated battery of measures that assess a wide range of human functions. The core of its battery is the tools and methods developed by the [[NIH Toolbox]] for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral function.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanconnectome.org/about/project/behavioral-testing.html, Retrieved 2013-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Connectome Project has grown into a large group of research teams. These teams make use of the style of brain scanning developed by the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.4361 |pmid=27571196 |title=The Human Connectome Project's neuroimaging approach |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1175–87 |year=2016 |last1=Glasser |first1=Matthew F |last2=Smith |first2=Stephen M |last3=Marcus |first3=Daniel S |last4=Andersson |first4=Jesper L R |last5=Auerbach |first5=Edward J |last6=Behrens |first6=Timothy E J |last7=Coalson |first7=Timothy S |last8=Harms |first8=Michael P |last9=Jenkinson |first9=Mark |last10=Moeller |first10=Steen |last11=Robinson |first11=Emma C |last12=Sotiropoulos |first12=Stamatios N |last13=Xu |first13=Junqian |last14=Yacoub |first14=Essa |last15=Ugurbil |first15=Kamil |last16=Van Essen |first16=David C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies usually include using large groups of participants, scanning many angles of participants' brains, and carefully documenting the location of the structures in each participant's brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/|title=Connectome - Homepage|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies affiliated with the Human Connectome Project are currently cataloged by the Connectome Coordination Facility. The studies fall into three categories: Healthy Adult Connectomes, Lifespan Connectome Data, and Connectomes Related to Human Disease. Under each of these categories are research groups working on specific questions.

=== Healthy Adult Connectomes ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult|title=HCP Young Adult - Connectome - Publications|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Connectome Project Young Adult study made data on the brain connections of 1100 healthy young adults available to the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/publications-using-hcp-data.php&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have used data from the study to support theories about which areas of the brain communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=pmid28231395&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/ejn.13544 |pmid=28231395 |title=Functional connectivity in amygdalar-sensory/(pre)motor networks at rest: New evidence from the Human Connectome Project |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1224–1229 |year=2017 |last1=Toschi |first1=Nicola |last2=Duggento |first2=Andrea |last3=Passamonti |first3=Luca }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study used data from the project to show that the [[amygdala]], a part of the brain essential for emotional processing, is connected to the parts of the brain that receive information from the senses and plan movement.&lt;ref name=pmid27744495&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11682-016-9642-2 |pmid=27744495 |title=White matter integrity in brain networks relevant to anxiety and depression: Evidence from the human connectome project dataset |journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1604–1615 |year=2016 |last1=De Witte |first1=Nele A. J |last2=Mueller |first2=Sven C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that healthy individuals who had a high tendency to experience anxious or depressed mood had fewer connections between the amygdala and a number of brain areas related to attention.

=== Lifespan Connectome Data ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies|title=Connectome - HCP Lifespan Studies|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently four research groups collecting data on connections in the brains of populations other than young adults. The purpose of these groups is to determine ordinary brain connectivity during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and aging. Scientists will use the data from these research groups in the same manner in which they have used data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study.

=== Connectomes Related to Human Disease ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/disease-studies|title=Connectome - Human Connectome Studies Related To Disease|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen research groups investigate how connections in the brain change during the course of a particular disease. Four of the groups focus on [[Alzheimer's Disease]] or [[dementia]]. Alzheimer's Disease and dementia are diseases that begin during aging. Memory loss and cognitive impairment mark the progression of these diseases. While scientists consider Alzheimer's Disease to be a disease with a specific cause, dementia actually describes symptoms which could be attributed to a number of causes. Two other research groups investigate how diseases that disrupt vision change connectivity in the brain. Another four of the research groups focus on [[anxiety disorders]] and [[Major Depressive Disorder]], psychological disorders that result in abnormal emotional regulation. Two more of the research groups focus on the effects of [[psychosis]], a symptom of some psychological disorders in which an individual perceives reality differently than others do. One of the teams researches [[epilepsy]], a disease characterized by seizures. Finally, one research team is documenting the brain connections of the [[Amish]] people, a religious and ethnic group that has high rates of some [[psychological disorders]].

Although theories have been put forth about the way brain connections change in the diseases under investigation, many of these theories have been supported by data from healthy populations.&lt;ref name=pmid27744495/&gt; For example, an analysis of the brains of healthy individuals supported the theory that individuals with anxiety disorders and depression have less connectivity between their emotional centers and the areas that govern attention. By collecting data specifically from individuals with these diseases, researchers hope to have a more certain idea of how brain connections in these individuals change over time.

{{Humanism|Organizations = Kurdish Humanist Association|Kurdish Humanist Association = }} 
'''''Humanist Manifesto''''' is the title of three [[manifesto]]s laying out a [[Humanism|Humanist]] worldview.  They are the original ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' (1933, often referred to as Humanist Manifesto I), the ''[[Humanist Manifesto II]]'' (1973), and ''[[Humanism and Its Aspirations]]'' (2003, a.k.a. ''[http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/humanist_manifesto_iii Humanist Manifesto III]'').  The Manifesto originally arose from [[religious Humanism]], though [[secular Humanism|secular Humanists]] also signed.

The central theme of all three ''manifestos'' is the elaboration of a [[philosophy]] and value system which does not necessarily include belief in any personal deity or "higher power", although the three differ considerably in their tone, form, and ambition.  Each has been signed at its launch by various prominent members of [[academia]] and others who are in general agreement with its principles.

In addition, there is a similar document entitled ''[[A Secular Humanist Declaration]]'' published in 1980 by the [[Council for Secular Humanism]].

==Humanist Manifesto I==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{main article|Humanist Manifesto I}}
The first manifesto, entitled simply ''A Humanist Manifesto'', was written in 1933 primarily by [[Roy Wood Sellars]] and [[Raymond Bragg]] and was published with 34 signatories including philosopher [[John Dewey]].  Unlike the later ones, the first Manifesto talked of a new "[[religion]]", and referred to Humanism as a religious movement to transcend and replace previous religions that were based on allegations of supernatural revelation.  The document outlines a fifteen-point belief system, which, in addition to a secular outlook, opposes "acquisitive and profit-motivated society" and outlines a worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation, language which was considerably softened by the Humanists' board, owners of the document, twenty years later.

The title "A Humanist Manifesto"—rather than "The Humanist Manifesto"—was intentional, predictive of later Manifestos to follow, as indeed has been the case. Unlike the creeds of major organized religions, the setting out of Humanist ideals in these Manifestos is an ongoing process. Indeed, in some communities of Humanists the compilation of personal Manifestos is actively encouraged, and throughout the Humanist movement it is accepted that the Humanist Manifestos are not permanent or authoritative dogmas but are to be subject to ongoing critique.

==Humanist Manifesto II==
{{main article|Humanist Manifesto II}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The second Manifesto was written in 1973 by [[Paul Kurtz]] and [[Edwin H. Wilson]], and was intended to update and replace the previous one.  It begins with a statement that the excesses of [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]] had made the first seem "far too optimistic", and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version.  Nevertheless, much of the unbridled optimism of the first remained, with hopes stated that war would become obsolete and poverty would be eliminated.

Many of the proposals in the document, such as opposition to [[racism]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]] and support of strong [[human rights]], are fairly uncontroversial, and its prescriptions that [[divorce]] and [[birth control]] should be legal and that [[technology]] can improve life are widely accepted today in much of the [[Western world]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Furthermore, its proposal of an [[international court]] has [[International Court of Justice|since been implemented]].  However, in addition to its rejection of supernaturalism, various controversial stances are strongly supported, notably the right to [[abortion]].

Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the [[American Humanist Association|AHA]] website encourages visitors to add their own name.  A provision at the end noted that signators do "not necessarily endors[e] every detail" of the document.

Among the oft-quoted lines from this 1973 Manifesto are, "No deity will save us; we must save ourselves," and "We are responsible for what we are and for what we will be," both of which may present difficulties for members of certain Christian, Jewish, and Muslim sects, or other believers in doctrines of submission to the will of an all-powerful God.

Expanding upon the role the public education establishment should play to bring about the goals described in the Humanist Manifesto II, [[John Dunphy]] wrote: "I am convinced that the battle for humankind's future must be waged and won in the public school classroom by teachers that correctly perceive their role
as proselytizers of a new faith: a religion of humanity
that recognizes and respects the spark of what theologians
call divinity in every human being...The classroom must and will become an arena of conflict between the old and new -- the rotting corpse of Christianity, together with all its adjacent evils and misery, and the new faith of humanism, resplendent with the promise of a world in which the never-realized Christian ideal of 'love thy neighbor' will finally be achieved."  &lt;ref&gt;Dunphy, J., A Religion for a New Age, The Humanist, January–February 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanist Manifesto III==
{{see main|Humanism and Its Aspirations}}

''Humanism and Its Aspirations'', subtitled ''Humanist Manifesto III, a successor to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933'', was published in 2003 by the [[American Humanist Association | AHA]], and was written by committee. Signatories included 21 Nobel laureates. The new document is the successor to the previous ones, and the name "Humanist Manifesto" is the property of the American Humanist Association.

The newest manifesto is deliberately much shorter, listing seven primary themes, which echo those from its predecessors [http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III]  :

* Knowledge of the world is derived by observation, experimentation, and rational analysis.  (See [[empiricism]].)
* Humans are an integral part of nature, the result of [[evolution]]ary change, an unguided process.
* [[ethics|Ethical]] values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience.  (See [[ethical naturalism]].)
* Life’s fulfillment emerges from individual participation in the service of humane ideals.
* Humans are social by nature and find meaning in relationships.
* Working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness.

==Other Manifestos for Humanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Aside from the official Humanist Manifestos of the [[American Humanist Association]] ("AHA"), there have been other similar documents.  "Humanist Manifesto" is a [[trademark]] of the AHA. Formulation of new statements in emulation of the three Humanist Manifestos is encouraged, and examples follow.

===A Secular Humanist Declaration===
{{main article|A Secular Humanist Declaration}}
In 1980, the [[Council for Secular Humanism]], founded by [[Paul Kurtz]], which is typically more detailed in its discussions regarding the function of Humanism than the AHA, published what is in effect its manifesto, entitled ''[[A Secular Humanist Declaration]]''.  It has as its main points:

# Free Inquiry 
# Separation of Church and State
# The Ideal of Freedom
# Ethics Based on Critical Intelligence
# Moral Education
# Religious Skepticism
# Reason
# Science and Technology
# Evolution
# Education

'''A Secular Humanist Declaration''' was an argument for and statement of support for [[democracy|democratic]] [[secular humanism]].  The document was issued in 1980 by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism ("CODESH"), now the [[Council for Secular Humanism]] ("CSH"). Compiled by [[Paul Kurtz]], it is largely a restatement of the content of the [[American Humanist Association]]'s 1973 [[Humanist Manifesto II]], of which he was co-author with [[Edwin H. Wilson]]. Both Wilson and Kurtz had served as editors of ''[[The Humanist]]'', from which Kurtz departed in 1979 and thereafter set about establishing his own movement and his own periodical. His Secular Humanist Declaration was the starting point for these enterprises.

===Humanist Manifesto 2000===
''Humanist Manifesto 2000: A Call for New Planetary Humanism'' is a book by [[Paul Kurtz]] published in 2000.  It differs from the other three in that it is a full-length book rather than essay-length, and was published not by the American Humanist Association but by the [[Council for Secular Humanism]]. In it, Kurtz argues for many of the points already formulated in Humanist Manifesto 2, of which he had been co-author in 1973.

===Amsterdam Declaration===
{{main article|Amsterdam Declaration}}

The '''Amsterdam Declaration 2002''' is a statement of the fundamental principles of modern [[Humanism]] passed unanimously by the General Assembly of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) at the 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress in 2002. According to the IHEU, the declaration "is the official statement of World Humanism."

It is officially supported by all member organisations of the IHEU including:

*[[American Humanist Association]]
*[[British Humanist Association]]
*[[Humanist Canada]]
*[[Council of Australian Humanist Societies]]
*[[Council for Secular Humanism]]
*[[Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association]]
*[[Human-Etisk Forbund]], the Norwegian Humanist Association
*[[Humanist Association of Ireland]]
*[[Indian Humanist Union]]

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Intracerebral hemorrhage''' ('''ICH'''), also known as '''cerebral bleed''', is a type of [[intracranial bleed]] that occurs within the [[intraparenchymal bleed|brain tissue]] or [[intraventricular hemorrhages|ventricles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naidich|first1=Thomas P.|last2=Castillo|first2=Mauricio|last3=Cha|first3=Soonmee|last4=Smirniotopoulos|first4=James G.|title=Imaging of the Brain, Expert Radiology Series,1: Imaging of the Brain|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1416050094|page=387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUfZSKldJRwC&amp;pg=PA387|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002094230/https://books.google.com/books?id=TUfZSKldJRwC&amp;pg=PA387|archivedate=2016-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can include [[headache]], one-sided weakness, vomiting, seizures, [[decreased level of consciousness]], and [[neck stiffness]].&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; Often symptoms get worse over time.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; [[Fever]] is also common.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; In many cases bleeding is present in both the brain tissue and the ventricles.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes include [[brain trauma]], [[brain aneurysm|aneurysm]]s, [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, and [[brain tumors]].&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; The largest risk factors for spontaneous bleeding are [[high blood pressure]] and [[amyloidosis]].&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; Other risk factors include [[alcoholism]], [[low cholesterol]], [[blood thinners]], and [[cocaine]] use.&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; Diagnosis is typically by [[CT scan]].&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; Other conditions that may present similarly include [[ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref name=Hem2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemphill JC|first1=3rd|last2=Greenberg|first2=SM|last3=Anderson|first3=CS|last4=Becker|first4=K|last5=Bendok|first5=BR|last6=Cushman|first6=M|last7=Fung|first7=GL|last8=Goldstein|first8=JN|last9=Macdonald|first9=RL|last10=Mitchell|first10=PH|last11=Scott|first11=PA|last12=Selim|first12=MH|last13=Woo|first13=D|last14=American Heart Association Stroke|first14=Council|last15=Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke|first15=Nursing|last16=Council on Clinical|first16=Cardiology|title=Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association|journal=Stroke: A Journal of Cerebral Circulation|date=July 2015|volume=46|issue=7|pages=2032–60|pmid=26022637|doi=10.1161/str.0000000000000069|pmc=4462131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Treatment should typically be carried out in an [[intensive care unit]].&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; Guidelines recommended decreasing the [[blood pressure]] to a [[systolic blood pressure|systolic]] of 140&amp;nbsp;mmHg.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ko |first1=SB |last2=Yoon |first2=BW |title=Blood Pressure Management for Acute Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke: The Evidence |journal=Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |date=December 2017 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=718–725 |doi=10.1055/s-0037-1608777 |pmid=29262429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood thinners should be reversed if possible and [[blood sugar]] kept in the normal range.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; Surgery to place a [[ventricular drain]] may be used to treat [[hydrocephalus]] but [[corticosteroids]] should not be used.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt; Surgery to remove the blood is useful in certain cases.&lt;ref name=Hem2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Cerebral bleeding affects about 2.5 per 10,000 people each year.&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; It occurs more often in males and older people.&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; About 44% of those affected die within a month.&lt;ref name=Ca2012/&gt; A good outcome occurs in about 20% of those affected.&lt;ref name=Ca2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caceres|first1=JA|last2=Goldstein|first2=JN|title=Intracranial hemorrhage|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=August 2012|volume=30|issue=3|pages=771–94|pmid=22974648|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2012.06.003|pmc=3443867}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stroke]]s were first divided into their two major types, bleeding and insufficient blood flow, in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennerici|first1=Michael|title=Imaging in Stroke|date=2003|publisher=Remedica|isbn=9781901346251|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RG6be-FhMxEC&amp;pg=PA1|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002095126/https://books.google.com/books?id=RG6be-FhMxEC&amp;pg=PA1|archivedate=2016-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with intracerebral bleeding have symptoms that correspond to the functions controlled by the area of the brain that is damaged by the bleed.&lt;ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"&gt;Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2888.htm "Penetrating Head Trauma."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913061516/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2888.htm |date=2005-09-13 }} Emedicine.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symptoms include those that indicate a rise in [[intracranial pressure]] caused by a large mass putting pressure on the brain.&lt;ref name="Vinas and Pilistis"/&gt;
Intracerebral bleeds are often misdiagnosed as [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]s due to the similarity in symptoms and signs. A severe headache followed by vomiting is one of the more common symptoms of intracerebral hemorrhage. Another common symptom is a patient can collapse. Some people may experience continuous bleeding from the ear. Some patients may also go into a coma before the bleed is noticed.

Traumautic intracerebral hematomas are divided into acute and delayed. Acute intracerebral hematomas occur at the time of the injury while delayed intracerebral hematomas have been reported from as early as 6 hours post injury to as long as several weeks.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Intracerebral hemorrhage.jpg|thumb|Spontaneous ICH with [[hydrocephalus]] on CT scan&lt;ref name="Yadav07"/&gt;]]
Both [[computed tomography angiography]] (CTA) and [[magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA) have been proved to be effective in diagnosing intracranial vascular malformations after ICH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography for detection of intracranial vascular malformations in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage|last = Josephson|first = Colin B|last2 = White|first2 = Philip M|last3 = Krishan|first3 = Ashma|last4 = Al-Shahi Salman|first4 = Rustum|date = 1 September 2014|journal = The Cochrane Library|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009372.pub2|pmid = 25177839|volume = 9|issue = 9|pages = CD009372|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; So frequently, a CT angiogram will be performed in order to exclude a secondary cause of hemorrhage&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeung R, Ahmad T, Aviv RI, Noel de Tilly L, Fox AJ, Symons SP | year = 2009 | title = Comparison of CTA to DSA in determining the etiology of spontaneous ICH | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 176–180 | doi=10.1017/s0317167100006533}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to detect a "spot sign".

[[Intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] can be recognized on [[CT scan]]s because blood appears brighter than other tissue and is separated from the inner table of the skull by brain tissue. The tissue surrounding a bleed is often less dense than the rest of the brain because of [[edema]], and therefore shows up darker on the CT scan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Location ===
When due to [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], intracerebral hemorrhages typically occur in the [[putamen]] (50%) or [[thalamus]] (15%), cerebrum (10-20%), cerebellum (10-13%), pons (7-15%), or elsewhere in the brainstem (1-6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Mark S. |title= Handbook of Neurosurgery |date= 2016|isbn= 9781626232419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prayson|first1=Richard A.|title=Neuropathology|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1437709490|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmNSdcu14HEC&amp;pg=PA49|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312043001/https://books.google.com/books?id=DmNSdcu14HEC&amp;pg=PA49|archivedate=2017-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment depends substantially on the type of ICH. Rapid [[CT scan]] and other diagnostic measures are used to determine proper treatment, which may include both medication and surgery.

However, in large controlled studies, corticosteroids have been found to increase mortality rates and are no longer recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Ian|last1=Roberts|first2=David|last2=Yates|first3=Peter|last3=Sandercock|first4=Barbara|last4=Farrell|title=Effect of intravenous corticosteroids on death within 14 days in 10008 adults with clinically significant head injury (MRC CRASH trial): randomised placebo-controlled trial|journal=Lancet|date=9 October 2016|issn=1474-547X|pages=1321–1328|volume=364|issue=9442|pmid=15474134|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17188-2|first5=Jonathan|last5=Wasserberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=P|last2=Arango|first2=M|last3=Balica|first3=L|last4=Cottingham|first4=R|last5=El-Sayed|first5=H|first35=collaborators.|title=Final results of MRC CRASH, a randomised placebo-controlled trial of intravenous corticosteroid in adults with head injury-outcomes at 6 months|journal=Lancet|date=undefined NaN|volume=365|issue=9475|pages=1957–9|pmid=15936423|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)66552-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
Surgery is required if the [[hematoma]] is greater than {{convert|3|cm|0|abbr=on}}, if there is a structural [[vascular]] [[lesion]] or [[lobe (anatomy)|lobar]] [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] in a young patient.&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;

*A [[catheter]] may be passed into the brain [[vasculature]] to close off or dilate [[blood vessel]]s, avoiding invasive surgical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmc.edu/2424.html Cedars-Sinai Health System - Cerebral Hemorrhages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312064211/http://csmc.edu/2424.html |date=2009-03-12 }} Retrieved on 02/25/2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aspiration by [[stereotactic surgery]] or [[endoscopic]] drainage may be used in [[basal ganglia]] hemorrhages, although successful reports are limited.&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;
*A [[Decompressive craniectomy|craniectomy]] may take place, where part of the skull is removed to allow a swelling brain room to expand without being squeezed.

==Prognosis==
The risk of death from an intraparenchymal bleed in traumatic brain injury is especially high when the injury occurs in the [[brain stem]].&lt;ref name="Sanders and McKenna"&gt;Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. Mosby's Paramedic Textbook, 2nd revised Ed.  Chapter 22, "Head and Facial Trauma." Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; Intraparenchymal bleeds within the [[medulla oblongata]] are almost always fatal, because they cause damage to cranial nerve X, the [[vagus nerve]], which plays an important role in [[blood circulation]] and breathing.&lt;ref name="McCaffrey"/&gt;  This kind of hemorrhage can also occur in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] or subcortical areas, usually in the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] or [[temporal lobe]]s when due to head injury, and sometimes in the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="McCaffrey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham and Gennareli "&gt;Graham DI and Gennareli TA.  Chapter 5, "Pathology of Brain Damage After Head Injury"  Cooper P and Golfinos G.  2000.  ''Head Injury'', 4th Ed. Morgan Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

For spontaneous ICH seen on CT scan, the death rate ([[mortality rate|mortality]]) is 34–50% by 30&amp;nbsp;days after the insult,&lt;ref name="Yadav07"/&gt; and half of the deaths occur in the first 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broderick|first1=J.|last2=Connolly|first2=S.|last3=Feldmann|first3=E.|last4=Hanley|first4=D.|last5=Kase|first5=C.|last6=Krieger|first6=D.|last7=Mayberg|first7=M.|last8=Morgenstern|first8=L.|last9=Ogilvy|first9=C.

'''''Kulap''''' figurines of [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] were made in [[Melanesia]]. The small [[funerary]] sculptures from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] were associated with [[Death and culture|death rituals]].&lt;ref name="metmuseumCollections"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50007035|title=Funerary Figure (Kulap)|publisher=Metropolitan Museum|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typical in the hilly [[Punam region]] of the [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] province in [[Papua New Guinea]] of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]].&lt;ref name=Barbier&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barbier-mueller.ch/collections/mers-du-sud/sculptures-des-mers-du-sud/article/limestone-ancestral-figure?lang=en|title=Limestone Ancestral Figure|accessdate=28 December 2012|publisher= The Musée Barbier-Mueller}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were believed to contain the [[soul]] of the deceased person whom they were meant to represent, and would be ritually smashed once their usefulness or the period of mourning was over. In more recent years, some have been sold in their intact forms to [[Western world|Westerners]], particularly to [[Germany|German]] administrators.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=166453|title=Kulaps|accessdate=28 December 2012|publisher=National Gallery of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The figurines were found in an intact form in the nineteenth century. However, as [[Christianity]] took roots in these islands, the belief system for Kulap figures vanished. Particularly when the [[Australia]]n administration of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] was established in 1914, the ritual practice ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt; However, during the colonial rule, the figurines were sold to Westerners for their cultural value.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt; The earliest recorded history of these figures was provided by Reverend [[George Brown (missionary)|George Brown]] during his visit to an area on the west coast at [[Patpatar]] of southern New Ireland where the language spoken was [[Hinsal]]. Brown had noted that these figures were kept in a large, painted, corner house, which was well maintained on protected land. The building had kept two, large, painted human figures (one large male figure and the other smaller but not intended for worship) inferred to be linked to some kind of superstition as people danced in front of the figures. Women and children were prohibited entry.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt; The last of the figurines was created ca. 1910.&lt;ref name="Kjellgren2007" /&gt;

==Features==
The [[chalk]] [[limestone]] used for carving Kulaps is found in the river beds of the hilly Punam region of southern New Ireland. Recent studies indicate that the figures are also from [[Muliama]] on the east coast. In villages where the language spoken is [[Patpatar]], the Kulaps are known by other names, such as ''Katpuo'' or ''Papawa'' in [[Saraha]] village.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.art-pacific.com/artifacts/nuguinea/malagan.htm|title= Malagan and other New Ireland art, Papua New Guinea|accessdate=28 December 2012|publisher=Art Pacific.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved Kulaps may sometimes be painted. They are produced by artisans from the [[Rossel Mountains]]. They may represent either men or women.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Art/&gt; Some of these figures are carved in "stylized" form and painted in pure white colour and kept in small enclosures.&lt;ref name="Geoffroy-Schneiter2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bérénice Geoffroy-Schneiter|title=Tribal arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BewzAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Vendome Press|isbn=978-0-86565-215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurines represent the dead, generally in a sitting posture. Only specific people were allowed to handle such figures as it was believed that the “spirit" or "soul of the dead” in whose commemoration it was made should be temporarily confined to these figures to prevent them from harming the village environment.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt; However, smaller images of Kulaps made of chalk are kept in houses.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt;

==Rituals==
Rituals were involved in selecting and making these figures. It involved a male relative of the deceased specifically visiting the Russel Mountain quarries&lt;ref name="Kjellgren2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kjellgren|first=Eric|title=Oceania: Art of the Pacific Islands in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_tnC5UxkeukC&amp;pg=PA162, 163|accessdate=29 December 2012|year=2007|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-238-1|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; to acquire a suitable stone. The funerary sculpture was made by specialist artists.&lt;ref name="Kjellgren2007" /&gt; The carved figure was presented to a local leader in secret,&lt;ref name="Kjellgren2007" /&gt; where it would be formally kept, sometimes standing in rows with other kulaps, within leaf-decorated mortuary structures.&lt;ref name="Kjellgren2007" /&gt; Only men were allowed to visit the ceremonial enclosure to view and perform rituals to the figures of the dead. Women and children mourned the dead relative from outside the enclosure as they were considered impure to see the figurines. After the specific period of mourning was over, the figure was removed from the shrine in secrecy and destroyed to symbolically represent the release of “the soul into the realm of the ancestors”, otherwise bad spirits could reach the ancestor.&lt;ref name=Barbier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; These funeral practices are not conducted anymore.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nwir/hd_nwir.htm|title=Helburn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=28 December 2012|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60566">{{For|a chronological list of human spaceflights, including crews, dates and mission summaries|List of human spaceflights}}

This is a '''list of human spaceflight programs''', including successful programs, programs that were canceled, and programs planned for the future. The criteria for what constitutes [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as any flight over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}}. In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} are awarded [[astronaut wings]]. This article follows the FAI definition of spaceflight.

Until the 21st century, human spaceflight programs were sponsored exclusively by governments, through either the military or civilian space agencies. With the launch of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of human spaceflight programs – [[commercial astronaut|commercial human spaceflight]] – arrived.

==Successful programs==
Programs in this section are sorted by the years when the first successful crewed spaceflight took place.

===[[Vostok program]] (USSR, 1956–1964)===
[[Image:Vostok spacecraft.jpg|thumb|300px|Model of Vostok spacecraft with third stage of launcher]]
The Vostok program was a project that succeeded in putting a person into orbit for the first time. Sergei Korolev and Konstantin Feoktistov began, in June 1956, manned spacecraft research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/project/vostok.htm#chrono&lt;/ref&gt; The program developed the [[Vostok spacecraft]] from the [[Zenit spy satellite]] project and adapted the [[Vostok rocket]] from an existing [[ICBM]] design. Just before the first release of the name Vostok to the press, it was a classified word. By August/September 1958 a division had been formed devoted to producing the first Vostok craft. The official approval (decree) for the Vostok was delayed until 22 May 1959 by competition with photo reconnaissance programs.

Vostok 1 was the first [[human spaceflight]]. The [[Vostok 3KA]] spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961, taking  into space [[Yuri Gagarin]], a [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] from the [[Soviet Union]]. The Vostok 1 mission was the first time anyone had journeyed into [[outer space]] and the first time anyone had entered into [[Orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]].

There were six Vostok flights in total. Another seven Vostok flights (Vostok 7 to 13) were originally planned, going through to April 1966, but these were canceled and the components recycled into the [[Voskhod program]], which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.

===[[Project Mercury]] (USA, 1959–1963)===&lt;!--considering how wrong the vostok timeline was, this could probably use checking as well--&gt;
[[Image:Mercury Capsule2.png|thumb|left|Mercury capsule with escape tower]]

Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the  United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. The [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] flight on 20 February 1962 was the first Mercury flight to achieve this goal.

Early planning and research was carried out by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], and the program was officially conducted by the newly created [[NASA]].

Because of their small size it was said that the Mercury spacecraft capsules were worn, not ridden. With 1.7 cubic meters of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by [[Maxime Faget|Max Faget]] and NASA's Space Task Group.

NASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20, from [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Company]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Five of the twenty spacecraft, #10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft #3 and #4 were destroyed during unmanned test flights. [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Spacecraft #11]] sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.) and received a letter designation after their number, examples 2A, 15B. Some spacecraft were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.

===[[North American X-15]] (USA, 1954–1968)===
[[Image:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in flight]]
The [[North American Aviation|North American]] X-15 [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was part of the [[X-plane (aircraft)|X-series]] of [[experimental aircraft]], initiated with the [[Bell X-1]], that were made for the [[USAF]], NASA, and the [[USN]]. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the [[Kármán line|edge of outer space]] and returning with valuable data used in [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a manned aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fastest"&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/ "Aerospaceweb.org | Aircraft Museum X-15".] Aerospaceweb.org, 24 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] criteria by exceeding the altitude of 50&amp;nbsp;miles (80.47&amp;nbsp;km. 264,000&amp;nbsp;ft.), thus qualifying the pilots for [[astronaut]] status; some pilots also qualified for NASA [[astronaut wings]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, Dennis R.

===[[Voskhod program]] (USSR, 1964–1965)===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Voskhod2.jpg|left]] --&gt;

The Voskhod program ({{lang-ru|Восход}}, ''"ascent"'', ''"dawn"'') was a Soviet human spaceflight project. Voskhod development was both a follow-on to the [[Vostok program]], recycling components left over from that program's cancellation following its first six flights. The two missions flown used the [[Voskhod spacecraft]] and [[Voskhod rocket|rocket]].

The Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the [[R-7 Semyorka]]-derived booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments.

While the Vostok program was dedicated more towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod's two flights were more aimed towards spectacular "firsts". Although achieving the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] ("spacewalk") became the main success of the program, beating the U.S. [[Gemini project]] to put the first multi-person crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the program. Once both goals were realized, the program was abandoned. This followed the change in Soviet leadership, which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the [[Soyuz program]].

===[[Project Gemini]] (USA, 1965–1966)===

[[Image:Gemini 6 7.jpg|right|250px|Gemini spacecraft on orbit]]

Project Gemini was the second human spaceflight program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It operated between Projects Mercury and Apollo, with 10 manned flights occurring in 1965 and 1966. Its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel, notably those necessary for Project Apollo, whose objective was to land humans on the Moon. Gemini missions included the first American [[Extra-vehicular activity|extravehicular activity]], and new orbital maneuvers including [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]].

Gemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the Mercury program, and thus early on was called ''Mercury Mark II''. The actual program had little in common with Mercury and was [[Big Gemini|superior to even Apollo in some ways]]. This was mainly a result of its late start date, which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the Apollo project (which, despite its later launch dates, was actually begun before Gemini).
Of all the X-15 missions, two flights by [[Joseph A. Walker]] in 1963 qualified as space flights, per the international [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] definition of a spaceflight by exceeding a 100&amp;nbsp;kilometer (62.137&amp;nbsp;mi, 328,084&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude.

===[[Soyuz program]] (USSR/Russia, 1967–ongoing)===
[[Image:Soyuz rocket ASTP.jpg|thumb|left|Soyuz rocket on launch pad.]]

The Soyuz program ({{lang-ru|Союз}}, {{IPA-ru|sɐˈjus|pron}}, meaning "Union") is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the Soviet Union in early 1967. It was originally part of a [[Moon landing]] program intended to put a Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] on the Moon. All experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]], and flights of the Lunar orbital ships around the Moon – the name [[Zond program|Zond]]. Both the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] and the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] are part of this program, which is now the responsibility of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]].

The basic [[Soyuz spacecraft]] design was the basis for many projects, many of which never came to light. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the [[Saturn V]] or the Soviet [[N1 rocket|N-1]] by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer [[Sergei Korolev|Sergei Pavlovich Korolev]], who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives actually took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.

The launch vehicles used in the Soyuz [[expendable launch system]] are manufactured at the [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center]] (TsSKB-Progress) in [[Samara, Russia]]. As well as being used in the Soyuz program as the launcher for the manned [[Soyuz spacecraft]], Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch unmanned [[Progress spacecraft|Progress supply spacecraft]] to the [[International Space Station]] and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the [[Starsem]] company.  There were 11 Soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002. Currently, Soyuz vehicles are launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in northwest Russia. Since 2009 Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref name=sitehw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |title=The Spaceport’s new Soyuz launch site is ready for installation of its mission equipment |date=October 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Arianespace]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415214124/http://www.arianespace.com/news-soyuz-vega/2008/2008-10-03-Vega-Soyuz.asp |archivedate=April 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Project Apollo]] (USA, 1961–1975)===
[[File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|[[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] used on Apollos 15–17]]

Apollo was a program undertaken by NASA during the years 1961–1975 with the goal of conducting manned [[moon landing]] missions. In 1961, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] announced a goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.  It was accomplished on July 20, 1969, by the landing of astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] orbiting above during the [[Apollo 11]] mission. Five other Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the [[Moon]], the last one in 1972. These six Apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another [[celestial body]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm 30th Anniversary of Apollo 11, Manned Apollo Missions], NASA, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by NASA, the [[space agency]] of the United States. It used [[Apollo spacecraft]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch vehicles, which were later used for the [[Skylab|Skylab program]] and the joint American-Soviet [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. These later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall Apollo program.

The goal of the program, as articulated by President Kennedy, was accomplished with only two major failures. The first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger Chaffee]], in the [[Apollo 1]] launchpad fire. The second was an in-space explosion on [[Apollo 13]], which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey. The three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves.

===[[Space Shuttle]] (USA, 1972–2011)===
[[Image:STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' launches at the start of [[STS-120]]]]
NASA's Space Shuttle, officially called "Space Transportation System" (STS), is the United States government's most recent manned launch vehicle and is retired from service {{as of|2011|lc=y}}. The winged [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] is launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven [[astronaut]]s (although eight have been carried) and up to 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]  (22&amp;nbsp;700&amp;nbsp;[[kg]]) of payload into [[low earth orbit]]. When its mission is complete, the [[Space Shuttle|shuttle]] can independently move itself out of orbit (by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines, thus slowing it down) and  [[atmospheric reentry|re-enter]] the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere. During descent and landing, the orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing.

The shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to achieve orbit and land, and the only reusable space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit. Its [[List of space shuttle missions|missions]] involve carrying large payloads to various orbits (including segments to be added to the [[International Space Station]]), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions. The orbiter can also recover [[satellite]]s and other payloads from orbit and return them to [[Earth]], but its use in this capacity is rare. However, the shuttle has previously been used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]] has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life.

===[[Shenzhou program]]me (China, 1992–ongoing)===
[[File:Post S-7 Shenzhou spacecraft.png|thumb|left]]
The Shenzhou program ({{zh|c=神舟 |p=Shén Zhōu}}) is a manned spaceflight initiative by the People's Republic of China. The program put the first Chinese citizen into orbit on 15 October 2003.

Development began in 1992, under the name of '''Project 921-1'''. The [[Space program of China|Chinese National Manned Space Program]] was given the designation [[Project 921]] with Project 921-1 as its first significant goal. The plan called for a manned launch in October 1999, prior to the new millennium. The first four unmanned test flights happened in 1999, 2001 and 2002.  These were followed with three manned launches in 2003, 2005, and 2008. Unmanned and manned launches to test docking occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It is launched on the [[Long March 2F]] from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]].  The command center of the mission is the [[Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center]].

The name is variously translated as "Divine Craft", "Divine Vessel" or similar, but is also a reference to a literary [[Names of China|name for China]] with the same pronunciation (神州; literally "Divine Land").

===[[SpaceShipOne]]/[[SpaceShipTwo]] ([[United States]], 2004–ongoing)===
[[File:SpaceShipOne Flight 15P photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|300px|right]]
[[Virgin Galactic]] is a company within [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Group]], which is developing a privately funded spacecraft in conjunction with [[Scaled Composites]] to offer [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s and later [[orbital spaceflight]]s to the paying public. SpaceShipOne reached space with a pilot in three test flights in 2004.

'''Tier One''' is [[Scaled Composites]]' program of [[suborbital]] [[human spaceflight]] using the [[Reusable launch system|reusable spacecraft]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] and its launcher [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]. The craft are designed by [[Burt Rutan]], and the project is funded 20 million US Dollars by [[Paul Allen]].  In 2004 it made the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first privately funded human spaceflight]] and won the 10 million US Dollars [[Ansari X Prize]] for the first non-governmental reusable manned spacecraft.

The objective of the project is to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space.  Tier One is not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but it is envisioned that there will be commercial spinoffs, initially in [[space tourism]].  The company [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]] was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology.  A deal with [[Virgin Galactic]] could see routine space tourism, using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.

The model finally developed into [[SpaceShipTwo]], [[Virgin Galactic]]'s second generation suborbital vehicle. On 10 October 2010, VSS ''Enterprise'', the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, made its first manned gliding test flight. By October 2014 SpaceShipTwo had conducted 54 test flights.&lt;ref name="space20141008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/27376-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-flight.html |title= Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Aces Glide Test Flight |work=Space.com |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014 |last=Wall |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2014, SpaceShipTwo VSS ''Enterprise'' suffered an in-flight breakup during a powered flight test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|title=SpaceShipTwo disaster: Industry mourns pilot but vows to keep ... - BakersfieldCalifornian.com|work=The Bakersfield Californian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044651/http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1143260271/SpaceShipTwo-experiences-in-flight-anomaly|archivedate=2015-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nbc_premature_deploy&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virgin-voyage/spaceshiptwo-feather-tail-system-deployed-prematurely-ntsb-n239721|title = SpaceShipTwo 'Feather' Tail System Deployed Prematurely: NTSB|last = |first = |date = |work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a crash killing one pilot and injuring the other.

==Successful [[Space station]] programs==

(Dates refer to periods when stations were inhabited by crews.)

===[[Salyut]] stations (USSR, 1971–1986)===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Salyut 7 from Soyuz T-13.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Salyut 7]], the final Salyut station to be launched, as seen from the departing [[Soyuz T-13]] spacecraft]] --&gt;
The Salyut program was the first [[space station]] program undertaken by the [[Soviet Union]], which consisted of a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years from 1971 to 1986. Two other Salyut launches failed.  Salyut was, on the one hand, designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military [[Almaz]] stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. [[Salyut 1]], the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station. Salyut broke several [[spaceflight records]], including several mission duration records, the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records.

*[[Salyut 1]]/DOS-1 (1971, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*[[Salyut 2]]/Almaz/OPS-1 (1973, failed shortly after launch)
*[[Salyut 3]]/Almaz/OPS-2 (1974, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*[[Salyut 4]]/DOS-4 (1975–1976, 2 crews)
*[[Salyut 5]]/Almaz/OPS-3 (1976–1977, 2 crews and 1 failed docking)
*[[Salyut 6]]/DOS-5 (1977–1981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed docking)
*[[Salyut 7]]/DOS-6 (1982–1986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed docking)

===[[Skylab]] (USA, 1973–1974)===
[[File:Skylab (SL-4).jpg|thumb]]
Skylab was launched and operated by [[NASA]] and was the [[United States]]' first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched unmanned by a modified [[Saturn V]] rocket, with a weight of {{convert|169,950|lb|MT|0}}. Three manned missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) atop the smaller [[Saturn IB]], each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two manned missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.

===[[Mir]] (USSR/Russia, 1986–2001)===
[[File:Mir Space Station viewed from Endeavour during STS-89.jpg|thumb|left]]
Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1996.  It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. Until 21 March 2001 it was the largest [[artificial satellite]] in orbit, succeeded by the [[International Space Station]] after Mir's [[Orbital decay|orbit decayed]]. The station served as a [[microgravity]] [[research]] [[laboratory]] in which crews conducted [[experiment]]s in [[biology]], [[human biology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]] and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.

Mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the [[International Space Station|ISS]].&lt;ref name="Mirrecord"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackman|first=Frank|title=ISS Passing Old Russian Mir In Crewed Time|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/asd/2010/10/28/11.xml|newspaper=Aviation Week|date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with [[Valeri Polyakov]] spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short term visits. Mir had [[List of Mir Expeditions|28 long duration crews]].

===[[International Space Station]] (USA, Russia, Japan, Europe, Canada, 1998–ongoing)===

[[File:Orange_tank_SLS_launch_through_clouds_-_Post_CDR.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Artist's rendering of a Block 1 SLS]]
The '''Space Launch System''' ('''SLS''') is an American [[Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle|Space Shuttle-derived]] heavy [[expendable launch system|expendable launch vehicle]] being designed by [[NASA]].  It follows the cancellation of the [[Constellation program]], and is to replace the retired [[Space Shuttle]]. The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] envisions the transformation of the Constellation program's [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]] vehicle designs into a single launch vehicle usable for both crew and cargo, similar to the [[Ares IV]].  SLS will be the world's most powerful rocket with 20% more thrust than [[Saturn V]] and a comparable payload capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-space-launch-system-sls-critical-design-review/38612/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/12954-nasa-rocket-powerful-space-launch-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The SLS launch vehicle is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. Its initial Block 1 version is to lift a [[payload]] of 70 [[metric ton]]s to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), which will be increased with the debut of Block 1B and the [[Exploration Upper Stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/spacerocket/space-launch-system.html |title=Space Launch System |work= aerospaceguide.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block 2 will replace the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and is planned to have an LEO capability of more than 130 metric tons to meet the congressional requirement. These upgrades will allow the SLS to lift astronauts and hardware to various beyond-LEO destinations: on a [[circumlunar trajectory]] as part of [[Exploration Mission 1]] with Block 1, to a near-Earth asteroid in [[Exploration Mission 2]] with Block 1B, and to [[Mars]] with Block 2. The SLS will launch the [[Orion (spacecraft)#Design|Orion Crew and Service Module]] and may support trips to the [[International Space Station]] if necessary. SLS will use the ground operations and launch facilities at NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida.

The first uncrewed flight is scheduled for 2019, the first crewed flight is slated for 2022.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/first-crew-flight-of-orion-likely-to-slip-two-years-to-2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[XCOR Lynx|Lynx]] (USA, 2008–2016)===
[[File:Lynx spaceplane mockup.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''XCOR Lynx''' is a [[suborbital]] [[HTHL|horizontal-takeoff, horizontal-landing]] (HTHL),
[[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket-powered]] [[spaceplane]] under development by the California-based company [[XCOR Aerospace]] to compete in the emerging suborbital spaceflight market. The Lynx is projected to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload above 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The Mark I test model will reach only {{convert|200,000|ft|km}}; the Mark II production model will be sub-orbital.

According to a September 2015 report, the first flight of the Lynx spaceplane was likely to be in the second quarter of 2016 from Midland, Texas,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrt.com/business/development/article_59287c2e-5682-11e5-b319-e7ad9e129220.html?mode=jqm&lt;/ref&gt; but the company halted spaceplane development in May 2016 and refocused on its LOX/H2 engine technology.&lt;ref name=sn20160531&gt;

'''Modular design''', or "[[modularity]] in design", is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or [[modular process skid|skids]], that can be independently created and then used in different systems. A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable, reusable modules; rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces; and making use of industry standards for interfaces.

Besides reduction in cost (due to less customization, and shorter learning time), and flexibility in design, modularity offers other benefits such as augmentation (adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module), and exclusion. Examples of modular systems are [[car]]s, [[computers]], [[Modular process skid|process systems]], [[solar panel]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, [[elevator]]s and modular buildings. Earlier examples include [[furniture]], [[loom]]s, [[railroad signal]]ing systems, [[telephone exchanges]], [[pipe organ]]s, [[Modular synthesizer|synthesizers]] and [[electric power distribution]] systems. Evolution also results in the modular design of species in that homologous modules sharing approximately the same form or function appear in different organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, M.A. (2002) Modularity in multiple disciplines. In Garud, R., Langlois, R., &amp; Kumaraswamy, A. (eds) Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks and Organizations. Oxford, England: Blackwell Publishers, pg. 203-214 {{ISBN|0631233164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers use modularity to overcome changing customer demands and to make the manufacturing process more adaptive to change (see [[modular programming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin and Clark, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Modular design is an attempt to combine the advantages of [[standardization]] (high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs) with those of [[Personalization|customization]]. A downside to modularity (and this depends on the extent of modularity) is that low quality modular systems are not optimized for performance. This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich K (1995) The role of product architecture in the manufacturing firm.

[[File:2010-04-07 Unimog at Arthur Ibbetts machinery dealership.jpg|thumb|The modular design of the [[Unimog]] offers attachment capabilities for various different [[List of agricultural machinery|implements]].]]

Aspects of modular design can be seen in cars or other [[vehicles]] to the extent of there being certain parts to the car that can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car.

A simple example of modular design in cars is the fact that, while many cars come as a basic model, paying extra will allow for "snap in" upgrades such as a more powerful engine or seasonal tires; these do not require any change to other units of the car such as the chassis, steering, electric motor or battery systems.

==In machines and architecture==
{{main article|Modular building}}
Modular design can be seen in certain buildings. Modular buildings (and also modular homes) generally consist of universal parts (or modules) that are manufactured in a [[factory]] and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/cs/buildyourhouse/g/modular.htm|title=Modular home definition|accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components. This can be done without altering larger portions of the building. Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components.

[[File:Flexible Workplace Variability.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Modular workstations]]

For example, an [[office]] building can be built using modular parts such as walls, frames, doors, ceilings, and windows. The interior can then be partitioned (or divided) with more walls and furnished with desks, computers, and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace. If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees, modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building. Later, this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a [[retail]] space, [[conference hall]] or another type of building, using the same modular components that originally formed the office building. The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions.

Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a [[guardhouse]], machine enclosure, [[press box]], [[conference room]], two-story building, [[clean room]] and many more applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliedmodular.com/products Allied Modular Products] Allied Modular. Retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|title=modular building|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140917142328/http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|archivedate=2014-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies. Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare, commercial, retail, military, and multi-family/student housing.

==In televisions==

In 1963 [[Motorola]] introduced the first rectangular color picture tube, and in 1967 introduced the modular [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand. In 1964 it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States, in Israel under the management of Moses Basin. In 1974 Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita, the parent company of Panasonic.

==In computer hardware==
[[File:Xi3 modular computer 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modular computer design]] 
Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things (e.g. cars, refrigerators, and furniture). The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether. This idea was also being implemented in [[Project Ara]], which provided a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which could then be customised by the end user.

A computer is one of the best examples of modular design. Typical modules include [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply units]], [[Central processing unit|processors]], [[mainboard]]s, [[graphics card]]s, [[hard drive]]s, and [[optical drive]]s. All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface. Similar to the computer's modularity, other tools have been developed to leverage modular design, such as [[LittleBits|littleBits Electronics]], which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits.&lt;ref name="PSFK 5.15"&gt;{{cite web|title=How One Entrepreneur Is Bringing Fringe Maker Knowledge Mainstream|url=http://www.psfk.com/2014/08/one-entrepreneur-bringing-fringe-maker-knowledge-mainstream.html|website=PSFK|publisher=PSFK|accessdate=27 May 2015|ref=PSFK|date=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modular Design, Digital Twin, and Industry 4.0 directions==
During the presentation of the [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]] centre of University of Michigan, Grieves&lt;ref&gt;Grieves, M. (2005). “Product Lifecycle Management: the new paradigm for enterprises.” Int. J. Product development 2, 71-84 &lt;/ref&gt; launched inside the modular design contest the initial idea of "Conceptual ideal for PLM", that introduces: real space, virtual space, the link for data flow from real space to virtual space, the link for information flow from virtual space to real space and virtual sub-spaces.
Egan &lt;ref&gt;Egan, M. (2004). “Implementing A Successful Modular Design-PTC´s Approach.” In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Product Structuring - Product Platform Development, Chalmers University, Göteborg, Sweden, 24.-25.03. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;([[PTC Inc]]) disclosed the strategy for an implementation of modular design in a PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) contest through a process that starts with a cross-functional input to the definition of the product architecture, and includes an architecture development program that keeps the integrity of the product during its lifecycle.  
Grieves &lt;ref&gt;Grieves, M. (2006), “[[Product Lifecycle Management]], Driving the Next Generation of Lean Thinking”, New York, McGraw-Hill &lt;/ref&gt;has produced an effective definition of [[digital twin]]: “A strategic business approach that applies a consistent set of business solutions in support of the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, and use of product definition information across the extended enterprise from concept to end of life –integrating people, processes, business systems, and information”.

==Integrating Lifecycle and Energy assessments into modular design ==
Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time. Trancossi &lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M. A response to industrial maturity and energetic issues: a possible solution based on constructal law. Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2015) 7: 2. doi:10.1007/s12544-014-0150-4&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the [[constructal law]]. In fact, the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bejan A., and Lorente S., “Constructal theory of generation of configuration in nature and engineering”, J. Appl. Phys., 100, 2006, doi:10.1063/1.2221896&lt;/ref&gt; It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema: 
* a system can be divided into subsystems (elemental parts) using tree models;
* any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system; 
* analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system; 
* by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones, it is possible to improve the performances of the system. 
A better formulation has been produced during the MAAT EU FP7 Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/99650_en.html | title=Multibody Advanced Airship for Transport &amp;#124; Projects &amp;#124; FP7-TRANSPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new design method that couples the above bottom-up optimization with a preliminary system level top-down design has been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;Dumas A, Madonia M, Trancossi M, Vucinic D (2013) Propulsion of photovoltaic cruiser-feeder airships dimensioning by constructal design for efficiency method.

'''Necklacing''' is the practice of [[extrajudicial]] [[summary execution]] and torture carried out by forcing a rubber [[tire|tyre]], filled with [[Gasoline|petrol]], around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on [[fire]]. The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process.&lt;ref name="urlDeath By Tire Fire: A History Of Necklacing In Apartheid South Africa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/necklacing |title=Death By Tire Fire: A History Of "Necklacing" In Apartheid South Africa |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South Africa==
Necklacing was used by the black community to punish its members who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Human Being Died That Night: Forgiving Apartheid's Chief Killer|author=Pumla Godobo-Madikizela|year=2006|publisher=Portobello Books|page=147|ISBN=1-84627-053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necklacing primarily police informants; the practice was often carried out in the name of the struggle, although the ANC executive body condemned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/southafrica1/6.htm|title=The Black Struggle for Political Power: Major Forces in the Conflict|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fihlani|first=Pumza|title=Is necklacing returning to South Africa?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14914526|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2013|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Winnie Mandela]], then-wife of the imprisoned [[Nelson Mandela]], stated, "With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country", which was widely seen as an explicit endorsement of necklacing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnie Madikizela-Mandela|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/winnie-madikizela-mandela|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,110268,00.html|title=Row over 'mother of the nation' Winnie Mandela|work=The Guardian|date=27 January 1989|author=David Beresford |accessdate=2008-05-01|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time caused the ANC to distance itself from her,&lt;ref name="africafiles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnie Madikizela Mandela: Tragic figure? Populist tribune?

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: OurMatches&amp;TyreNecklaceswewillFreeSouthAfrica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"With our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country." - Winnie Mandela (1986)&lt;ref&gt;http://cofcc.org/2012/02/mandela-health-problems-renew-fears-of-mass-genocide-in-south-africa/&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt; 

The first victim of necklacing, according to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was a young woman, [[Maki Skosana]], on 20 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/hrvtrans/duduza/moloko.htm |title=Truth And Reconciliation Commission |publisher=Doj.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Moloko said her sister was burned to death with a tire around her neck while attending the funeral of one of the youths. Her body had been scorched by fire and some broken pieces of glass had been inserted into her vagina, Moloko told the committee. Moloko added that a big rock had been thrown on her face after she had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1997/9702/s970204c.htm|date=4 February 1997|publisher=SAPA|title=Truth Commission Looks at First "Necklace" Murder|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Photojournalist [[Kevin Carter]] was the first to photograph a public execution by necklacing in South Africa in the mid-1980s. He later spoke of the images: {{quote|I was appalled at what they were doing. I was appalled at what I was doing. But then people started talking about those pictures ... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timporter.com/firstdraft/archives/000071.html|title=Covering War in a Free Society|date=18 February 2003|accessdate=2008-02-18|author=Tim Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He went on to say: {{quote|After having seen so many necklacings on the news, it occurs to me that either many others were being performed (off camera as it were) and this was just the tip of the iceberg, or that the presence of the camera completed the last requirement, and acted as a catalyst in this terrible reaction. The strong message that was being sent, was only meaningful if it were carried by the media. It was not more about the warning (others) than about causing one person pain. The question that haunts me is 'would those people have been necklaced, if there was no media coverage?'}}

Author Lynda Schuster writes, {{quote|"Necklacing" represented the worst of the excesses committed in the name of the uprising. This was a particularly gruesome form of mob justice, reserved for those thought to be government collaborators, informers and black policemen. The executioners would force a car tire over the head and around the arms of the suspect, drench it in petrol, and set it alight. Immobilized, the victim burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vhsim3fPF8C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304|title=A Burning Hunger: One Family's Struggle Against Apartheid|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2004|author=Lynda Schuster&lt;!--|isbn=9780821416518--&gt;|isbn=9780821416525|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some commentators have noted that the practice of necklacing served to escalate the levels of violence during the township wars of the 1980s and early 1990s as security force members became brutalized and afraid that they might fall victim to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Turton, A.R. 2010.

==In other countries==
This practice of [[lynching]] is found in [[Haiti]]. It was prominently used against supporters of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]'s dictatorship at the beginning of the democratic transition, from 1986 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

In the early years of 1960, when the seeds of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka]] ([[Sri Lankan Civil War]]) related to [[Eelam]] were being sown, [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]] rioters used necklacing in [[Sri Lankan Civil War|anti Tamil riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Subramaniam|first1=Samantha|title=This Divided Island|date=5 February 2015|publisher=Atlantic books|isbn=9780857895950|url=http://bookshop.theguardian.com/this-divided-island.html|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|title=This Divided Island: Stories from the Sri Lankan War review – a moving portrayal of the agonies of the conflict|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/09/this-divided-island-stories-from-sri-lankan-war-review-moving-portrayal-samanth-subramanian|accessdate=5 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assassination of Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] by her [[Sikh]] bodyguards on October 31, 1984 this technique was applied on Sikhs by mobs. https://harperbroadcast.com/2015/07/16/tyres-the-unusual-weapon-used-during-the-1984-riots/

In the early 1990s, university students in [[Abidjan]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]], were plagued by burglars stealing from their dormitories. The students took matters into their own hands by capturing the alleged thieves, and then executed them by placing tyres around their necks and setting the tyres on fire. Ivorian police, powerless to stop these necklacings, could do nothing but stand by and watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|authorlink=Robert D.

In 2006, at least one person died in [[Nigeria]] by necklacing in the deadly [[International reactions to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muslim protests]] over satirical cartoon drawings of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="in-nigeria"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Muslims' rage over cartoons hits Nigeria | journal= [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | last = Musa |first=Njadvara | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060219/news_1n19cartoon.html |accessdate=18 September 2009 | date = 19 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice is widely used by [[drug dealers]] in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Region), where it's called ''micro-ondas''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/740136-autorizado-a-visitar-familia-condenado-por-morte-de-tim-lopes-foge-da-prisao.shtml|title=Autorizado a visitar família, condenado por morte de Tim Lopes foge da prisão|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Folha de S.

Necklacing was also widely used in the armed insurrection led by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in Sri Lanka. A graphic description of one such necklacing appears in the book ''The Island of Blood'' by journalist [[Anita Pratap]].

==In popular culture==
* ''[[The Shield]]'' season two villain Armadillo Quintero used necklacing" as a means to kill his enemies. The season premiere opens with the villain killing a rival drug dealer this way and the episode's plot entails two of the detective characters attempting to find witnesses that link Quintero to the murder. 
* ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'' third season featured a South African intelligence operative being put to death through necklacing, for attempting to false flag a bombing in order to discredit a college based anti-apartheid group.
* ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' season three (episode 10: "Seed Money") has necklacing as an important plot point arc. In the episode, Kitty tries to find a runaway teen, Sherlock and Joan work a case in which the murder of a brilliant bioengineer looks to be at the hands of a drug cartel.
* In ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', Marcelo Branco is murdered this way by the Cracha Preto; the scene's purpose is to show how cruel the villains are and to implicate the Comando Sombra in the crime.
* In ''[[Elite Squad]]'', student and NGO volunteer Pedro Rodrigues is necklaced under orders from main antagonist Baiano as retaliation for bringing police attention to his slum, even if inadvertently.
* In chapter 64 of ''[[I Am a Hero]]'' a burnt body is shown on the side of the road. One of the characters, Araki, says it may have been executed by necklacing.
* A man is seen being necklaced in the 2003 war drama ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'' as the SEAL team enters a Nigerian village being massacred by rebel forces.
* In the opening scenes of the movie "[[Bopha!]]", a black South African police officer is executed by a lynch mob of black anti-apartheid militants who accuse him of betrayal.
* In “[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 ]]”, one mission has the player take on the role of a disavowed Task Force 141 member infiltrating a village under control of [[Sierra Leone]] militia, who are executing villagers by necklacing. Villagers can be saved, depending on the player’s actions.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Postpartum psychosis''' is a rare [[Emergency psychiatry|psychiatric emergency]] in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts ([[mania]]), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions set in, beginning suddenly in the first two weeks after [[childbirth]]. The symptoms vary and can change quickly.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=I|last2=Chandra|first2=PS|last3=Dazzan|first3=P|last4=Howard|first4=LM|title=Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period.|journal=Lancet |date=15 November 2014|volume=384|issue=9956|pages=1789–99|pmid=25455249 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61278-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(14)61278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
About half of women who experience it have no risk factors; but women with a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history are at a higher risk.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt; It is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a condition that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies. It is different from [[postpartum depression]] and from [[maternity blues]].&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Postpartum Psychosis|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx|publisher=Royal College of Psychiatrists|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be a form of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wesseloo|first1=R|last2=Kamperman|first2=AM|last3=Munk-Olsen|first3=T|last4=Pop|first4=VJ|last5=Kushner|first5=SA|last6=Bergink|first6=V|title=Risk of Postpartum Relapse in Bipolar Disorder and Postpartum Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 February 2016|volume=173|issue=2|pages=117–27|pmid=26514657 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15010124 |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15010124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
It often requires hospitalization, where treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication, [[mood stabilizer]]s, and, in cases of strong risk for suicide, [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt; Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery.&lt;ref name=OrsoliniRev2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orsolini|first1=L|display-authors=etal|title=Suicide during Perinatal Period: Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Clinical Correlates.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=12 August 2016|volume=7|pages=138|pmid=27570512|pmc=4981602|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a need for further research into the causes and prevention; the lack of a formal diagnostic category and the difficulty of conducting clinical trials in pregnancy hinder research.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

==Classification==
Postpartum psychosis is a [[Emergency psychiatry|psychiatric emergency]] related to care of women [[postpartum period|after they give birth]].&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;  It is different from [[postpartum depression]] and from [[maternity blues]].&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

The condition is not recognized in the [[DSM-5]] nor in the [[ICD-10]] but it is widely used clinically.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

It may be a form of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery,&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt; sometimes in the first two to three days after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Indira|last2=Rai|first2=Shashi|last3=Pathak|first3=Abhishek|title=Postpartum psychiatric disorders: Early diagnosis and management|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=2015|volume=57|issue=6|pages=216–221|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.161481|pmid=26330638|pmc=4539865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms vary and can change quickly, and can include high mood and racing thoughts ([[mania]]), depression, severe confusion, losing inhibitions, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

In contrast, about half of women have the [[maternity blues]] after birth, which is characterized by symptoms of mild mood swings, anxiety, and irritability that start about 3 to 4 days after delivery and last about a week. It is different from [[postpartum depression]] which is experienced in some form by roughly 20% of all women after birth and is similar to [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

==Risk factors==
Women with a history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, prior episode of postpartum psychosis, or a family history of postpartum psychosis are at high risk; about 25-50% of women in this group will have postpartum psychosis.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;  around 37% of women with bipolar disorder have a severe postpartum episode.&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016/&gt;  Women with a prior episode of postpartum psychosis have about a 30% risk of having another episode in the next pregnancy.&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016/&gt; For a woman with no history of mental illness who has a close relative (a mother or sister) who had postpartum psychosis, the risk is about 3%.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt; There may be a genetic component; while [[mutations]] in chromosome 16 and in specific genes involved in serotoninergic, hormonal, and inflammatory pathways have been identified, none had been confirmed as of 2014.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

[[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] of [[affective psychosis]], [[prenatal depression]], and [[autoimmune thyroid dysfunction]] also increase the risk of postpartum psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Essali|first1=A.|last2=Alabed|first2=S.|last3=Guul|first3=A.|last4=Essali|first4=N.|title=Preventive Interventions for Postnatal Psychosis|journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]|date=20 May 2013|volume=39|issue=4|pages=748–750|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt073|pmid=23690649|pmc=3686463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis had no risk factors.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;   Many other potential factors like pregnancy and delivery complications, caesarean section, sex of the baby, length of pregnancy, changes in psychiatric medication, and psychosocial factors have been researched and no clear association has been found; the only clear risk factor identified as of 2014 was that postpartum psychosis happens more often to women giving birth for the first time, than to women having second or subsequent deliveries, but the reason for that was not known.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;  There may be a role for hormonal changes that occur following delivery, in combination with other factors; there may be a role changes in the immune system as well.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

==Prevention and screening==
For women taking psychiatric medication, the decision as to whether continue during pregnancy and whether to take them while breast feeding is difficult in any case; there is no data to guide this decision with respect to preventing postpartum psychosis.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt; There is no data to guide a decision as to whether women at high risk for postpartum psychosis should take antipsychotic medicine to prevent it.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt; For women at risk of postpartum psychosis, informing medical care-givers, and monitoring by a psychiatrist during pregnancy, in the perinatal period, and for a few weeks following delivery, is recommended.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

For women with known bipolar disorder, taking medication during pregnancy roughly halves the risk of a severe postpartum episode, as does starting to take medication immediately after the birth.&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016/&gt;

==Management==
In most cases [[Inpatient care|hospital admission]] is necessary.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;  [[Antipsychotic]] drugs and [[Mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing drugs]] such as lithium are typically administered&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;  but is not clear if mood stabilizers can be titrated to a high enough level quickly enough to be effective.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt; [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] may be considered, especially if there is a high risk of suicide.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

Family support may be provided via a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

==Outcomes==
The most severe symptoms usually last from 2 to 12 weeks; it can take between six months and a year to recover.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

Women often experience low self-esteem and difficulties as they recover, but many women fully recover; many women also have a hard time bonding with their child as they recover, but end up with healthy relationships with their babies.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have further experiences of mental illness unrelated to childbirth; further pregnancies do not change that risk.&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric illness shortly after giving birth have a 70 times greater risk of suicide in the first year after they gave birth.&lt;ref name=OrsoliniRev2016/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Postpartum psychosis occurs in around 1 in 1000 deliveries,&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt; but this figure is uncertain due to the lack of diagnostic categories for tracking in databases.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

==History==
Puerperal mania was clearly described by the German obstetrician [[Friedrich Benjamin Osiander]] in 1797,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osiander |first=Friedrich Benjamin |year=1797 |title=Neue Denkwuerdigkeiten fuer Aerzte und Geburtshelfer |trans-title=New memoirs for physicians and obstetricians |language=German |publisher=Rosenbusch |location=Goettingen |volume=1 |pages=52–128 |chapter=Glücklich gehobenes hitziges Fieber einer Wöchnerin mit Wahnsinn |trans-chapter=Happy young mother with a violent fever upscale madness |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaY-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a literature of over 2,000 works has accumulated since then.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[French people|French]] psychiatrist [[Louis-Victor Marcé]] (1862) suggested that the menstrual cycle is important and drew parallels with [[menstrual psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcé |first=L V |year=1862 |title=Traité Pratique des Maladies Mentales |trans-title=Practical Treatise on Mental Illness |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Martinet |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes of postpartum psychosis used to be explained by [[eclampsia]], "delirium", [[thyroid disorders]], or infection.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Support===
In the UK, a series of workshops called "Unravelling Eve" were held in 2011, where women who had experienced postpartum depression shared their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When having a baby can cause you to 'lose your mind' |first=Clare |last=Dolman |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=4 December 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15969234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable cases===
* [[Harriet Mordaunt|Harriet Sarah, Lady Mordaunt]] (1848–1906), formerly Harriet Moncreiffe, was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] wife of an English [[baronet]] and [[Member of Parliament]], [[Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th Baronet|Sir Charles Mordaunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Person Page: Harriett Sarah Moncreiffe|url=http://thepeerage.com/p2712.htm#i27120|website=thepeerage.com|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the defendant in a sensational divorce case in which the Prince of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]]) was embroiled; after a controversial trial lasting seven days, the jury determined that Lady Mordaunt was suffering from “puerperal mania” and her husband's petition for divorce was dismissed, while Lady Mordaunt was committed to an asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Souhami|first1=Diana|title=Mrs. Keppel and her daughter|date=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0312155940|edition=1st U.S.}} E-book {{ISBN|9781466883505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36–37}}
* [[Stacey Slater]], a fictional character in the long-running [[BBC]] soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' suffered from postpartum psychosis in 2016 , and was one of the show's biggest storylines that year.

===Legal status===
Several nations including Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and Italy recognize postpartum mental illness as a mitigating factor in cases where [[infanticide|mothers kill their children]].&lt;ref name="no murder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appel|first1=Jacob M.|title=When Infanticide Isn't Murder|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/when-infanticide-isnt-mur_b_279703.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, such a legal distinction was not made as of 2009.&lt;ref name="no murder" /&gt; In the US, an [[Insanity defense#United States law|insanity defense]] is not available in all states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Ann M.|last2=Segre|first2=Lisa S.|title=Perinatal depression: a review of US legislation and law|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|date=6 June 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=259–270|doi=10.1007/s00737-013-0359-6|pmid=23740222|pmc=3725295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Britain has had the [[Infanticide Act]] since 1922.

==Research directions==
The lack of a formal diagnosis in the DSM and ICD has hindered research.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;  The causes of postpartum depression are unknown and are under investigation.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014/&gt;

There is a need to better understand whether taking medication for prevention during pregnancy or immediately following birth, is useful.&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016/&gt;

In [[pregnancy]] terms, '''quickening''' is the moment in [[pregnancy]] when the pregnant woman starts to feel or perceive [[fetal movement]]s in the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Quickening Quickening in Farlex dictionary], in turn citing The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. copyright 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical facts==
The first natural sensation of quickening may feel like a light tapping, or the fluttering of a butterfly.  These sensations eventually become stronger and more regular as the pregnancy progresses.  Sometimes, the first movements are mis-attributed to gas or hunger pangs.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, Roger. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060746378&amp;id=s-7d20ulE8UC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;ots=cLn4PQ44f0&amp;dq=%22Mayo+Clinic%22+and+quickening&amp;sig=KJyaqcmu-BeNXCMHhrdzIGkwzWc Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy]'', page 480 (HarperCollins 2004). Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman's [[uterus|uterine]] muscles, rather than her [[abdomen|abdominal]] muscles, are first to sense fetal motion.  Therefore, a woman's body weight usually does not have a substantial effect on when movements are initially perceived.  Women who have already given birth have more relaxed uterine muscles that are consequently more sensitive to fetal motion, and for them fetal motion can sometimes be felt as early as 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Ziel, Cornelia &amp; Tourville, Jacqueline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1569243190&amp;id=jciZAfJWoqsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA70&amp;lpg=RA1-PA70&amp;ots=RD_hiLptXz&amp;dq=quickening+and+%22plus-size%22&amp;sig=S9lPp8zEcLGW3cyEnCouefDFZxI Big, Beautiful &amp; Pregnant: Expert Advice And Comforting Wisdom for the Expecting Plus-size Woman]'' (Marlowe 2006). Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, quickening occurs naturally at about the middle of a pregnancy. A woman pregnant for the first time (i.e., a [[Glossary of terms associated with gravidity|primigravida]] woman) typically feels fetal movements at about 18–20 weeks, whereas a woman who has been pregnant more than once (i.e., a multipara woman) will typically feel movements around 15–17 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Malcolm et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0632051639&amp;id=FHXtDkLzOHEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA8&amp;lpg=RA2-PA8&amp;ots=fkQG1qvn5i&amp;dq=%22quickening%22+and+obese&amp;num=100&amp;sig=-Xgmp3WR71poUh1qJ3oke-5XTOM#PRA2-PA8,M1 Essentials of Neonatal Medicine]'' (Blackwell 2000), page 8. Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==
{{see also|History of abortion law debate}}

The word "quick" [[wiktionary:quick#Adjective|originally meant]] "alive".  Historically, quickening has sometimes been considered to be the beginning of the possession of "individual life" by the fetus.  British legal scholar [[William Blackstone]] explained the subject of quickening in the eighteenth century, relative to [[feticide]] and [[abortion]]:

{{quote|Life... begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb. For if a woman is ''quick'' with child, and by a potion, or otherwise, killeth it in her womb; or if any one beat her, whereby the child dieth in her body, and she is delivered of a dead child; this, though not murder, was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter. But at present it is not looked upon in quite so atrocious a light, though it remains a very heinous misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Blackstone |authorlink=William Blackstone |chapter=Amendment IX, Document 1 |chapterurl=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs1.html |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] |origyear=1765 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |volume=5 |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, quickening was only one of several standards that were used historically to determine when the [[right to life]] attaches to a fetus.  According to the "ancient law" mentioned by Blackstone, another standard was [[formation of the fetus]], which occurs weeks before quickening.  [[Henry de Bracton]] explained the ancient law, about five hundred years before Blackstone:

{{quote|If one strikes a pregnant woman or gives her poison in order to procure an abortion, if the fetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened, he commits homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Henry de Bracton]] |chapter=The crime of homicide and the divisions into which it falls |editor=George E. Woodbine ed.; Samuel Edmund Thorne trans. |title=On the Laws and Customs of England |origyear=c. 1250 |year=1968 |volume=2 |page=[http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/bracton/Unframed/English/v2/341.htm 341] |oclc=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a woman convicted of a capital crime could claim a delay in her execution if she were pregnant; a woman who did so was said to "[[plead the belly]]". In Ireland on 16 March 1831 Baron Pennefather in Limerick stated that pregnancy was not alone sufficient for a delay but there had to be quickening.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Evening Post'' and ''Clare Sentinel'', 18 March 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samboja Lestari''' is an area of restored [[tropical rainforest]] near the city of [[Balikpapan]] in [[East Kalimantan]], [[Borneo]], [[Indonesia]], created by the [[Borneo Orangutan Survival]] Foundation (BOS) led by Dr [[Willie Smits]], with the aim of providing a safe haven for rehabilitated [[Bornean orangutan|orangutans]] while at the same time providing a source of income for local people. According to Smits' talks for [[Qi GLOBAL|Qi Global]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qi-global.com/WILLIE-SMITS Willie Smits' presentation at Qi Global 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TED (conference)|TED]],&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; Samboja Lestari has evolved on the principles of [[People, Planet, Profit]], linking  community and empowerment and capacity-building with promoting economic development and conservation. Located about 38 kilometers from East Kalimantan's biggest city, [[Balikpapan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/02/a-sanctuary-sun-bears.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 87 kilometer from its capital, [[Samarinda]].

The project covers nearly {{convert|2000 |ha |sqmi}} of [[Deforestation|deforested]], degraded and burnt land. In 2001 BOS began purchasing land near Samboja that, like much of the [[deforestation in Borneo|deforested land in Borneo]], had been by impoverished by mechanical logging, drought and severe fires and was now covered in alang-alang grass (''[[Imperata cylindrica]]''). The name Samboja Lestari roughly translates as the "Samboja Forever".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/Samboja-Lestari-128959069771931264.aspx BOS Australia website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reforestation]] and orangutan rehabilitation is the core of this acclaimed but controversial project,&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite news|last=Braxton Little|first=Jane |title=Regrowing Borneo's Rainforest--Tree by Tree|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=regrowing-borneo|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Scientific American|date=7 January 2009}} [http://www.ecoearth.info/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=114842&amp;keybold=mammal%20AND%20%20dispersal%20 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; with hundreds of indigenous tree species planted.

==History of Samboja==
The small town of Samboja was founded about a century ago in what was then rainforest when oil was discovered in the area. The first drilling began in 1897 near Balikpapan Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/.../uhm_phd_8520322_r.pdf Intermediate Cities in the Resource Frontier: A case study of Samarinda and Balikpapan] Ph.D dissertation by William Bruce Wood, University of Hawaii, 1985, p63&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch oil workers moved into the area to work for a company that was later taken over by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and later still by the national Indonesian oil company [[Pertamina]]. The oil company began cutting wood in the 1950s and as people came flooding into the booming oil town of Balikpapan they cleared the surrounding forest.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 2008, p300&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|right|thumb|Smog in October 1997]]With the pronounced [[El Niño]] of 1982 and 1983 the worst firestorms then known in a tropical forest ravaged the area, destroying what small pockets of forest that remained.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 2008, p301&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pattern of [[deforestation in Borneo]] as a whole, the area was now vulnerable to the dry years that followed. In 1997 and 1998 the fires [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|enveloped the region in smoke]]. The thick choking smog darkened the sky and caused respiratory problems throughout the region and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Pearce   | first = Fred    | title = Borneo fires may intensify 'Asian brown haze'    | newspaper = New Scientist   | pages =    | date = 12 August 2002    | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2660-borneo-fires-may-intensify-asian-brown-haze.html   | accessdate = 11 April 2010}} The smog from fires killed "as many as a million people a year from respiratory diseases" according to UNEP director Klaus Toepfer.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smits' 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED talk]],&lt;ref name="TED" /&gt; Samboja in 2002 before reforestation was the poorest district of East Kalimantan, with 50% of the population unemployed and a high crime rate. There had been climate change, with severe droughts resulting in crop failures, along with almost total extinction of plant and animal life. Flooding occurred five or six times a year and there were annual fires. Almost a quarter of average income went on buying drinking water. The land no longer sustained any agricultural productivity and was covered with alang-alang grass (''Imperata cylindrica'') which produces [[hydrocyanic acid]] that prevents the germination of tree seeds. There were many nutrition and hygiene related health problems and life expectancy was low, with high infant and maternal mortality.

==The project==

===Land purchase===
In 2001 BOS began purchasing land near Samboja. It was insured that the purchase of each plot of land was in accordance with regulations and documented by letter, official seal and security copy, that the land was free from foreign influence and that its protected status would be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 2008, p304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===
Conditions were not favourable: aside from the land degradation, the soil itself was not promising - predominantly [[clay]], with hard [[plinthite]] clods. Not far beneath the surface there were [[coal]] seams that in the dry periods opened up to the air and caught fire. In addition there were concerns whether the area would be sufficient for the population of 1000 orangutans that was deemed to be viable over 500 years in the absence of logging or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Singleton, I., S. Wich, S. Husson, S. Stephens, S. Utami Atmoko, M. Leighton, N. Rosen, K. Traylor-Holzer, R. Lacy and O. Byers (eds.). [http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/methprimconsweb08/OrangutanPHVA04.pdf Orangutan Population and Habitat Viability Assessment: Final Report] 2004. IUCN/SSC Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, Apple Valley, MN. p35&lt;/ref&gt; Land prices were rising and it would be impossible to buy enough land to support such a population in normal rainforest. The possibility of increasing the number of orangutans per hectare by increasing the density of fruit-bearing trees above the normal figure, in particular the density of [[Ficus|wild fig trees]]. Despite this, forestry experts were sceptical: they believed that once the rainforest was cut and burned down, it would never return.&lt;ref name = "little"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 2008, p305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree planting===
In May 2003 BOS bought {{convert|1200|ha |sqmi}}, most of it with credit from the Gibbon Foundation, also under the management of Smits. In a tree nursery of 3 hectares, 250,000 small trees of about 400 species were waiting to be planted. Of particular importance were the 500 or so species that bore fruit eaten by the orangutan. Many of the seeds of these had been recovered from orangutan faeces all over Borneo.

As soil-forming pioneer trees the drought-resistant Sungkai (''[[Peronema canessceus]]'') and legumes such as ''[[Acacia mangium]]'' which [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] through [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] ''[[Rhizobium]]'' bacteria in their [[Nitrogen-fixing nodules|root nodules]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 2008, p311&lt;/ref&gt;

Smits drew on his background in microbiology and his doctoral dissertation on [[mycorrhiza]],&lt;ref&gt;Smits WTM, 1994, ''Dipterocarpaceae: mycorrhizae and regeneration.'' Thesis. Tropenbos Series No. 9. Backhuys Publishers. Lead.&lt;/ref&gt; making enormous quantities of compost for tree seedlings. Along with organic waste, he mixed in sawdust, fruit remnants from the orangutan cages, manure from cattle and chickens scavenged from his other projects in Kalimantan and a microbiological agent made from sugar and cow urine.&lt;ref name="little" /&gt;

===Orangutan rehabilitation===
The drive to secure the future of the Bornean orangutan was the central concern of the project. Smits' Orangutan Rehabilitation Project at Wanariset was moved to Samboja. "Forest Schools" were established, areas that provide natural, educational playgrounds for the orangutans in which to learn forest skills. Here the orangutans roam freely but under supervision and are returned to sleeping cages for the night. "Orangutan islands" were created where the orangutans and other wildlife that cannot return to the wild are nevertheless able to live in almost completely natural conditions.

===Sun bears===
At the request of the Indonesian Government, Samboja Lestari became home to 52 [[sun bear]]s, confiscated from the illegal [[pet trade]] or rescued from deforested areas.

The sanctuary includes a {{convert|58 |ha |sqmi}} area put aside for the bears including a 55 hectare patch of fenced secondary forest with maturing fruit trees and a river and a second area of approximately 3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/BOS-Sun-Bear-Sanctuary.aspx BOS Sun Bear Sanctuary at www.orangutans.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of biodiversity===
Although there is not yet a return to the [[biodiversity]] of the species-rich rainforest of Borneo, a young forest is quickly emerging which it is hoped will evolve over time into such a rainforest.  In the tropical climate of Borneo plants grow much faster than in Europe.  A tree may reach a height of up to 17 metres within four years. Already dense forest surrounds the headquarters of BOS in the Samboja Lestari area. In addition to the return of bird species (such as the rare [[hornbill]]), 30 species of [[reptile]],&lt;ref name="TED" /&gt; [[porcupines]], [[pangolin]]s, [[mouse deer]] and many other animal species have returned. The [[endangered species|endangered]] [[proboscis monkeys]] are one of seven primate species to be found at Samboja Lestari.

===Farming===
The local population around the area is a crucial part of the project. Planted around the perimeter of the rainforest is a belt of sugar palm (''[[Arenga pinnata]]'') trees. This serves both as a protective barrier against fires and as a source of income for over 650 families.  Samboja Lestari enjoys the support of the local people through its creation of employment such as in the fire protection program and maintaining the security of drinking water resources.

Alongside the orangutan reintroduction work, BOS has promoted forms of farming that do not involve burning and destroying forests, by switching to agriculture combining rattan, sugar palms, pineapples, papayas, beans, and corn along with other fruits and vegetables. A community of 2,000 Indonesians is developing that can now support itself on the land.&lt;ref name ="this"&gt;{{cite news |title= Borneo experiment shows how saving the apes could save ourselves|author= Shawn Thompson|newspaper= This Magazine|date= 17 May 2010|url= http://this.org/magazine/2010/05/17/apes-saving-humans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smits believes that to develop the orangutan population, their forest habitat must first be built; also, to achieve sustainable solutions the root social problems must be addressed by empowering local communities to take up livelihood options that are more rewarding than logging.&lt;ref&gt;http://masarang.or.id/&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract to supply food for the orangutans is worth 125 million Indonesian rupiah (about $14,000) a month for 150 farmers (the estimated  average monthly income for a worker in the villages is between one and two million rupiah).&lt;ref name ="this" /&gt;

===Finance===

===="Create Rainforest"====
To finance the nature reserve, BOS created a system of "land-purchasing", a "Create Rainforest" initiative where donors can symbolically adopt square metres of rainforest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.createrainforest.org/en/idea "Create Rainforest website]&lt;/ref&gt; and are able to view and follow the progress of their "purchase"  in the project area with [[Google Earth]] satellite images from 2002 and 2007 with additional information overlaid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JhcRKlGuCA ''"Google Earth Hero: BOS, Borneo rain forest"'' on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samboja Lodge====
The Samboja Lodge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sambojalodge.com/AboutBOSFoundation/|title= About BOS|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to provide accommodation for visitors and volunteers at Samboja. Its design was based upon local architecture and its interior and exterior walls are made of recycled materials.

===Environmental impact===
In his 2009 TED talk Smits claimed there had been a substantial increase in cloud cover and 30% more rainfall due to the reforestation at Samboja Lestari.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;February 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED talk]], {{cite web |url= http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html|title= Willie Smits restores a rainforest |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SarVision==
The SarVision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarvision.nl/index.php?page=about Sarvision website]&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite Natural Resources Monitoring Centre was established to monitor deforestation and [[illegal logging]] and the relentless growth of [[palm oil]] in unsuitable locations. A study commissioned by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] Netherlands with SarVision showed that almost half of present oil palm plantations are not located on suitable land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenkampong.com/green_reporter/environmental-hero-willie-smits/&lt;/ref&gt; The use of satellite technology and [[GIS]] has enabled SarVison to monitor forests down to the individual tree level, to develop accountability in the management of the forest and identify where palm oil plantations are destroying areas of forest illegally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/winter0910articles/willie-smits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==
[[Amory Lovins]], renewable energy advocate and chief scientist at Colorado's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] claimed Samboja Lestari was possibly "the finest example of ecological and economic restoration in the Tropics."&lt;ref name = "little" /&gt; In 2009 Smits was elected to the [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Fellowship]]. Ashoka Fellows are leading social entrepreneurs who are recognized to have innovative solutions to social problems and the potential to change patterns across society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ashoka.org/willie_smits|title= Ashoka Fellowship profile of Willie Smits|author= |year= 2009|work= |publisher= |accessdate=3 April 2010}} "Dr. Willie Smits is a rainforest inventor who has revolutionized reforestation techniques and policies worldwide and is also the world’s most prominent protector of orangutans and their natural habitat."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some, like Erik Meijaard, say that it remains unclear whether Samboja Lestari is a good idea that achieves results, and that the success will ultimately depend on the extent to which it can improve community livelihoods and achieve long-term financial stability:  "That question remains unanswered, and will remain so for a few years, because that is the kind of time such projects need to be evaluated." Meijaard also questions the enormous cost of projects like Samboja, and their financial sustainability, saying, like others, that it is better to concentrate on projects that attempt to protect those remaining areas of forest rather than trying to create new ones from scratch.&lt;ref name = "this" /&gt;

For Francis E. Putz, botany professor at the University of Florida, there is another concern: what if Smits successfully demonstrates that devastated lands can be turned into multilayered stands supporting a mixture of plant and animal species? In the eyes of developers and policymakers, will that then justify destroying existing rain forests?&lt;ref name = "little" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">A '''sociocultural system''' is a "human [[population]] viewed (1) in its ecological context and (2) as one of the many [[subsystems]] of a larger [[ecological systems|ecological system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena (1984). ''Cultural Anthropology, second edition.'' Stamford, Connecticut: [[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Publishing Company]] (Cengage Learning). {{ISBN|978-0-534-02749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SCSdiagram.jpg|thumb|350px|Conceptual Model of a Sociocultural System.]] The term "sociocultural system" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and system. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species.  A culture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society, together with the material products of such behaviors. The words "society" and "culture" are fused together to form the word "sociocultural". A system is "a collection of parts which interact with each other to function as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Draper L. (1980). ''Systems One: An Introduction to Systems Thinking.'' Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems Inc. {{ISBN|978-99962-805-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sociocultural system is most likely to be found in the writings of anthropologists who specialize in [[ecological anthropology]].

In 1979, Marvin Harris outlined a universal structure of sociocultural systems. He mentioned [[infrastructure]] (production and population), structure (which is behavioural, like corporations, political organizations, hierarchies, castes), and a [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (which is mental, like beliefs, values, norms).&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W., 2013, "Harris on the Universal Structure of Society," Retrieved 2015-02-15, http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Essays/Harris1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120219 Sociocultural Systems:Principles of Structure and Change], Frank W.

A '''stab wound''' is a specific form of [[penetrating trauma]] to the [[Human skin|skin]] that results from a [[knife]] or a similar pointed object.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabers"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Taber, Clarence Wilbur |author2=Venes, Donald |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F a Davis Co |location= |year=2009 |page=2189 |isbn=978-0-8036-1559-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stab"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mankin SL |title=Emergency!

Even though stab wounds are inflicted at a much greater rate than [[Ballistic trauma|gun shot wounds]], they account for less than 10% of all penetrating trauma deaths.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Management==
Stab wounds can cause various internal and external injuries. They are generally caused by low-velocity weapons, meaning the injuries inflicted on a person are typically confined to the path it took internally, instead of causing damage to surrounding tissue, which is common of gunshot wounds.&lt;ref name="missile"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Missile and explosive wounds |author1=Christopher McLean |author2=Jonathan Hull | journal=Surgery (Oxford) |date=June 2006 | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=194–7 | doi=10.1383/surg.2006.24.6.194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abdomen]] is the most commonly injured area from a stab wound. Interventions that may be needed depending on severity of the injury include [[airway]], [[intravenous]] access, and  control of [[hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=guidelines/&gt;&lt;ref name="btls"&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton |title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers |publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-13-084584-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length and size of the knife [[blade]], as well as the trajectory it followed, may be important in planning management as it can be a predictor of what structures were damaged.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=stab/&gt; There are also special considerations to take into effect as given the nature of injuries, there is a higher likelihood that persons with these injuries might be under the influence of illicit substances which can make it harder to obtain a complete medical history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special precautions should also be taken to prevent further injury from a [[perpetrator]] to the victim in a [[hospital]] setting.&lt;ref name="nursing"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird J, Faulkner M |title=Emergency care and management of patients with stab wounds |journal=Nurs Stand |volume=23 |issue=21 |pages=51–7; quiz 58 |year=2009 |pmid=19248451 |doi= 10.7748/ns2009.01.23.21.51.c6769|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to treating [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], it is important to keep the systolic pressure above 90mmHg, maintain the person's core body temperature, and for prompt transport to a [[trauma center]] in severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEMS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jems.com/article/patient-care/patient-suffers-multiple-stab-wounds | title=Patient Suffers Multiple Stab Wounds: A 19-year-old male was stabbed multiple times in the chest | publisher=Elsevier Inc. | work=Journal of Emergency Medical Services | date=June 7, 2012 | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Edgerly, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine if internal bleeding is present a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma|focused assessment with sonography]] (FAST) or [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage]] (DPL) can be used. Other diagnostic tests such as a [[computed tomography]] scan or various [[contrast medium|contrast studies]] can be used to more definitively classify the injury in both severity and location.&lt;ref name="ATLS"&gt;{{cite book | title=ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support for Doctors | publisher=American College of Surgeons | year=2008 | pages=113–9 | isbn=978-1880696316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local wound exploration is also another technique that may be utilized to determine how far the object penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observation can be used in place of surgery as it can substitute an unnecessary surgery, which makes it the preferred treatment of penetrating trauma secondary to a stab wound when [[hypovolemia]] or shock is not present.&lt;ref name="PHTLS"&gt;{{cite book |title=PHTLS: Prehospital Trauma Life Support |publisher=Mosby/JEMS |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=978-0-323-06502-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory diagnostic studies such as a [[hematocrit]], [[white blood cell count]] and chemical tests such as [[liver function tests]] can also help to determine the efficiency of care .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
[[surgical|Surgical intervention]] may be required but it depends on what [[organ system]]s are affected by the wound and the extent of the damage.&lt;ref name=stab/&gt; It is important for care providers to thoroughly check the wound site inasmuch as a [[laceration]] of an [[artery]] often results in delayed complications sometimes leading to [[death]]. In cases where there is no suspicion of bleeding or infection, there is no known benefit of surgery to correct any present injuries.&lt;ref name=Oyo2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyo-Ita|first=Angela|last2=Chinnock|first2=Paul|last3=Ikpeme|first3=Ikpeme A.|date=2015-11-13|title=Surgical versus non-surgical management of abdominal injury|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=11|pages=CD007383|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007383.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26568111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a [[surgeon]] will track the path of the weapon to determine the anatomical structures that were damaged and repair any damage they deem necessary.&lt;ref name="surgery"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth D.

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Hilt wound.jpg|thumb|Hilt mark left from a knife]]
Stab wounds are one of the most common forms of penetrating trauma globally, but account for a lower mortality compared to blunt injuries due to their more focused impact on a person.&lt;ref name=Oyo2015 /&gt; Stab wounds can result from self-infliction, accidental [[nail gun]] injuries,&lt;ref name="JodatiSafaei2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jodati|first1=A.|last2=Safaei|first2=N.|last3=Toufan|first3=M.|last4=Kazemi|first4=B.|title=A unique nail gun injury to the heart with a delayed presentation|journal=Interactive CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery|volume=13|issue=3|year=2011|pages=363–365|issn=1569-9293|doi=10.1510/icvts.2011.272120|pmid=21636580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaljustoTønnessen2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaljusto ML, Tønnessen T | title = How to mend a broken heart: a major stab wound of the left ventricle | journal = World J Emerg Surg | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 17 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22640705 | pmc = 3467162 | doi = 10.1186/1749-7922-7-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stingray injury|stingray injuries]],&lt;ref name="ParraCostantini2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parra MW, Costantini EN, Rodas EB, Gonzalez PJ, Salamen OJ, Catino JD, Taber PM, Puente I | title = Surviving a transfixing cardiac injury caused by a stingray barb | journal = The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = e115–6 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19660402 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.02.052 |issn=0022-5223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most stab wounds are caused by intentional [[violence]], as the [[weapon]]s  used to inflict such wounds are readily available compared to [[gun]]s.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite book | title=Knife crime : review of evidence and policy | publisher=Centre for Crime and Justice Studies | author=Eades, Chris | year=2007 | location=London | isbn=978-1906003067}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stabbings are a relatively common cause of [[homicide]] in Canada&lt;ref name=StatsCan/&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref name=USAStat/&gt; Typically death from stab wounds is due to [[organ failure]] or [[blood loss]]. They are the mechanism of approximately 2% of [[suicide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Riviello RJ|title=Manual of forensic emergency medicine : a guide for clinicians|year=2010|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0-7637-4462-5|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[homicides]] by stabbing and gunshot occur relatively equally (1,008 to 980 for the years 2005 to 2009).&lt;ref name=StatsCan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal01-eng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110203802/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal01-eng.htm |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }} Homicides by method&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States guns are a more common method of homicide (9,484 versus 1,897 for stabbing or cutting in 2008).&lt;ref name=USAStat&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infoplease.com/us/crime/murder-victims-weapons-used |title=Murder Victims, by Weapons Used |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Infoplease |publisher=Sandbox Networks Inc |access-date=2015-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stab wounds occur four times more than [[gunshot wounds]] in the United Kingdom, but the [[mortality rate]] associated with stabbing has ranged from 0-4% as 85% of injuries sustained from stab wounds only affect [[subcutaneous tissue]].&lt;ref name=btls/&gt;&lt;ref name=nursing/&gt;&lt;ref name="terrorist"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanoch J, Feigin E, Pikarsky A, Kugel C, Rivkind A |title=Stab wounds associated with terrorist activities in Israel |journal=JAMA |volume=276 |issue=5 |pages=388–90 |date=August 1996 |pmid=8683817 |doi= 10.1001/jama.1996.03540050048022|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[assault]]s resulting in a stab wound occur to men and persons of [[ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref name="epi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Abdellati E, Messaoudi N, Van Hee R |title=Assault induced stab injuries: epidemiology and actual treatment strategy |journal=[[Acta Chirurgica Belgica]] |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=146–54 |year=2011 |pmid=21780521 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some of the first principles of wound care come from [[Hippocrates]] who promoted keeping wounds dry except for irrigation.&lt;ref name="historymed"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manring MM, Hawk A, Calhoun JH, Andersen RC |title=Treatment of war wounds: a historical review |journal=[[Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research]] |volume=467 |issue=8 |pages=2168–91 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19219516 |pmc=2706344 |doi=10.1007/s11999-009-0738-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy de Chauliac]] would promote removal of foreign bodies, rejoining of severed tissues, maintenance of tissue continuity, preservation of organ substance, and prevention of complications.&lt;ref name="historymed" /&gt; The first successful operation on a person who was stabbed in the [[heart]] was performed in 1896 by [[Ludwig Rehn]], in what is now considered the first case of [[heart surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laceration of the Heart: Repair and Recovery: 1877|last = Sharpe|first = William|date = June 17, 1961|journal = Journal of the American Medical Association|doi = 10.1001/jama.1961.63040240024023|pmid = |access-date =|volume=176|issue = 11|pages=964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1800s it was hard to treat stab wounds because of poor transportation of victims to health facilities and the low ability for surgeons to effectively repair organs. However, the use of [[laparotomy]], which has been developed a few years earlier, had provided better patient outcomes than had been seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gun Shot Wounds of the Abdomen with Report of Fifty Eight Cases | journal=Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati |date=1899-01-09|first =J.C.|last=Oliver | pages=354–75|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iEFYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its inception, the use of exploratory laparotomies was highly encouraged for "all deep stab wounds" in which surgeons were to stop active bleeding, repair damage, and remove "devitalized tissues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Essential immediate treatment of trauma|last = DeBrun|first = Harry|date = December 1926|journal = The American Journal of Surgery|doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(26)80009-1|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 376–385|volume = 1|issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because laparotomies were seen to benefit patients, they were used on most every person with an abdominal stab wound until the 1960s when doctors were encouraged to use them more selectivity in favor of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marx|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 459}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Korean war a greater emphasis was put on the use of pressure dressings and [[tourniquets]] to initially control bleeding.&lt;ref name="historymed" /&gt;

'''Timothy David Wilkinson''' (born 26 July 1978) is a [[professional golfer]] from New Zealand.

==Biography==
Wilkinson was born in [[Palmerston North]], and was educated at [[St Peter's College, Palmerston North|St Peter's College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-cut/20160201/282832190158327 | title=Turbo man at the top | date=1 February 2016 | work=The Cut | first=Bob | last=Howit | accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the New Zealand Stroke Play Championship in 2000 and turned professional in 2003.

Wilkinson joined the second tier [[Nationwide Tour]] in 2005, but failed to win enough money to graduate directly to the [[PGA Tour]]. He finally obtained his PGA Tour card by finishing inside the top 25 at the 2007 [[qualifying school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/manawatu/news/article.cfm?l_id=500559&amp;objectid=10480170 |title=Golf: Wilkinson earns PGA Tour card |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkinson had a successful rookie season on the PGA Tour in 2008, the highlights being an outright third at the [[Zurich Classic of New Orleans]] and finishing joint runner-up at the [[Valero Texas Open]], two shots behind winner [[Zach Johnson]]. He made over one million dollars in prize money and finished 92nd on the final money list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/golf/712662 |title=Tim Wilkinson happy with opening year |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10545740 |title=Golf: Doing it his own way |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=30 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first=Ahmer |last=Khokhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Wilkinson played in the final pairing at the [[Verizon Heritage]], but faded to finish T6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/2009/tournaments/r012/04/18/awtrey.rd3/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422142259/http://www.pgatour.com/2009/tournaments/r012/04/18/awtrey.rd3/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 April 2009 |title=Wilkinson Looking to ride the wind to a historic victory |publisher=pgatour.com |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A thumb ligament injury curtailed his season and saw him gain a major medical extension of his playing rights. By June 2010 he had played the 12 events this extension afforded him, and had not earned enough money to retain his status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/golf/5571431 |title=Wilkinson finds form with top eight finish |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=6 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkinson finished fifth on the 2013 Web.com Tour regular season money list to earn his 2014 PGA Tour card.

A '''Toyol''' or '''Tuyul''' is a mythical [[spirit]] in [[Malay mythology]] of South-East Asia, especially in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lp0TxqmTzEEJ:http://melayuonline.com/eng/article/read/223/toyol%2Btoyol+money&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;strip=1 Toyol - (Googel cache)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
It is sometimes called the "Kwee Kia" in Hokkien. In Thailand, they are called Koman-tong (Male) and Koman-lay (Female). In the Philippines, they have a similar child spirit called the "[[tiyanak]]". In [[Cambodia]], they are called "Cohen Kroh". In South Korea, they are called "Do Yeol". It is a small child spirit invoked by a [[dukun]] (Indonesian shaman) or [[pawang]] (Malay witch doctor) from a dead human [[fetus]] using [[black magic]].

== Evoking a Toyol ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
This creature can be evoked to work with a human under its own terms. There are different methods to possess a Toyol:

# Purchase a Toyol from a Shaman.
# Making use of an aborted baby and through special [[embalmment]] techniques.
# Evoke a Toyol from its dwelling place.

A Toyol is like an animal, so it needs to be treated as such. In order to foster a closer relationship with this creature, below offering should be presented:

# A cup of [[milk]] every morning.
# Some toys, clothing, sweets and biscuits.
# A black candle and incense accompanied with mantras.
# Some will smear a few drops of the owner’s own blood to the Toyol statue.

A person who owns a ''toyol'' uses it mainly to steal things from other people, or to do mischief. According to a well-known superstition, if money or jewelry keeps disappearing mysteriously from your house, a ''toyol'' might be responsible. One way to ward off a ''toyol'' is to place some needles under your money, for ''toyols'' are afraid of being hurt by needles. 

According to [[Javanese people|Javanese]] mythology, the creature is believed to be kept by a person practicing ''pesugihan toyol'' [[black magic]]. ''Pesugihan'' is derived from [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word ''sugih'' means "rich". It is a kind of magic to help people to become rich instantly, but in exchange he or she must perform some rituals or offering ''tumbal'' (sacrifice something) to keep the toyol happy. According to Javanese myth, toyol can be kept for financial gain, but in exchange a female member of the family must allow it to breastfeed from her, sucking blood instead of milk.

==Appearance==
People normally associate the appearance of a toyol with that of a small baby, frequently that of a newborn baby walking naked with a big head, small hands, clouded eyes and usually greenish skin. It can be seen without the use of magic, though they are unlikely to be spotted casually. 

Those who did claim to encounter it described its actual appearance to be childlike (a toddler) with green/gray skin, bald, big red (alien-like) eyes, pointy ears and rows of sharp teeth, and sometimes reported with hairs, like a monkey. Its behaviour is more animal-like. It tends to climb on rooftops either to play or prior to entering houses.

==Tasks==
In old village tales, people keep ''toyols'' for selfish but petty gains. They use such spirits for theft, sabotage and other minor crimes. With special rituals the ''toyol'' can be made powerful and perform murder. A person who suddenly becomes wealthy without explanation might be suspected of keeping a ''toyol''. The ''toyol'' is kept in a [[jar]] or an [[urn]], and hidden away in a dark place until needed.

What happens at the end of the "contract" is not very clear. It could be that the tablet, along with the urn, is buried in a [[graveyard]] (with the relevant rituals), and the spirit is then laid to rest. An alternative method is to dispose them in the sea. Or else, a ''toyol'' gets passed down in a family through the generations. This seems to suggest that once you obtain a ''toyol'', not only are you stuck with it for the rest of your life, but all your descendants will also be condemned to own it. 

However, it can still get released by either the owner or "[[bomoh]]" (shaman) to roam free. Without a master, it would stray into the jungle or visit homes as an observer without disturbing residents. Based on an anecdote, a toyol confessed that it likes to peek into people's lives apart from the occasional distraction of playing with any toys found within houses. Simply put, toyol is quite harmless without a master but like a gun, it can turn to crime or mischief under the command of an unscrupulous individual.

When it comes to stealing money or jewellery, people wonder how the toyol can find such valuables in hidden places where even humans fail to find them. There is speculation that it can somehow see through walls or barriers with its big red eyes (like infra-red) to spot hidden valuables but this is unconfirmed. After stealing, the only traces of its presence are its childlike footprints and fingerprints found at the crime scene if it happens to have dust on its hands and feet. Otherwise, people would not suspect that a toyol had raided their premises.

==Toyol and The Newly Wed Bride==

It has been said that if any family member of a bride or groom owns a toyol, the toyol will visit the newly wed couple before dawn. And it will suck the blood from the bride's toe until the bride wakes up. This is to enhance the toyol's power. Meaning after sucking bride's toe, the toyol shall become faster and stronger. It is crucial if the owner wants the toyol to be more capable in stealing money.

==Weaknesses==
Although seemingly cunning, toyols are supposedly not very intelligent. It is said that they are easily deceived by marbles, beans and sand and strands of [[garlic]] hanging on the door post or placed on certain parts of the house. The toyol will start playing with these items until it forgets its task at the intended victim's house. Money placed under mirrors has the potency to ward off toyols due to a fear of their reflection.

==Koman-tong/Koman-lay==
In [[Thailand]], they are known as [[Kuman thong|Koman-tong]], for male sprits, and Koman-lay for females. Literally translated as "Golden Child". They are used for protection, they can whisper in your ear of impending danger.
Koman-tongs are usually wandering souls of dead children that the monks would adopt and give them a "replacement body". The "replacement body" is usually a small statue carved out of tree bark, [[coral]] or baby bone. It is then placed in a container, soaked in perfume or chicken blood.

The story of the Golden Child comes supposedly from a 19th-century Thai tale called, “Khun Chang Khun Paen”. In brief, the story goes:

Khun Paen was a soldier, 400 years previous, a time when supernatural forces played an important part of traditional warfare. Khun Paen had wanted a protective spirit to watch over him in battle. To this end he cut the unborn foetus of his son from his dead wife’s womb and took it to a temple to perform an occult rite. He wrapped the child’s torso in sacred cloth and roasted it on a fire whilst chanting ritual mantras and dark incantations to create the supernatural being with whom he could communicate.

The more powerful Kuman-tong are made by sorcerers living in the mountains. They would soak the "replacement body" in 尸油 (literally corpse oil). This ingredient seems to be crucial as it gives the toyol additional powers. Corpse oil is collected by removing the dead corpse’s chin (using a knife to cut through the bones) and cooking on a hot pan until the oil oozes out. These Thai ones are more subdued and even tempered, as the monks would chant to them daily.

==Kwee Kia (鬼孩/小鬼)==
Kwee Kia is the Chinese version of the Toyol. These are made from either a fetus that miscarried or been aborted. A medium will take these small corpses and chop off their heads. Once the heads are collected, they will be dried out and cooked to obtain their corpse oil while the bones from the bodies are carved to become replacement bodies. These have to be specially ordered before you can get one.

If the fetus is five months old, they would carve the replacement body out of its own bone, in which case they are supposedly more powerful. Different Kwee Kia have different uses and different names. Usually the ones made in the deep mountains (山巴) are stronger.

==Characteristic of a Toyol/Kwee Kia==
# They will protect the owner, talk to him, accomplish tasks for him. Some toyols are tasked to find spirits of wandering children so that they can be made into toyols.
# They do not like to be abandoned and will kill when provoked. They can kill by either slashing one's throat with their long claws or squeezing one's heart, amongst others.
# They can pass through walls or even human bodies and see into the human body (hence some mediums use them to give medical advice).
# They are known to take possession of their owner's body if they are hungry at night. Due to their preference for raw meat, the owners sometimes end up eating raw meat from their fridges in the middle of the night, without even knowing it. The eating of raw meat also makes the toyol stronger.
# They are intensely jealous, especially when they know that a new child is on the way.
# Their powers will increase with each year.
# The owner has to feed it blood the 14th of each month (they seem very particular about their eating patterns. They will not touch something as disgusting as a sanitary pad)
# They are used for finding information for their owners:
## Giving their owners information at the gambling table but it is typically difficult because the casinos would usually have their own toyols guarding the place. The casino would also have employed other spiritual masters to bless the place with gods so that outside toyols cannot enter. The owner would have better luck if he was playing with his friends or an unprotected place. 
## They are also used by [[fortune teller]]s who will get their toyols to give background information on their customers so that they will be convinced of the fortune teller's prowess.
# They can even help their owner (if male) to seduce women.
# But they can turn against their owner, if there is a child on the way. It will become jealous, causing the owner to have bad luck, constantly losing things and even confusing the owner.
# When you get the toyol initially from the Spiritual master, he will teach you how to control it. He will teach you a few chants so that you can tell the toyol instructions such as (1) to eat (2) look for information you need (3) do certain tasks. There is even a chant to the effect that it will “get beaten/caned” if it’s not obedient.
# If it is not well taken care of, it will sometimes create trouble for the owner so that it will be taken back to the spiritual master that created it so that it can complain to him against the owner.
# In order to get rid of a toyol, you have to take it back to the spiritual master that made it. But complications arise when that master dies. Then the spiritual master’s disciple will have to be sought to solve the problem. If no disciple is to be found, it then becomes a big problem! Other spiritual masters/ghost catchers can be called in to convince it to go.
# The toyols ultimately wants to be reborn/reincarnated. But some choose not to take that path because when they are reincarnated, they may not be reborn as humans again. Because of what they are and what they have done, judgment will be passed onto them and they will have to go through a few cycles lasting a few hundred years (risking reborn as animals first), before they can be reborn ultimately as a human. Hence they may choose to stay a toyol. The owner can choose the toyol to take over the body of his unborn child.
# In the event that the bottle/jar is broken, they will be stronger as they are now freed and there is nothing to restrain/control them. The owner will also be punished for breaking the bottle. The owner will then have to get the bottle replaced and get it refilled with corpse oil.
# The bottle has to be put under the moon to absorb its energy so that it will be strong. Blood is dripped into the bottle every 14th of the month. Corpse oil has to be refilled if the levels drop in the bottle.
# Like a child, when telling the toyol to accomplish a task, very specified instructions have to be given to it. E.g. You need it to steal a $10,000 for you. You have to go through the steps of (1) showing it the different denominations. (2) telling it what the rewards of bringing back the different denomination, $10 will get it a certain amount of sweets and with $50, it will get it a bigger amount (3) showing it what a 10 thousand note look like and telling it the reward for bringing the note back.
# It cannot help make predictions for four-digit numbers. But in rare cases where it is a powerful toyol, it can approach a spirit/ghost for numbers. But this seldom happens.
# It understands different languages.
# It likes to be treated like a baby echidna. Enjoys hugs like a baby and listening to lullabies. Usually under the beds of the owners, there will be toys, marbles, toy cars and baby sucklers. Likes to be rewarded with sweets and toys. Some of them will even ride a child’s tricycle. They supposedly also like to play with water.
# To find out if the house has a toyol, you can line up matchbox toy cars in a line. You will find them moving on their own.
# During meal times, the owner and the toyol have to eat together. A plate of food, the same as what the owner is eating, has to be placed beside the owner during mealtime. If the owner forgets to feed the toyol, he will find bruise(s) on his body to serve as warning. If circumstance really does not allow them to eat together, then the toyol has to be fed first before the owner eats. Food that has been offered to the toyol and “eaten” by it, supposedly spoils very quickly.
# It is not true that you can abandon a toyol overseas. Supposedly it can latch itself onto people’s luggage and make its way back.
# Because the toyol is consistently fed with the owner’s blood, it has established a link with the owner. With the passing of time, the link is so strong that there is no need for spoken words and the two can communicate via “the heart” (用心沟通). Eventually it can even read the owner’s thoughts. In some cases, they are aware that the owner is thinking of abandoning them before the deed is done. Sometimes they choose to communicate to the owner in their dreams.
# They sometimes complain to the owner if it is not treated right. It has to be treated with tender loving care (爱心). Owners when getting one of these toyols have to know that they have a responsibility towards looking after them and not only be concern about the benefits they bring. They are not pets that can be abandoned.
# Malays who keep toyol like to pass it down to their children because they know the toyol has helped them and it can continue to do the same for their children.
# Initially when it is brought back, its presence may not be felt. But as it spends more and more time in the house, you will know if it’s around.
# Toyols that stay evoked for long periods take on features akin to men and women.
# There are also female toyols. But male ones are more common as the girl toyols are more vicious and difficult to control. The bond with their owners is stronger and closer, hence they are more possessive and jealous. They also tend to be stubborn. If they want something, there will be no negotiation. Their preference for toys would be dolls and not cars. They will not perform all the tasks of the boy toyols. They are more homebound and hence will not perform tasks such as stealing. They are usually used to defend the house and beat up baddies. Due to their “lack of usefulness” and control issues, female toyols are not common.
# Toyols are dressed. Owners would buy children clothes, placing them in the cupboard for them to wear.
# If the toyol knows that the owner is planning to destroy it, it will make sure that the owner dies together with it.

'''Zoe''' is a 3-year-old orange female monster on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', originally performed by [[Fran Brill]]. She was designed in her color to complement [[Elmo]], who was gaining popularity at her introduction in 1993.
Before Season 33, Zoe wore only her [[barrettes]], [[bracelets]], and [[necklace]].

She has regularly been dressed in a [[ballet tutu|tutu]] since season 33, as like many girls of her age, Zoe is obsessed with [[ballet]]. Her love of dance in general resulted in the video ''Zoe's Dance Moves''. In Season 49, she returns to her sans-tutu wardrobe.

She often rides a [[Gravity racer|soapbox-style car]] around ''Sesame Street'', called the Zoemobile. She has a [[pet rock]], Rocco, much to Elmo's constant dismay.
 
Though it is likely she has many relatives, only the voice of her Aunt Chloe has been heard on the show. Recently, her aunt Gizelle, who lives in Swan Lake, sent her the tutu she wears. This is a reference to the character of Giselle in the ballet ''[[Giselle]]''.

Her film debut was ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]''. Her first video appearance was ''[[The Best of Elmo]]''; she then appeared in the videos ''Do The Alphabet'' and ''Big Bird Sings!''.

Starting with Season 46, [[Jennifer Barnhart]] took over the role of Zoe, following Fran Brill's retirement in 2014.
