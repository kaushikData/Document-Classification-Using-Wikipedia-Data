'''ASAPROSAR''' (Asociación Salvadoreña Pro-Salud Rural - The Salvadoran Association for Rural Health) is a [[non-governmental organization]] that provides health, education, environment and economic development programs in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asaprosar.org ASAPROSAR website] Retrieved 6/14/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/22-3199621/friends-asaprosar.aspx Guidestar ASAPROSAR Nonprofit Report] Retrieved 6/14/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

ASAPROSAR was founded in 1986 by [[Vicky Guzman|Dr. Vicky Guzmán]]. The organization developed out of Dr. Guzmán's work providing health services and training to rural communities in her native El Salvador in the 1970s. Founded during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], ASAPROSAR continued Dr. Guzman's work providing health services to the rural poor. In the 1990s, ASAPROSAR developed a post conflict resolution program that sought to help reintegrate ex-combatants from the civil war into society.&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=612166 From Bullets to Blackboards: Education for Peace in Latin America and Asia.] E.

Headquartered in [[Santa Ana, El Salvador]], ASAPROSAR has over 200 local employees in the education, health and social work fields. ASAPROSAR also has staff and volunteers based in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofasaprosar.org/ Friends of ASAPROSAR] US based volunteer organization supporting ASAPROSAR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9024">The '''Akanksha Infertility Clinic''' is a [[women's health]] centre located in [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]], [[Gujarat]], [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;Kari Points, [COMMERCIAL SURROGACY AND 
FERTILITY TOURISM IN INDIA The Case of Baby Manji https://web.duke.edu/kenanethics/CaseStudies/BabyManji.pdf], Case Studies in Ethics, The Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University&lt;/ref&gt; and
headed by Dr '''Nayna Patel'''.&lt;ref&gt;Nita Bhalla and Mansi Thapliyal
Mon Sep 30, 2013, [India seeks to regulate its booming 'rent-a-womb' industry https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/30/us-india-surrogates-idUSBRE98T07F20130930], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;  The clinic was founded in 1999, and was originally focused on [[In vitro fertilisation|In Vitro Fertilization.]] India declared commercial surrogacy legal in 2002; however the clinic did not begin to do surrogacy until 2004.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/childbirth-global-crossroads-0|title=Childbirth at the Global Crossroads|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie|date=September 19, 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patel, who appeared on [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s talk show in 2007, has produced more than 1000 surrogate babies as of October 2015.

Patel states that "we provide a legitimate service to those in need, whether it is the couple who desperately want a child or the woman who wishes to change her circumstances, to educate her children, build a house or pay off debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivf-surrogate.com/|title=Akanksha|website=ivf-surrogate.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==Surrogacy==
How this works is a couple will go to the clinic, request a surrogate, and essentially rent her womb for the next nine months. The surrogate will be implanted with the sperm and egg, and hopefully after having a successful birth, will give up the child to its parents. The women are then paid. Dr. Patel pays her surrogates around 400,000 rupees ($6,500). Couples are charged an average of $25,000 to $30,000 per baby.

Of the women who work as surrogates “nearly half described themselves as housewives and the rest were a mix of domestic, service, and manual laborers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;” . Most of them are married and have children of their own. They must live at the clinic, are heavily monitored and restricted, and are not allowed sex for the duration of their pregnancy. Their young children are allowed to stay with them, as a way to prevent to the women from getting attached to the baby they are carrying. During their required stay “residents are offered daily English classes and weekly lessons in computer use” and the director “arranges film screenings and gives out school backpacks and pencil boxes to surrogates’ children".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In India, “surrogacy...is slated to add $2 billion to the nation's gross domestic product”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So the country gets money, the surrogates get the needed money, and a couple gets a baby.

For comparison, in USA, the cost is $150,000, in a handful of states where it is permitted. 
For surrogates, the compensation outweighs the downside. A recent surrogate was the wife of an auto-rickshaw driver with three daughters of her own. she had to live in a hostel for nine months with 60 other surrogates so the [[clinic]] could monitor her health.

Akanksha claims an implantation success rate of 44%, similar to other Indian clinics, compared with a US norm of 31%.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Carney, Inside India’s Rent-a-Womb Business https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/02/surrogacy-tourism-india-nayna-patel?page=2, Mother Jones, March/April 2010 Issue&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Regulations and Rights ===
While surrogacy is legal, it is highly unregulated. There is are laws in the progress of being made to attempt to aid the surrogate mothers. However it does “little to improve the life for women” and takes away their rights to decide whether they want an abortion or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another problem is that “lack of regulation could spark a price war for surrogacy”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This means that other countries could have surrogates willing to be paid a lower wage per baby carried. This leads to surrogate clinics basically competing against other clinics in other countries, creating a “race to the bottom.” If this happens then the protections for surrogate mothers could decrease; “with countries slowly under-cutting fees and legal protections for surrogates along the way”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are other cultural consequences as well. Women who are surrogates face the risk and consequences of being rejected from society or being discriminated against. There is another issue, the “dilemma of all rural surrogates: being suspected of adultery -a cause for shunning or worse”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Citizenship ===
There was an issue of the citizenship of children, as many countries do not recognize surrogacy and these babies therefore have no legal standing &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/03/india-surrogate-embryo-ban-hardship-gujarat-fertility-clinic|title=‘We pray that this clinic stays open’: India’s surrogates fear hardship from embryo ban|last=Doshi|first=Vidhi|date=2016-01-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baby Manji controversy===
A Japanese baby girl born to an Indian surrogate mother was in legal limbo after the couple who had intended to raise her divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Gardner, [Surrogate baby in legal limbo http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/surrogate-baby-in-legal-limbo#ixzz2gP5nCM00], The National, August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The three-month-old baby had been unable to leave India after her birth because she holds neither an Indian nor a Japanese nationality. The issue was resolved after the Japanese Government issued a one-year visa to her on humanitarian grounds, after the Indian Government had granted the baby a travel certificate in September in line with a Supreme Court direction.&lt;ref&gt;Press Trust of India, [Baby Manji reaches Osaka http://www.indianexpress.com/news/baby-manji-reaches-osaka/380945/], November 3, Tue Nov 04 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

=== The Ban on Surrogacy ===
In October 2015 a letter was sent by [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR).  The letter bans foreign couples getting Indian surrogates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=9211haea&amp;id=GALE%7CA433155727&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=ebsco&amp;ugroup=outside&amp;authCount=1&amp;selfRedirect=true|title=Surrogate mothers stage protest in Anand|last=|first=|date=October 31, 2015|website=The Times of India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked public outcry and protests. People are concerned about the affect the ban will have on the economy of Anand.

The surrogacy industry has played a role in transforming the economy of Anand in India and financially bettering the lives of thousands of poor families and the government’s recent move to ban the practice will wipe out incomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/indian-surrogacy-ban-leads-to-pain-and-anguish-for-gulf-couples-1.105031|title=Indian surrogacy ban leads to pain and anguish for Gulf couples|work=The National|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “About 5,000 families in Anand are surviving on surrogacy,” says Dr Patel, whose clinic has been at the forefront of the country’s commercial surrogacy sector. “There are the surrogates, the nannies, the rickshaw drivers, the hoteliers who employ hundreds of peoples, the restaurants, the shops. There are so many people directly or indirectly surviving on surrogacy, so it’s going to be a huge economic impact as far as Anand is concerned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;”

=== Protections ===
In 2008 a law - the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Bill (ART) - was introduced to protect surrogates, the children and the commissioning parents.&lt;ref&gt;Nita Bhalla and Mansi Thapliyal, [India seeks to regulate its booming 'rent-a-womb' industry, https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/30/us-india-surrogates-idUSBRE98T07F20130930], Sep 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Anup Gupta, the founder of [[Delhi IVF]], a clinic that handles five to six cases a month said that "The legislation will facilitate surrogacy".&lt;ref&gt;Nirmala Ganapathy, 
The Straits Times, [A Rented Womb http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=5005], August 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World (AMFPA)''' is a for-profit international organization facilitating the sale of artwork produced by [[mouth and foot painting]] artists associated with the organization. None of the artists have proper use of their hands as a pre-condition to joining the association. It represents around 820 artists located in 76 countries, of whom 143 ( as of 2016) are full members, and receive a monthly fee from the organization from the date of their admission until their death. The other artists are students, who receive a monthly scholarship until such time as they are promoted.

The main product of the organization is [[Christmas card]]s designed by the member artists. These cards are sold every year in the months leading up to Christmas via [[direct mail]]ing in 48 countries around the world. Other products include postcards, art prints and calendars.

The parent company in [[Liechtenstein]] acquires the reproduction rights of a given painting and distributes it internationally. The original works are also sold at exhibitions held throughout the world. Works produced by the members have been shown in the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] and at the [[European Council]] in [[Strasbourg]].

== History ==

AMFPA was founded in 1957 as the '''Vereinigung der Mund- und Fussmalenden Künstler in aller Welt, e. V. (VDMFK)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdmfk.com/|title=VDMFK International|publisher=VDMFK International}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Liechtenstein]]. It was styled a "self-help" organization and had the scope to further the painting skills of any mouth or foot painter, to promote their artwork and to support them financially.

=== A. Erich Stegmann ===
The first president of the association, Arnulf Erich Stegmann, was a prominent figure in the development of mouth and foot painting. Born in 1912 in Darmstadt, Germany, Stegmann lost the use of both arms from [[polio]] at the age of two. Regardless, his artistic talents were soon recognized and supported by his teachers. He was proficient with a variety of brushes and styles, using only his mouth. He was educated at the School of Higher Education for Book Trade and Graphics in [[Nuremberg]] and studied with the artists Erwin von Kormöndy and Hans Gerstacker. He made a living selling his art cards and prints at marketplaces. After the [[Second World War]] he established his own publishing company with the poignant name "Dennoch" ("Anyway").

In 1953/54 he organized the "Lodge of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists" as a type of artists' community. This developed into the international "Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists", with Stegmann elected president for life.

== Objectives ==

The association's stated objectives are:
* Find as many mouth and foot painting artists as possible.
* Safeguard and promote the interests of the mouth and foot painting artists, improve their working and living conditions, promote and improve their artistic abilities and skills, in particular, by promoting the commercial use of their work.
* Conclude and negotiate contracts with publishers in countries all over the world.
* Grant scholarships to promote the development of mouth and foot painting artists.
* Collect and make available to its members or Student Members the literature and medical or other aids owned by the Association or by others.
* Organise exhibitions by mouth and foot painting artists.
* Collect, catalogue, and administer the works created by the members.

== Organization ==

The association is run as a "democratic co-operative". Any mouth and foot painter of unimpeachable reputation living anywhere in the world can become a member of the association, provided they are 18 years of age and their works are considered artistic by the Jury who then recommends them for membership to the Managing Board.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The management procedures are governed by the statutes, which require that a Delegates Convention or General Assembly of all members must be held at least once every three years.

For electoral purposes, the Association divides the world into four regions: Europe, Africa and the Middle East; the Americas; the Far East; Australasia and Oceania. Each region deputes at least one delegate for every five members.

The managing board members and the president are elected by the members of the association. With the exception of the legal representative, every managing board member has to be a recognized mouth or foot painter.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Member organizations==
===United Kingdom===
'''The Mouth and Foot Painting Artists ''' ('''MFPA''') is the British organization for mouth and foot painters, and is a member organization of AMFPA. It was established in 1973 following legislation which required that disabled people be in charge of the business activities of an organization representing them.&lt;ref name="british"&gt;{{cite web|title=British partnership|url=https://www.mfpa.uk/about-mfpa/british-partnership/|publisher=The Mouth and Foot Painting Artists|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

Then years ago AMFPA has been the subject of several [[Exposé (journalism)|exposés]] in [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] media, suggesting unethical behaviour within the organization. The coverage has spurred criticism from charity, consumer and handicap organizations. The criticism included:

* That AMFPA effectively poses as a [[charity organization]] although it is purely a commercial venture, in effect [[Confidence trick|conning]] charitable people out of money.&lt;ref name="TP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lorscheid |first=Helmut |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/19/19093/1.html |title=Alle Jahre wieder... |publisher=Telepolis |date=24 December 2004 |language=de |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verbrauchernews.de/artikel/0000006844.html |title=An Postkarten von Mund- und Fussmalern verdient vor allem ein Lichtensteiner Wirtschaftsunternehmen |publisher=''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] |date=22 December 2000 |accessdate=29 July 2016 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528060938/http://www.verbrauchernews.de/artikel/0000006844.html |archive-date=2016-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KO1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/DR1/kontant/2005/12/06150809.htm |title=Hyggeligt salgsbrev snyder |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093112/http://www.dr.dk/DR1/kontant/2005/12/06150809.htm |archivedate=6 April 2012 |date=6 December 2005 |language=da }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-1631113.html |title=Hjertet på rette sted, men pengene ... |language=da |publisher=[[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]] |date=28 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The use of high pressure sales tactics by sending its main sales item, Christmas card packages to consumers via unsolicited [[direct mail]] with an option to pay afterwards.&lt;ref name="KO1"/&gt;
* The secrecy maintained by the company.

No claims have been made suggesting any illegal activity by AMFPA. The criticism has been centred on what is perceived as bad [[ethics]].

=== AMFPA's response to criticism ===

The AMFPA has in some news reports and court hearings responded to some of the claims, stating that AMFPA has never intentionally presented itself as a charitable organization, but instead has explicitly pointed its commercial nature out to consumers. AMFPA has also stated that 80% of the worldwide profits are distributed among the artists. AMFPA declined to present financial records to support this claim.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfje.dk/cfje/Lovbasen.nsf/ID/LB04884975?OpenDocument |title=Kendelse fra Pressenævnet i sag 2006-6-288 (Danish press ethics council ruling) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829153307/http://www.cfje.dk/cfje/Lovbasen.nsf/ID/LB04884975?OpenDocument |date=14 June 2006 |archivedate=29 August 2007 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMFPA stated that it never introduced pressure sales tactics but made use of direct mailing many years before competitors and charity organisations introduced similar methods.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} AMFPA sees itself as a victim of an unfair and tendentious journalistic coverage lacking of true facts and suspecting bad ethics.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Litigation ===

In June 2007 the company sued the [[Danmarks Radio|Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] and Danish daily ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'' for [[libel]], following negative coverage during December 2005. On 10 October 2008, the [[Courts of Denmark#High Courts|High Court of Eastern Denmark]] ruled in favor of the accused journalists, stating that there was sufficient factual basis for statements like: "Behind the scenes we found a well-oiled money making machine with economic puppeteers, who are scraping in money with arms and legs"; "People think they are supporting a charity, but in reality we are looking at a money making machine"; and "...only a measly 3% is going to the mouth and foot painting artists". AMFPA did not appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="COURT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avm.dk/nyhed/visnyhed.php?nyhedsnummer=1164 |title=DR vandt sag om ytringsfrihedens grænser |publisher=avm.dk |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2016 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioenhancers''' or bioavailability enhancers is a new chapter in medical science first scientifically established in 1979 after the discovery of world's first bioenhancer Piperine. It is a pocket friendly drug technology which reduces the destruction, wastage and elimination of several orally administered drugs inside the body.

'''Definition''' Bioenhancers are defined as substances that increase the [[bioavailability]] and bioefficacy of active substances with which they are combined without having any activity of their own  at the dose used. Besides several classes of modern drugs like antibiotics, anti cancer drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anti inflammatory, central nervous drugs, etc., they also increase the bioavailability of vitamins and nutrients.

Increased Bioavailabiity means increased levels of drug in the blood stream available for drug action. Increased Bioefficecy means the increased effectiveness of the drug due to increased bioavailability and also due to other mechanisms.
 
'''Significance of Bioenhancers'''
Due to an increased bioavailability, the dose and cost of active drug can be reduced, making the formulation cheaper and safer, better tolerated,  having better efficacy, better compliance and having lesser risk of developing drug resistance as in case of antibiotics. As it benefits the dose economy,it is particularly of great value to poor ill diseased segment of society.For example, by reducing the required dose of expensive toxic Rifampicin by 60 percent,it correspondingly reduces the cost and side effects of Rifampicin while treating the dreaded disease Tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioenhancers|url=http://www.jaim.in/text.asp?2010/1/2/96/65073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History''' 
Bioenhancers or bioavailability enhancers as a term and chapter did not exist in any modern scientific literature prior to 1979.  The term bioavailability enhancers was first coined in 1979 at Indian Institute of Integrative medicine, Jammu, formerly RRL,Jammu, by Indian scientists (Dr. C. K. Atal, the Director of institute RRL Jammu proposed the hypothesis of increased bioavailability of drugs from a clue during research on traditional medicinal drugs). Subsequently, the concept of bioavailability enhancers was scientifically researched and scientifically established by him and his research team at RRL Jammu. The institute then discovered and scientifically validated Piperine as the world's first bioenhancer using Sparteine and Vasicine which became the world's first experimentally bioenhanced drugs. Dr.Atal also initiated the bioenhanced anti tubercular drug research project using Rifampicin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4044481 | volume=33 | title=Influence of piperine on rifampicin blood levels in patients of pulmonary tuberculosis | year=1985 | journal=J Assoc Physicians India | pages=223–4 | last1 = Zutshi | first1 = RK | last2 = Singh | first2 = R | last3 = Zutshi | first3 = U | last4 = Johri | first4 = RK | last5 = Atal | first5 = CK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later resulted in development of world's first bioenhanced anti tubercular drug formulation. This DCGI approved formulation was officially released by Indian government at Anusandhan Bhawan Delhi on world tuberculosis day 2011, and also presented to Mr. Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft same day at a function at Le Meridian in Delhi.

After the discovery of bioenhancer Piperine in 1979, a new chapter was added in medical science. Since then it has generated global interest and research in the field and has led to discovery of many other new bioenhancers. Piperine remains the most potent and extensively researched bioenhancer till date. It is safe, effective, extremely economical and  easily manufactured for commercial use.It is also a broad spectrum bioenhancer acting on several classes of modern drugs as noted elsewhere.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=World's first bioenhancer Piperine|url=http://www.iiim.res.in/award-ckatal.pdf.}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RRL jammu drug research|url=http://www.herbalnet.org/events.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bioenhancers of herbal origin| pmc=3634921 | pmid=23620848 | doi=10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60060-X| volume=3| year=2013| journal=Asian Pac J Trop Biomed| pages=253–66 | last1 = Kesarwani | first1 = K | last2 = Gupta | first2 = R | last3 = Mukerjee | first3 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classification''' bioenhancers can be classified according to their source of origin, either plant based or animal based or else according to their site of action.

Bioenhancers so far almost exclusively discovered in plants, increase the bioavailability of other substances in different ways:
* Increase of absorption in the [[intestine]]
* Inhibition of degradation in the intestine and the liver by inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes (inhibiting first pass mechanism of destruction of drugs).
* Inhibition of elimination in the drug in gut and through bile by inhibition of efflux pumps.
* Increase of drug permeability of pathogens.
* Inhibition of defense mechanisms of pathogens or tumor tissue (such as efflux of drugs)
* Increasing binding possibilities on binding sites (such as DNA and proteins) of the pathogen
* Improving overcoming of the [[blood-brain barrier]]

''''''Reduced bioavailability of orally administered drugs by Destruction, elimination and wastage  inside the body'''

•	After oral ingestion and absorption, drugs reach the blood stream where the drug needs to attain a certain desired drug level in the blood to cause desired drug action.
•	After oral ingestion and absorption, drugs while passing from the gut via the liver to blood stream are inadequately absorbed, wasted, eliminated and destroyed and therefore a reduced percentage of ingested dose reaches the blood stream resulting in lower drug levels in blood.
•	Therefore, more quantity of drug has to be ingested to compensate for the losses in order to achieve desired blood levels which in turn increase the cost and side effects of drugs.

Billions of Dollars are wasted globally in various countries due to poor bioavailability of drugs, which is a huge financial burden on any nation, particularly poor developing countries.This is particularly relevant in serious and dreaded diseases on mankind like tuberculosis for which treatment is expensive, toxic and prolonged and for which an emergency situation has been declared by UN due to emergence of AIDS and development of serious drug resistance.

''''''BENEFICIAL ROLE OF BIOENHANCERS''''''

'''Reduced dose'''- Bioenhancers prevent this wastage of ingested drugs inside the body and increase quantity of drug reaching the blood, therefore a reduced dosage of oral drug is sufficient to achieve the desired blood levels.

'''Reduced burden on raw material of country''' -This reduced dose needed for desired drug action means beneficial effect on raw materials consumption required to develop drugs which is a great savings for any country.

'''Ecological advantage'''- This also translates into ecological advantage in case of rare and expensive plant based drugs as less trees or plant have to be consumed to produce drugs, an example being the costly anti cancer drug Taxol derived from  very slow growing Yew trees .

'''Reduced drug cost'''- This reduced dose in turn also reduces the cost of drugs.

'''Reduced adverse reactions'''- This reduced dose in turn also reduces the side effects of drugs.

'''Improved compliance'''- Lesser side effects also improve drug tolerability, drug compliance and promote completion of treatment.

'''Reduced drug resistance'''- This improved tolerability and compliance in turn reduces risk of developing dangerous drug resistance.

'''Added hepatoprotective and gastroprotective actions''' of bioenhacer piperine reduces gastrointestinal side effects and hepatotoxicity of primary active drug which further makes formulation safer, better tolerated and again reduces drug toxicity and drug resistance.

This is a great advantage to poor patients, poor countries and for dreaded diseases of man.

== Examples of bioenhancers ==

The following examples of bioenhancers give an insight into the current pharmacological research and show how with pepper, curry, ginger and other herbal ingredients in food a lack of nutrients or insufficient effects of active agents can be prevented:

[[Piperine]], an ingredient of pepper, promotes intestinal absorption by activation of the γ-glutamyltranspeptidase and inhibits the degradation of many compounds, by inhibiting different enzymes: aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), ethylmorphine N-demethylase, Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronyltransferase (UGT), P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. Especially the latter two enzymes contribute significantly to the first-pass effect.

Piperine acts as bioenhancer to vitamins (A, B1, B2, B6, C, D, E, K), amino acids (lysine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, valine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and methionine), minerals (iodine, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, magnesium, potassium, manganese), herbal compounds (including ginsenosides, Pycnogenol), and drugs (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, rifampicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, vasicine, pyrazinamide, fexofenadine, resveratrol, epigallocatechin, curcumin).

[[Allicin]] from garlic enhances the effect of the fungicide amphotericin B on yeast cells by affecting the transport of the fungicide into the yeast vacuole.

[[Curcumin]] which inter alia is found in curry inhibits like piperine the enzyme CYP3A4 and affects the transport function of P-glycoprotein. In combination with curcumin an increased bioavailability of the active compounds celiprolol and midazolam was detected.

[[Ginger]] promotes due to the gingerols the intestinal absorption of many compounds (including drugs) and elements. In most cases, ginger acts synergistically with piperine.

[[Glycyrrhizin]], a saponin of the liquorice plant, promotes the action of numerous antibiotics and the antifungal agent clotrimazole.

[[Quercetin]], a flavonoid from fruits and leaves, acts like curcumin and piperine. It increases the bioavailability of the active agent paclitaxel used to treat cancer.

==Application of research results==

The bioenhancer technology is primarily targeted for toxic drugs, expensive drugs, scarce drugs,poorly bioavailable drugs or drugs which need to be given for prolonged periods. However it can also be used in any drugs influenced by bioenhancers. The discovery and characterization of bioenhancers has led to several patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|Land=USA|V-Nr=EP0742722 B1|Titel=Method for increasing bioavailability of oral pharmaceutical compositions|V-Datum=2002-4-17|Erfinder=Leslie Benet,Yuan Chi Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|Land=USA|V-Nr=EP1127579 A3|Titel=Method for increasing bioavailability of oral pharmaceutical compositions|V-Datum=2004-1-21|Erfinder=Leslie Benet,Yuan Chi Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piperine is marketed as bioenhancer in mono preparations and as a component of [[dietary supplements]] that contain different vitamins, [[curcumin]], [[resveratrol]] or [[Coenzyme Q10|Coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Since  bioenhancers can reduce the dosage and cost of expensive medication while making treatment safer, its application has for the first time been done in humans in treating tuberculosis for which the existing drugs are toxic and expensive and need to be administered over prolonged periods. In India where low treatment costs for medical care are essential, the drug Risorine is approved against tuberculosis. Besides the [[antibiotics]] rifampicin and isoniazid it contains piperine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atal | first1 = N | last2 = Bedi | first2 = KL | year = 2010 | title = Bioenhancers: revolutionary concept to market | journal = J Ayurveda Integr Med | volume =  1| issue = | pages = 96–99 | pmc=3151395 | pmid=21836795 | doi=10.4103/0975-9476.65073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs''' ('''OES''') is a bureau within the [[United States Department of State]]. It coordinates a portfolio of issues related to the world's oceans, environment, science and technology, and health.

==Overview==

The Bureau is headed by the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]].  As of April 2014, it is headed by acting Assistant Secretary [[Judith G. Garber|Judith Garber]]. 

The Oceans and Fisheries Directorate has two offices dedicated to international oceans issues. The Office of Marine Conservation focuses on international [[Fishery|fisheries]] matters and related problems and the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs has primary responsibility for [[Law of the sea|international ocean law]] and policy, [[marine pollution]], [[marine mammals]], polar affairs, [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]], and [[marine science]].  It is headed by  Deputy Assistant Secretary David A. Balton.

The Environment Directorate deals with environmental issues including environmental aspects of international trade and safeguarding hazardous materials requiring multilateral agreements within the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Affairs. The Office of Conservation and Water develops U.S. foreign policy approaches to conserving and managing the world [[ecosystem]]s and to transboundary water issues.  The Environment Directorate is headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Daniel Reifsnyder. 

The Health, Space and Science Directorate includes the Office of International Health Affairs which works with U.S. Government agencies to facilitate policy-making regarding international [[bioterrorism]], [[infectious disease]], surveillance and response, [[environmental health]], and health in post-conflict situations. The Office of Space and Advanced Technology handles issues arising from our [[Space exploration|exploration of space]] to assure global security regarding this new frontier, and the Office of Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Cooperation promotes the interests of the U.S. [[Scientific community|science]] and technology communities in the international policy arena, negotiates framework and other S&amp;T agreements, manages the Department's Embassy Science fellows program, and takes a leading role in representing U.S. science and technology in multilateral international organizations, such as [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] and other [[United Nations|UN]] organizations, [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and others. The Health, Space and Science Directorate is headed by acting Deputy Assistant Secretary Jonathan Margolis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4583">'''CT Values''' are an important part of calculating [[disinfectant]] dosage for the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of [[drinking water]]. A CT value is the product of the concentration of a disinfectant (e.g. free chlorine) and the contact time with the water being disinfected. It is typically expressed in units of mg-min/L.

The goal of disinfection is the inactivation of microorganisms. This depends on: the microorganism, the disinfectant being used, the concentration of the disinfectant, the contact time, and the temperature and [[pH]] of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pine|first=Rob|title=Everything You Ever Wanted  to Know About CT (and then some)|url=http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/dwb/whats_new/documents/CT.pdf|publisher=New Mexico Environment Department|accessdate=20 October 2013|author2=Joe Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinetics==
The disinfection kinetics are conventionally calculated via the Chick-Watson model, named for the work of [[Harriette Chick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chick|first=Harriette|title=An Investigation of the Laws of Disinfection|journal=The Journal of Hygiene|date=January 1908|volume=8|issue=1|pages=92–158|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2167134/pdf/jhyg00376-0104.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013|doi=10.1017/s0022172400006987|pmid=20474353|pmc=2167134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.E. Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Herbert Edmeston|title=A Note on the Variation of the Rate of Disinfection with Change in the Concentration of the Disinfectant|journal=The Journal of Hygiene|year=1908|volume=8|page=536|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2167149/pdf/jhyg00379-0093.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013|doi=10.1017/s0022172400015928|pmid=20474372|pmc=2167149}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is expressed by the following equation:&lt;ref name=autogenerated2005&gt;{{cite book|last=MWH|title=Water Treatment: Principles And Design|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0471110183|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \ln(\frac{N}{N_0})=\Lambda_{CW} C^n t \!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt; (\frac{N}{N_0}) \!&lt;/math&gt;  is the survival ratio for the microorganisms being killed
* &lt;math&gt; \Lambda_{CW} \!&lt;/math&gt;  is the Chick-Watson coefficient of specific lethality
* &lt;math&gt; C \!&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the disinfectant (typically in mg/L)
* &lt;math&gt;  n \!&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of dilution, frequently assumed to be 1&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; t \!&lt;/math&gt; is the contact time (typically in minutes or seconds)

The survival ratio is commonly expressed as an inactivation ratio (in %) or as the number of reductions in the order of magnitude of the microorganism concentration. For example, a situation where N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]]/L and N=10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/L would be reported as a 99.9% inactivation or "3-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;" removal.

In water treatment practice, tables of the product C×t are used to calculate disinfection dosages. These tables express the required CT values to achieve a desired removal of microorganisms of interest in drinking water (e.g. ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' cysts) for a given disinfectant under constant temperature and pH conditions. A portion of such a table is reproduced below.

==Example CT Table==
CT Values for the Inactivation of Giardia Cysts by Free Chlorine at 5&amp;nbsp;°C and pH ≈ 7.0:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Office of Drinking Water|title=Guidance Manual for Compliance with the Filtration and Disinfection Requirements for Public Water Systems Using Surface Water Sources|year=1991|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/guidance_manual_for_compliance_with_the_filtration_and_disinfection_requirements.pdf|quote=Table E-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

Capital punishment in [[Bangladesh]] is a legal form of punishment&lt;ref&gt;/"Death Penalty | Amnesty International". Amnesty.org. 15 March 2014. Retrieved 2015-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; for anyone who is over 16, however in practice will not apply to persons under 18.&lt;ref&gt;["Bangladesh". The Death Penalty Worldwide database. Center for International Human Rights, Northwestern University School of Law. Retrieved 22 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Crimes that are currently punishable by death in Bangladesh are set out in the ''Penal Code'' 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code 1860, s.121, s.132, s.302, s.305.&lt;/ref&gt; These include waging war against Bangladesh, abetting mutiny, giving false evidence upon which an innocent person suffers death, murder, assisted suicide of a child, attempted murder of a child and kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Report_eng.pdf Bangladesh:Criminal justice through the prism of capital punishment and the fight against terrorism] &lt;/ref&gt; The ''Code of Criminal Procedure'' 1898 provides that "[[hanging|he be hanged by the neck until he is dead]]."&lt;ref&gt;Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, s 368.&lt;/ref&gt; For murder cases, the Appellate Division requires trial courts to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty is warranted.&lt;ref&gt;file:///Users/claudialeighs/Downloads/The_Mandatory_Death_Penalty_in_India_and_Bangladesh_stamped.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] does not anywhere expressly recognise [[Human rights|International Human Rights]] law, although some articles recognise international human rights. Article 25 of the Constitution recognises the [[United Nations Charter]]. Article 47 recognises international humanitarian law and provides that the Constitution will not limit the application of international treaties and the law of war.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, arts. 25, 47, 4 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can receive the death penalty if they are found guilty of crimes against women and children. The ''Women and Children Repression Prevention Act'' 2000 provides that the death penalty can be imposed for murder or attempted murder involving burning, poison, or acid.&lt;ref&gt;''Women and Children Repression Prevention Act'' 2000, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Causing grievous bodily harm by burning, poison or acid, if the victims eyesight, hearing, face, breasts or reproductive organs are damaged.&lt;ref&gt;''Women and Children Repression Prevention Act'' 2000, section 4(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, criminals in Bangladesh can be sentenced for death for attempted crimes and causing grievous bodily harm.

A number of offences (crimes not result in death) are punishable by death when committed by armed forces personnel. These offences include, providing aid to the enemy, cowardice and desertion and inducement to such and cowardly use of a flag of truce or any act calculated to imperil Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icomdp.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Most-serious-crimes_final_6Feb2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===International human rights law===

Bangladesh was created as a consequence of human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Awami League won Pakistan’s first election in 1970, the Pakistani Army brutally suppressed the Bengali people in East Pakistan. More than three million people were left dead, millions of women were raped, tens of millions of people were forced into extremely dirty and unpleasant refugee camps in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt; After India briefly invaded, Bangladesh was free from the brutality of Pakistani rule but faced a difficult task of rebuilding a country that was already desperately poor and prone to natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, [[Amnesty International]] believes Bangladesh is still wracked with human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt;

The People’s Republic of Bangladesh has ratified some International Human Rights Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection. http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Treaties.aspx?id=4&amp;subid=A〈=en (Accessed: 31 July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government has registered some declarations and reservations to particular articles of certain treaties. One reservation of particular importance is the reservation to Article 14 paragraph 1 of the [[Convention Against Torture]] (CAT).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Report_eng.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The reservation grounds were that Bangladesh would apply it “in consonance with the existing laws and legislation of the country.”&lt;ref&gt;visit www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat-reserve.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh has not yet ratified or acceded to a number of International Human Rights Treaties. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: 1976 was ratified in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://indicators.ohchr.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have not yet been ratified.&lt;ref&gt;http://indicators.ohchr.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty: 1991 has also not yet been ratified.&lt;ref&gt;http://indicators.ohchr.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Rights Council]] under the [[Universal Periodic Review]] reviewed Bangladesh in 2009.  A strong recommendation was made for the abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Council]], Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Bangladesh’. UN Doc A/HRC/11/18. 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladesh government in response to this said: “The death penalty is maintained in Bangladesh only as an exemplary punishment for heinous crimes such as throwing of acid, acts of terrorism, planned murder, trafficking of drugs, rape, abduction of women and children.  Both the judiciary and administration deal with these cases of capital punishment with extreme caution and compassion, and such punishment is extended only in ultimate cases that relates to gross violation of human rights of the victims. Bangladesh has an extremely low rate of implementation of such death penalties.”&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Bangladesh, Addendum’ UN Doc A/HCR/11/18/Add.1, 9 June 2009, 4, Recommendation 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that a very wide range of crimes are punishable by death is potentially conflicting with Bangladesh's International obligations. Allowing the death penalty for crimes such as kidnapping or drug trafficking is contrary to the ICCPR's mandate which states the death penalty should only be applied in the most serious of cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Report_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory death sentences==

The Women and Children Repressive Prevention Act 2000 provides that the punishment required for a person who causes death for dowry is a mandatory death sentence. This therefore means there is no other alternative punishment available and the jury are deprived the ability to apply discretion to certain circumstances relating to the crime or the accused.

===State v Shukar Ali===

This case is an example of the potentially unjust outcomes that can result from mandatory death sentences. 
On 12 July 2001, Shukar Ali, a 14 year old boy who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 7 year old girl which resulted in her death. At the time, the summer of 1999, Ali lived with his mother and elder sister in the slums of western Bangladesh’s Manikganj District.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crin.org/en/library/publications/bangladesh-mandatory-death-penalty-declared-void-after-14-year-legal-battle&lt;/ref&gt; He was not in a financial position to afford legal assistance , so he was appointed a defence lawyer by the State. This was not standard practice, however in this case was necessary because of the severity of the punishment that Ali would face if found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crin.org/en/library/publications/bangladesh-mandatory-death-penalty-declared-void-after-14-year-legal-battle&lt;/ref&gt; Ali was sentenced by the High Court Division to death by hanging under section 6 of an earlier version of the Women and Children Repressive Prevention Act, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;The Women and Children Repressive Prevention Act 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The court compelled they were compelled to make this decision regardless of his age. The court held "no alternative punishment has been provided for the offence that the condemned prisoner has been charged and we are left with no other discretion but to maintain the sentence if we believe that the prosecution has been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt. This is a case, which may be taken as "hard cases make bad laws".&lt;ref&gt;State vs Sukur Ali [9 (2004) BLC (HCD) 238].&lt;/ref&gt;
On appeal, the Appellate Division commuted Ali's death sentence to life imprisonment for "until natural death". This was the first time the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has ever overturned a decision.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crin.org/en/library/publications/bangladesh-mandatory-death-penalty-declared-void-after-14-year-legal-battle&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal law in Bangladesh has advanced significantly since Ali was first imprisoned. A law was introduced prohibiting the death penalty and life imprisonment for children. However, children are still held to be criminally responsible at the age of nine.

On 16 May 2010, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh declared that sections 6(2), 6(3), and 6(4) of the Women and Children Repressive Prevention (Special Provision) Act, 1995 unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Writ Petition No. 8283 of 2005. BLAST vs State (Not yet reported).&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that regardless of the offence, legislation may not provide that mandatory death sentences are the only available punishment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Report_eng.pdf, at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge held, “A provision of law which deprives the court to use of its beneficent discretion in a matter of life and death, without regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and, therefore without regard to the gravity of the offence cannot but be regarded as harsh, unfair and oppressive. The legislature cannot make relevant circumstances irrelevant, deprive the court of its legitimate jurisdiction to exercise its discretion not to impose death sentence in appropriate cases. Determination of appropriate measures of punishment is judicial and not executive functions [sic]. The court will enunciate the relevant facts to be considered and weight to be given to them having regard to the situation of the case. Therefore we have no hesitation in holding the view that these provisions are against the fundamental tenets of our Constitution, and therefore, ultra vires the Constitution and accordingly they are declared void."&lt;ref&gt;Sukur Ali, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and others v. The State, pp. 60–61, Civil Appeal No. 116 of 2010 with Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 374 of 2011, Supreme Court of Bangladesh, 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)==

The [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)]] (ICT of Bangladesh) is a domestic war tribunal in Bangladesh, which was set up to investigate and prosecute suspects for the genocide committed in 1971 by the [[Pakistan Army]] during the Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref&gt;Wierda, Marieke; Anthony Triolo (31 May 2012). Luc Reydams, Jan Wouters, Cedric Ryngaert, ed. International Prosecutors. Oxford University Press. p. 169. {{ISBN|978-0199554294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to be convicted in the Tribunal was [[Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu)|Abul Kalam Azad]], he had already left the country so he was not present for his own trial. He was sentenced to death in 2013. The United Nations offered its support in 2009 to make sure that similar mistakes made by other Crimes tribunals were not made in Bangladesh. The head of the United Nations in Bangladesh said "this is the first time Bangladesh is conducting war crimes tribunals and it is important it understands how other countries have held them. There are some countries where mistakes were made and we don't want Bangladesh to repeat those mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/904714/un-to-help-bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-planning&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a shift since the commencement of the trials because there is concern the International Crimes Tribunal are not carrying out their  obligations under Bangladesh's international human rights obligations, International Criminal law, and the Bangladesh Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/18/letter-bangladesh-prime-minister-regarding-international-crimes-tribunals-act&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh is a State party to the [[ICCPR]], therefore they have an obligation to meet the key provisions. Especially the provisions regarding fair trials and the rights of accused persons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/18/letter-bangladesh-prime-minister-regarding-international-crimes-tribunals-act&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heredity==

{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
Although there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.&lt;ref name="Expert09" /&gt; The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary ("sporadic cancers"). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A [[cancer syndrome]] or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.

Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in [[tumor suppressor genes]] that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of [[DNA repair|DNA repair genes]], [[oncogenes]] and [[Angiogenesis|genes involved in the production of blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson S | title = Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University.

Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014|last=Stewart|first=Bernard | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=World Health Organization|year=2014|isbn=9789283204299|location=|pages=124–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Lynnette R. | last = Ferguson | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 2010 | title = Meat and cancer |journal=Meat Science|volume=84|issue=2|pages=308–313|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.06.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2011|title=Colorectal Cancer 2011 Report: Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Colorectal Cancer|url=https://www.wcrf.org/sites/default/files/Colorectal-Cancer-2011-Report.pdf|journal=World Cancer Research Fund &amp; American Institute for Cancer Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high-[[salt]] diet is linked to [[gastric cancer]].

The relationship between diet and the development of particular cancers may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries.  For example, [[gastric cancer]] is more common in Japan due to the frequency of high-salt diets and colon cancer is more common in the United States due to the increased intake of processed and red meats.&lt;ref name="pmid19107449"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner H, Rothenbacher D, Arndt V | title = Epidemiology of stomach cancer | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 472 | issue =  | pages = 467–77 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19107449 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_23 | isbn = 978-1-60327-491-3 | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | pmc = 2166976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant communities tend to develop the cancer risk profile of their new country, often within one to two generations, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid14278899"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buell P, Dunn JE | title = Cancer Mortality among Japanese Issei and Nisei of California | journal = Cancer | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 656–64 | date = May 1965 | pmid = 14278899 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(196505)18:5&lt;656::AID-CNCR2820180515&gt;3.0.CO;2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkin|first=D.

In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of all cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Nutri06" /&gt; Every year, nearly 85,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States are related to obesity.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Individuals who underwent [[bariatric surgery]] for weight loss have reduced cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt;

There is an associated between obesity and colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Obesity has also been linked with the development of liver cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alzahrani B, Iseli TJ, Hebbard LW | title = Non-viral causes of liver cancer: does obesity led inflammation play a role? | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 345 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–9 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24007864 | doi = 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.08.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development in obesity relates to abnormal levels of metabolic proteins (including insulin-like growth factors) and sex hormones ([[estrogens]], [[androgens]] and [[progestogens]]).&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt; Adipose tissue also creates an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] environment which may contribute to the development of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert CA, Slingerland JM | title = Cytokines, obesity, and cancer: new insights on mechanisms linking obesity to cancer risk and progression | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–57 | date = 2013-01-14 | pmid = 23121183 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-121211-091527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on [[immune system]] and [[endocrine system]].&lt;ref name="Nutri06" /&gt;  More than half of the effect from diet is due to [[overnutrition]] rather than from eating too little healthy foods.&lt;ref name="Basen-Engquist_2011" /&gt;

==Hormones==
[[File:Breast cancer gross appearance.jpg|thumb|Macroscopic appearance of invasive [[ductal carcinoma]] of the breast. The tumor is the pale, crab-shaped mass at the center, surrounded by normal, yellow fatty tissue.]]
Some [[hormone]]s play a role in the development of cancer by promoting [[cell growth|cell proliferation]].&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20759/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Henderson BE, Bernstein L, Ross RK|publisher=B.C.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of [[testosterone]] than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the [[selective estrogen-receptor modulator]] [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitors]], now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.

== Infection and inflammation ==

== Radiation ==

Up to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both [[non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] radiation and [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a [[chromosome]], it can break the chromosome, result in an [[aneuploidy|abnormal number of chromosomes]], inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause [[chromosome translocation]]s, or cause other types of [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/|title=Cancer medicine|author=Little JB|publisher=B.C.

===  Non-ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Squamous cell carcinoma (3).jpg|thumb|Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.]]Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energey to break [[chemical bonds]]. Non-ionizing [[radio frequency]] radiation from [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric power transmission]], and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones|title=Cell Phones and Cancer Risk - National Cancer Institute|date=2013-05-08|publisher=Cancer.gov|access-date=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in sunlight), [[x-rays]], and [[gamma radiation]], generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name="Cleaver"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20854/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL|publisher=B.C.

Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave [[UVB]], as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

===  Ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Meningioma.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.]]Sources of ionizing radiation include [[medical imaging]], and [[radon]] gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation-induced [[meningiomas]] are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamanaka R, Hayano A, Kanayama T | title = Radiation-Induced Meningiomas: An Exhaustive Review of the Literature | journal = World Neurosurgery | volume = 97 | pages = 635–644.e8 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27713063 | doi = 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Ionizing radiation is also used in some kinds of [[medical imaging]]. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. [[Nuclear medicine]] techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. [[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.&lt;ref name="pmid18046031"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner DJ, Hall EJ | title = Computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 22 | pages = 2277–84 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18046031 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]], are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

The development of donor-derived tumors from [[organ transplants]] is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.&lt;ref name="pmid16957717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dingli D, Nowak MA | title = Cancer biology: infectious tumour cells | journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = 7107 | pages = 35–6 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957717 | pmc = 2711443 | doi = 10.1038/443035a | bibcode = 2006Natur.443...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barozzi P, Luppi M, Facchetti F, Mecucci C, Alù M, Sarid R, Rasini V, Ravazzini L, Rossi E, Festa S, Crescenzi B, Wolf DG, Schulz TF, Torelli G | title = Post-transplant Kaposi sarcoma originates from the seeding of donor-derived progenitors | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 554–61 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12692543 | doi = 10.1038/nm862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Trauma ===
Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20784/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Gaeta JF|publisher=B.C.

It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by [[kanger]] and kairo heaters (charcoal [[hand warmer]]s), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.

=== Maternal-fetal transmission ===
In the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of [[acute leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[melanoma]] and [[carcinoma]] from mother to fetus has been observed.&lt;ref name="Tolar"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolar J, Neglia JP | title = Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–4 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12794519 | doi = 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]]. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] [[histocompatibility|incompatibility]].&lt;ref name="Tolar" /&gt; In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ciguatera fish poisoning''', also known simply as '''ciguatera''', is a [[foodborne illness]] caused by eating [[reef fish]] whose flesh is contaminated with certain [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; Symptoms may include [[diarrhea]], vomiting, numbness, itchiness, sensitivity to hot and cold, [[dizziness]], and weakness.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; Onset of symptoms vary with the amount of toxin eaten from half an hour to up to two days.&lt;ref name=FAO2004/&gt; The diarrhea may last for up to four days.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt; Some symptoms typically remain for a few weeks to months.&lt;ref name=FAO2004/&gt; Heart difficulties such as a [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]] and [[low blood pressure]] may occur.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The specific toxins involved are [[ciguatoxin]] and [[maitotoxin]].&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; They are originally made by a small [[marine organism]], ''[[Gambierdiscus toxicus]]'', that grows on and around [[coral reefs]] in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] waters.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; These are eaten by [[herbivorous]] fish which in turn are eaten by larger [[carnivorous]] fish.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; The toxins become [[biomagnification|more concentrated]] as they move up the [[food chain]].&lt;ref name=FAO2004&gt;{{cite book |title=Marine biotoxins |date=2004 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |isbn=92-5-105129-1|page=Chapter 7 |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5486e/y5486e0q.htm |chapter=Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish most often implicated include [[barracuda]], [[grouper]], [[moray eel]], [[amberjack]], [[sea bass]], and [[sturgeon]].&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms together with having recently eaten fish.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt; If a number of those who eat the same fish develop symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt; If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Preventive efforts include not eating [[reef fish]], not eating high risk fish such as barracuda, and not eating fish liver, [[roe]], or fish heads.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; [[Ciguatoxin]] has no taste or smell, and cannot be destroyed by conventional [[cooking]].&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; There is no specific treatment for ciguatera fish poisoning once it occurs.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Food Poisoning from Marine Toxins - Chapter 2 - 2018 Yellow Book |url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/food-poisoning-from-marine-toxins |website=CDC |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en-us |date=2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be considered but evidence supporting its use is not very good.&lt;ref name=Fri2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=MA |last2=Fernandez |first2=M |last3=Backer |first3=LC |last4=Dickey |first4=RW |last5=Bernstein |first5=J |last6=Schrank |first6=K |last7=Kibler |first7=S |last8=Stephan |first8=W |last9=Gribble |first9=MO |last10=Bienfang |first10=P |last11=Bowen |first11=RE |last12=Degrasse |first12=S |last13=Flores Quintana |first13=HA |last14=Loeffler |first14=CR |last15=Weisman |first15=R |last16=Blythe |first16=D |last17=Berdalet |first17=E |last18=Ayyar |first18=R |last19=Clarkson-Townsend |first19=D |last20=Swajian |first20=K |last21=Benner |first21=R |last22=Brewer |first22=T |last23=Fleming |first23=LE |title=An Updated Review of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning: Clinical, Epidemiological, Environmental, and Public Health Management. |journal=Marine Drugs |date=14 March 2017 |volume=15 |issue=3 |doi=10.3390/md15030072 |pmid=28335428|pmc=5367029}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabapentin]] or [[amitriptyline]] may be used to treat some of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
The [[Center for Disease Control]] estimates that around 50,000 cases occur a year.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; Other estimates vary up to 500,000 cases per year.&lt;ref name=Fri2017/&gt; It is the most frequent [[seafood poisoning]].&lt;ref name=FAO2004/&gt; It occurs most commonly in the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] between the [[latitudes]] of 35°N and 35°S.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; The risk of the condition appears to be increasing due to coral reef deterioration and increasing trade in seafood.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; The risk of death from poisoning is less than 1 in 1,000.&lt;ref name=Yellow2018/&gt; Descriptions of the condition date back to at least 1511.&lt;ref name=FAO2004/&gt; The current name came into use in 1787.&lt;ref name=FAO2004/&gt;

[[Dyspareunia]] and other ciguatera symptoms have developed in otherwise healthy males and females following [[sexual intercourse]] with partners suffering ciguatera poisoning, signifying that the toxin may be sexually transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lange W, Lipkin K, Yang G |title=Can ciguatera be a sexually transmitted disease? |journal=J.

==Cause==
''[[Gambierdiscus toxicus]]'' is the primary [[dinoflagellate]] responsible for the production of a number of similar [[polyether]] toxins, including [[ciguatoxin]], [[maitotoxin]], [[gambieric acid]] and [[scaritoxin]], as well as the [[Fatty alcohol|long-chain alcohol]] [[palytoxin]].&lt;ref name=Identifying&gt;Faust, MA and Gulledge RA.

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dinoflagellates that may cause ciguatera include ''[[Prorocentrum]]'' spp., ''[[Ostreopsis]]'' spp., ''[[Coolia monotis]]'', ''[[Thecadinium]]'' spp. and ''[[Amphidinium carterae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms, [http://www.whoi.edu/redtide/human-health/ciguatera-fish-poisoning Ciguatera Fish Poisoning: Causative organisms:]. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms together with having recently eaten fish.&lt;ref name=Fri2017 /&gt; If a number of those who eat the same fish have symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely.&lt;ref name=Fri2017 /&gt; If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Fri2017 /&gt; Other potential causes such as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] (PSP), [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] (NSP), [[scombrotoxin fish poisoning]], and [[pufferfish poisoning]] should be excluded.&lt;ref name=Fri2017 /&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no effective treatment or antidote for ciguatera poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. There is some evidence that [[calcium channel blockers]] like [[nifedipine]] and [[verapamil]] are effective in treating some of the symptoms that remain after the initial sickness passes, such as poor circulation and shooting pains through the chest. These symptoms are due to [[vasoconstriction]] caused by [[maitotoxin]]&lt;ref name=uhm /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Attaway D, Zaborsky O |title=Marine Biotechnology |page=8 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fleming L |title=Ciguatera Fish Poisoning |url=http://www.whoi.edu/redtide/page.do?pid=9679&amp;tid=523&amp;cid=27687 |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schlossberg D |title=Infections of leisure |page=13 |year=1999 |isbn=3-540-94069-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ciguatoxin lowers the threshold for opening [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s in [[synapse]]s of the [[nervous system]]. Opening a sodium channel causes depolarization, which could sequentially cause paralysis, heart contraction, and changing the senses of hot and cold. Some medications such as [[amitriptyline]] may reduce some symptoms, such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[paresthesia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198607033150115 |vauthors=Davis R, Villar L |title=Symptomatic improvement with amitriptyline in ciguatera fish poisoning |journal=N.

J. Aust. |volume=153 |issue=5 |pages=306–7 |year=1990 |pmid=2118229}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found benefit from mannitol. However, a randomized, [[double-blind]] [[clinical trial]] found no difference between mannitol and normal [[Saline (medicine)|saline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnorf H, Taurarii M, Cundy T |title=Ciguatera fish poisoning: a double-blind randomized trial of mannitol therapy |journal=Neurology |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=873–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11914401 |doi=10.1212/WNL.58.6.873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this its use may still be considered.&lt;ref name=Fri2017 /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The current estimated global incidence annually is 20,000 to 50,000&amp;nbsp;people, though a large number of cases are believed to go unreported.&lt;ref name="UpToDate 06-04-2015"&gt;{{Citation |last=Marcus |first=Erin N. |title=Ciguatera fish poisoning |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning?source=related_link |accessdate=6 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to the limited habitats of ciguatoxin-producing microorganisms, ciguatera is common only in [[subtropical]] and [[tropics|tropical waters]], particularly the Pacific and Caribbean, and usually is associated with fish caught in tropical reef waters.&lt;ref name=Isbister-2005 /&gt; Exportation of reef fish, as well as tourism, often account for cases that develop in other regions.&lt;ref name="UpToDate 06-04-2015"/&gt;

Ciguatoxin is found in over 400&amp;nbsp;species of reef fish. Avoiding consumption of all reef fish is the only sure way to avoid exposure.&lt;ref name=Schep&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Temple WA, Beasley DM |title=Ciguatera poisoning: an increasing occurrence in New Zealand |journal=N.

*In February&amp;nbsp;2008, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) traced several outbreaks to the [[Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], near the [[Texas]]&amp;ndash;[[Louisiana]] shoreline. The FDA advised seafood processors that ciguatera poisoning was reasonably likely to occur from eating several species of fish caught as far as {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = FDA Advises Seafood Processors About Ciguatera Fish Poisoning in the Northern Gulf of Mexico Near the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = 2008-02-05 | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01790.html | accessdate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ciguatera was first described by one of the surgeon's mates, [[William Anderson (naturalist)|William Anderson]], on the crew of {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Fish Tale|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/magazine/11FOB-diagnosis-t.html?ref=magazine |quote=The illness was first described in 1774 by a surgeon's mate on the crew of Captain Cook's South Pacific exploration aboard HMS Resolution. The crewman, John Anderson, documented the symptoms described by several shipmates who had eaten a large fish caught in the tropical waters.  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-10 | first1=Lisa | last1=Sanders}} (''The New York Times'' incorrectly gives William Anderson's first name as John.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, such as Ross M. Brown with his New Religion theory suggest that ciguatera outbreaks caused by warm climatic conditions in part propelled the [[History of the Polynesian people|migratory voyages of Polynesians]] between 1000 and 1400AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02139.x |title=Did ciguatera prompt the late Holocene Polynesian voyages of discovery? |year=2009 |last1=Rongo |first1=Teina |last2=Bush |first2=Mark |last3=Van Woesik |first3=Robert |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=1423–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Did fish poisoning drive Polynesian colonization of the Pacific? |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0707-morgan_ciguatera.html |accessdate=1 June 2018 |work=news.mongabay.com |date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk tales===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
In Northern Australia, where ciguatera is a common problem, two different [[folk science]] methods are widely believed to detect whether fish harbor significant ciguatoxin. The first method is that flies are supposed not to land on contaminated fish. The second is that cats will either refuse to eat or vomit/display symptoms after eating contaminated fish. A third, less common testing method involves putting a silver coin under the scales of the suspect fish. If the coin turns black, according to the theory, it is contaminated.

On [[Grand Cayman]] and other islands the locals will test barracuda by placing a piece of the fish on the ground and allowing ants to crawl on it. If the ants do not avoid the flesh and will eat it, then the fish is deemed safe.  {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In Dominican Republic, another common belief is that during months whose names do not include the letter "R" (May through August), it is not recommended to eat certain kinds of fish, because they are more likely to be infected by the ciguatera toxin.

The validity of many of these tests has been scientifically rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=D. L.|title=Evaluation of methods for assessing ciguatera toxins in fish.|journal=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|date=1994|volume=136|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk remedies ===
Leaves of ''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]'' (Boraginaceae) – also known as ''octopus bush'' – are used in many Pacific islands as a traditional medicine to treat ciguatera fish poisoning. Senescent octopus bush leaves contain [[rosmarinic acid]] and derivatives, which are known for their [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], [[antibacterial]], [[antioxidant]], and [[anti-inflammatory]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.045 |title=Protective effect of Heliotropium foertherianum (Boraginaceae) folk remedy and its active compound, rosmarinic acid, against a Pacific ciguatoxin |year=2012 |last1=Rossi |first1=Fanny |last2=Jullian |first2=Valérie |last3=Pawlowiez |first3=Ralph |last4=Kumar-Roiné |first4=Shilpa |last5=Haddad |first5=Mohamed |last6=Darius |first6=H.

An account of ciguatera poisoning from a linguistics researcher living on Malakula island, [[Vanuatu]], indicates the local treatment: "We had to go with what local people told us: avoid salt and any seafood.  Eat sugary foods. And they gave us a tea made from the roots of ferns growing on tree trunks. I don't know if any of that helped, but after a few weeks, the symptoms faded away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dimock |first=Laura |title=Rescue mission for fading tongue |url=http://www.educationreview.co.nz/teach-international/june-2010/rescue-mission-for-fading-tongue/ |journal=New Zealand Education Review |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Caribbean folk and ritualistic treatments originated in [[Cuba]] and nearby islands. The most common old-time remedy involves bed rest subsequent to a [[guanabana]] juice [[enema]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In [[Puerto Rico]], natives drink a [[tea]] made from [[mangrove]] buttons, purportedly high in [[B vitamins]], to flush the toxic symptoms from the system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There has never been a funded study of these treatments. Other folk treatments range from directly porting and bleeding the gastrointestinal tract to "cleansing" the diseased with a dove during a [[Santería]] ritual.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

'''Clinical trials''' are [[experiment]]s or [[observation]]s done in [[clinical research]]. Such [[prospective cohort study|prospective]] biomedical or behavioral research studies on [[human subject research|human participants]] are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new [[therapy|treatments]] (such as novel [[vaccine]]s, [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]], [[medical nutrition therapy|dietary choices]], [[dietary supplement]]s, and [[medical device]]s) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on [[safety]] and [[efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clinical Trials |url=https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/clinical_trials.pdf |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are conducted only after they have received [[institutional review board|health authority/ethics committee]] approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the [[risk/benefit ratio]] of the trial – their approval does not mean that the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.

Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small [[Pilot experiment|pilot studies]], and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or [[multicenter trial|multiple centers]], in one country or in multiple countries. [[Clinical study design]] aims to ensure the scientific validity and [[reproducibility]] of the results.

Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012| pmid = 26928437| title = Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&amp;D costs| journal = Journal of Health Economics| volume = 47| pages = 20–33| year = 2016| last1 = Dimasi| first1 = Joseph A| last2 = Grabowski| first2 = Henry G| last3 = Hansen| first3 = Ronald W| hdl = 10161/12742}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]] or [[medical device]] company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an [[outsource]]d partner, such as a [[contract research organization]] or a central laboratory.

Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become an [[approved drug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ezekiel J. | last = Emanuel | author-link = Ezekiel J.

==Overview==

===Trials of drugs===
Some clinical trials involve healthy subjects with no [[pre-existing medical conditions]]. Other clinical trials pertain to patients with specific health conditions who are willing to try an experimental treatment.

When participants are healthy volunteers who receive financial incentives, the goals are different than when the participants are sick. During dosing periods, study subjects typically remain under supervision for one to 40 nights.

Usually [[pilot experiment]]s are conducted to gain insights for design of the clinical trial to follow.

There are two goals to testing medical treatments: to learn whether they work well enough, called "efficacy" or "effectiveness"; and to learn whether they are safe enough, called "safety".  Neither is an absolute criterion; both safety and efficacy are evaluated relative to how the treatment is intended to be used, what other treatments are available, and the severity of the disease or condition. The benefits must outweigh the risks.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Page last updated 25 April 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm289601.htm  FDA's Drug Review Process: Continued]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PhRMA. February 2007 [http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf Drug Discovery and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  For example, many drugs to treat cancer have severe side effects that would not be acceptable for an over-the-counter pain medication, yet the cancer drugs have been approved since they are used under a physician's care, and are used for a life-threatening condition.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual.  Last full review/revision October 2013 by Daniel A. Hussar, PhD [http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/over-the-counter_drugs/overview_of_over-the-counter_drugs.html Overview of Over-the-Counter Drugs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the elderly constitute 14% of the population, while they consume over one-third of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Avorn J. (2004). ''Powerful Medicines'', pp. 129–33. Alfred A. Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; People over 55 (or a similar cutoff age) are often excluded from trials because their greater health issues and drug use complicate [[data analysis|data interpretation]], and because they have different physiological capacity than younger people. Children and people with unrelated medical conditions are also frequently excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Spall HG, Toren A, Kiss A, Fowler RA | title = Eligibility criteria of randomized controlled trials published in high-impact general medical journals: a systematic sampling review | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 11 | pages = 1233–40 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17374817 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.11.1233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women are often excluded due to potential risks to the [[fetus]].

The sponsor designs the trial in coordination with a panel of expert clinical investigators, including what alternative or existing treatments to compare to the new drug and what type(s) of patients might benefit. If the sponsor cannot obtain enough test subjects at one location investigators at other locations are recruited to join the study.

During the trial, investigators recruit subjects with the predetermined characteristics, administer the treatment(s) and collect data on the subjects' health for a defined time period.  Data include measurements such as [[vital signs]], concentration of the study drug in the blood or tissues, changes to symptoms, and whether improvement or worsening of the condition targeted by the study drug occurs. The researchers send the data to the trial sponsor, who then analyzes the pooled data using [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]].

Examples of clinical trial goals include assessing the safety and relative effectiveness of a medication or device:
* On a specific kind of patient, for example, a patient who has been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]
* At varying dosages, for example, a 10 milligram dose instead of a 5 milligram dose
* For a new indication 
* Evaluation for improved efficacy in treating a patient's condition as compared to the standard therapy for that condition
* Evaluation of the study drug or device relative to two or more already approved/common interventions for that condition, for example, device A versus device B, or therapy A versus therapy B)

While most clinical trials test one alternative to the novel intervention, some expand to three or four and may include a [[placebo]].

Except for small, single-location trials, the design and objectives are specified in a document called a [[clinical trial protocol]]. The protocol is the trial's "operating manual" and ensures that all researchers perform the trial in the same way on similar subjects and that the data is comparable across all subjects.

As a trial is designed to test [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] and rigorously monitor and assess outcomes, it can be seen as an application of the [[scientific method]], specifically the [[experiment]]al step.

The most common clinical trials evaluate new [[medication|pharmaceutical products]], medical devices (such as a new [[catheter]]), [[biologic medical product|biologics]], [[psychological therapies]], or other interventions. Clinical trials may be required before a national [[regulatory authority]]&lt;ref name="reg-auth"&gt;The regulatory authority in the USA is the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]; in Canada, [[Health Canada]]; in the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]]; and in Japan, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]]&lt;/ref&gt; approves marketing of the innovation.

===Trials of devices===
Similarly to drugs, manufacturers of medical devices in the United States are required to conduct clinical trials for [[premarket approval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Devices, Premarket Clinical Studies for Investigational Device Exemption|url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm050419.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=2 October 2017|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Device trials may compare a new device to an established therapy, or may compare similar devices to each other. An example of the former in the field of [[vascular surgery]] is the Open versus Endovascular Repair (OVER trial) for the treatment of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], which compared the older [[open aortic repair]] technique to the newer [[endovascular aneurysm repair]] device.&lt;ref name=OVER&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederle FA, Freischlag JA, Kyriakides TC, Padberg FT, Matsumura JS, Kohler TR, Lin PH, Jean-Claude JM, Cikrit DF, Swanson KM, Peduzzi PN | title = Outcomes following endovascular vs open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a randomized trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 302 | issue = 14 | pages = 1535–42 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19826022 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter are clinical trials on mechanical devices used in the management of adult female [[urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipp A, Shaw C, Glavind K | title = Mechanical devices for urinary incontinence in women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD001756 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25517397 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001756.pub6 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0011167/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trials of procedures===
Similarly to drugs, [[medical procedure|medical]] or [[surgical procedures]] may be subjected to clinical trials,&lt;ref name=PROCEDURE_TRIALS&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farrokhyar F, Karanicolas PJ, Thoma A, Simunovic M, Bhandari M, Devereaux PJ, Anvari M, Adili A, Guyatt G | title = Randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 251 | issue = 3 | pages = 409–16 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20142732 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181cf863d }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[case-control study|case-controlled studies]] for surgical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao AM, Cox MR, Eslick GD | title = Study design in evidence-based surgery: What is the role of case-control studies? | journal = World Journal of Methodology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–4 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 27019801 | pmc = 4804244 | doi = 10.5662/wjm.v6.i1.101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concepts behind clinical trials are ancient. The [[Book of Daniel]] chapter 1, verses 12 through 15, for instance, describes a planned experiment with both baseline and follow-up observations of two groups who either partook of, or did not partake of, "the King's meat" over a trial period of ten days. [[Ancient Iranian medicine|Persian physician]] [[Avicenna]], in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) gave similar advice for determining the efficacy of medical [[drug]]s and [[Chemical substance|substances]].&lt;ref name="MeinartTonascia"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Curtis L. | last1 = Meinert | first2 = Susan | last2 = Tonascia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical trials: design, conduct, and analysis |year=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |page=3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=i1oAxuE29MUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3 |isbn=978-0-19-503568-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Melingue Jenner.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating [[James Phipps]], a boy of eight, on 14 May 1796. Jenner failed to use a [[control group]].]]
Although early medical experimentation was often performed, the use of a [[control group]] to provide an accurate comparison for the demonstration of the intervention's efficacy, was generally lacking. For instance, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], who campaigned for the introduction of [[inoculation]] (then called variolation) to prevent [[smallpox]], arranged for seven prisoners who had been sentenced to death to undergo variolation in exchange for their life. Although they survived and did not contract smallpox, there was no control group to assess whether this result was due to the inoculation or some other factor. Similar experiments performed by [[Edward Jenner]] over his [[smallpox vaccine]] were equally conceptually flawed.&lt;ref name="MeinartTonascia"/&gt;

The first proper clinical trial was conducted by the physician [[James Lind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Harvey B. |title=The Harvard Medical School guide to men's health |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |year=2002 |page=31 |isbn=978-0-684-87181-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease [[scurvy]], now known to be caused by a [[Vitamin C]] deficiency, would often have terrible effects on the welfare of the crew of long distance ocean voyages. In 1740, the catastrophic result of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Anson]]'s [[George Anson's voyage around the world|circumnavigation]] attracted much attention in Europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 had died, most of them allegedly from having contracted scurvy.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Stephen R. (2003). ''Scurvy: How a Surgeon, a Mariner, and a Gentleman Solved the Greatest Medical Mystery of the Age of Sail''. New York, NY: St. Martin's Press. {{isbn|0-312-31391-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Woodall]], an English military surgeon of the [[British East India Company]], had recommended the consumption of [[citrus fruit]] (it has an [[antiscorbutic]] effect) from the 17th century, but their use did not become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1995). ''Diffusion of Innovations''. New York, NY: The Free Press. {{isbn|0-7432-2209-1}}. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries'', John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. p. 393. {{isbn|0-471-24410-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He included a dietary supplement of an acidic quality in the experiment after two months at sea, when the ship was already afflicted with scurvy. He divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. They all received the same diet but, in addition, group one was given a quart of [[cider]] daily, group two twenty-five drops of elixir of [[vitriol]] ([[sulfuric acid]]), group three six spoonfuls of [[vinegar]], group four half a pint of seawater, group five received two [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and one [[lemon]], and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of [[barley water]]. The treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one also showed some effect of its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Medicine/Lind(1753).html|title=James Lind: A Treatise of the Scurvy (1754)|access-date=9 September 2007|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1750, the discipline began to take its modern shape.&lt;ref name="GreenCrowley2002"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Stephanie | last1 = Green | first2 = John | last2 = Crowley | first3 = Jacqueline | last3 = Benedetti | first4 = Angela | last4 = Smith | name-list-format = vanc | title = Clinical Trials in Oncology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zke8ocubNXAC&amp;pg=PA1|date=30 July 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3530-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gad2009"&gt;{{cite book | first = Shayne Cox | last = Gad | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical Trials Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8GxG0d9rpgC&amp;pg=PA118|date=17 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-46635-3|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haygarth]] demonstrated the importance of a control group for the correct identification of the [[placebo effect]] in his celebrated study of the ineffective remedy called ''[[Elisha Perkins|Perkin's tractors]]''. Further work in that direction was carried out by the eminent physician [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="MeinartTonascia"/&gt;

[[Frederick Akbar Mahomed]] (d. 1884), who worked at [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]], made substantial contributions to the process of clinical trials, where "he separated chronic [[nephritis]] with [[secondary hypertension]] from what we now term [[Hypertension|essential hypertension]]. He also founded the Collective Investigation Record for the [[British Medical Association]]; this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative clinical trials."&lt;ref name=MFOR&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Rourke MF | title = Frederick Akbar Mahomed | journal = Hypertension | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–7 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1737655 | doi = 10.1161/01.HYP.19.2.212 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | pmc = 2308176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern trials===
[[File:Austin Bradford Hill.jpg|thumb|[[Austin Bradford Hill]] was a pivotal figure in the modern development of clinical trials.]]
Sir [[Ronald A. Fisher]], while working for the [[Rothamsted experimental station]] in the field of agriculture, developed his ''Principles of experimental design'' in the 1920s as an accurate methodology for the proper design of experiments. Among his major ideas, was the importance of [[randomized experiment|randomization]] – the random assignment of individuals to different groups for the experiment;&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{isbn|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Replication (statistics)|replication]] – to reduce [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]], measurements should be repeated and experiments replicated to identify sources of variation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Hani|title=Replication study|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/replication-study.html|access-date=27 October 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blocking (statistics)|blocking]] – to arrange experimental units into groups of units that are similar to each other, and thus reducing irrelevant sources of variation; use of [[factorial experiment]]s – efficient at evaluating the effects and possible [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] of several independent factors.&lt;ref name="MeinartTonascia"/&gt;

The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|British Medical Research Council]] officially recognized the importance of clinical trials from the 1930s. The Council established the ''Therapeutic Trials Committee'' to advise and assist in the arrangement of properly controlled clinical trials on new products that seem likely on experimental grounds to have value in the treatment of disease.&lt;ref name="MeinartTonascia"/&gt;

The first randomised curative trial was carried out at the MRC Tuberculosis Research Unit by Sir Geoffrey Marshall (1887–1982). The trial, carried out between 1946–1947, aimed to test the efficacy of the chemical [[streptomycin]] for curing [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. The trial was both [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] and [[placebo|placebo-controlled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalfe NH | title = Sir Geoffrey Marshall (1887-1982): respiratory physician, catalyst for anaesthesia development, doctor to both Prime Minister and King, and World War I Barge Commander | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–4 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350072 | doi = 10.1258/jmb.2010.010019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology of clinical trials was further developed by Sir [[Austin Bradford Hill]], who had been involved in the streptomycin trials. From the 1920s, Hill applied [[statistics]] to medicine, attending the lectures of renowned mathematician [[Karl Pearson]], among others. He became famous for a landmark study carried out in collaboration with [[Richard Doll]] on the correlation between [[smoking]] and [[lung cancer]]. They carried out a [[case-control study]] in 1950, which compared lung cancer patients with matched control and also began a sustained [[prospective study|long-term prospective study]] into the broader issue of smoking and health, which involved [[British doctors study|studying the smoking habits and health of over 30,000 doctors]] over a period of several years. His certificate for election to the [[Royal Society]] called him "...the leader in the development in medicine of the precise experimental methods now used nationally and internationally in the evaluation of new therapeutic and [[prophylactic|prophylactic agents]]."

International clinical trials day is celebrated on 20 May.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmabiz.com, 19 May 2014, Mumbai [http://www.pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=81931&amp;sid=2 ISCR releases Guide for clinical trial participants on International Clinical Trials Day] (Accessed on 20 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

One way of classifying clinical trials is by the way the researchers behave.

* In an observational study, the investigators observe the subjects and measure their outcomes. The researchers do not actively manage the study.
* In an interventional study, the investigators give the research subjects a particular medicine or other intervention to compare the treated subjects with those receiving no treatment or the standard treatment. Then the researchers measure how the subjects' health changes.

Another way of classifying trials is by their purpose. The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) organizes trials into five different types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/glossary|title=Glossary of Common Site Terms|work=clinicaltrials.gov|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61BHrqVfM?url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/glossary|archive-date=24 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prevention trials look for better ways to prevent disease in people who have never had the disease or to prevent a disease from returning. These approaches may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, or lifestyle changes.
* Screening trials test the best way to detect certain diseases or health conditions.
* Diagnostic trials are conducted to find better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.
* Treatment trials test experimental treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or [[radiation therapy]].
* [[Quality of life (healthcare)|Quality of life]] trials (supportive care trials) explore ways to improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a [[chronic illness]].
* Compassionate use trials or [[expanded access]] trials provide partially tested, unapproved therapeutics to a small number of patients who have no other realistic options. Usually, this involves a disease for which no effective therapy has been approved, or a patient who has already failed all standard treatments and whose health is too compromised to qualify for participation in randomized clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Helene S | title = EU Compassionate Use Programmes (CUPs): Regulatory Framework and Points to Consider before CUP Implementation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707082132/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-07 |journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=223–229 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/BF03256820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually, case-by-case approval must be granted by both the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the pharmaceutical company for such exceptions.

A third classification is whether the trial design allows changes based on data accumulated during the trial.

* Fixed trials consider existing data only during the trial's design, do not modify the trial after it begins and do not assess the results until the study is complete.
* [[Adaptive clinical trial]]s use existing data to design the trial, and then use interim results to modify the trial as it proceeds. Modifications include dosage, sample size, drug undergoing trial, patient selection criteria and "cocktail" mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan |first=Zachary | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/CROs-Slowly-Shifting-to-Adaptive-Clinical-Trial-Designs |title=CROs Slowly Shifting to Adaptive Clinical Trial Designs|publisher=Outsourcing-pharma.com |date=2013-06-05 |access-date=2014-01-05 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive trials often employ a [[Bayesian experimental design]] to assess the trial's progress. In some cases, trials have become an ongoing process that regularly adds and drops therapies and patient groups as more information is gained.&lt;ref name=news1309&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20130916/Adaptive-Clinical-Trials-for-Overcoming-Research-Challenges.aspx |title=Adaptive Clinical Trials for Overcoming Research Challenges |publisher=News-medical.net |access-date=2014-01-04|date=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to more quickly identify drugs that have a therapeutic effect and to zero in on patient populations for whom the drug is appropriate.&lt;ref name=wsj1401&gt;{{cite web |last=Wang |first=Shirley S. |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290572010514840?KEYWORDS=adaptive+clinical+trial |title=Health: Scientists Look to Improve Cost and Time of Drug Trials - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-12-30 |access-date=2014-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314151221/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290572010514840?KEYWORDS=adaptive+clinical+trial |archive-date=14 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huber2013"&gt;{{cite book| first = Peter W. | last = Huber | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Cure in the Code: How 20th Century Law Is Undermining 21st Century Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU4TAAAAQBAJ|date=12 November 2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06981-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a common way of distinguishing trials is by phase, which in simple terms, relates to how close the drug is to being clinically proven both effective for its stated purpose and accepted by the regulatory authorities for use for that purpose.

===Phases===
{{main|Phases of clinical research}}
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into five phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through phases 1, 2, and 3, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they will also have conducted extensive [[pre-clinical development|preclinical studies]]. Each phase has a different purpose and helps scientists answer a different question.

:{| class=wikitable
|-
! Phase !! Aim!! Notes
|-
| Phase 0 || [[Pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacokinetics]] in humans || Phase 0 trials are optional first-in-human trials. Single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug or treatment are given to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) and pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Phase 0 trials: a platform for drug development? | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9685 | pages = 176 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19616703 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61309-X | last1 = The Lancet }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a test drug, the trial documents the absorption, distribution, metabolization, and removal (excretion) of the drug, and the drug's interactions within the body, to confirm that these appear to be as expected.
|-
| Phase 1 || Screening for safety || Often the first-in-man trials. Testing within a small group of people (20–80) to evaluate safety, determine safe dosage ranges, and begin to identify side effects. A drug's side effects could be subtle or long term, or may only happen with a few people, so phase 1 trials are not expected to identify all side effects. 
|-
| Phase 2 || Establishing the efficacy of the drug, usually against a placebo || Testing with a larger group of people (100–300) to determine efficacy and to further evaluate its safety. The gradual increase in test group size allows for the evocation of less-common side effects.
|-
| Phase 3 || Final confirmation of safety and efficacy || Testing with large groups of people (1,000–3,000) to confirm its efficacy, evaluate its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow it to be used safely.
|-
| Phase 4 || Safety studies during sales || Postmarketing studies delineate additional information, including the treatment's risks, benefits, and optimal use. As such, they are ongoing during the drug's lifetime of active medical use. (Particularly after approval under [[FDA Accelerated Approval Program]])

==Trial design==

{{Main|Clinical study design}}
A fundamental distinction in [[evidence-based practice]] is between [[observational studies]] and [[randomized controlled trials]].&lt;ref name="hannan"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hannan EL | title = Randomized clinical trials and observational studies: guidelines for assessing respective strengths and limitations | journal = JACC. Cardiovascular Interventions | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–7 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 19463302 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcin.2008.01.008 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936879808001702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of observational studies in [[epidemiology]], such as the [[cohort study]] and the [[case-control study]], provide less compelling evidence than the randomized controlled trial.&lt;ref name=hannan/&gt; In observational studies, the investigators retrospectively assess associations between the treatments given to participants and their health status, with potential for considerable errors in design and interpretation.&lt;ref name="sessler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sessler DI, Imrey PB | title = Clinical Research Methodology 2: Observational Clinical Research | journal = Anesthesia and Analgesia | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 1043–51 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26378704 | doi = 10.1213/ANE.0000000000000861 | url = http://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2015/10000/Clinical_Research_Methodology_2___Observational.27.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A randomized controlled trial can provide compelling evidence that the study treatment causes an effect on human health.&lt;ref name=hannan/&gt;

Currently, some phase 2 and most phase 3 drug trials are designed as randomized, [[Blind experiment|double-blind]], and [[placebo]]-controlled.
* Randomized: Each study subject is randomly assigned to receive either the study treatment or a placebo.
* Blind: The subjects involved in the study do not know which study treatment they receive. If the study is double-blind, the researchers also do not know which treatment a subject receives. This intent is to prevent researchers from treating the two groups differently. A form of double-blind study called a "double-dummy" design allows additional insurance against bias. In this kind of study, all patients are given both placebo and active doses in alternating periods.
* Placebo-controlled: The use of a placebo (fake treatment) allows the researchers to isolate the effect of the study treatment from the [[placebo effect]].

Clinical studies having small numbers of subjects may be "sponsored" by single researchers or a small group of researchers, and are designed to test simple questions or feasibility to expand the research for a more comprehensive randomized controlled trial.&lt;ref name="eldridge"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eldridge SM, Lancaster GA, Campbell MJ, Thabane L, Hopewell S, Coleman CL, Bond CM | title = Defining Feasibility and Pilot Studies in Preparation for Randomised Controlled Trials: Development of a Conceptual Framework | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150205 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26978655 | pmc = 4792418 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active control studies===
In many cases, giving a placebo to a person suffering from a disease may be unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticshowto.com/active-control-comparator/|title=Active Control / Active Comparator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this, it has become a common practice to conduct "active comparator" (also known as "active control") trials. In trials with an active control group, subjects are given either the experimental treatment or a  previously approved treatment with known effectiveness.

===Master protocol===
In such studies, multiple experimental treatments are tested in a single trial. Genetic testing enables researchers to group patients according to their genetic profile, deliver drugs based on that profile to that group and compare the results. Multiple companies can participate, each bringing a different drug. The first such approach targets [[squamous cell cancer]], which includes varying genetic disruptions from patient to patient. Amgen, AstraZeneca and Pfizer are involved, the first time they have worked together in a late-stage trial. Patients whose genomic profiles do not match any of the trial drugs receive a drug designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Susan |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/521496/can-genomics-blow-up-the-clinical-trial/ |title=Foundation Medicine Joins Coalition Aiming to Shake Up Cancer Drug Trials &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |access-date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical trial protocol===
{{Main|Clinical trial protocol}}

A [[clinical trial protocol]] is a document used to define and manage the trial. It is prepared by a panel of experts. All study investigators are expected to strictly observe the protocol.

The protocol describes the scientific rationale, objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization of the planned trial. Details of the trial are provided in documents referenced in the protocol, such as an [[investigator's brochure]].

The protocol contains a precise study plan to assure safety and health of the trial subjects and to provide an exact template for trial conduct by investigators. This allows data to be combined across all investigators/sites. The protocol also informs the study administrators (often a [[contract research organization]]).

The format and content of clinical trial protocols sponsored by pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies in the United States, European Union, or Japan have been standardized to follow Good Clinical Practice guidance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA482.pdf ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921193848/http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA482.pdf |date=21 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org/|title=ICH Official web site : ICH|work=ich.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory authorities in Canada and Australia also follow ICH guidelines. Journals such as ''[[Trials (journal)|Trials]]'', encourage investigators to publish their protocols.

===Design features===

====Informed consent====
[[File:PARAMOUNT Eli Lilly Informed Consent Document.djvu|thumbnail|right|Example of informed consent document from the [[PARAMOUNT trial]]]]

Clinical trials recruit study subjects to sign a document representing their "[[informed consent]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand|title=Learn About Clinical Studies|work=clinicaltrials.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410030741/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document includes details such as its purpose, duration, required procedures, risks, potential benefits, key contacts and institutional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protection of Human Research Subjects: A Practical Guide to Federal Laws and Regulations|last=Maloney|first=Dennis M|publisher=Springer US|year=1984|isbn=9781461327035|location=Boston, MA|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participant then decides whether to sign the document. The document is not a contract, as the participant can withdraw at any time without penalty.

Informed consent is a legal process in which a recruit is instructed about key facts before deciding whether to participate. Researchers explain the details of the study in terms the subject can understand. The information is presented in the subject's native language. Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent.

====Statistical power====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The number of subjects has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure effects of the intervention. This is described as its "[[Statistical power|power]]". The larger the number of participants, the greater the statistical power and the greater the cost.

The statistical power estimates the ability of a trial to detect a difference of a particular size (or larger) between the treatment and control groups. For example, a trial of a [[lipids|lipid]]-lowering drug versus placebo with 100 patients in each group might have a power of 0.90 to detect a difference between placebo and trial groups receiving dosage of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/dL or more, but only 0.70 to detect a difference of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.

===Placebo groups===
{{Main|Placebo-controlled studies}}

Merely giving a treatment can have nonspecific effects. These are controlled for by the inclusion of patients who receive only a placebo. Subjects are assigned [[Randomized controlled trial|randomly]] without informing them to which group they belonged. Many trials are doubled-blinded so that researchers do not know to which group a subject is assigned.

Assigning a subject to a placebo group can pose an ethical problem if it violates his or her right to receive the best available treatment. The [[Declaration of Helsinki]] provides guidelines on this issue.

=== Duration ===
[[File:Drug Evaluation Process.jpg|900px|thumbnail|center|Timeline of  various approval tracks and research phases in the US]]
Clinical trials are only a small part of the research that goes into developing a new treatment. Potential drugs, for example, first have to be discovered, purified, characterized, and tested in labs (in cell and animal studies) before ever undergoing clinical trials. In all, about 1,000 potential drugs are tested before just one reaches the point of being tested in a clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norwitz ER, Greenberg JA | title = FDA approval for use of medications in pregnancy: an uphill battle | journal = Reviews in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 39–41 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22102925 | pmc = 3218552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a new cancer drug has, on average, six years of research behind it before it even makes it to clinical trials. But the major holdup in making new cancer drugs available is the time it takes to complete clinical trials themselves. On average, about eight years pass from the time a cancer drug enters clinical trials until it receives approval from regulatory agencies for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azcc.arizona.edu/patients/clinical-trials/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions &amp;#124; University of Arizona Cancer Center |publisher=Azcc.arizona.edu |access-date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs for other diseases have similar timelines.

Some reasons a clinical trial might last several years:
* For chronic conditions such as cancer, it takes months, if not years, to see if a cancer treatment has an effect on a patient.
* For drugs that are not expected to have a strong effect (meaning a large number of patients must be recruited to observe 'any' effect), recruiting enough patients to test the drug's effectiveness (i.e., getting statistical power) can take several years.
* Only certain people who have the target disease condition are eligible to take part in each clinical trial. Researchers who treat these particular patients must participate in the trial. Then they must identify the desirable patients and obtain consent from them or their families to take part in the trial.

The biggest barrier to completing studies is the shortage of people who take part. All drug and many device trials target a subset of the population, meaning not everyone can participate. Some drug trials require patients to have unusual combinations of disease characteristics. It is a challenge to find the appropriate patients and obtain their consent, especially when they may receive no direct benefit (because they are not paid, the study drug is not yet proven to work, or the patient may receive a placebo). In the case of cancer patients, fewer than 5% of adults with cancer will participate in drug trials. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), about 400 cancer medicines were being tested in clinical trials in 2005. Not all of these will prove to be useful, but those that are may be delayed in getting approved because the number of participants is so low.&lt;ref name="pmid17497782"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JE, Crossley MJ, Turner P, Thordarson P | title = Pyromellitamide aggregates and their response to anion stimuli | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 129 | issue = 22 | pages = 7155–62 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17497782 | doi = 10.1021/ja0713781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For clinical trials involving potential for seasonal influences (such as [[Aeroallergen|airborne allergies]], [[seasonal affective disorder]], [[influenza]], and [[skin disease]]s), the study may be done during a limited part of the year (such as spring for pollen allergies), when the drug can be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss SC, Rowell R, Krochmal L | title = Impact of seasonality on conducting clinical studies in dermatology | journal = Clinics in Dermatology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 565–9 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18755376 | doi = 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2008.01.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharm-olam.com/pdf/POI-Seasonality.pdf|title=Seasonality: The Clinical Trial Manager's Logistical Challenge|publisher=Pharm-Olam International | first1 = Yamin | last1 = Khan | first2 = Sarah | last2 = Tilly | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=26 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715072506/http://www.pharm-olam.com/pdf/POI-Seasonality.pdf|archive-date=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical trials that do not involve a new drug usually have a much shorter duration. (Exceptions are epidemiological studies, such as the [[Nurses' Health Study]]).

==Administration==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Clinical trials designed by a local investigator, and (in the US) federally funded clinical trials, are almost always administered by the researcher who designed the study and applied for the grant. Small-scale device studies may be administered by the sponsoring company. Clinical trials of new drugs are usually administered by a [[contract research organization]] (CRO) hired by the sponsoring company. The sponsor provides the drug and medical oversight. A CRO is contracted to perform all the administrative work on a clinical trial. For phases 2, 3 and 4, the CRO recruits participating researchers, trains them, provides them with supplies, coordinates study administration and data collection, sets up meetings, monitors the sites for compliance with the clinical protocol, and ensures the sponsor receives data from every site. Specialist [[site management organization]]s can also be hired to coordinate with the CRO to ensure rapid IRB/IEC approval and faster site initiation and patient recruitment. Phase 1 clinical trials of new medicines are often conducted in a specialist clinical trial clinic, with dedicated pharmacologists, where the subjects can be observed by full-time staff. These clinics are often run by a CRO which specialises in these studies.

At a participating site, one or more research assistants (often nurses) do most of the work in conducting the clinical trial. The research assistant's job can include some or all of the following: providing the local [[institutional review board]] (IRB) with the documentation necessary to obtain its permission to conduct the study, assisting with study start-up, identifying eligible patients, obtaining consent from them or their families, administering study treatment(s), collecting and statistically analyzing data, maintaining and updating data files during followup, and communicating with the IRB, as well as the sponsor and CRO.

===Marketing===
Janet Yang uses the Interactional Justice Model to test the effects of willingness to talk with a doctor and clinical trial enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Z. J., et al. (2010). "Motivation for Health Information Seeking and Processing About Clinical Trial Enrollment." Health Communication 25(5): 423–436.&lt;/ref&gt; Results found that potential clinical trial candidates were less likely to enroll in clinical trials if the patient is more willing to talk with their doctor. The reasoning behind this discovery may be patients are happy with their current care. Another reason for the negative relationship between perceived fairness and clinical trial enrollment is the lack of independence from the care provider. Results found that there is a positive relationship between a lack of willingness to talk with their doctor and clinical trial enrollment. Lack of willingness to talk about clinical trials with current care providers may be due to patients' independence from the doctor. Patients who are less likely to talk about clinical trials are more willing to use other sources of information to gain a better insight of alternative treatments. Clinical trial enrollment should be motivated to utilize websites and television advertising to inform the public about clinical trial enrollment.

===Information technology===
The last decade has seen a proliferation of [[information technology]] use in the planning and conduct of clinical trials. [[Clinical Trial Management System|Clinical trial management systems]] are often used by research sponsors or CROs to help plan and manage the operational aspects of a clinical trial, particularly with respect to investigational sites.  Advanced analytics for identifying researchers and research sites with expertise in a given area utilize public and private information about ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130507-911627.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=BIO to Use ViS Analytics to Streamline Pediatric Clinical Research - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-05-07 |access-date=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030845/http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130507-911627.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |archive-date=4 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Web-based [[electronic data capture]] (EDC) and [[clinical data management system]]s are used in a majority of clinical trials&lt;ref&gt;Life Sciences Strategy Group, "Clinical Trial Technology Utilization, Purchasing Preferences &amp; Growth Outlook" Syndicated Publication, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to collect case report data from sites, manage its quality and prepare it for analysis. [[Interactive voice response]] systems are used by sites to register the enrollment of patients using a phone and to allocate patients to a particular treatment arm (although phones are being increasingly replaced with web-based (IWRS) tools which are sometimes part of the EDC system). While [[patient-reported outcome]] were often paper based in the past, measurements are increasingly being collected using web portals or hand-held [[Electronic patient-reported outcome|ePRO]] (or eDiary) devices, sometimes wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) – Changing the Face of Clinical Trials|url=http://med-quest.org/electronic-patient-reported-outcomes-benefits/|website=Med-Quest.org|access-date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[statistical packages|Statistical software]] is used to analyze the collected data and prepare them for regulatory submission. Access to many of these applications are increasingly aggregated in web-based [[Clinical Trial Portal|clinical trial portals]]. In 2011, the FDA approved a phase 1 trial that used telemonitoring, also known as remote patient monitoring, to collect biometric data in patients' homes and transmit it electronically to the trial database. This technology provides many more data points and is far more convenient for patients, because they have fewer visits to trial sites.

==Ethical aspects==
{{main|Clinical research ethics|Clinical trials publication}}
Clinical trials are closely supervised by appropriate regulatory authorities. All studies involving a medical or therapeutic intervention on patients must be approved by a supervising ethics committee before permission is granted to run the trial. The local ethics committee has discretion on how it will supervise noninterventional studies (observational studies or those using already collected data). In the US, this body is called the [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB); in the EU, they are called [[Ethics committee (European Union)|Ethics committee]]s. Most IRBs are located at the local investigator's hospital or institution, but some sponsors allow the use of a central (independent/for profit) IRB for investigators who work at smaller institutions.

To be ethical, researchers must obtain the full and [[informed consent]] of participating human subjects. (One of the IRB's main functions is to ensure potential patients are adequately informed about the clinical trial.) If the patient is unable to consent for him/herself, researchers can seek consent from the patient's legally authorized representative. In [[California]], the state has prioritized the individuals who can serve as the legally authorized representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irb.ucsd.edu/ab_2328_bill_20020826_enrolled.pdf|title=Assembly Bill No. 2328|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some US locations, the local IRB must certify researchers and their staff before they can conduct clinical trials. They must understand the federal patient privacy ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]]) law and good clinical practice. The International Conference of Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice is a set of standards used internationally for the conduct of clinical trials. The guidelines aim to ensure the "rights, safety and well being of trial subjects are protected".

The notion of informed consent of participating human subjects exists in many countries all over the world, but its precise definition may still vary.

Informed consent is clearly a 'necessary' condition for ethical conduct but does not 'ensure' ethical conduct. In [[compassionate use]] trials the latter becomes a particularly difficult problem. The final objective is to serve the community of patients or future patients in a best-possible and most responsible way. See also [[Expanded access]]. However, it may be hard to turn this objective into a well-defined, quantified, objective function. In some cases this can be done, however, for instance, for questions of when to stop sequential treatments (see [[Odds algorithm]]), and then quantified methods may play an important role.

Additional ethical concerns are present when conducting [[Ethical problems using children in clinical trials|clinical trials on children]] ([[pediatrics]]), and in emergency or epidemic situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayden EC | title = Ethical dilemma for Ebola drug trials | journal = Nature | volume = 515 | issue = 7526 | pages = 177–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25391940 | doi = 10.1038/515177a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|date=2012|title=Emergency research and the interests of participants|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=121–141|doi=10.1177/0968533212465615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts of interest and unfavorable studies===
In response to specific cases in which unfavorable data from pharmaceutical company-sponsored research were not published, the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] published new guidelines urging companies to report all findings and limit the financial involvement in drug companies by researchers.&lt;ref name="moynihanbmj"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=British Medical Journal|volume = 326|issue = 7400|pages = 1193–1196|pmc = 1126054|year = 2003|last1 = Moynihan|first1 = R.|title = Who pays for the pizza?

Drug researchers not directly employed by pharmaceutical companies often seek grants from manufacturers, and manufacturers often look to academic researchers to conduct studies within networks of universities and their hospitals, e.g., for [[translational research|translational]] cancer research. Similarly, competition for tenured academic positions, government grants and prestige create conflicts of interest among academic scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/science/rise-in-scientific-journal-retractions-prompts-calls-for-reform.html |title=Rise in Scientific Journal Retractions Prompts Calls for Reform | work=The New York Times|date = April 16, 2012|access-date= May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study, approximately 75% of articles retracted for misconduct-related reasons have no declared industry financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolley KL, Lew RA, Stretton S, Ely JA, Bramich NJ, Keys JR, Monk JA, Woolley MJ | title = Lack of involvement of medical writers and the pharmaceutical industry in publications retracted for misconduct: a systematic, controlled, retrospective study | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 1175–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21473670 | doi = 10.1185/03007995.2011.573546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seeding trial]]s are particularly controversial.&lt;ref name="Say no"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sox HC, Rennie D | title = Seeding trials: just say "no" | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 149 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–80 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18711161 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-149-4-200808190-00012 | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18711161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all clinical trials submitted to the FDA as part of a drug approval process are independently assessed by clinical experts within the Food and Drug Administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ |title=Development &amp; Approval Process (Drugs) |publisher= U.S. Food and Drug Administration |access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including inspections of primary data collection at selected clinical trial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126553.pdf |title=Information Sheet Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: FDA Inspections of Clinical Investigators|date=June 2010|website= |access-date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the editors of 12 major journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication. They strengthened editorial restrictions to counter the effect. The editorial noted that [[contract research organization]]s had, by 2000, received 60% of the grants from [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] in the US. Researchers may be restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davidoff F, DeAngelis CD, Drazen JM, Nicholls MG, Hoey J, Højgaard L, Horton R, Kotzin S, Nylenna M, Overbeke AJ, Sox HC, Van Der Weyden MB, Wilkes MS | title = Sponsorship, authorship and accountability | journal = CMAJ | volume = 165 | issue = 6 | pages = 786–8 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11584570 | pmc = 81460 | doi =  | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11584570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Responsibility for the safety of the subjects in a clinical trial is shared between the sponsor, the local site investigators (if different from the sponsor), the various IRBs that supervise the study, and (in some cases, if the study involves a marketable drug or device), the regulatory agency for the country where the drug or device will be sold.

For safety reasons, many clinical trials of drugs are designed to exclude women of childbearing age, pregnant women, or women who become pregnant during the study. In some cases, the male partners of these women are also excluded or required to take birth control measures.

===Sponsor===
Throughout the clinical trial, the sponsor is responsible for accurately informing the local site investigators of the true historical safety record of the drug, device or other medical treatments to be tested, and of any potential interactions of the study treatment(s) with already approved treatments. This allows the local investigators to make an informed judgment on whether to participate in the study or not. The sponsor is also responsible for [[Monitoring in clinical trials|monitoring]] the results of the study as they come in from the various sites as the trial proceeds. In larger clinical trials, a sponsor will use the services of a [[data monitoring committee]] (DMC, known in the US as a data safety monitoring board). This independent group of clinicians and statisticians meets periodically to review the [[blind experiment|unblinded]] data the sponsor has received so far. The DMC has the power to recommend termination of the study based on their review, for example if the study treatment is causing more deaths than the standard treatment, or seems to be causing unexpected and study-related serious [[adverse event]]s. The sponsor is responsible for collecting [[adverse event]] reports from all site investigators in the study, and for informing all the investigators of the sponsor's judgment as to whether these adverse events were related or not related to the study treatment.

The sponsor and the local site investigators are jointly responsible for writing a site-specific [[informed consent]] that accurately informs the potential subjects of the true risks and potential benefits of participating in the study, while at the same time presenting the material as briefly as possible and in ordinary language. FDA regulations state that participating in clinical trials is voluntary, with the subject having the right not to participate or to end participation at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Patients: Informed Consent for Clinical Trials|url=https://www.fda.gov/forpatients/clinicaltrials/informedconsent/default.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=9 August 2017|date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local site investigators===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The ethical principle of ''[[primum non nocere]]'' ("first, do no harm") guides the trial, and if an investigator believes the study treatment may be harming subjects in the study, the investigator can stop participating at any time. On the other hand, investigators often have a financial interest in recruiting subjects, and could act unethically to obtain and maintain their participation.

The local investigators are responsible for conducting the study according to the study protocol, and supervising the study staff throughout the duration of the study. The local investigator or his/her study staff are also responsible for ensuring the potential subjects in the study understand the risks and potential benefits of participating in the study.  In other words, they (or their legally authorized representatives) must give truly informed consent.

Local investigators are responsible for reviewing all adverse event reports sent by the sponsor. These adverse event reports contain the opinion of both the investigator at the site where the adverse event occurred, and the sponsor, regarding the relationship of the adverse event to the study treatments. Local investigators also are responsible for making an independent judgment of these reports, and promptly informing the local IRB of all serious and study treatment-related adverse events.

When a local investigator is the sponsor, there may not be formal adverse event reports, but study staff at all locations are responsible for informing the coordinating investigator of anything unexpected. The local investigator is responsible for being truthful to the local IRB in all communications relating to the study.

===Institutional review boards (IRBs)===
Approval by an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB), or ethics board, is necessary before all but the most informal research can begin. In commercial clinical trials, the study protocol is not approved by an IRB before the sponsor recruits sites to conduct the trial. However, the study protocol and procedures have been tailored to fit generic IRB submission requirements. In this case, and where there is no independent sponsor, each local site investigator submits the study protocol, the consent(s), the data collection forms, and supporting documentation to the local IRB. Universities and most hospitals have in-house IRBs. Other researchers (such as in walk-in clinics) use independent IRBs.

The IRB scrutinizes the study for both medical safety and protection of the patients involved in the study, before it allows the researcher to begin the study. It may require changes in study procedures or in the explanations given to the patient. A required yearly "continuing review" report from the investigator updates the IRB on the progress of the study and any new safety information related to the study.

===Regulatory agencies===
In the US, the FDA can [[audit]] the files of local site investigators after they have finished participating in a study, to see if they were correctly following study procedures. This audit may be random, or for cause (because the investigator is suspected of fraudulent data). Avoiding an audit is an incentive for investigators to follow study procedures.

Alternatively, many American pharmaceutical companies have moved some clinical trials overseas. Benefits of conducting trials abroad include lower costs (in some countries) and the ability to run larger trials in shorter timeframes, whereas a potential disadvantage exists in lower-quality trial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lang T, Siribaddana S | title = Clinical trials have gone global: is this a good thing? | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = e1001228 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719228 | pmc = 3373653 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries have different regulatory requirements and enforcement abilities. An estimated 40% of all clinical trials now take place in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central and South America. "There is no compulsory registration system for clinical trials in these countries and many do not follow European directives in their operations", says Jacob Sijtsma of the Netherlands-based WEMOS, an advocacy health organisation tracking clinical trials in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/12/14/5838/|title=India: Prime Destination for Unethical Clinical Trials|work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, harmonization of clinical trial protocols was shown as feasible across countries of the European Union. At the same time, coordination between Europe, Japan and the United States led to a joint regulatory-industry initiative on international harmonization named after 1990 as the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmda.go.jp/ich/s/s1b_98_7_9e.pdf Pmda.go.jp 独立行政法人　医薬品医療機器総合機構] {{ja icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217025300/http://www.pmda.go.jp/ich/s/s1b_98_7_9e.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, most clinical trial programs follow ICH guidelines, aimed at "ensuring that good quality, safe and effective medicines are developed and registered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. These activities are pursued in the interest of the consumer and public health, to prevent unnecessary duplication of clinical trials in humans and to minimize the use of animal testing without compromising the regulatory obligations of safety and effectiveness."&lt;ref name=ich&gt;[http://www.ich.org/cache/compo/276-254-1.html ICH] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630181341/http://www.ich.org/cache/compo/276-254-1.html |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aggregation of safety data during clinical development ===
Aggregating safety data across clinical trials during drug development is important because trials are generally designed to focus on determining how well the drug works.  The safety data collected and aggregated across multiple trials as the drug is developed allows the sponsor, investigators and regulatory agencies to monitor the aggregate safety profile of experimental medicines as they're developed.  The value of assessing aggregate safety data is: a) decisions based on aggregate safety assessment during development of the medicine can be made throughout the medicine's development and b) it sets up the sponsor and regulators well for assessing the medicine's safety after the drug is approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cioms.ch/shop/product/management-of-safety-information-from-clinical-trials-report-of-cioms-working-group-vi/|title=Management of Safety Information from Clinical Trials: Report of CIOMS Working Group VI|last=|first=|date=2005|website=CIOMS Publications|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/InvestigationalNewDrugINDApplication/ucm226358.htm|title=Investigational New Drug (IND) Application - Final Rule: Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting Requirements for Human Drug and Biological Products and Safety Reporting Requirements for Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies in Humans|last=|first=|date=2010-09-29|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM227351.pdf|title=Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies Small Entity Compliance Guide | date = December 2012 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM477584.pdf | title = Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting Guidance for Industry|last=|first=|date= December 2015 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://cioms.ch/shop/product/evidence-synthesis-and-meta-analysis-report-of-cioms-working-group-x/|title=Evidence Synthesis and Meta-Analysis: Report of CIOMS Working Group X|date=2016|publisher = CIOMS Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

Clinical trial costs vary depending on trial phase, type of trial, and disease studied. A study of clinical trials conducted in the United States from 2004 to 2012 found the average cost of phase I trials to be $1.4 million and $6.6 million, depending on the type of disease. Phase II trials ranged from $7 million to $20 million, and phase III trials from $11 million to $53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1740774515625964| pmid=26908540|title = Key cost drivers of pharmaceutical clinical trials in the United States| journal=Clinical Trials| volume=13| issue=2| pages=117–126|year = 2016|last1 = Sertkaya|first1 = Aylin| last2=Wong| first2=Hui-Hsing| last3=Jessup| first3=Amber| last4=Beleche| first4=Trinidad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sponsor===
The cost of a study depends on many factors, especially the number of sites conducting the study, the number of patients involved, and whether the study treatment is already approved for medical use.

The expenses incurred by a pharmaceutical company in administering a phase 3 or 4 clinical trial may include, among others:
* production of the drug(s) or device(s) being evaluated
* staff salaries for the designers and administrators of the trial
* payments to the contract research organization, the site management organization (if used) and any outside consultants
* payments to local researchers and their staff for their time and effort in recruiting test subjects and collecting data for the sponsor
* the cost of study materials and the charges incurred to ship them
* communication with the local researchers, including on-site monitoring by the CRO before and (in some cases) multiple times during the study
* one or more investigator training meetings
* expense incurred by the local researchers, such as pharmacy fees, IRB fees and postage
* any payments to subjects enrolled in the trial
* the expense of treating a test subject who develops a medical condition caused by the study drug
These expenses are incurred over several years.

In the US, sponsors may receive a 50 percent [[tax credit]] for clinical trials conducted on drugs being developed for the treatment of [[orphan disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/orphan/taxcred.htm|title=Tax Credit for Testing Expenses for Drugs for Rare Diseases or Conditions|access-date=27 March 2007|date=17 April 2001|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National health agencies, such as the US [[National Institutes of Health]], offer grants to investigators who design clinical trials that attempt to answer research questions of interest to the agency. In these cases, the investigator who writes the grant and administers the study acts as the sponsor, and coordinates data collection from any other sites. These other sites may or may not be paid for participating in the study, depending on the amount of the grant and the amount of effort expected from them. Using internet resources can, in some cases, reduce the economic burden.&lt;ref name=Paul2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul J, Seib R, Prescott T | title = The Internet and clinical trials: background, online resources, examples and issues | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = e5 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15829477 | pmc = 1550630 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.7.1.e5 | url = http://www.jmir.org/2005/1/e5/ | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigators===
Investigators are often compensated for their work in clinical trials. These amounts can be small, just covering a partial salary for research assistants and the cost of any supplies (usually the case with national health agency studies), or be substantial and include 'overhead' that allows the investigator to pay the research staff during times between clinical trials.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Subjects===
Participants in phase 1 drug trials do not gain any direct health benefit from taking part. They are generally paid a fee for their time, with payments regulated and not related to any risk involved. In later phase trials, subjects may not be paid to ensure their motivation for participating with potential for a health benefit or contributing to medical knowledge. Small payments may be made for study-related expenses such as travel or as compensation for their time in providing follow-up information about their health after the trial treatment ends.

==Participant recruitment and participation==
[[File:Clinical trial newspaper advertisements.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Newspaper advertisement]]s seeking patients and healthy [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s to participate in clinical trials]]

Phase 0 and phase 1 drug trials seek healthy volunteers. Most other clinical trials seek patients who have a specific disease or medical condition. The diversity observed in society should be reflected in clinical trials through the appropriate inclusion of [[ethnic minority]] populations.&lt;ref name="ethnic2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu JJ, Davidson E, Sheikh A |title=Achieving Ethnic Diversity in Trial Recruitment |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25040/Achieving_Ethnic_Diversity_in_Trial_Recruitment.1.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=215–222 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/BF03256863 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114180004/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25040/Achieving_Ethnic_Diversity_in_Trial_Recruitment.1.aspx |archive-date=14 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient recruitment]] or participant recruitment plays a significant role in the activities and responsibilities of sites conducting clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald AM, Knight RC, Campbell MK, Entwistle VA, Grant AM, Cook JA, Elbourne DR, Francis D, Garcia J, Roberts I, Snowdon C | title = What influences recruitment to randomised controlled trials?

* Measurement of the electrical activity of the heart (ECG)
* Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature
* Blood sampling
* Urine sampling
* Weight and height measurement
* Drug abuse testing
* Pregnancy testing

===Locating trials===
Depending on the kind of participants required, sponsors of clinical trials, or contract research organizations working on their behalf, try to find sites with qualified personnel as well as access to patients who could participate in the trial. Working with those sites, they may use various recruitment strategies, including patient databases, newspaper and radio advertisements, flyers, posters in places the patients might go (such as doctor's offices), and personal recruitment of patients by investigators.

Volunteers with specific conditions or diseases have additional online resources to help them locate clinical trials. For example, the Fox Trial Finder connects [[Parkinson's disease]] trials around the world to volunteers who have a specific set of criteria such as location, age, and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxtrialfinder.org |title=Parkinson's Disease Clinical Trials |publisher=Fox Trial Finder |access-date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other disease-specific services exist for volunteers to find trials related to their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlanet.org/resources/hlth_tutorial/mod4c.html |title=Medical Information on the Internet |publisher=Mlanet.org |access-date=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003122247/http://www.mlanet.org/resources/hlth_tutorial/mod4c.html |archive-date=3 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers may search directly on [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] to locate trials using a registry run by the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Library of Medicine]].

===Research===
The risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model analyzes social implications that affect attitudes and decision making pertaining to clinical trials.&lt;ref name="yang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang ZJ, McComas KA, Gay GK, Leonard JP, Dannenberg AJ, Dillon H | title = Comparing decision making between cancer patients and the general population: thoughts, emotions, or social influence? | journal = Journal of Health Communication | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–94 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22376222 | doi = 10.1080/10810730.2011.635774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who hold a higher stake or interest in the treatment provided in a clinical trial showed a greater likelihood of seeking information about clinical trials. Cancer patients reported more optimistic attitudes towards clinical trials than the general population. Having a more optimistic outlook on clinical trials also leads to greater likelihood of enrolling.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definitions and symptoms --&gt;
'''Fasciolosis''' is a [[helminth|parasitic worm]] infection caused by the common liver fluke ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'' as well as by ''[[Fasciola gigantica]]''. The disease is a plant-borne [[Trematoda|trematode]] [[zoonosis]],&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma05"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mas-Coma S, Bargues MD, Valero MA |title=Fascioliasis and other plant-borne trematode zoonoses |journal=Int.

Rev. Parasitol | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 13–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the [[bile duct]]s, [[cholecystitis|gall bladder]] and may cause [[cholelithiasis|gall stone]]s as well as [[fibrosis]].&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.&lt;ref name=Tsocheva&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= Göteborgs universitetsbibliotek: Logga in via proxy |url = http://www.saske.sk/pau/helminthologia/2005_2/Tsocheva107.pdf |title= Fasciolosis and tumour growth |accessdate= 2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
Up to half of those infected display no symptoms,&lt;ref name=Mansons/&gt; and diagnosis is difficult because the worm eggs are often missed in fecal examination.&lt;ref name=Mansons&gt;{{Cite book |title= Manson's Tropical Diseases |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GTjRAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA691-IA1&amp;dq=manson%2527s+tropical+infectious+diseases&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAmoVChMIuIq59bDgxgIVClGSCh0UBQaN#v=onepage&amp;q=manson%2527s%2520tropical%2520infectious%2520diseases&amp;f=false |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences |date= 2013-10-26 |isbn= 9780702053061 |first= Jeremy |last= Farrar |first2= Peter |last2= Hotez |first3= Thomas |last3= Junghanss |first4= Gagandeep |last4= Kang |first5= David |last5= Lalloo |first6= Nicholas J. |last6= White}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of detection are through fecal examination, parasite-specific antibody detection, or radiological diagnosis, as well as [[laparotomy]]. In case of a suspected outbreak it may be useful to keep track of dietary history, which is also useful for exclusion of differential diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection. Eggs appear in the feces first between 9–11 weeks post-infection. The cause of this is unknown, and it is also difficult to distinguish between the different species of fasciola as well distinguishing them from [[Echinostoma|echinostomes]] and ''[[Fasciolopsis]]''.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Most immunodiagnostic tests detect infection with very high sensitivity, and as concentration drops after treatment, it is a very good diagnostic method.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Clinically it is not possible to differentiate from other [[Hepatobiliary diseases|liver and bile diseases]]. Radiological methods can detect lesions in both acute and chronic infection, while laparotomy will detect lesions and also occasionally eggs and live worms.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment--&gt;
Because of the size of the parasite, as adult ''F. hepatica'': {{convert|20|–|30 |xx|13|mm |abbr=in}} or adult ''F. gigantica:'' 25–75×12&amp;nbsp;mm, fasciolosis is a big concern.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; The amount of symptoms depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans.{{Citation needed |date= July 2015}} Treatment with [[triclabendazole]] has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC - Fasciola - Treatment" /&gt; [[Praziquantel]] is not effective, and older drugs such as [[bithionol]] are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing [[cholangitis]]  has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and [[Bacteremia#Consequences|toxaemia]] may be treated with [[prednisolone]].&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt;

&lt;!--Control, prevention and epidemiology --&gt;
Humans are infected by eating watergrown plants, primarily wild-grown [[watercress]] in Europe or [[morning glory]] in Asia. Infection may also occur by drinking contaminated water with floating [[metacercariae|young fasciola]] or when using utensils washed with contaminated water.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Cultivated plants do not spread the disease in the same capacity. Human infection is rare, even if the infection rate is high among animals. Especially high rates of human infection have been found in Bolivia, Peru and Egypt, and this may be due to consumption of certain foods.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; No vaccine is available to protect people against ''Fasciola'' infection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title= CDC - Fasciola - Prevention &amp; Control |url= https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/fasciola/prevent.html |website= www.cdc.gov |accessdate= 2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventative measures are primarily treating and immunization of the livestock, which are required to host the live cycle of the worms. Veterinary vaccines are in development, and their use is being considered by a number of countries on account of the risk to human health and economic losses resulting from livestock infection.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Other methods include using [[molluscicide]]s to decrease the number of snails that act as vectors, but it is not practical.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Educational methods to decrease consumption of wild watercress and other waterplants has been shown to work in areas with a high disease burden.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt;

Fascioliasis occurs in Europe, Africa, the Americas as well as Oceania.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; Recently, worldwide losses in animal productivity due to fasciolosis were conservatively estimated at over US$3.2 billion per annum.&lt;ref name="spithill99"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spithill |first=TW |author2= Smooker PM |author3= Copeman DB  |chapter= ''Fasciola gigantica'': epidemiology, control, immunology and molecular biology |editor=Dalton, JP |title= Fasciolosis |publisher=CABI Pub |location= Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=1999 |pages=465–525 |isbn=0-85199-260-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasciolosis is now recognized as an emerging human disease: the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has estimated that 2.4 million people are infected with ''Fasciola'', and a further 180 million are at risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymus (1995).

==Signs and symptoms==

===Humans===
[[Image:F. hepatica hypertrophia of bile duct.jpg|300px|thumb|Hypertrophia of bile ducts in liver caused by F. hepatica (liver section of an infested goat)]][[Image:F. hepatica adults in bile duct.jpg|300px|thumb|Adult flukes ''Fasciola hepatica'' in [[bile ducts]] (liver of goat)]] The course of fasciolosis in humans has 4 main phases:&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;
*'''[[Incubation period|Incubation]] phase''': from the ingestion of metacercariae to the appearance of the first symptoms; time period: few days to 3 months; depends on number of ingested metacercariae and immune status of host
*'''Invasive or acute phase''': fluke migration up to the bile ducts. This phase is a result of mechanical destruction of the hepatic tissue and the [[peritoneum]] by migrating juvenile flukes causing localized and or generalized toxic and [[allergic]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Facey, R.V., Marsden, P.D. (1960). "Fascioliasis in man: an outbreak in Hampshire". ''Br. Med. J.'' ii, 619–625.
&lt;/ref&gt; The major symptoms of this phase are:
**Fever: usually the first symptom of the disease; {{cvt|40|-|42|°C}}
**Abdominal pain
**Gastrointestinal disturbances: loss of appetite, [[flatulence]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]]
**[[Urticaria]]
**Respiratory symptoms (very rare): [[cough]], [[dyspnoea]], chest pain, [[hemoptysis]]
**[[Hepatomegaly]] and [[splenomegaly]]
**[[Ascites]]
**[[Anaemia]]
**[[Jaundice]]
*'''Latent phase''': This phase can last for months or years. The proportion of asymptomatic subjects in this phase is unknown. They are often discovered during family screening after a patient is diagnosed.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;
*'''Chronic or obstructive phase''':
This phase may develop months or years after initial infection. Adult flukes in the bile ducts cause inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium. The resulting cholangitis and cholecystitis, combined with the large body of the flukes, are sufficient to cause mechanical obstruction of the biliary duct. In this phase, biliary [[colic]], [[epigastric]] pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, [[pruritus]], right upper-quadrant abdominal tenderness, etc., are clinical manifestations indistinguishable from [[cholangitis]], [[cholecystitis]] and [[cholelithiasis]] of other origins. Hepatic enlargement may be associated with an enlarged [[spleen]] or ascites. In case of obstruction, the gall bladder is usually enlarged and [[edema]]tous with thickening of the wall (Ref: Hepatobiliary Fascioliasis:
Sonographic and CT Findings in 87 Patients During the InitialPhase and Long-Term Follow-Up. Adnan Kabaalioglu, Kagan Ceken, Emel Alimoglu, Rabin Saba, Metin Cubuk, Gokhan Arslan, Ali Apaydin. AJR 2007; 189:824–828). Fibrous adhesions of the gall bladder to adjacent organs are common. [[Lithiasis]] of the bile duct or gall bladder is frequent and the stones are usually small and multiple.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;

===Other animals===
Clinical signs of fasciolosis are always closely associated with infectious dose (amount of ingested metacercariae). In sheep, as the most common definitive host, clinical presentation is divided into 4 types:&lt;ref name=Dubinsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Behm99/&gt;

*'''Acute Type I Fasciolosis''': infectious dose is more than 5000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep suddenly die without any previous clinical signs. [[Ascites]], [[abdomen|abdominal]] [[haemorrhage]], [[icterus (medicine)|icterus]], [[pallor]] of membranes, weakness may be observed in sheep.
*'''Acute Type II Fasciolosis''': infectious dose is 1000-5,000 ingested metacercariae. As above, sheep die but briefly show pallor, loss of condition and [[ascites]].
*'''Subacute Fasciolosis''': infectious dose is 800-1000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep are [[lethargic]], anemic and may die. Weight loss is dominant feature.
*'''Chronic Fasciolosis''': infectious dose is 200-800 ingested metacercariae. Asymptomatic or gradual development of bottle jaw and ascites (ventral [[edema]]), emaciation, weight loss.

In blood, [[anemia]], [[hypoalbuminemia]], and [[eosinophilia]] may be observed in all types of fasciolosis.&lt;ref name=Behm99/&gt; Elevation of [[liver enzyme]] activities, such a [[glutamate dehydrogenase]] (GLDH), [[gamma-glutamyl transferase]] (GGT), and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), is detected in subacute or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson P.H. |author2=Matthews J.G. |author3=Berrett S. |author4=Brush P.J. |author5=Patterson D.S. | year = 1981 | title = Changes in plasma enzyme activities and other blood components in response to acute and chronic liver damage in cattle | url = | journal = Res Vet Sci. | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 1–4 |pmid=6118918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sykes A.R. |author2=Coop A.R. |author3=Robinson M.G. | year = 1980 | title = Chronic subclinical ovine fascioliasis: plasma glutamate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and their significance as diagnostic aids. | url = | journal = Res.

In this case the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death.&lt;ref name=Boray69/&gt; Importance of cattle fasciolosis consist in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phiri IK, Phiri AM, Harrison LJ |title=Serum antibody isotype responses of Fasciola-infected sheep and cattle to excretory and secretory products of Fasciola species |journal=Vet.

In sheep and sometimes cattle, the damaged liver tissue may become infected by the ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria [[Clostridium novyi|''C. novyi'']] type B. The bacteria will release toxins into the bloodstream resulting in what is known as [[black disease]]. There is no cure and death follows quickly. As ''C. novyi'' is common in the environment, black disease is found wherever populations of liver flukes and sheep overlap.&lt;ref name=MERCK2&gt;[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/ Merck Veterinary Manual - Infectious Necrotic Hepatitis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Fasciola LifeCycle 2013.png|thumb|350px|Immature eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool &lt;br&gt;1. Eggs become embryonated in water 2, eggs release miracidia 3, which invade a suitable snail intermediate host 4, including the genera Galba, Fossaria and Pseudosuccinea. In the snail the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts The number 4a, rediae The number 4b, and cercariae The number 4c). The cercariae are released from the snail 5 and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation or other surfaces. Mammals acquire the infection by eating vegetation containing metacercariae. Humans can become infected by ingesting metacercariae-containing freshwater plants, especially watercress 6. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum 7 and migrate through the intestinal wall, the peritoneal cavity, and the liver parenchyma into the biliary ducts, where they develop into adults 8. In humans, maturation from metacercariae into adult flukes takes approximately 3 to 4 months. The adult flukes (Fasciola hepatica: up to 30 mm by 13 mm; F. gigantica: up to 75 mm) reside in the large biliary ducts of the mammalian host. Fasciola hepatica infect various animal species, mostly herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - DPDx - Fascioliasis|url = https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/fascioliasis/index.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Fasciolosis is caused by two [[Digenea|digenetic]] trematodes ''F. hepatica'' and ''F. gigantica''. Adult flukes of both species are localized in the [[bile duct]]s of the [[liver]] or [[gallbladder]]. ''F. hepatica'' measures 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;cm and has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. ''F. gigantica'' measures 4 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in length and the distribution of the species is limited to the [[tropics]] and has been recorded in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and south and eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=Torges99/&gt; In domestic livestock in Japan, [[diploid]] (2n = 20), [[triploid]] (3n = 30) and [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] flukes (2n/3n) have been described, many of which reproduce [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]]. As a result of this unclear classification, flukes in Japan are normally referred to as ''Fasciola'' spp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakaguchi | first1 = Y. | year = 1980 | title = Karyotype and gametogenesis of the common liver fluke, ''Fasciola'' sp., in Japan.

===Transmission===
Human ''F. hepatica'' infection is determined by the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions and the dietary habits of man.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;  Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]]s. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that [[donkey]]s and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mas-Coma | first1 = S. | last2 = Rodriguez | first2 = A. | last3 = Bargues | first3 = M.D. | last4 = Valero | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Coello | first5 = J. | last6 = Angles | first6 = R. | year = 1998 | title = Secondary reservoir role of domestic animals other than sheep and cattle in fascioliasis transmission on the northern Bolivian Altiplano | url = | journal = Res.

===Intermediate hosts===
[[File:Galba truncatula.jpg|thumb|''[[Galba truncatula]]'' - the most common intermediate host of ''F. hepatica'' in Europe and South America]]

{{main|Fasciola hepatica#Life cycle|Fasciola gigantica#Intermediate hosts}}

Intermediate hosts of ''F. hepatica'' are freshwater snails from family [[Lymnaeidae]].&lt;ref name=Torges99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graczyk |first=TK |author2=Fried B |chapter=Development of ''Fasciola hepatica'' in the intermediate host.|editor=Dalton, JP |title=Fasciolosis |publisher=CABI Pub |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=1999 |pages=31–46 |isbn=0-85199-260-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snails from family [[Planorbidae]] act as an intermediate host of ''F. hepatica'' very occasionally.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma05"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The development of infection in definitive host is divided into two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the biliary phase.&lt;ref name=Dubinsky&gt;Dubinský, P., 1993. Trematódy a trematodózy. In: Jurášek, V., Dubinský, P. a kolektív, Veterinárna parazitológia. Príroda a.s., Bratislava, 158–187. (in Slovakian)&lt;/ref&gt; The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, flukes migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. ''F. hepatica'' has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver.&lt;ref name=Behm99&gt;Behm, C.A., Sangster, N.C., 1999. Pathology, pathophysiology and clinical aspects. In: Dalton, J.P. (Ed.), Fasciolosis. CAB International Publishing, Wallingford, pp. 185–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, ectopic locations of flukes such as the lungs, [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], intestinal wall, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue can occur.&lt;ref name=Boray69&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boray JC |title=Experimental fascioliasis in Australia |journal=Adv. Parasitol. |volume=7 |issue= |pages=95–210 |year=1969 |pmid=4935272 |doi= 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60435-2|url= |series=Advances in Parasitology |isbn=978-0-12-031707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt; During the migration of flukes, tissues are mechanically destroyed and [[inflammation]] appears around migratory tracks of flukes. The second phase (the biliary phase) begins when parasites enter the [[biliary duct]]s of the liver. In biliary ducts, flukes mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. [[Hypertrophy]] of biliar ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.

===Resistance to infection===
Mechanisms of resistance have been studied by several authors in different animal species. These studies may help to better understand the [[immune response]] to ''F. hepatica'' in host and are necessary in development of vaccine against the parasite. It has been established that cattle acquire resistance to challenge infection with ''F. hepatica'' and ''F. gigantica'' when they have been sensitized with primary patent or drug-abbreviated infection.&lt;ref name=Haroun86/&gt; Resistance to fasciolosis was also documented in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Milligen FJ, Cornelissen JB, Bokhout BA |title=Location of induction and expression of protective immunity against Fasciola hepatica at the gut level: a study using an ex vivo infection model with ligated gut segments |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==
Most immunodiagnostic tests will detect infection and have a sensitivity above 90% during all stages of the diseases. In addition antibody concentration quickly drops post treatment and no antibodies are present one year after treatment, which makes it a very good diagnostic method.&lt;ref name="Mansons" /&gt; In humans, diagnosis of fasciolosis is usually achieved parasitologically by findings the fluke eggs in stool, and immunologically by [[ELISA]] and [[Western blot]]. Coprological examinations of stool alone are generally not adequate because infected humans have important clinical presentations long before eggs are found in the stools.

Moreover, in many human infections, the fluke eggs are often not found in the faeces, even after multiple faecal examinations.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hillyer88"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillyer |first=GV |chapter=Fascioliasis and fasciolopsiasis.|editor=A. Turano |editor2=Balows, Albert |editor3=M. Ohashi |title=Laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases: principles and practices |volume=1: Bacterial, mycotic, and parasitic diseases|publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1988 |pages=856–62 |isbn=0-387-96755-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, eggs of ''F. hepatica'', ''F. gigantica'' and ''Fasciolopsis buski'' are morphologically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Hillyer88" /&gt; Therefore, immunonological methods such ELISA and enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot, also called Western blot, are the most important methods in diagnosis of ''F. hepatica'' infection. These immunological tests are based on detection of species-specific [[antibody|antibodies]] from [[Blood plasma|sera]]. The [[antigen]]ic preparations used have been primarily derived from extracts of excretory/secretory products from adult [[worm]]s, or with partially purified fractions.&lt;ref name="Hillyer99"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillyer |first=GV |chapter=Immunodiagnosis of human and animal fasciolosis. |editor=Dalton JP |title=Fasciolosis |publisher=CABI Pub |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=1999 |pages=435–47 |isbn=0-85199-260-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, purified native and [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] antigens have been used, e.g. recombinant ''F. hepatica'' [[Cathepsin L1|cathepsin L]]-like [[protease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Neill SM, Parkinson M, Strauss W, Angles R, Dalton JP |title=Immunodiagnosis of Fasciola hepatica infection (fascioliasis) in a human population in the Bolivian Altiplano using purified cathepsin L cysteine proteinase |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=417–23 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9574785 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9574785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods based on antigen detection (circulating in serum or in faeces) are less frequent. In addition, biochemical and haematological examinations of human sera support the exact diagnosis (eosinophilia, elevation of liver enzymes). [[Ultrasonography]] and [[Medical radiography|xray]] of the abdominal cavity, [[biopsy]] of liver, and gallbladder punctuate can also be used (ref: US-guided gallbladder aspiration:
a new diagnostic method for biliary fascioliasis. A. Kabaalioglu, A. Apaydin, T. Sindel, E. Lüleci. Eur. Radiol. 9, 880±882 (1999) . False fasciolosis ([[pseudofasciolosis]]) refers to the presence of eggs in the stool resulting not from an actual infection but from recent ingestion of infected livers containing eggs. This situation (with its potential for misdiagnosis) can be avoided by having the patient follow a liver-free [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] several days before a repeat stool examination.&lt;ref name="Hillyer99" /&gt;

In animals, intravital diagnosis is based predominantly on faeces examinations and immunological methods. However, clinical signs, biochemical and haematological profile, season, climate conditions, [[epidemiology]] situation, and examinations of snails must be considered.&lt;ref name="Dubinsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Torges99" /&gt; Similarly to humans, faeces examinations are not reliable. Moreover, the fluke eggs are detectable in faeces 8–12 weeks post-infection. In spite of that fact, faecal examination is still the only used diagnostic tool in some countries. While coprological diagnosis of fasciolosis is possible from 8- to 12-week post-infection (WPI), ''F. hepatica'' specific-antibodies are recognized using ELISA or Western blot after 2-4 week post-infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zimmerman GL, Jen LW, Cerro JE, Farnsworth KL, Wescott RB |title=Diagnosis of Fasciola hepatica infections in sheep by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay |journal=Am.

==Prevention==
In some areas special control programs are in place or have been planned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vegetables grown in fields, that might have been irrigated with polluted water, should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Several drugs are effective for fascioliasis, both in humans and in domestic animals.  The drug of choice in the treatment of fasciolosis is [[triclabendazole]], a member of the [[benzimidazole]] family of [[anthelmintics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savioli L, Chitsulo L, Montresor A |title=New opportunities for the control of fascioliasis |journal=Bull.

==Epidemiology==
Human and animal fasciolosis occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=Torges99/&gt; While animal fasciolosis is distributed in countries with high cattle and sheep production, human fasciolosis occurs, excepting Western Europe, in developing countries. Fasciolosis occurs only in areas where suitable conditions for intermediate hosts exist.

Studies carried out in recent years have shown human fasciolosis to be an important [[public health]] problem.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, M.G., Mott, K.E., 1990. "Progress in assessment of morbidity due to Fasciola hepatica infection: a review of recent literature". Trop. Dis. Bull. 87, R1–R38.&lt;/ref&gt; Human fasciolosis has been reported from countries in Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The incidence of human cases has been increasing in 51 countries of the five continents.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esteb98"/&gt; A global analysis shows that the expected correlation between animal and human fasciolosis only appears at a basic level. High prevalences in humans are not necessarily found in areas where fasciolosis is a great veterinary problem. For instance, in South America, [[hyperendemics]] and [[mesoendemics]] are found in Bolivia and Peru where the veterinary problem is less important, while in countries such as Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, human fasciolosis is only sporadic or [[hypoendemic]].&lt;ref name=Esteb98/&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, human fasciolosis occur mainly in France, Spain, Portugal, and the former USSR.&lt;ref name=Esteb98/&gt; France is considered an important human endemic area. A total of 5863 cases of human fasciolosis were recorded from nine French hospitals from 1970 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Danis, M., Nozais, J.P., Chandenier, J., 1985. "La distomatose à ''Fasciola hepatica'', II: La fasciolose humaine en France". Action Vet. 907.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the former Soviet Union, almost all reported cases were from the [[Tajikistan|Tajik Republic]].&lt;ref name=Esteb98/&gt; Several papers referred to human fasciolosis in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yilmaz H, Gödekmerdan A |title=Human fasciolosis in Van Province, Turkey |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=161–2 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15350869 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2004.04.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(04)00152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[serological survey]] of human fasciolosis was performed in some parts of Turkey. The prevalence of the disease was [[serology|serologically]] found to be 3.01% in [[Antalya Province]], and between 0.9 and 6.1% in [[Isparta Province]], Mediterranean region of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Demirci, M., 2003. Insanlarda epidemiyoloji. In: Tinar, R., Korkmaz, M. (Eds.), Fasciolosis. Türkiye Parazitoloji Derněgi, META Basim, İzmir, pp. 343–358 (in Turkish).&lt;/ref&gt; In other European countries, fasciolosis is sporadic and the occurrence of the disease is usually combined with travelling to endemic areas.

===Americas===
In North America, the disease is very sporadic. In Mexico, 53 cases have been reported. In Central America, fasciolosis is a human health problem in the Caribbean islands, especially in zones of Puerto Rico and Cuba. [[Pinar del Río Province]] and [[Villa Clara Province]] are Cuban regions where fasciolosis was hyperendemic. In South America, human fasciolosis is a serious problem in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. These [[Andes|Andean]] countries are considered to be the area with the highest prevalence of human fasciolosis in the world. Well-known human hyperendemic areas are localized predominately in the high plain called [[altiplano]]. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, prevalences detected in some communities were up to 72% and 100% in [[coprology|coprological]] and [[serology|serological]] surveys, respectively.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt; In Peru, ''F. hepatica'' in humans occurs throughout the country. The highest prevalences were reported in [[Arequipa]], [[Mantaro Valley]], [[Cajamarca]] Valley, and [[Puno Region]].&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma05"/&gt; In other South American countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, human fasciolosis appear to be sporadic, despite the high prevalences of fasciolosis in cattle.

===Africa===
In Africa, human cases of fasciolosis, except in northern parts, have not been frequently reported. The highest prevalence was recorded in Egypt where the disease is distributed in communities living in the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma05"/&gt;

===Asia===
In Asia, the most human cases were reported in Iran, especially in [[Gīlān Province]], on the [[Caspian Sea]]. It was mentioned that more than 10,000 human cases were detected in Iran. In eastern Asia, human fasciolosis appears to be sporadic. Few cases were documented in Japan, Koreas, Vietnam, and Thailand.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;

===Australia and the Oceania===
In Australia, human fasciolosis is very rare (only 12 cases documented). In New Zealand, ''F. hepatica'' has never been detected in humans.&lt;ref name="Mas-Coma99"/&gt;

==Other animals==
[[Image:Triclabendazole.svg|thumb|Formula of triclabendazole]]A number of drugs have been used in control fasciolosis in animals. Drugs differ in their efficacy, mode of action, price, and viability.

Triclabendazole (Fasinex) is considered as the most common drug due to its high efficacy against adult as well as juvenile flukes. Triclabendazole is used in control of fasciolosis of livestock in many countries. Nevertheless, long-term veterinary use of triclabendazole has caused appearance of resistance in ''F. hepatica''. In animals, triclabendazole resistance was first described in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Overend DJ, Bowen FL |title=Resistance of Fasciola hepatica to triclabendazole |journal=Aust.

Recently, a new fasciolicide was successfully tested in naturally and experimentally infected cattle in Mexico. This new drug is called 'Compound Alpha' and is chemically very similar to triclabendazole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ibarra F, Vera Y, Quiroz H |title=Determination of the effective dose of an experimental fasciolicide in naturally and experimentally infected cattle |journal=Vet.

Countries where fasciolosis in livestock was repeatedly reported:
* Europe: UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Poland
* Asia: Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Iraq, Iran, China, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Philippines
* Africa: Kenya, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Egypt, Gambia, Morocco
* Australia and the Oceania: Australia, New Zealand
* Americas:United States, Mexico, Cuba, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Jamaica, Brazil

On September 8, 2007, Veterinary officials in [[South Cotabato]], Philippines said that laboratory tests on samples from cows, [[carabao]]s, and horses in the province's 10 towns and lone city showed the level of infection at 89.5%, a sudden increase of positive cases among large livestock due to the erratic weather condition in the area. They must be treated forthwith to prevent complications with [[surra]] and [[hemorrhagic]] [[septicemia]] diseases. Surra already affected all [[barangays]] of the [[Surallah]] town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/59646/SunStar-Rise-in-animal-liver-fluke-cases-alarms-South-Cotabato GMA NEWS.TV, Rise in animal liver fluke cases alarms South Cotabato]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the health services of [[Gabon]] are public, but there are some private institutions, of which the best known is the hospital established in 1913 in [[Lambaréné]] by [[Albert Schweitzer]]. The hospital is now partially subsidized by the Gabonese government.

==Health infrastructure==
Gabon’s medical infrastructure is considered one of the best in [[West Africa]]. By 1985 there were 28 hospitals, 87 medical centers, and 312 infirmaries and dispensaries. As of 2004, there were an estimated 29 physicians per 100,000 people. 

Approximately 90% of the population had access to health care services. In 2000, 70% of the population had access to safe drinking water and 21% had adequate sanitation.

== Health status ==
=== Life expectancy ===
The 2014 CIA estimated average life expectancy in Gabon was 52.06 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertility rate ===
The [[total fertility rate]] has decreased from 5.8 in 1960 to 4.20 children per mother during childbearing years in 2000.

===Endemic diseases===
A comprehensive government health program treats such diseases as [[leprosy]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[malaria]], [[filariasis]], [[intestinal worms]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Rates for immunization of children under the age of one were 97% for tuberculosis and 65% for [[polio]]. Immunization rates for [[DPT vaccine|DPT]] and [[measles]] were 37% and 56% respectively.  Gabon has a domestic supply of pharmaceuticals from a large, modern factory in [[Libreville]].

===Maternal and child healthcare===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Gabon is 260. This is compared with 493.5 in 2008 and 422.5 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 71 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 36. In Gabon the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 12 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 110.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten percent of all births were low birth weight.

===HIV/AIDS===
The [[HIV/AIDS]] [[prevalence]] is estimated to be 5.2% of the adult population (ages 15–49).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html?countryName=Lesotho&amp;countryCode=LT&amp;regionCode=af#gb CIA world factbook: HIV/AIDS – adult prevalence rate]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, approximately 46,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2156rank.html?countryName=Gabon&amp;countryCode=gb&amp;regionCode=afr&amp;rank=59#gb CIA world factbook: People living with HIV/AIDS]&lt;/ref&gt; There were an estimated 2,400 deaths from AIDS in 2009 – down from 3,000 deaths in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2157rank.html?countryName=Gabon&amp;countryCode=gb&amp;regionCode=afr&amp;rank=52#gb CIA world factbook: HIV/AIDS deaths]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ebola===
[[World Health Organization]] specialists and the government of Gabon took immediate action against the mid-1990s re-emergence of the [[Ebola]] virus.

'''Health psychology''' is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Current trends in Health Psychology. ''The Psychologist, 7,'' 114-118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with understanding how [[psychological]], [[behavior]]al, and [[culture|cultural]] factors contribute to physical health and illness. Psychological factors can affect health directly&lt;ref name="Simandan"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. For example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], cumulatively, can harm health. Behavioral factors can also affect a person's health. For example, certain behaviors  can, over time, harm (smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol) or enhance health (engaging in exercise).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"&gt;Ogden, J. (2012). ''Health Psychology: A Textbook (5th ed.).'' Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists take a [[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approach. In other words, health psychologists understand health to be the product not only of biological processes (e.g., a virus, tumor, etc.) but also of psychological (e.g., thoughts and beliefs), behavioral (e.g., habits), and social processes (e.g., [[socioeconomic status]] and [[ethnicity]]).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"/&gt;

By understanding psychological factors that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) to take advantage of the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in [[public health]] departments working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct [[research]].

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of [[clinical psychology]],&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, R. W. (1983). Preventive health psychology: An interface of social and clinical psychology. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 1''(2), 120-127. {{doi|10.1521/jscp.1983.1.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; four different divisions within health psychology and one related field, [[occupational health psychology]] (OHP),&lt;ref&gt;Everly, G. S., Jr. (1986). An introduction to occupational health psychology. In P. A. Keller &amp; L. G. Ritt (Eds.), ''Innovations in clinical practice: A source book, Vol. 5'' (pp. 331-338). Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed over time. The four divisions include clinical health psychology, [[public health]] psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David F. Marks, Michael Murray &amp; Emee Vida Estacio  2018)''Health Psychology. Theory-Research-Practice'' (5th Ed.) Sage |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/health-psychology/book256917|date=2018-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organizations for the field of health psychology include Division 38 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health-psych.org/ Division 38]&lt;/ref&gt; the Division of Health Psychology of the [[British Psychological Society]] (BPS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health-psychology.org.uk/ Division of Health Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Health Psychology Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehps.net/ European Health Psychology Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced credentialing in the US as a clinical health psychologist is provided through the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3308 American Board of Professional Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Recent advances in psychological, medical, and physiological research have led to a new way of thinking about health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the [[biopsychosocial model]], views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, [[social support]]).

[[Psychologists]] who strive to understand how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.&lt;ref name='BPS'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). What is health psychology? A guide for the public.&lt;/ref&gt; They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles and try to find ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or stop smoking.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; 
Health psychologists work in many different settings including the UK's [[National Health Service]] (NHS), private practice, universities, communities, schools and organizations. While many health psychologists provide clinical services as part of their duties, others function in non-clinical roles, primarily involving teaching and research. Leading journals include ''[[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Health Psychology]]'', the ''British Journal of Health Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8287 The ''British Journal of Health Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1758-0846&amp;site=1 ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being'']&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

;Clinical health psychology (ClHP)
:ClHP is the application of scientific knowledge, derived from the field of health psychology, to clinical questions that may arise across the spectrum of health care.  ClHP is one of many specialty practice areas for clinical psychologists. It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of [[behavioral health]] and the treatment-oriented field of [[behavioral medicine]]. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of [[behavior modification|behavior change]], and psychotherapy. In some countries, a clinical health psychologist, with additional training, can become a [[medical psychologist]] and, thereby, obtain prescription privileges.

;Public health psychology (PHP)
:PHP is population oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health. PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[nutrition]], [[genetics]] and [[biostatistics]]. Some PHP interventions are targeted toward at-risk population groups (e.g., undereducated, single pregnant women who smoke) and not the population as a whole (e.g., all pregnant women).

;Community health psychology (CoHP)
:CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities. CoHP also develops community-level interventions that are designed to combat disease and promote physical and mental health. The community often serves as the level of analysis, and is frequently sought as a partner in health-related interventions.

;Critical health psychology (CrHP)
:CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy. CrHP prioritizes social justice and the universal right to health for people of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The critical health psychologist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloger. A leading organization in this area is the [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology]].

Health psychology, like other areas of applied psychology, is both a theoretical and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], [[longitudinal studies]], [[time-series]] designs, [[cross-sectional studies]], [[case-control]] studies, qualitative research as well as [[action research]]. Health psychologists study a broad range of variables including [[heart disease|cardiovascular disease]], ([[cardiac psychology]]), [[smoking]] habits, the relation of [[religious beliefs]] to health, [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, alcohol problems, etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.

==Origins and development==

Psychological factors in health had been studied since the early 20th century by disciplines such as [[psychosomatic medicine]] and later [[behavioral medicine]], but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. For example, the [[Alameda County Study]], which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer.&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, N., &amp; Breslow, L. (1972). Relationship of physical health status and health practices. ''Preventive Medicine, 1''(3), 409-421.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones.&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"&gt;Sterling, P., &amp; Eyer, J. (1981). Biological basis of stress-related mortality. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part E, Medical Psychology, 15''(1), 3-42.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems,&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"/&gt; and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R. &amp; Cohen, N. (1975). Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 37''(4), 333–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed [[medical psychology]]). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled ''The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, W. (1969). The role of psychology in the delivery of health services. ''American Psychologist, 24(6),'' 565-584.&lt;/ref&gt; While there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M., Weinman, J. &amp; Chater, A. (2011). A healthy contribution. ''The Psychologist, 24''(12), 890-892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Joseph Matarazzo]], in 1977, APA added a division devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, "Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation."&lt;ref&gt;Matarazzo, J. D.  (1980). Behavioral health and behavioral medicine:  Frontiers for a new health psychology. ''American Psychologist, 35,'' 807-818.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. In 1986, the BPS established a Division of Health Psychology. The European Health Psychology Society was also established in 1986. Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Belar, C. D., Mendonca McIntyre, T. &amp; Matarazzo, J. D. (2003). Health psychology. In D. K. Freedheim &amp; I. Weiner (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychology. Vol.1: History of Psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.

A number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology, including:
*Epidemiological evidence  linking behavior and health.&lt;ref name='BPS3'&gt;Johnson, M., Weinman, J., &amp; Chater, A. (2011) A healthy Contribution. Health Psychology, 24 (12) 890-902&lt;/ref&gt;
*The addition of behavioral science to medical school curricula, with courses often taught by psychologists.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The training of health professionals in communication skills, with the aim of improving patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;
*Increasing numbers of interventions based on psychological theory (e.g., [[behavior modification]]).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*An increased understanding of  the interaction between psychological and physiological factors leading to the emergence of [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] (PNI).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The health domain having become a target of research by social psychologists interested in testing theoretical models linking beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). ''Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergence of [[AIDS/HIV]], and the increase in funding for behavioral research the epidemic provoked.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

In the UK, the BPS’s reconsideration of the role of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the ''BPS Bulletin'' that there was a great need for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of "Current Trends in Health Psychology" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as "the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare" was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Health psychology:Current trends. The Psychologist, 7,114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Health Psychology Section  became a Special Group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the UK  in 1997. The awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and  members were able to obtain chartered status with the BPS. The BPS went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until  the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the [[Health Professions Council]] in 2010.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

==Objectives==

===Understanding behavioral and contextual factors===
Health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, S.J.; Garry, M.; Jacobsen, J.A.; Loftus, E.F.; &amp; Ditto, P.H. (2008). False memories for end-of-life decisions. ''Health Psychology'', 27, 291–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking&lt;ref&gt;Dusseldorp, E.; van Elderen, T.; &amp; Maes, S.; [[Jacqueline Meulman|Meulman, J.]] &amp; Kraaij, V. (1999). A meta-analysis of psychoeducational programs for coronary heart disease patients. ''Health Psychology'', 18, 506–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and improve daily nutrition&lt;ref&gt;Resnicow, K.; Jackson, A.; Blissett, D.; Wang, T.; McCarty, F.; Rahotep, S.; &amp; Periasamy, S. (2005). Results of the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit Trial. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 339–48.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Beirness, D.J. (1993). Do we really drive as we live? The role of personality factors in road crashes. ''Alcohol, Drugs &amp; Driving'', 9, 129–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health&lt;ref name = "Simandan"/&gt;. The [[biopsychosocial model]] can help in understanding the relation between contextual factors and biology in affecting health&lt;ref name = "Martire"&gt;Martire, L.M. and Franks, M.M., 2014. The role of social networks in adult health: Introduction to the special issue. Health Psychology, 33(6), pp.501-504.&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. Some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, J.P.; &amp; Gilpin, E.A. (1995). A historical analysis of tobacco marketing and the uptake of smoking by youth in the United States: 1890–1977. ''Health Psychology'', 14, 500–508.&lt;/ref&gt; although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson C.J. &amp; Meehan, D.C. (2011). With friends like these...: Peer delinquency influences across age cohorts on smoking, alcohol and illegal substance use. ''European Psychiatry'', 26(1), 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenström, T., Hintsanen, M., Jokela, M., Keltikangas-Järvinen, L., Kivimäki, M., Juonala, M., &amp; ... Viikari, J. S. (2011). Change in job strain and progression of atherosclerosis: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 16''(1), 139-150. {{doi|10.1037/a0021752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.V., Stewart, W., Hall, E.M., Fredlund, P., &amp; Theorell, T. (1996). Long-term psychosocial work environment and cardiovascular mortality among Swedish men. ''American Journal of Public Health, 86''(3), 324–31. {{doi|10.2105/AJPH.86.3.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other OHP research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Ilies, R., Dimotakis, N., &amp; Watson, D. (2010). Mood, blood pressure, and heart rate at work: An experience-sampling study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15''(2), 120-130. {{doi|10.1037/a0018350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasl, S.V. &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M.G. &amp; Theorell, T. (1988). Social class and cardiovascular disease: The contribution of work. ''International Journal of Health Services, 18'', 659–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens (also see [[health action process approach]]). Health psychologists employ [[cognitive behavior therapy]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] (also see [[behavior modification]]) for that purpose.

===Preventing illness===
Health psychologists promote health through behavioral change, as mentioned above; however, they attempt to prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people to make changes in their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive [[emotional]] states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, C.K.; Jamner, L.D.; Henker, B. &amp; Delfino, R.J. (2001). Smoking and moods in adolescents with depressive and aggressive dispositions: Evidence from surveys and electronic diaries. ''Health Psychology'', 20, 99–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is [[anti-smoking campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, J.C.; Niederdeppe, J. &amp; Evans, W.D. (2005). The theory of 'truth': How counterindustry campaigns affect smoking behavior among teens. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

Health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, J.; Bavalia, K.; Bull, M.; Frankum, S.; Goldie, C.; Gosslau, M.; et al. (2004) 'I want more time with my doctor': A quantitative study of time and the consultation. ''Family Practice'', 21, 479–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kompier, M.A.J.; Aust, B.; van den Berg, A.-M. &amp; Siegrist, J. (2000). Stress prevention in bus drivers: Evaluation of 13 natural experiments. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology'', 5, 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.

===The effects of disease===
Health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals' psychological well-being. An individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. These stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having one's sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. These stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B.R.; Lusk, E.J.; Strouse, T.B.; Miller, D.S.; Brown, L.L.; Cross, P.A. &amp; Tenaglia, A.N. (1984). Psychosocial status in chronic illness. ''New England Journal of Medicine, 311'', 506–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with [[terminal illness]]. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Lander, D.A. &amp; Graham-Pole, J.R. (2008). Love medicine for the dying and their caregivers: The body of evidence. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 13'', 201–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists are also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J.M.; Forrest, L.M. &amp; Austin, A.E. (2002). Death of a partner: Perspectives of heterosexual and gay men. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 7'', 317–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical analysis of health policy===
Critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice &lt;ref name = "Martire"/&gt;. These avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. The individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.&lt;ref name="Marks, D.F. 2011"&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M., Evans, B., &amp; Estacio, E.V. (2011). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; ''Health psychology. Theory-research-practice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006160053/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; |date=2011-10-06 }} (3rd Ed.) Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting research===
Like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. Health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; For example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as: 
* What influences healthy eating?
* How is stress linked to heart disease? 
* What are the emotional effects of genetic testing?
* How can we change people’s health behavior to improve their health?&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

===Teaching and communication===
{{main|Health communication}}

Health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. Health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Applications==

===Improving doctor–patient communication===
Health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms (e.g., intestines).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C.M. (1970). Difference between patients' and doctors' interpretation of some common medical terms. ''British Medical Journal, 2'', 286–89.&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research on this topic involves "doctor-centered" or "patient-centered" consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, S.M., Saul, J.L., Butow, P.N., Dunn, S.M., Boyer, M.J., Findlow, R., &amp; Dunsmore, J. (2000). Communication styles in the cancer consultation: Preferences for a patient-centred approach. ''Psycho-Oncology, 9'', 147–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving adherence to medical advice===
Health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, M.; Hampson, S.E.; Avery, L. &amp; Simpson, R. (2004). Effects of a tailored lifestyle self-management intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. ''British Journal of Health Psychology'', 9 (Pt 3), 365–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Safren, S., Gonzalez, J., Wexler, D., Psaros, C., Delahanty, L., Blashill, A., . . . Cagliero, E. (2014). A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 37 (3): 625-633. {{doi|10.2337/dc13-0816}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of measuring adherence====
Health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients' adherence to medical regimens:
* Counting the number of pills in the medicine bottle
* Using self-reports
* Using "Trackcap" bottles, which track the number of times the bottle is opened.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, P. (2002). ''Psychology in practice: Health''. London, England: Hodder &amp; Stoughton Educational.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing pain===
Health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic [[analgesia]], [[causalgia]], [[neuralgia]], and [[phantom limb pain]]. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]]&lt;ref&gt;Melzack, R. (1975). The McGill Pain Questionnaire: Major properties and scoring methods. ''Pain, 1''(3), 277–299.&lt;/ref&gt; has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered [[analgesia]], [[acupuncture]] (found to be effective in reducing pain for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee&lt;ref&gt;Berman, B.; Singh B.B.; Lao, L.; Langenberg, P.; Li, H.; Hadhazy, V.; Bareta, J. &amp; Hochberg, M. (1999). A randomized trial of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee. ''Rheumatology, 38''(4), 346–54.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[biofeedback]], and [[cognitive behavior therapy]].

===Health psychologist roles===
Below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the UK's NHS and private practice.
*'''Consultant health psychologist''': A consultant health psychologist will take a lead for health psychology within public health, including managing tobacco control and smoking cessation services and providing professional leadership in the management of health trainers.&lt;ref name='BPS1'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). Health psychology: A guide for employees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Principal health psychologist''': A principal  health psychologist could, for example lead the health psychology service within one of the UK’s leading heart and lung hospitals, providing a clinical service to patients and advising all members of the multidisciplinary team.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist''': An example of a health psychologist's role would be to provide health psychology input to a center for weight management. Psychological assessment of treatment, development and delivery of a tailored weight management program, and advising on approaches to improve adherence to health advice and medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Research psychologist''': Research health psychologists carry out health psychology research, for example, exploring the psychological impact of receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or evaluating ways of providing psychological support for people with burn injuries. Research can also be in the area of health promotion, for example investigating the determinants of healthy eating or physical activity or understanding why people misuse substances.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist in training/assistant health psychologist''': As an assistant/in training, a health psychologist will gain experience assessing patients, delivering psychological interventions to change health behaviors, and conducting research, whilst being supervised by a qualified health psychologist.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Training==
{{See also|List of universities with health psychology programs}}

In the UK, health psychologists are registered by the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC) and have trained to a level to be eligible for full membership of the Division of Health Psychology within the BPS.&lt;ref name='BPS2'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). ''Health Psychology in applied settings: A guide for employers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Registered health psychologists who are chartered with the BPS will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training and will have specialized in health psychology for a minimum of three years.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; Health psychologists in training must have completed BPS stage 1 training and be registered with the BPS Stage 2 training route or with a BPS-accredited university doctoral health psychology program. Once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the NHS, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist will have demonstrated competencies in all of the following areas:
* professional skills (including implementing ethical and legal standards, communication, and teamwork),
* research skills (including designing, conducting, and analyzing psychological research in numerous areas),
* consultancy skills (including planning and evaluation),
* teaching and training skills (including knowledge of designing, delivering, and evaluating large and small scale training program),
* intervention skills (including delivery and evaluation of behavior change interventions).&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
All qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) for psychology each year throughout their career.&lt;ref name= 'BPS2' /&gt;

'''Herbalism''' (also '''herbal medicine''') is the study of [[botany]] and use of [[plant]]s intended for [[medicinal plants|medicinal]] purposes. Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history, and such [[traditional medicine]] is still widely practiced today.&lt;ref name=swallow&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/448106a|title=Hard to swallow|year=2007|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7150/full/448106a.html|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=448|issue=7150|pages=105–06|pmid=17625521|bibcode=2007Natur.448S.105.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.

==History==
{{main|History of herbalism|Materia medica}}

Archaeological evidence indicates that the use of [[medicinal plant]]s dates back to the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic age]], approximately 60,000 years ago. Written evidence of herbal remedies dates back over 5,000 years to the [[Sumer]]ians, who compiled lists of plants. Some ancient cultures wrote about plants and their medical uses in books called ''[[herbal]]s''. In ancient Egypt, herbs are mentioned in [[Egyptian medical papyri]], depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite book|last= Nunn|first= John|title= Ancient Egyptian Medicine|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfEnVU6z8IC&amp;pg=PA151|year= 2002|publisher= University of Oklahoma Press|isbn= 978-0-8061-3504-5|page= 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the oldest, lengthiest, and most important medical papyri of ancient Egypt, the [[Ebers Papyrus]] dates from about 1550 BC, and covers more than 700 compounds, mainly of plant origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Atanasov AG, Waltenberger B, Pferschy-Wenzig EM, Linder T, Wawrosch C, Uhrin P, Temml V, Wang L, Schwaiger S, Heiss EH, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Breuss JM, Bochkov V, Mihovilovic MD, Kopp B, Bauer R, Dirsch VM, Stuppner H | year = 2015 | title = Discovery and resupply of pharmacologically active plant-derived natural products: A review | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.08.001 | journal = Biotechnol.

==Modern herbal medicine==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/ |title=Traditional medicine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Zeyw2hfS?url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/ |archivedate=2008-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceuticals are prohibitively expensive for most of the world's population, half of whom lived on less than $2 U.S. per day in 2002.&lt;ref name=Developingworld2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Edgar J.

Many of the [[pharmaceuticals]] currently available to physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including [[opium]], [[aspirin]], [[digitalis]], and [[quinine]]. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; At least 7,000 medical compounds in the modern pharmacopoeia are derived from plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interactive European Network for Industrial Crops and their Applications |title=Summary Report for the European Union |date=2000–2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/quality-of-life/ka5/en/00111.html |id=QLK5-CT-2000-00111 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222231154/http://ec.europa.eu/research/quality-of-life/ka5/en/00111.html |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }} [www.ienica.net/reports/ienicafinalsummaryreport2000-2005.pdf Free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 120 active compounds currently isolated from the higher plants and widely used in modern medicine today, 80% show a positive correlation between their modern therapeutic use and the traditional use of the plants from which they are derived.&lt;ref name=Fabricant2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabricant DS, Farnsworth NR |title=The value of plants used in traditional medicine for drug discovery |journal=Environ.

===Clinical tests===
In a 2010 global survey of the most common 1000 plant-derived compounds, 156 had clinical trials published.&lt;ref name="jcpt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cravotto G, Boffa L, Genzini L, Garella D |title=Phytotherapeutics: an evaluation of the potential of 1000 plants |journal=J Clin Pharm Ther |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=11–48 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20175810 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2710.2009.01096.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2710.2009.01096.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preclinical studies ([[cell culture]] and animal studies) were reported for about one-half of the plant products, while 120 (12%) of the plants evaluated &amp;ndash; although available in the Western market &amp;ndash; had no rigorous studies of their properties, and five were toxic or allergenic, a finding that led the authors to conclude "their use ought to be discouraged or forbidden."&lt;ref name=jcpt/&gt; Nine plants evaluated in human [[clinical research]] included ''[[Althaea officinalis]]'' (marshmallow), ''[[Calendula officinalis]]'' (marigold), ''[[Centella asiatica]]'' (centella), ''[[Echinacea purpurea]]'' (echinacea), ''[[Passiflora incarnata]]'' (passionflower), ''[[Punica granatum]]'' (pomegranate), ''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]'' (cranberry), ''[[Vaccinium myrtillus]]'' (bilberry), and ''[[Valeriana officinalis]]'' (valerian), although generally there were inconsistent, often negative results, and the studies were of low quality.&lt;ref name=jcpt/&gt;

In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; Herbalism was one of 17 topics evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government – Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

===Prevalence of use===
The use of herbal remedies is more prevalent in patients with chronic diseases such as [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and [[end-stage renal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of alternative medicine by women with early-stage breast cancer|pmid=10352166 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906033402206 | volume=340|issue=22 |date=June 1999|journal=N Engl J Med|pages=1733–39|author1=Burstein |first1=HJ |last2=Gelber |first2=S |last3=Guadagnoli |first3=E |last4=Weeks |first4=JC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The prevalence and pattern of complementary and alternative medicine use in individuals with diabetes|pmid=11815504 | volume=25 |issue=2 | date=February 2002|journal=Diabetes Care|pages=324–29|doi=10.2337/diacare.25.2.324|author1=Egede |first1=LE |last2=Ye |first2=X |last3=Zheng |first3=D |last4=Silverstein |first4=MD }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of herbal remedies among patients undergoing hemodialysis|pmid=24241097 | volume=7 |issue=6 | date=November 2013|journal=Iran J Kidney Dis|pages=492–95|author1=Roozbeh |first1=J |last2=Hashempur |first2=MH |last3=Heydari |first3=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, education and social class are also shown to have association with prevalence of herbal remedies use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who Uses CAM?

A survey released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] focused on who used [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicines]] (CAM), what was used, and why it was used. The survey was limited to adults, aged 18 years and over during 2002, living in the [[United States]]. According to this survey, herbal therapy, or use of natural products other than [[vitamin]]s and minerals, was the most commonly used CAM therapy (18.9%) when all use of [[prayer]] was excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html Complementary and alternative medicine] (CAM) is a combination of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nccih.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine] Press release, 27 May 2004. [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbal remedies are very common in [[Europe]]. In [[Germany]], herbal medications are dispensed by apothecaries (e.g., Apotheke). Prescription drugs are sold alongside essential oils, herbal extracts, or [[herbal tea]]s. Herbal remedies are seen by some as a treatment to be preferred to pure medical compounds that have been industrially produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = James A. Duke |date=December 1999 – January 2000|title = Returning to our Medicinal Roots|journal = Mother Earth News|pages = 26–33|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-73088521.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India the herbal remedy is so popular that the government of India has created a separate department—AYUSH—under the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare. The National Medicinal Plants Board was also established in 2000 by the Indian government in order to deal with the herbal medical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|author2=Sajwan|title=Revitalizing Indian systems of herbal medicine by the National Medicinal Plants Board through institutional networking and capacity building|journal=Current Science|year=2007|volume=93|issue=6|pages=797–806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbal preparations===
There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is in the form of a liquid that is drunk by the patient—either an herbal tea or a (possibly diluted) plant extract.&lt;ref name="saad-2011-p80" /&gt;

Several methods of standardization may be determining the amount of herbs used. One is the ratio of raw materials to solvent. However different specimens of even the same plant species may vary in chemical content. For this reason, [[thin layer chromatography]] is sometimes used by growers to assess the content of their products before use. Another method is standardization on a signal chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Mark Blumenthal and Tara Hall | title = What is Herb Standardization? | journal = HerbalGram. | issue = 52 | pages = 25 | year =  2001 | url = http://essiacfacts.com/herb-standardization/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eucalyptus olida distillation1.JPG|thumb|right|Leaves of ''[[Eucalyptus olida]]'' being packed into a steam [[distillation]] unit to gather its [[essential oil]].]]
[[Herbal tea]]s, or tisanes, are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. [[Infusion]]s are hot water extracts of herbs, such as [[Matricaria recutita|chamomile]] or [[Mentha|mint]], through [[steeping]]. [[Decoction]]s are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. [[Maceration (wine)|Maceration]] is the cold infusion of plants with high [[mucilage]]-content, such as [[Common sage|sage]] or [[thyme]]. To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on herb used). For most macerates, 10 hours is used.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Tincture]]s are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than herbal teas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, James|title=The Herbal Medicine Maker's Handbook: A Home Manual|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2000|isbn=9780895949905|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nxKJ7SocEUC&amp;pg=PT168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinctures are usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or a mixture of 100% ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Groot Handboek Geneeskrachtige Planten by Geert Verhelst&lt;/ref&gt; Herbal wine and [[elixir]]s are alcoholic extract of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12–38%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  [[Extract]]s include liquid extracts, dry extracts, and nebulisates. Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum [[Distillation|distilling]] tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are [[Evaporation|evaporated]] into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The exact composition of an herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in [[Chemical polarity|polar]] components because [[water]] is a [[polar solvent]]. Oil on the other hand is a [[non-polar]] solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between.&lt;ref name="saad-2011-p80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saad, Bashar|author2=Said, Omar|last-author-amp=yes|title=Greco-Arab and Islamic Herbal Medicine: Traditional System, Ethics, Safety, Efficacy, and Regulatory Issues|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9780470474211|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WQVF8nhKf4C&amp;pg=PT80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. [[Essential oil]] extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; diluting them in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. Salves, oils, [[Liniment|balm]]s, creams and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, and wound healing compounds are made this way.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Northern Lore: A Field Guide to the Northern Mind-Body-Spirit|last=Odinsson|first=Eoghan|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=1452851433|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

A number of herbs are thought to be likely to cause adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Talalay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talalay | first1 = P | last2 = Talalay | first2 = P | title = The importance of using scientific principles in the development of medicinal agents from plants | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–47 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11242573 | doi = 10.1097/00001888-200103000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life threatening or lethal.&lt;ref name="LewisME"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0378-8741(00)00394-9 | last1 = Elvin-Lewis | first1 = M. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2001 | title = Should we be concerned about herbal remedies | url = | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 75 | issue = 2–3| pages = 141–64 | pmid = 11297844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Proper double-blind clinical trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of each plant before they can be recommended for medical use.&lt;ref name="pmid17761132"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vickers AJ|title=Which botanicals or other unconventional anticancer agents should we take to clinical trial?|journal=J Soc Integr Oncol|volume=5|issue=3|pages=125–29|year=2007|pmid=17761132|doi=10.2310/7200.2007.011|pmc=2590766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many consumers believe that herbal medicines are safe because they are "natural", herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may interact, causing toxicity to the patient.

Standardization of purity and dosage is not mandated in the United States, but even products made to the same specification may differ as a result of biochemical variations within a species of plant.&lt;ref name=bmc2013/&gt; Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Love potions and the ointment of witches: historical aspects of the nightshade alkaloids | journal =  J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 617–27 | year = 1998| doi =10.3109/15563659809028060 | pmid = 9776969 | last1 =Müller
 | first1 =JL  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with "sorcery", "magic" and intrigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Solanaceae III: henbane, hags and Hawley Harvey Crippen | journal = J R Coll Physicians Edinb. | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages =366–73 |date=December 2006 | pmid = 17526134 | last1 =Lee | first1 =MR  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Adverse effects associated with herbal medicine | journal = Aust Fam Physician | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages =1070–75 |date=November 2001 | pmid = 11759460

A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An unusual cause of hypokalemic paralysis: chronic licorice ingestion | journal =[[Am J Med Sci]] | volume = 325 | issue = 3 | pages =153–56 |date=March 2003 | doi =10.1097/00000441-200303000-00008 | pmid = 12640291 | author =Lin, Shih-Hua | last2 =Yang | first2 =SS | last3 =Chau | first3 =T | last4 =Halperin | first4 =ML  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Fulminant hepatic failure associated with the use of black cohosh: a case report | journal =  Liver Transpl. | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages =989–92 |date=June 2006 | doi =10.1002/lt.20778 | pmid = 16721764 | author =Lynch, Christopher R. | last2 =Folkers | first2 =ME | last3 =Hutson | first3 =WR  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Herb use in pregnancy: what nurses should know | journal = MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs. | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages =201–06 | date=May–June 2005 | pmid = 15867682 | last1 =Born | first1 =D | last2 =Barron | first2 =ML | doi=10.1097/00005721-200505000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines are associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boivin | first1=J. | last2=Schmidt | first2=L. | title=Use of complementary and alternative medicines associated with a 30% lower onging pregnancy/live birth rate during 12 months of fertility treatment | journal=Human Reproduction |volume=24 |year=2009 |issue=7 |pages=1626–31 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dep077  |name-list-format=vanc | pmid=19359338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite, which is often a legally restricted herb, ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal.&lt;ref name ="ErnstE"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ernst | first1 = E |name-list-format=vanc | title = Harmless Herbs?

There is also concern with respect to the numerous well-established interactions of herbs and drugs.&lt;ref name="LewisME"/&gt; In consultation with a physician, usage of herbal remedies should be clarified, as some herbal remedies have the potential to cause adverse drug interactions when used in combination with various prescription and [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] pharmaceuticals, just as a patient should inform a herbalist of their consumption of orthodox prescription and other medication.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

For example, dangerously low blood pressure may result from the combination of an herbal remedy that lowers blood pressure together with prescription medicine that has the same effect. Some herbs may amplify the effects of anticoagulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An examination of the bleeding complications associated with herbal supplements, antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications | journal = J Dent Hyg. | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages =67 | date = Summer 2007 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6368/is_3_81/ai_n31843689/ | doi = | pmid = 17908423 | accessdate = | last1 =Spolarich | first1 =AE | last2 =Andrews | first2 =L  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain herbs as well as common fruit interfere with cytochrome P450, an enzyme critical to much drug metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Interactions of food and dietary supplements with drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes | journal = Ceska Slov Farm. | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages =165–73 |date=July 2007 | url = | doi = | pmid = 17969314 | accessdate = | last1 =Nekvindová | first1 =J | last2 =Anzenbacher | first2 =P  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 study, FDA identified active [[medication|pharmaceutical additives]] in over 700 of analyzed dietary supplements sold as "herbal", "natural" or "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/12/656875443/no-wonder-it-works-so-well-there-may-be-viagra-in-that-herbal-supplement|author=Ronnie Cohen|title=No Wonder It Works So Well: There May Be Viagra In That Herbal Supplement|website=NPR.org|language=en|date=12 October 2018|access-date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undisclosed additives included "unapproved antidepressants and designer steroids", as well as [[prescription drug]]s, such as [[sildenafil]] or [[sibutramine]].

===Labeling accuracy===
A 2013 study found that one-third of herbal supplements sampled contained no trace of the herb listed on the label.&lt;ref name="bmc2013"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3851815|year=2013|author1=Newmaster|first1=SG|title=DNA barcoding detects contamination and substitution in North American herbal products|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=11|pages=222|last2=Grguric|first2=M|last3=Shanmughanandhan|first3=D|last4=Ramalingam|first4=S|last5=Ragupathy|first5=S|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-222|pmid=24120035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found products adulterated with contaminants or [[filler (materials)|fillers]] not listed on the label, including potential allergens such as soy, wheat, or black walnut. One bottle labeled as [[St. John's Wort]] was found to actually contain ''[[Alexandrian senna]]'', a laxative.&lt;ref name=bmc2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=Herbal Supplements Are Often Not What They Seem|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/herbal-supplements-are-often-not-what-they-seem.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1383945465-XvljD6UxwpzyAWUPgcqK3A&amp;|publisher=New York Times|date=3 November 2012|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[University of Adelaide]] found in 2014 that almost 20 per cent of herbal remedies surveyed were not registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, despite this being a condition for their sale.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/herbal-medicines-study-raises-alarm-over-labelling-20140223-33aex.html|title=Herbal medicines: Study raises alarm over labelling|author=Carroll, Lucy|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia|date=24 February 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that nearly 60 per cent of products surveyed had ingredients that did not match what was on the label. Out of 121 products, only 15 had ingredients that matched their TGA listing and packaging.&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt;

In 2015, the [[New York Attorney General]] issued [[cease and desist]] letters to four major U.S. retailers ([[GNC (store)|GNC]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Walgreens]], and [[Walmart]]) who were accused of selling herbal supplements that were mislabeled and potentially dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Anahad|title=New York Attorney General Targets Supplements at Major Retailers|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/new-york-attorney-general-targets-supplements-at-major-retailers/|accessdate=3 February 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Sarah|title=GNC, Target, Wal-Mart, Walgreens accused of selling adulterated ‘herbals’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/03/gnc-target-wal-mart-walgreens-accused-of-selling-fake-herbals/|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=Washington Post|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four products were tested by [[DNA barcoding]] as part of the investigation, with all but five containing DNA that did not match the product labels.

===Practitioners of herbalism===
[[File:Picking of heads of Arnica montana.JPG|thumb|right|A herbalist gathers the flower heads of ''[[Arnica montana]]''.]]

Herbalists must learn many skills, including the [[wildcrafting]] or cultivation of herbs, diagnosis and treatment of conditions or dispensing herbal medication, and preparations of herbal medications. Education of herbalists varies considerably in different areas of the world. Lay herbalists and traditional indigenous [[medicine man|medicine people]] generally rely upon apprenticeship and recognition from their communities in lieu of formal schooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In some countries, formalized training and minimum education standards exist, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. In Australia, for example, the self-regulated status of the profession (as of 2009) resulted in variable standards of training, and numerous loosely-formed associations setting different educational standards.&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3270908|year=2009|last1=Lin|first1=V.|title=The practice and regulatory requirements of naturopathy and western herbal medicine in Australia|journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy|volume=2|pages=21–33|last2=McCabe|first2=P.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=A.|last4=Myers|first4=S.|last5=Cohen|first5=M.|last6=Hill|first6=S.|last7=Howse|first7=G.|pmid=22312205|doi=10.2147/RMHP.S4652}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 2009 review concluded that regulation of herbalists in Australia was needed to reduce the risk of interaction of herbal medicines with [[prescription drug]]s, to implement clinical guidelines and prescription of herbal products, and to assure self-regulation for protection of public health and safety.&lt;ref name=lin/&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], the training of herbalists is done by state funded universities offering [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in herbal medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Government regulations===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health, published ''Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials'' in 1998 in order to support WHO Member States in establishing quality standards and specifications for herbal materials, within the overall context of quality assurance and control of herbal medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/h1791e/h1791e.pdf|title=WHO Quality Control Methods for Herbal Materials|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]] (EU), herbal medicines are regulated under the [[Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000208.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac05800240cf|title=Herbal medicinal products|date=2017|publisher=European Medicines Agency|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], herbal remedies are regulated [[dietary supplements]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under [[good manufacturing practice|current good manufacturing practice]] (cGMP) policy for dietary supplements.&lt;ref name="ods2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/BotanicalBackground-HealthProfessional/|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health|title=Botanical Dietary Supplements|date=June 2011|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product so long as they do not make 'medical' claims or imply uses other than as a 'dietary supplement', though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/dshea.html US Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldman P |title=Herbal medicines today and the roots of modern pharmacology |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=135 |issue=8 Pt 1 |pages=594–600 |year=2001 |pmid=11601931 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-135-8_Part_1-200110160-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian regulations are described by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate which requires an eight-digit Natural Product Number or Homeopathic Medicine Number on the label of licensed herbal medicines or dietary supplements.&lt;ref name="hc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/applications/licen-prod/lnhpd-bdpsnh-eng.php|title=Licensed Natural Health Products Database: What is it?|publisher=Health Canada|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some herbs, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[coca]], are outright banned in most countries though coca is legal in most of the [[South America]]n countries where it is grown. The [[Cannabis|''Cannabis'' plant]] is used as an herbal [[medical cannabis|medicine]], and as such is [[legal status of cannabis|legal]] in some parts of the world. Since 2004, the sales of [[ephedra]] as a dietary supplement is prohibited in the United States by the FDA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fpephed6.html FDA Issues Regulation Prohibiting Sale of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids and Reiterates Its Advice That Consumers Stop Using These Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915111213/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fpephed6.html |date=2007-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subject to Schedule III restrictions in the United Kingdom.

===Scientific criticism===
Herbalism has been criticized as a potential "[[land mine|minefield]]" of unreliable product quality, safety hazards, and potential for misleading health advice.&lt;ref name=swallow/&gt;&lt;ref name="quackwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/herbs.html|title=The herbal minefield|author=Barrett, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Barrett|publisher=Quackwatch|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are no standards across various herbal products to authenticate their contents, safety or efficacy,&lt;ref name=bmc2013/&gt; and there is generally an absence of high-quality scientific research on product composition or effectiveness for anti-disease activity.&lt;ref name=quackwatch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/92455/1/9789241506090_eng.pdf?ua=1|publisher=World Health Organization|title=WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy, 2014–2023|page= 41|date=2013|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumed claims of therapeutic benefit from herbal products, without rigorous evidence of efficacy and safety, receive skeptical views by scientists.&lt;ref name=swallow/&gt;

==Phytotherapy and paraherbalism{{anchor|Phytotherapy|Paraherbalism}}==
[[File:Cinchona officinalis 001.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a herbal medicine resource: the bark of the [[cinchona]] tree contains [[quinine]], which today is a widely prescribed treatment for [[malaria]]. The unpurified bark is still used by some who can not afford to purchase more expensive antimalarial drugs.]]

'''Paraherbalism''' or '''phytotherapy''' is the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] use of [[extract]]s of plant or animal origin as supposed medicines or health-promoting agents.&lt;ref name=swallow/&gt;&lt;ref name=quackwatch/&gt;&lt;ref name="tyler"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/paraherbalism.html|title=False Tenets of Paraherbalism|publisher=Quackwatch|author=Varro E. Tyler|date=31 August 1999|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytotherapy differs from plant-derived medicines in standard [[pharmacology]] because it does not isolate and [[Standardization|standardize]] the compounds from a given plant believed to be biologically active. It relies on the false belief that preserving the complexity of substances from a given plant with less processing is safer and potentially more effective, for which there is no evidence either condition applies.&lt;ref name=tyler/&gt;

Phytochemical researcher [[Varro Eugene Tyler]] described paraherbalism as "faulty or inferior herbalism based on pseudoscience", using scientific terminology but lacking scientific evidence for safety and efficacy. Tyler listed ten [[fallacy|fallacies]] that distinguished herbalism from paraherbalism, including claims that there is a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to suppress safe and effective herbs, herbs can not cause harm, that whole herbs are more effective than molecules isolated from the plants, herbs are superior to drugs, the [[doctrine of signatures]] (the belief that the shape of the plant indicates its function) is valid, dilution of substances increases their potency (a doctrine of the pseudoscience of [[homeopathy]]), astrological alignments are significant, animal testing is not appropriate to indicate human effects, [[anecdotal evidence]] is an effective means of proving a substance works and herbs were created by [[God]] to cure disease. Tyler suggests that none of these beliefs have any basis in fact.&lt;ref name = Tyler&gt;{{cite book | last = Tyler | first = VE | authorlink = Varro Eugene Tyler |author2=Robbers JE | year = 1999 | title = Tyler's Herbs of Choice: The Therapeutic Use of Phytomedicinals | publisher = [[Routledge]] | pages = [https://books.google.ca/books?id=4X4ly7nRDxwC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6–8] | isbn = 0789001594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Quackwatchtyler&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/paraherbalism.html | title = False Tenets of Paraherbalism | first = VE | last = Tyler | accessdate = 2012-04-28 | date = 1999-08-31 | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Some researchers trained in both western and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have attempted to deconstruct ancient medical texts in the light of modern science. One idea is that the yin-yang balance, at least with regard to herbs,  corresponds to the pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant balance. This interpretation is supported by several investigations of the [[Oxygen radical absorbance capacity|ORAC]] ratings of various yin and yang herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem054| pmc = 2586310| last1 = Liao| pmid = 18955214| year = 2008| first1 = Hui| pages = 429–34| issue = 4| volume = 5| journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine| last2 = Banbury| first2 = Linda K.| last3 = Leach| first3 = David N.  |title=Antioxidant activity of 45 Chinese herbs and the relationship with their TCM characteristics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===India===
In [[India]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]] has quite complex formulas with 30 or more ingredients, including a sizable number of ingredients that have undergone "[[alchemy|alchemical processing]]", chosen to balance [[dosha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Preserving Ayurvedic herbal formulations by Vaidyas: The traditional healers of the Uttaranchal Himalaya region in India|journal=HerbalGram|year=2006|volume=70|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ladakh, Lahul-Spiti and Tibet, the [[Tibetan Medicine|Tibetan Medical System]] is prevalent, also called the 'Amichi Medical System'. Over 337 species of [[medicinal plant]]s have been documented by [[C.P. Kala]]. Those are used by Amchis, the practitioners of this medical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Health traditions of Buddhist community and role of amchis in trans-Himalayan region of India|journal=Current Science|year=2005|volume=89|issue=8|pages=1331–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Medicinal plants of Indian trans-Himalaya|year=2003|publisher=Bishen Singh Mahendra Pal Singh|location=Dehradun|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tamil Nadu]], Tamils have their own medicinal system now popularly called [[Siddha medicine]]. The Siddha system is entirely in the [[Tamil language]]. It contains roughly 300,000 verses covering diverse aspects of medicine. This work includes herbal, mineral and metallic compositions used as medicine. Ayurveda is in [[Sanskrit]], but Sanskrit was not generally used as a mother tongue and hence its medicines are mostly taken from Siddha and other local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Theivaththin Kural, Chandrasekarendra saraswathi sankaracharya, Vol. 3, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[File:Jamu.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of Indonesian [[jamu]] herbal medicines held in bottles.]]
In [[Indonesia]], especially among the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], the [[jamu]] traditional herbal medicine is an age old tradition preserved for centuries. Jamu is thought to have originated in the [[Mataram Kingdom]] era, some 1300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jejak Mataram Kuno di Sindoro |author1=Indira Permanasari |author2=Aryo Wisanggeni |work=Ekspedisi Cincin Api Kompas |date=21 February 2012 |url=http://ekspedisi.kompas.com/cincinapi/index.php/detail/articles/2012/02/21/06231614/Jejak.Mataram.Kuno.di.Sindoro |language=Indonesian |accessdate=4 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302210029/http://ekspedisi.kompas.com/cincinapi/index.php/detail/articles/2012/02/21/06231614/Jejak.Mataram.Kuno.di.Sindoro |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bas-relief]]s on [[Borobudur]] depicts the image of people grinding herbs with stone [[mortar and pestle]], a drink seller, a physician and [[masseuse]] treating their clients.&lt;ref name="Tribun1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jamu dan Lulur, Rahasia Cantik Para Putri Keraton |date=21 May 2013 |newspaper=Tribun Jogja| url=http://jogja.tribunnews.com/2013/05/21/jamu-dan-lulur-rahasia-cantik-para-puteri-keraton |language=Indonesian |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these scenes might be interpreted as a traditional herbal medicine and health-related treatments in ancient Java. The Madhawapura inscription from [[Majapahit]] period mentioned a specific profession of herbs mixer and combiner (herbalist), called ''Acaraki''.&lt;ref name="Tribun1"/&gt; The medicine book from [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] dated from circa 1700 contains 3,000 entries of jamu herbal recipes, while Javanese classical literature [[Serat Centhini]] (1814) describes some jamu herbal concoction recipes.&lt;ref name="Tribun1"/&gt;

Though highly possible influenced by Indian [[Ayurveda]] system, Indonesia is a vast archipelago with numerous indigenous plants not to be found in India, which include plants similar to [[Australia]] beyond the [[Wallace Line]]. Indonesians might experimented and figure out the medicinal uses of these native herbal plants. Jamu may vary from region to region, and often not written down, especially in remote areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Susan-Jane Beers, ''Jamu: The Ancient Indonesian Art of Herbal Healing'' (Hong Kong: Periplus, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although primarily herbal, materials acquired from animals, such as [[honey]], [[royal jelly]], [[milk]] and ''[[Ayam Kampung|ayam kampung]]'' [[chicken eggs|eggs]] are also often used in jamu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The [[Hittites]] have left a good number of texts detailing preparation of food and many Hittite laws stipulate how certain food is to be prepared, cooked and served. 
The main ingredients of Hittite cuisine were dairy products, meat, grain products and other natural products such as honey. 
Hittites loved bread and had recipes for as many as 180 types of bread in different shapes and with varying ingredients. Food eaten in Anatolia is a continuation of the Hittite cuisine as stated in the book "Hittite Cuisine" published by Alpha Publishing (08-2008) in Turkey.
Some cities have preserved the Hittite food traditions. Adana, a major city in South East Turkey (Adaniya in Hittite in the former Neo-Hittte, Luwian Kizzuwadna region) is famous for its kebabs and according to studies Hittite cuisine contained a strong element of meat skewer (Shish Kebab). 
Various books are written in Turkish about the Hittite cuisine and the [[Hittite University]] in [[Çorum]] in [[Turkey]] has published articles about Hittite cuisine recently.
Hittite food recipes were generally similar to that of contemporary civilizations, especially in regard to meat and dairy dishes, but were unique with regard to the plants used in cooking, as [[Anatolia]] has its own unique vegetation.
Wine was consumed by the Hittites on regular basis and used for religious festivals and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/hititler-damagina-pek-duskunmus-9420945|title=Hititler damağına pek düşkünmüş|first=Mehmet|last=YAŞİN|website=Hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judithstarkston.com/articles/cooking-like-a-hittite-or-a-trojan-lamb-and-lentil-stew-with-cumin-and-raisins/|title=Cooking like a Hittite or a Trojan: Lamb and lentil stew with cumin and raisins|date=23 February 2011|website=Judithstarkston.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hitit Mutfağı'', Asuman Albayrak, Türkiye Is Bankasi Kültür Yayinlari, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud''' (The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (GMI)) is a [[medical research]] institution that has been dedicated for more than 80 years on investigating diseases in the tropics and [[preventive medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.paho.org/pan/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;gid=61&amp;Itemid=224 Organización Panamericana de la Salud]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The institute was created in 1921 by [[Dr. Belisario Porras]], to honor Dr. William Crawford Gorgas, who eradicated yellow fever in Panama. This achievement allowed the construction of the Panama Canal. Gorgas Memorial Laboratories was inaugurated in 1928 on Arosemena Avenue. Its expertise in studying the diseases of the [[tropics]] originated from the necessity to eradicate [[yellow fever]] and control [[malaria]] in the cities of [[Panama]] and [[Colón, Panama|Colon]] with the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].

==Research==
This triumph, led by Dr. [[William C. Gorgas]] in the first years of the 20th century, was achieved by one of the largest and most successful community-level public health interventions ever recorded in the history of medicine. Since then, many emerging and reemerging diseases have been studied at GMI and physicians and scientists of many nationalities working there have made significant contributions to medicine in the tropics. These collaborations and lines of investigation have continued up to the present.

GMI is known for its high quality laboratories, including those of [[parasitology]], [[immunology]], [[genomics]], [[entomology]], water and food chemistry, [[bacteriology]], entomology and [[virology]]. Besides having an epidemiology and biostatistics department, it conducts research on health administration, [[chronic diseases]] and human reproduction. GMI has contributed to better the health of Panama and the Central American countries by acting as a reference laboratory to diagnose diseases like yellow fever, malaria, measles, [[arbovirus]] febrile illness, viral [[encephalitidies]], [[influenza]], [[dengue]] and [[hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome]]. Jorge Motta, MD, MPH,  was the Director General from 2004 to 2008 and the present director is Dr. Nestor Sosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorgas.gob.pa/index.php?lang=en The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently GMI became a World Bank-[[Pan-American Health Organization]] reference laboratory for [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) for the Central American region. Its lengthy tradition of service in the region has permitted GMI to maintain and nurture close contacts and rapid communication with all the public health installations of Panama’s [[Ministry of Health]], with the health installations of the Social Security System and with the main private hospitals of the country.

In 2006, GMI signed an MOU with the Department of Health and Human Services and was also awarded two grants, one to increase its virology diagnostic capacity and to strengthen the surveillance of influenza virus in Panama and [[Central America]] and the other to develop a Regional Training Center for community health care workers of the Central American Region.

The Regional Training Center is an educational facility dedicated to community health care workers and clinicians of Central America to prepare them to provide better primary and preventive health care to underserved rural and poor urban communities and indigenous populations. These health care providers are trained to provide the first line of response to health needs of their communities, especially in areas related of infectious diseases, pandemic illness response and the attainment of Millennium Development Health Goals.

GMI's has research agreements and research projects with academic centers like the [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[George Washington University]], the [[University of South Florida]], the [[University of New Mexico]], and the [[Walter Reed Institute of Research]]. GMI has developed strong links with the epidemiology programs and the extended immunization programs of all the countries in Central America, with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), specifically with the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and influenza program, with the Center for Diseases Control of the United of America (CDC-USA) and (CDC-MERTU-G), with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and with institutions like the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI).

Today GMI is an autonomous public institution that works closely with the Ministry of Health. Its vision is to improve the health of Panama and Central America. Its mission is to develop health research in Panama, to fulfill the functions of a national public health laboratory and to provide education to health care workers of the region. GMI is evolving to become Panama’s national public health institute and will continue serving the Ministry of Health by providing the best evidence available to develop public health policy.

A collection of the institute's papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/gorgas212|title=Gorgas Memorial Institute of Tropical and Preventive Medicine Records 1899-1992|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses''' was the first nursing school in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], located on Rideau Street.  It was founded in 1891 by Constance Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Preston and later Countess of Derby. She was the wife of [[Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby]], who served as Governor General of [[Canada]] from 1888-1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/322 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canal was suggested by a Nigerian engineer before 1991, and would generate hydro-electricity at several points along its length. These would power new industrial townships, while the canal would replenish the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The members of the [[Lake Chad Basin International Commission]] are [[Chad]], the Central African Republic, [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Niger]]. Concerned by shrinkage of the lake's area from {{convert|20,000|km2|sqmi}} in 1972 to {{convert|2,000|km2|sqmi}} in 2002, they met in January 2002 to discuss the project. Both the ADB and the [[Islamic Development Bank]] expressed interest in the project. However, the member states of the Congo-Ubangi-Sangha Basin International Commission, [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Congo-Brazzaville]] and the [[Central African Republic]] expressed concern that the project would reduce the energy potential of the [[Inga Dam|Inga hydroelectric dam]], would affect navigation on the Ubangi and [[Congo River|Congo]] rivers and would reduce fish catches on these rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Let There Be Light''''' (1946) — known to the U.S. Army as '''[[Professional Medical Film|PMF]] 5019''' — is a [[documentary film]] directed by [[United States|American]] filmmaker [[John Huston]] (1906–1987). It was the last in a series of four films&lt;ref&gt;The others were ''[[Report from the Aleutians]]'' (1943), were ''[[Tunisian Victory]]'' (1944), and ''[[The Battle of San Pietro]]'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Huston while serving in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] during World War II. Its portrayal of soldiers suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] led to  ''Let There Be Light'' being suppressed by the U.S. government; it was not released until the 1980s.

==Content==
Seventy-five [[U.S. armed forces|U.S. service members]] — recent combat veterans suffering from various "nervous conditions" including [[psychoneurosis]], [[battle neurosis]], [[conversion disorder]], [[amnesia]], severe [[stammering]], and [[anxiety state]]s — are followed in the course of their medical management. A series of scenes chronicles their entry into the military [[psychiatric hospital]], treatment, and eventual recovery and discharge, all typically in a period of 6 to 8 weeks. Treatments depicted include [[narcosynthesis]], [[hypnosis]], [[group psychotherapy]], [[music therapy]], and [[work therapy]]. The highlighted cases are presented as marked therapeutic successes, accompanied by upbeat [[musical cue]]s, although the narrator cautions after one dramatic recovery that "the neurosis is not cured".&lt;ref name=canby&gt;{{Citation | last = Canby   | first = Vincent   | title = 'Let There Be Light,' John Huston vs. The Army | newspaper = New York Times | date = January 16, 1981 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/16/movies/let-there-be-light-john-huston-vs-the-army.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients, who explain themselves to the doctors on camera at some length, are treated soberly and with dignity, while the therapies are presented in an optimistic and flattering manner. The film ends with a number of the featured patients participating in a ceremony in which they are discharged, not just from the hospital, but from military service, and returned to civilian life.

==Production==
The film was made as one of the early entries in the Army's [[Professional Medical Film]] series, which began in 1945. It was shot during spring 1945 at [[Edgewood State Hospital]], [[Deer Park, New York|Deer Park]], [[Long Island, New York]] which between 1944 and 1946 was part of [[Mason General Hospital]], a psychiatric hospital run by the United States War Department named for an Army doctor and general.

There are no personal credits in the film. Offscreen credits have been compiled by several sources. The film includes scoring by [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]. The cinematography has been credited to [[Stanley Cortez]], John Doran, Lloyd Fromm, Joseph Jackman, and George Smith. The film's editors were [[William H. Reynolds]] and [[Gene Fowler Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Let There Be Light |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |first=David |last=Sterritt |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/297142%7C0/Let-There-Be-Light.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFI&gt;{{AFI film |24480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See 'Film Notes' at: {{cite web |title=Let There Be Light |publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation |url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/preserved-films/screening-room/let-there-be-light-1946 |accessdate=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the film was remade with professional actors and retitled ''Shades of Gray'' ([[professional Medical Film|PMF]] 5047).

==Reception, suppression, and release==
The film was controversial in its portrayal of psychologically traumatized veterans of the war. "Twenty percent of our army casualties", the narrator says, "suffered psychoneurotic symptoms: a sense of impending disaster, hopelessness, fear, and isolation."&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{Citation  | author=[[Michael Kernan]]   | title = War Casualty, John Huston's 1945 Film Now Public  | newspaper = Washington Post | date =  Feb 12, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently due to the potentially demoralizing effects the film might have on post-war recruitment, it was subsequently banned by the Army after its production, although some unofficial copies had been made.  Military police once confiscated a print Huston was about to show friends at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The Army claimed it invaded the privacy of the soldiers involved, and the releases Huston had obtained were lost; the War Department refused to get new ones.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

The film's eventual release in the 1980s by Secretary of the Army [[Clifford Alexander, Jr.]] was attributed to his friend [[Jack Valenti]] who worked to get the ban lifted. The film was screened in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section at the [[1981 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1762/year/1981.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Let There Be Light |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930220536/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1762/year/1981.html |archivedate=2012-09-30 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The copy of the film that was released was poor, with a garbled sound track that "made it almost impossible to understand the whispers and mumbles of soldiers in some scenes.&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;{{cite news |title=John Huston film about WW II soldiers that Army suppressed is restored |first=Steve |last=Vogel |work=The Washington Post |date=May 24, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/john-huston-film-about-ww-ii-soldiers-that-army-suppressed-is-restored/2012/05/23/gJQA7LS3lU_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref name=hollreporter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/empire-strikes-airplane-25-movies-65915|title='Empire Strikes Back,' 'Airplane!' Among 25 Movies Named to National Film Registry|accessdate=28 December 2010 | work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Mike|last=Barnes|date=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] then funded restoration of the print and its soundtrack.  The restored version was released in May, 2012.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simmon&gt;{{cite web |last=Simmon |first=Scott |title=''Let There Be Light'' (1946) and Its Restoration |publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation |url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/LetThereBeLight_ProgramNote.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Archives now sells and rents copies of the film and, as a federal government work, it is in the [[public domain]].

==Legacy==
*[[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s 2012 film ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' borrowed lines and themes from ''Let There Be Light'', which is included as an extra on the [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=10263 |title=The Master BluRay Release Details |work=twcguilds.com |date=January 14, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |postscript=none}}; {{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/i-dont-consider-that-were-dealing-with-a-cult-paul-thomas-anderson-talks-about-the-master-at-tiff-20120909 |title='I Don't Consider That We're Dealing With A Cult' - Paul Thomas Anderson Talks About 'The Master' At TIFF |work=indiewire.com |date=September 9, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine''' (informally the '''LSHTM''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] on [[Keppel Street]], Bloomsbury, [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], the constituent college of the [[University of London]] that specialises in [[public health]] and [[tropical medicine]]. On successful completion of their studies, its students gain a University of London degree.

The institution was founded in 1899 by [[Patrick Manson|Sir Patrick Manson]], after a donation from the [[Parsi|Indian Parsi]] philanthropist [[Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit|B.D. Petit]]. Since its foundation it has become one of the most highly placed institutions in global rankings in the fields of [[public health]] and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/school_tops_research_tables.html|title=School tops research league tables in 2015 Leiden Ranking {{!}} London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine {{!}} LSHTM.|website=www.lshtm.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSHTM's mission is to contribute to the improvement of health worldwide through the pursuit of excellence in research, postgraduate teaching and advanced training in national and international public health and tropical medicine, and through informing policy and practice in these areas. The annual income of the institution for 2016&amp;ndash;17 was £177.7&amp;nbsp;million of which £121.9&amp;nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £176.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="LSHTM Financial Statement 16/17"/&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Seamens Hospital, Royal Albert Dock, London. (3525901692).jpg|right|thumb|The [[Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital]] in the early 20th century.]]
The school was founded in 1899 by [[Sir Patrick Manson]] as the '''[[London]] School of Tropical Medicine''' after the Parsi philanthropist [[Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LxdYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Bomanjee+Dinshaw+Petit++London+School+of+Tropical&amp;dq=Bomanjee+Dinshaw+Petit++London+School+of+Tropical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMIn9z19fLsyAIVkrYeCh240A-Y] Medical Record - Volume 70 by George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman - 1906- Page 26&lt;/ref&gt; made a donation of £6,666. 

It was initially located at the [[Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital]] in the [[London Docklands]].&lt;ref name="ActaTrop2001-Cook"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook GC, Webb AJ | title=The Albert Dock Hospital, London: the original site (in 1899) of Tropical Medicine as a new discipline | journal=Acta Trop | year=2001 | pages=249–55 | volume=79 | issue=3 | pmid=11412810 | doi=10.1016/S0001-706X(01)00127-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just prior to this teaching in tropical medicine had been commenced in 1899 at the Extramural school at Edinburgh and even earlier at London's Livingstone College founded in 1893 by Charles F. Harford-Battersby (1865–1925). Before giving lectures at [[St George's Hospital]], London, in 1895, Livingstone College afforded Manson his first opportunity to teach courses in tropical medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ryan (1910)Colonial Mission and Imperial Tropical Medicine: Livingstone College, London, 1893–1914, Social History of Medicine Volume23, Issue3 Pp. 549–566&lt;/ref&gt; Manson's early career was as a physician in the Far East where he deduced the correct [[etiology]] of [[filariasis]], a parasitic vector based disease, transmitted through the bite of a [[mosquito]]. On his return to London, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the [[Colonial Office]]. He strongly believed that doctors should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain's tropical [[British Empire|empire]]. He also encouraged and mentored [[Ronald Ross]] during this period to uncover the correct etiology of [[malaria]], which Ross subsequently discovered in 1897, winning the [[Nobel Prize]] for his efforts. The original school was established as part of the [[Seamen's Hospital Society]].

In 1902, the benefactor Petit  wrote the following about the institution in a letter to Sir Francis Lovell (Dean of the School), quoted in ''[[The Times]]''. 
{{quote|This institution, whilst according ample scope to students of diseases that well nigh devastate the East, will be the means of bringing the Western and Eastern minds together to afford help to the suffering East, and thus cementing that union of hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper [[The Times]] |articlename=The London School of Tropical Medicine |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=16 September 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36874| }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1920 the school moved, with the [[Hospital for Tropical Diseases]], to [[Endsleigh Gardens]] in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="AIM-Albert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=3973&amp;inst_id=23|title=Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital|publisher=[[AIM25]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine. This enlarged school, now named the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine was granted its [[Royal Charter]] in 1924.

The school moved to its present location in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in 1929.

A competition to design a new school building to be sited in Gower Street, was held involving five architects, all experienced in [[laboratory]] design and construction. This was won in 1925 by Morley Horder and Verner Rees who located the main entrance in Keppel Street. This building was opened in 1929 by HRH the Prince of Wales. The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/building/|title=London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine website, The History of the Building page|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817194602/http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/building/|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
===Faculties===

====Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health====

The Faculty of Epidemiology and [[Population]] Health aims to be a methodological centre of excellence for research in national and global health issues, to expand the limits of epidemiological thinking &amp; multi-disciplinary research to further understanding of health issues in their full complexity, to develop, refine and disseminate tools &amp; methods for research design, data collection, analysis and evaluation, and to conduct rigorous research in national and global health. 

====Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases====
The Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (ITD) was formed in August 1997 and encompasses all of the laboratory-based research in the School as well as that on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infectious and tropical diseases. It is currently headed by Simon Croft, who is Professor of [[Parasitology]]. The Faculty is organised into four large research departments. The range of disciplines represented in the faculty is very broad and inter-disciplinary research is a feature of much of its activity. 

The spectrum of diseases studied is wide and there are major research groups working on topics which include:

*HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
*malaria and other vector borne diseases
*tuberculosis
*vaccine development and evaluation
*vector biology and disease control

There is close interaction between scientists in different research teams. The Faculty has overseas links which provide a basis for field studies and international collaborations in developed and developing countries. Funding for research in the Faculty comes from around 45 funding organisations and agencies.

====Faculty of Public Health and Policy====

The Faculty of Public Health and Policy aims to improve global health through research, teaching and the provision of advice in the areas of health policy, health systems and services, and individual, social and environmental influences on health. Interests and activities embrace the health needs of people living in countries at all levels of development.
The School has the largest numbers of research active staff in the areas of epidemiology, public health and health services research in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;RAE 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The Faculty of Public Health and Policy has over 220 members of staff, including epidemiologists, public health physicians, economists, policy analysts, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, psychologists, statisticians and mathematicians. The Faculty's research programmes, with an annual spend of over £7m, focus on public health problems of importance both globally and in the UK, and build on an extensive network of collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;LSHTM Annual Report 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The research programmes exploit multidisciplinary and multi-method approaches, generate new knowledge for specific contexts and test transferability to different settings, and engage with policymakers and providers of health care to ensure research is relevant and translated into practice.

The Faculty hosts School Centres in the areas of [[Centre for History in Public Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine|History in Public Health]],&lt;ref&gt;Centre for History in Public Health,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, http://history.lshtm.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; Research on Drugs and Health Behaviours, Spatial Analysis in Public Health, Global Change and Health, Health of Societies in Transition (ECOHOST), and Gender Violence and Health. In addition, staff participate in Centres based in other departments, notably the Malaria Centre and the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13572">A '''medical license''' is an [[Occupational licensing|occupational license]] that permits a person to legally practice [[medical doctor|medicine]]. Most nations require such a license, bestowed either by a specified government-approved [[professional association]] or a [[government agency]]. Licenses are not granted automatically to all people with [[medical school|medical degree]]s.  A medical school graduate must receive a license to practice medicine to legally be called a [[physician]]. The process typically requires testing by a medical board.  The medical license is the documentation of authority to practice [[medicine]] within a certain locality.

China issued the &lt;&lt;Law on Licensed Physician&gt;&gt; in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/01/content_18970.htm|title=中华人民共和国执业医师法|author=|date=|website=www.gov.cn|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925052728/http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/01/content_18970.htm|archivedate=25 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires all newly graduated medical students to sit the National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE), regulated by the National Medical Examination Center (NMEC), and then register with the local regulatory body. Eligibility for the exam requires that students complete a one year internship after obtaining a primary medical qualification (i.e., Bachelor of Medicine). The two-part exam includes a Clinical Skill (CS) test and a General Written (GW) test. The CS test consists of many stations, and candidates must pass the CS test to take the GW test. The GW test consists of four papers, and candidates have 2.5 hours to complete each one over two days. The CS is held in July, followed by GW in September each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmec.org.cn/EnglishEdition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528011940/http://www.nmec.org.cn/EnglishEdition.html |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==
The Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior (ICFES) and the Ministry of Education regulate the medical schools that are licensed to offer medical degrees. After completing all the schools' requirements to obtain a medical degree, physicians must serve the "obligatory social service" (in rural areas, research, public health or special populations e.g., orphan children), which usually lasts one year. After completing the social service, a doctor obtains a "medical registration" at the governor's office (Gobernación) of the Department (province/state) where they served the obligatory term. This registration is the same as a license in other countries, and authorizes the physician to practice medicine anywhere in the national territory. However, to practice in other departments requires an inscription from that department. Unlike the US, there is no official licensing exam for medical graduates in Colombia, since this responsibility is delegated to medical schools that have permission to confer medical degrees.

==Germany&lt;!--'Approbation (Germany)'--&gt;==
In Germany, licensing of doctors ("Approbation") is the responsibility of the state governments. Licensed doctors are compulsory members of "Ärztekammern" (literally: "Physician chambers"), which are medical associations organized on state level. Criteria for licensing of doctors are regulated in the ''Approbationsordnung für Ärzte'', which is a piece of federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/_appro_2002/BJNR240500002.html |title=Approbationsordnung für Ärzte (Licensing regulation for physicians) |language=de |website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de |accessdate=19 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220172026/https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/_appro_2002/BJNR240500002.html |archivedate=20 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In India, certification requires that a medical school graduate pass the final MBBS examination and undergo a one year internship in a hospital recognised by the Medical Council of India. Foreign medical graduates must take the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE), conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE). They can practise medicine throughout the country after certifying themselves as per Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. Doctors registered with any one state medical council are automatically included in the Indian Medical Register and  thereby entitled to practise medicine anywhere in India.
The MCI Ethics Committee observed in a meeting held on September 2, 2004 that, "There is no necessity of registration in more than one state medical council because any doctor, who has registered with any state medical council is automatically registered in the Indian Medical Register and also by virtue of Section 27 of the IMC Act, 1956, a person, whose name is included in the IMR, can practise anywhere in India." The Registered Doctors with various State Medical Councils across India up to the year 2015 can be checked in the official website of INDIAN MEDICAL REGISTRY search www.mciindia.org by just typing the name of the doctor.

==UK==
The term "Medical License" is US-centric terminology. In the UK and in other commonwealth countries the analogous instrument is called registration; i.e., being on the register or being/getting struck off (the register). The [[General Medical Council]] is the regulatory body for doctor's licensing in the UK. Currently, there are two types of basic registration: "Provisional Registration" and "Full Registration", and two types of specialty registration: "Specialist Registration" and "GP registration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/information_for_you/registration_factsheet.asp#Types |title=General information about registration and licensing |publisher=[[General Medical Council]] |accessdate=29 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131412253000/http://www.gmc-uk.org/information_for_you/registration_factsheet.asp#Types |archivedate=24 April 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the GMC introduced the "licence to practise", and it is required by law that to practise medicine in the UK, all doctors must be registered and hold a licence to practise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/licensing.asp|title=The licence to practise|website=www.gmc-uk.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131412133500/http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/licensing.asp|archivedate=2018-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registration information for all doctors holding or that have previously held a license in the UK is available online at the GMC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/register/LRMP.asp|title=List of Registered Medical Practitioners|website=www.gmc-uk.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121311222800/http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/register/LRMP.asp|archivedate=2018-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], medical licenses are usually granted by individual states. Only those with medical degrees from schools listed in the [[Avicenna Directories#AVICENNA Directory for medicine|AVICENNA Directory for medicine]] or the [[FAIMER]] [[International Medical Education Directory]] are permitted to apply for medical licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2009ib/ibcert.html#img_define |title=ECFMG 2009 Information Booklet - ECFMG Certification |publisher=Ecfmg.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013212008/http://www.ecfmg.org/2009ib/ibcert.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government does not grant licenses. A physician practicing in a federal facility, federal prison, US Military, and/or an Indian Reservation may have a license from any state, not just the one they are residing in. The practice of "tele-medicine" has made it common for physicians to consult or interpret images and information from a distant location. Some states have special licensure for this. The licensure process for most physicians takes between three and six months, due to the extensive background checks, educational, training, and historical primary source verifications.

== Criticism ==
The enactment of U.S. state medical licensing laws in the late 1800s was for the primary  purpose of reducing competition and allowing physicians to make more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamowy |first1=R. |title=The early development of medical licensing laws in the United States, 1875-1900 |journal=The Journal of Libertarian Studies |date=1979 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=73–119 |pmid=11614768 |issn=0363-2873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The added benefit of public safety made restrictive licensure laws more appealing to both physicians and legislators. Infrequently mentioned in the literature, is that the “public safety” that is created by reducing the number of practitioners only extends to the patients who receive medical care. Thus, the overall effect is more expensive and higher-quality medical care for fewer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camenisch |first1=Paul F. |title=On the matter of good moral character |journal=The Linacre Quarterly |date=NaN |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=273–283 |pmid=11661606 |issn=0024-3639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from 2013 says of the road to licensing in Canada, "The path through immigration, residency training, licensure and employment promises to remain a difficult road to navigate," and emphasizes that the current and future demand for healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell–Page, R. M., Tepper, J., Klei, A. G., Hodges, B., Alsuwaidan, M., Bayoumy, D. H., … Cole, D. C. (2013). Foreign–trained medical professionals: Wanted or not?A case study of Canada. Journal of Global Health, 3(2), 020304. http://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.03.020304&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes that there are a number of barriers that doctors face when it comes to practicing, yet there is a very high demand for doctors.

Beyond the more general criticisms of [[occupational licensing]] that licensing increases costs and fails to improve quality, licensing in the medical profession specifically has been criticized as failing to enforce the standard practices they are charged with enforcing. In 1986, Inspector General at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Health Department]] said that medical boards took "strikingly few disciplinary actions" for physician misconduct.&lt;ref name="usatoday2013"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/20/doctors-licenses-medical-boards/2655513/|title=Thousands of doctors practicing despite errors, misconduct|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011228/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/20/doctors-licenses-medical-boards/2655513/|archivedate=2017-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been a number of cases involving patient deaths where physicians only had their licenses removed years after multiple wrongful patient deaths had happened.&lt;ref name="usatoday2013" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10news.com/news/team-10/critics-complain-the-california-medical-board-takes-too-long-to-discipline-doctors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722071627/http://www.10news.com/news/team-10/critics-complain-the-california-medical-board-takes-too-long-to-discipline-doctors |archivedate=2015-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it has been said that because hospitals have had more legal burden placed on them in recent decades, they have more of an incentive to require that their physicians be competent. Thus, the process whereby physicians are reviewed and licensed by the State medical board results in some duplicate evaluations. The physician is evaluated both in the licensure process and then again by the hospital for the purpose of credentialing and granting hospital privileges.&lt;ref name="indepednent2000"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=266|title=Does Physician Licensing Serve a Useful Purpose? {{!}} Shirley V.

'''Michael Jay Ybarra''' (September 28, 1966 – June 30, 2012) was an American journalist, author and adventurer whose non-fiction work appeared in various national publications. In 2004, his book about [[McCarthyism]], ''Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt'',&lt;ref&gt;Ybarra, Michael J. "''Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and The Great American Communist Hunt'' " (1st ed. Hanover, N.H.: Steerforth Press), pp. 818. {{ISBN|1586420658}}.&lt;/ref&gt; won the [[D.B. Hardeman Prize]]. As the [[extreme sport]]s correspondent for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]],'' Ybarra wrote articles about outdoor adventure, providing the genre with a wider audience than it typically receives.

==Life and career==

Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], Ybarra graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1990 with a B.A. in political science. It was during his undergraduate years at UCLA that he started writing professionally for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', followed by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. During his brief stint at the ''Chicago Tribune'', he interviewed future President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ybarra, Michael J|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-02-07/news/9001110408_1_ann-dunham-chicago-housing-authority-barack-obama |title=Activist In Chicago Now Heads Harvard Law Review |publisher = Chicago Tribune |work=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1990-02-07 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from UCLA, Ybarra moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He left to return to school and graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1992 with an M.A. in political science.

Ybarra had a 25-year career as a journalist and author. An article he wrote for ''The'' ''Washington Post'', "Activists Attest to Romania's Idea of Democracy", was entered into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' at the request of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. His story about [[Hurricane Katrina]] for ''CIO Decisions'' magazine, "The Long Road Back", won a National Azbee Gold Award from the [[American Society of Business Publication Editors]] and a Bronze Tabbie Award for feature article. Ybarra reported on a wide variety of topics and people, including President Obama, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Michael Chabon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ybarra, Michael |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/09/news/cl-33800 |title=The Novelist as Wonder Boy |publisher= Los Angeles Times |work=Articles.latimes.com |date=2000-10-09 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] founder and climber [[Yvon Chouinard]], novelist [[Norman Mailer]],&lt;ref&gt;Ybarra, Michael J.

In the early 1990s, Ybarra began working for ''The'' ''Wall Street Journal'' as a staff reporter in its [[San Francisco]] bureau. It was during this period that he started researching and writing ''Washington Gone Crazy''. The book was published by Steerforth in 2004 to critical acclaim. Author, professor and CBS News commentator [[Douglas Brinkley]] wrote: "Esteemed scholar Michael J. Ybarra's ''Washington Gone Crazy —'' based on extensive new archival research — offers a fair-minded, and ultimately devastating, portrait of Nevada's notorious Cold Warrior. A truly landmark study." It was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://events.latimes.com/bookprizes/press-releases/2005-04-23/ |title=Book Prizes – Los Angeles Times Festival of Books |publisher=Events.latimes.com |date=April 23, 2005 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shortlisted for the [[Ambassador Book Award]] in American Studies, and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' listed it among the 100 Notable Books of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/business/media/michael-j-ybarra-author-and-extreme-sports-reporter-is-dead-at-45.html?_r=0|title=Michael J.

Hardeman Prize for the best book on Congress from the Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/DBHardemanPrize.asp |title=12 millionth visitor expected release |publisher=Lbjlib.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award committee member [[H. W. Brands]], the Dickson, Allen, Anderson Centennial Professor of History at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], said Ybarra's work was "that rare book which has something really new to say on an old subject". A digital version, featuring an introduction by [[Sam Tanenhaus]], a former editor of ''The New York Times Book Review'', is slated to be released in 2015.

While on a trip to [[Peru]] in 2004, Ybarra took his first climbing lessons. He subsequently became an avid climber and adventurer. Ybarra traveled widely, climbing, hiking and kayaking in such places as Nepal, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Switzerland, Italy, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, Alaska, Montana, Utah and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. From 2007 until his death in 2012, he chronicled his adventures for ''The'' ''Wall Street Journal'' as its extreme sports correspondent, publishing more than 30 pieces.

==Death and legacy==

Ybarra was killed on June 30, 2012, in a climbing accident on the Sawtooth Ridge in [[Yosemite National Park]]. Mr. Ybarra’s sister, Suzanne, said the family had reported him missing on Sunday after he did not return from what was supposed to be a two-day solo climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/business/media/michael-j-ybarra-author-and-extreme-sports-reporter-is-dead-at-45.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi | title=Michael J. Ybarra, Author and Extreme-Sports Reporter, Is Dead at 45 | date=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sudden death at the age of 45 was widely covered by the American and British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Nye |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2169372/He-died-doing-loved-Extreme-sports-writer-WSJ-killed-mountain-climbing-trip-Sierra-Nevada.html |title='He died doing what he loved most': Extreme-sports writer for WSJ killed on mountain-climbing trip in Sierra Nevada.|publisher = Mail Online |work=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2012-12-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Ybarra's death, ''The'' ''Wall Street Journal'' released the following statement: "Michael Ybarra was an extraordinary journalist. In the best traditions of his profession he enlightened and engaged readers on a wide array of topics in clear, vivid prose. His passion for the outdoors was evident not only in his writing for the Leisure &amp; Arts and Book sections — reviews and essays written with such verve you felt you were right beside him on a mountain face or in a kayak — but in the way he lived. We mourn his passing, and send our thoughts and prayers to his family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ovide |first=Shira |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303684004577507032803420796 |title=Writer Michael J. Ybarra, 45, Is Killed Near Yosemite |publisher= Wall Street Journal |work=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a writer, he left behind a large body of published work spanning more than two decades. A portion of Ybarra's personal collection of climbing books is housed at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in the Sherman Fairchild Library as "The Michael J. Ybarra Memorial Collection." Bret Israel, Sunday Calendar editor of the ''Los Angeles Times'', established a scholarship at UCLA in Ybarra's memory for humanities students studying abroad. Ybarra's [[Pat McCarran]] memorabilia is available to the public at the Nevada Historical Society in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. His papers for ''Washington Gone Crazy'' are at the [[Hoover Institution]] at Stanford.

'''mPedigree''' refers both to a mobile telephony shortcode platform that interconnects [[GSM]] mobile networks in a number of African and Asian countries to a central registry wherein pedigree information of product brands belonging to participant manufacturers are stored, as well as the organisation that was founded in 2007 to manage and promote this registry to organisations and governments in Africa and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mPedigree.net |title=mPedigree |publisher=mPedigree |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is named the mPedigree Network.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prosecurityzone.com/News/Education__training_and_professional_services/Training_courses__seminars_and_conferences/Mpedigree_and__iwebgate_winners_at_fifth_annual_global_security_challenge_summit_15854.asp#axzz1KUlOKUBR |title=mPedigree and iWebGate winners at Fifth Annual Global Security Challenge Summit (Security Challenge) |publisher=Prosecurityzone.com |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005115256/http://www.prosecurityzone.com/News/Education__training_and_professional_services/Training_courses__seminars_and_conferences/Mpedigree_and__iwebgate_winners_at_fifth_annual_global_security_challenge_summit_15854.asp#axzz1KUlOKUBR |archive-date=5 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroafrica-magazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=191:ghana-mpedigree-uses-sms-to-combat-fake-drugs&amp;catid=78:the-africa-you-never-see-in-western-countries&amp;Itemid=77 |title=Showtime suggests better times ahead |publisher=Euroafrica-magazine.com |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1707667/hp-and-mpedigree-fight-counterfeit-drugs |title=Fighting Counterfeit Drugs With Mobile Technology |publisher=Fast Company |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the mPedigree Network rebranded to 'mPedigree', and begun to trade under that name and a new logo, based on a knight-of-chess motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/01/07/bright-simmons-mpedigree-network-now-mpedigree/ |title=mPedigree Network now mPedigree |publisher=Citifmonline.com |accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpedigree.net/who-we-are/our-brand/ |title=Our Brand - mPedigree |publisher=mPedigree.Net |accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the Nigerian National Agency for Drug Administration &amp; Control ([[NAFDAC]]) reported to an industry publication that its Technical Committee was evaluating the security credentials of the mPedigree system for a possible roll-out in that country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authenticationnews.info&lt;/ref&gt; NAFDAC and the Nigerian pharmaceutical companies formed a consortium in June 2009 to roll the service out for all medicines in Nigeria. By 2014, NAFDAC had renamed this initiative as MAS (Mobile Authentication Service), involving multiple partners, including mPedigree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Balogun |first=Segun |url=http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/Home/5579702-146/pharmaceutical_companies_wary_of_drug_agencys.csp |title=Pharmaceutical companies wary of drug agency’s new tactics |publisher=234next.com |accessdate=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124110917/http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/Home/5579702-146/pharmaceutical_companies_wary_of_drug_agencys.csp |archive-date=24 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news201535471.html |title=Africans text message to check if drugs are real |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassnewspaper.com/~compas/NG/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66464:africa-embraces-text-message-to-check-fake-drugs-&amp;catid=50:business-news&amp;Itemid=708 |title=Nigerian Compass – Politics, Business, Entertainment, Art &amp; Style |publisher=Compassnewspaper.com |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/web3/mobile/business/5643.html |accessdate=20 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Processing-QC/NAFDAC-keen-on-new-SMS-anti-counterfeit-results|title=NAFDAC keen on new SMS anti-counterfeit results|first=|last=in-PharmaTechnologist.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php?id=162221 |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/index.php/about-nafdac/directorates/special-duties/item/244-nafdac-enforcement-of-mobile-authentication-servicemas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20976277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/01/07/bright-simmons-mpedigree-network-now-mpedigree/|title=Bright Simons’ mPedigree Network now mPedigree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Kenyan drug safety regulator announced its support for the mobile telephony anti-counterfeiting system deployed in that country by mPedigree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/business/features/44621-sms-may-finally-beat-counterfeit-drugs- |title=Orange SMS may finally beat counterfeit drugs in Kenya|publisher=[[The Star (Kenya)|Star Kenya]] |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Kenyan agricultural regulator, KEPHIS, announced a partnership with mPedigree to enable the verification of seed quality using mobile phone technologies. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/markets/news/Plant-health-agency-ups-fight-against-fake-seeds/3815534-4093312-ynp0ow/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Manufacturers who sign on to the mPedigree scheme upload pedigree information of each pack of medicine into the central registry using standard mass serialisation methods such as those employed in the RFID-enabled e-pedigree system familiar in the United States and elsewhere.

When consumers buy a product made by a manufacturer participating in the scheme, they are able to query the pedigree information stored in the registry by means of a free SMS message. An automatic response from the registry certifies whether the particular product is truly "from source" or not. The proponents of the scheme believe the system will be effective in the fight against counterfeit medicines in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200806200817.html allAfrica.com: Ghana: Country to Use SMS to Fight Fake Drugs (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 it was reported that Hewlett Packard (HP), Zain Telecommunications, and undisclosed pharmaceutical and other partners had signed up to the mPedigree program with plans to extend the service to multiple countries across Africa. Some West African companies were also reported as using the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_21/b4179037128534.htm |title=Mobile Phones Fight Africa's Drug Wars |work=BusinessWeek  |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601090&amp;sid=a0_anlNoJCgU&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trials ==
The platform has been in testing since 28 January 2008. Media reports in Ghana suggest that monitored trials conducted in the two major cities in the country, [[Accra]] and [[Kumasi]], were largely successful. In a forum convened together with the US-based Partnership for Safe Medicines and the Ghana Food &amp; Drugs Board, the Deputy Chief Executive of the Food &amp; Drugs Board announced that the Ghanaian Authorities were investigating the introduction of the mPedigree platform as a national standard based on the outcomes of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thewhitakergroup.us/uploads/home/pdf/AfricaHealthNewsSeptember-October2008finalversion.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330004014/http://www.thewhitakergroup.us/uploads/home/pdf/AfricaHealthNewsSeptember-October2008finalversion.pdf |archive-date=30 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/health/200803/14868.asp |title=Ghana News :: Technology to detect [[counterfeit |access-date=2 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704202438/http://www.myjoyonline.com/health/200803/14868.asp |archive-date=4 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nigeria Update ==
A new consortium, including mPedigree and other technology companies, was formed by Nigerian regulator NAFDAC to promote the use of mobile medicines authentication technologies in Nigeria, and in July 2014 a deadline for compliance was set for manufacturers of certain categories of medicines.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/regulation/draft-regulations/item/244-nafdac-enforcement-of-mobile-authentication-servicemas |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508102812/http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/regulation/draft-regulations/item/244-nafdac-enforcement-of-mobile-authentication-servicemas |archive-date=8 May 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/regulation/draft-regulations/item/244-nafdac-enforcement-of-mobile-authentication-servicemas|title=NAFDAC Release:: Deadline on MAS Imposed, ::: Release - NAFDAC - NAFDAC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508102812/http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/regulation/draft-regulations/item/244-nafdac-enforcement-of-mobile-authentication-servicemas|archive-date=8 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ghana Update ==
On 21 August 2014, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana announced that it had adopted the mPedigree initiative through its new PREVENT program, thus making the mPedigree solution an industry-wide standard in Ghana. The Pharmaceutical Society's member organization, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Ghana, also announced its embrace of the solution, and mention was made that several member companies of the association had already implemented the mPedigree Goldkeys solution on medicines sold in Ghana. The Ministry of Health of Ghana and the Food &amp; Drugs Authority endorsed the program.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2014/August-22nd/fake-ebola-.php|title=Ghana News - Fake Ebola &amp; Cholera drugs must be prevented with ‘mPedigree’ – PSGH|first=|last=Myjoyonline.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Industries ==
mPedigree's Goldkeys technology is also used in the protection of products from counterfeiting in other industries such as textiles and cosmetics.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2015/0531/Chinese-counterfeits-leave-Ghanaian-textiles-hanging-by-a-thread|title=Chinese counterfeits leave Ghanaian textiles hanging by a thread|date=31 May 2015|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Ugandan standards regulator, the UNBS, announced a partnership with mPedigree, USAID, and others to track seeds and other agro-inputs, and secure them against counterfeiting, using mPedigree's Goldkeys platform, under the KAKASA brand name. Channel 114 was dedicated by the Uganda telecom authorities for this purpose. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pctechmag.com/2015/09/ghanaian-startup-mpedigree-partners-unbs-usaid-for-agricultural-input-e-verification-in-uganda/|title=mPedigree partners with UNBS, USAID for agricultural input e-verification|first=PC Tech|last=Magazine|date=22 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
MPedigree lists as its supporting partners: the [[World Economic Forum]] Technology Pioneers Program, [[Ashoka]], [[Nokia]], and a number of telecoms carriers and pharmaceutical regulators in Ghana, Nigeria, and India.

== Social Marketing ==
In April 2008, mPedigree announced that it had commissioned the first documentary on the [[fake drugs]] phenomenon produced within West Africa by a locally based production House. This documentary was debuted in partnership with the German overseas cultural establishment, the [[Goethe Institut]], and later premiered on Ghanaian television networks, including the national broadcaster, GTV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200804250978.html allAfrica.com: Ghana: Media Launch of Short Film (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Prize for Medicine''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Medicina'''}}) was created in 2001 by the {{ill|Chilean Academy of Medicine|es|Academia Chilena de Medicina}}, the Association of Medical Faculties, the Association of Medical Scientific Societies, and the {{ill|Medical College of Chile|es|Colegio Médico de Chile}}.&lt;ref name=uchile&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.medicina.uchile.cl/facultad/historia/premios-y-distinciones/114163/premio-nacional-de-medicina |title=Premio Nacional de Medicina |trans-title=National Prize for Medicine |publisher=[[University of Chile]] Faculty of Medicine |language=Spanish |access-date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is given to recognize the work of those doctors who have excelled among their peers in the area of clinical or public health and, in addition, have had a prominent role in teaching, academic administration, or research.

The prize consists of a diploma, a commemorative medal, and an amount of money that is contributed by the medical community.

It is awarded every two years.

'''Norman Vaughan Hurry Riches''' (1883-1975) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[cricketer]] who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] from 1921 to 1934.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web |title=Norman Riches |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/4/4608/4608.html |website=CricketArchive |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
[[File:Riches, Norman Vaughan Hurry (1883-1975) 1900 Atheltics.jpg|thumb|left|Norman Riches (back row far left) during the Abingdon School athletics past and present fixture in 1900.]]
The son of C. H. Riches of [[Tredegarville]], [[Cardiff]], Norman Riches joined [[Abingdon School]] from Chard School in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/flipping/SchoolRegister/files/assets/basic-html/index.html#page198|title=Register|publisher=Abingdon School}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a first team member of the football and athletics team and played cricket for the [[List of Old Abingdonians|Old Abingdonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1914_July_V005_N010.pdf#page=9|title=Cricket reports|publisher=The Abingdonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Riches worked as a [[dentist]]. He played cricket as an amateur for [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] from 1901, initially as wicket keeper. His first major innings was against Monmouth at Swansea when he scored 183 in 1904. Apart from two matches for Welsh teams against the touring South Africans in 1912, he played no first-class cricket until Glamorgan's initial season in the County Championship in 1921, when he captained the team, turning 38 during the season. His obituary in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' expressed the opinion that he had "the natural ability, the technique and the temperament" to have become a [[Test cricket|Test]] player, but had lacked the opportunity.&lt;ref name=WCA&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1976, pp. 1101–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riches continued to represent Glamorgan until 1934, and was captain again in 1929. He scored nine [[Century (cricket)|centuries]] in his career and in 1921 was the first Glamorgan batsman to pass a thousand runs in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; He was vice-chairman, trustee and patron of the club from 1934 to 1950. Riches also played for [[Cardiff Cricket Club]] from 1934 to 1947.

In 1923 he played for the Gentlemen in the [[List of Gentlemen v Players matches|Gentlemen v Players match]] on 4 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1923_July_V006_N009.pdf#page=20|title=OA Notes|publisher=The Abingdonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 he played for [[Wales cricket team|Wales]] against [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] in [[Belfast]], scoring 239 not out. As of late 2018 this remains the highest first-class score made in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Walmsley, "First-class records in Afghanistan and Ireland", ''The Cricket Statistician'', Winter 2018, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ireland v Wales 1926 |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1920S/1926/ENG_LOCAL/OTHERS/IRELAND_WALES_26-29JUN1926.html |website=Cricinfo |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21326">'''Nursing in Japan''' did not develop until the end of the nineteenth century. Initially introduced only in [[Tokyo]] in the late 1860s, small schools utilizing Western models were being opened by the late 1880s. In response to disaster relief, the [[Japanese Red Cross]] became an integral part of nursing development. By 1915, nurse registration had been established and public health nurses began working throughout the country. Nursing universities were established in the twentieth century and regulations were passed to develop standards for training and public health.

==History==
[[File:IyoArakinurses1909.jpg|thumb|Nursing educator [[Iyo Araki]], seated at center, and student nurses at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, from a 1909 publication]]
Care of the sick in [[Japan]] was primarily done in the home by untrained family members until the end of the nineteenth century. Nursing first emerged in [[Tokyo]] in 1869, when the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] opened a small school for nurses. Little training was given in how to care for the sick, but students were instructed in hygiene and sanitary conditions for hospitals. In 1883, foreign missionaries opened two small nursing schools, based on Western models to give theoretical training to nurses. Two years later, a doctor opened a school in [[Kyoto]] and the Canadian Episcopal Mission began a school in [[Kobe]].{{sfn|Araki|1928|pp=1003}} The Kyoto school was begun by [[Linda Richards]], who was sent by the [[American Board of Missions]] to organize a training school at the Doshisha Hospital. The first class of four nurses graduated in 1888.{{sfn|Dock|1912|pp=257-258}}

In 1887, the [[Japanese Red Cross]] (JRC) was founded{{sfn|Dock|1912|p=261}} and by 1890 had begun teaching and recruiting nurses for training.{{sfn|Dock|1912|p=264}} Though their nurses were still studying when the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino Japanese War]] broke out, the JRC decided to send trainees to help with relief efforts. From 1894,{{sfn|''Akiruno Central Library''|2007}} JRC Nurses served in numerous conflicts helping with the wounded, including in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1900), the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904),{{sfn|Dock|1912|p=262}} [[World War I]] and the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia]] (1919).{{sfn|International Foreign Students Association|2016}} The JRC Nurses' training program required three years of study with the first year dedicated to theory, including courses on anatomy, bandaging, disinfection, hygiene, instruments, women’s health, obstetrics, as well as basic assistance of surgery and health treatment and the latter two years involved in practical training.{{sfn|Dock|1912|p=263}} Completion of the course required a final examination before diplomas were given and additional six months of training could qualify nurse candidates as head nurses.{{sfn|Dock|1912|p=264}} Because the JRC was under government control, their hospitals spread to all the major cities and a uniformity of training made the organization a leader in nursing development.{{sfn|Araki|1928|p=1004}}

[[Nursing]] was not an established part of [[Japan]]'s [[health care]] system until 1899 with the adoption of the ''Midwives Ordinance''. The ''Registered Nurse Ordinance'' was passed in 1915 which established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over [[Japan]].{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=07}} In the 1920s, the government began investigating the need to increase the educational requirements for nurses. Up to that time, job training was the only requirement and there was no prerequisite for a high school education to enter training at most hospitals. In 1927, [[St. Luke's International Hospital]] became the first college of nursing in the country and based its training program on the one offered at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Araki|1928|p=1004}} The program required students to be graduates of a Government High School, complete three years of standard training, and a fourth year of specialization.{{sfn|Araki|1928|p=1005}}

The first nursing association in Japan was founded in 1929 by [[Take Hagiwara]] as the [[Japanese Nursing Association|Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire]].{{sfn|International Foreign Students Association|2016}} By 1933, the organization had around 1500 members from throughout Japan{{sfn|Takahashi|2004|p=126}} and joined the [[International Council of Nurses]] (ICN).{{sfn|''The British Journal of Nursing''|1936|p=184}} During [[World War II]] the ''Public Health Nurse Ordinance'' (1941) and ''National Medical Care Act'' (1942) were passed and re-affirmed in 1948 with passage of the ''Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses Act''. It established educational requirements, standards and [[Nursing licensure|licensure]].{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=07}} In 1946, the Japanese Nursing Association was created, merging the Japanese Midwife Society, Japanese Public Health Nurses Association and the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire into one umbrella organization.{{sfn|Japanese Nursing Association|2016}}

There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1952 the first university courses on nursing were introduced, 1957 requirements for assistant nurses were introduced, in 1965 regulations were passed for nurses working night-shifts, and throughout the 1990s several legislative acts expanded training and employment protections for nurses.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=07}} In 1992, the ''Law for Securing Nursing Personnel'' created new university programs to address the [[Aging of Japan|aging population of Japan]], establish a critical scientifically based approach to training rather than a pragmatic one, unify training and licensing requirements and overall improve the image of the field.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} In 2009, the ''Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses Act'' was amended allowing those who had graduated from a 4-year college to be eligible to take the nursing examination, revising course requirements, and making newly graduated training mandatory for nursing personnel.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=07}}

==Types of nurses==
Japan recognizes four types of nurses: [[Public Health Nursing|Public Health Nurses]], [[Midwifery|Midwives]], [[Registered Nurse]]s and [[Nursing assistant|Assistant Nurses]].{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=11}}

Public health nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=08}}

Midwife nurses are independent of any organization. A [[midwife]] takes care of a pregnant woman during labor and postpartum. They assist the mother with breastfeeding, caring for the child, and related tasks.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=08}}

Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a dentist, licensed registered nurse or physician.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=08}}

==Nursing education==
Requirements of nursing education in Japan are that candidates have completed twelve years of basic academic study and then three years of basic nursing education. Public health nurses and midwives require a minimum of one additional year of specialized study. After completing their studies, students must pass the national licensing examination and obtain a license from the [[Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] in the case of nurses, or from the prefectural governor, for nurse assistants. Foreign nurses who wish to work in Japan are required to pass the licensing examination and obtain a Japanese nursing license.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=08}}

To become a registered nurse in Japan, candidates must first obtain a high school degree and then either enroll in a nursing university for four years and earn a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN); attend a junior nursing college for three years, earning an [[Associate of Science in Nursing]] (ASN); or study at a nursing training school for three years and obtain a diploma.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=10}} The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) regulates the curriculum of the colleges and universities, while the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare's Division of Nursing regulates nursing diploma programs.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} The two Ministries jointly establish core curriculum, though individual schools may vary on additional requirements. The basic course study must include courses on: anatomy, adult health, basic nursing, children’s health, disease and recovery studies, gerontological nursing, health support and social systems, home care nursing theory, maternity, mental health, nursing integration, psychiatric nursing, scientific thinking and the understanding of humans, life and society. Both theoretical study and clinical practice are required.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=10}}

Upon completion of studies a national examination administered by the Division of Nursing of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare is required. Licenses are issued for the nurse's lifetime and require no renewal{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} or continuing education.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=11}} For nurses who wish to become Public Health Nurses or Midwives, post-graduate studies are required. Colleges, junior colleges, nurse training schools or universities offer courses for the additional training which must be for a minimum of one year. Additionally master's degrees are offered at some universities.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=10}} As of 2010, all nurses are required to complete postgraduate clinical training.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=11}}

===Credentialing===
The certification of nurse specialists is not legally specified in Japan, though the practice is widely accepted. The [[Japanese Nursing Association]] (JNA) certifies nurses in three categories: [[Nurse practitioner|Certified Nurse]], [[Nursing management|Certified Nurse Administrator]] and [[Clinical nurse specialist|Certified Nurse Specialist]].{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=11}} All three levels of certification require that the nurse pass the national nursing examination as well as a certification test administered by the JNA. Certifications must be renewed every five years.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}}

'''Certified Nurses''' (CN) are required to take six months training in [[Oncology nursing|cancer and chemotherapy nursing]], [[Emergency medicine|emergency care]], [[hospice care]], [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care nursing]], [[wound, ostomy, and continence nursing]], and [[Pain management|pain management nursing]],{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} after completion of their basic nursing licensing. As of July 2015, nearly 16,000 CNs were working in Japan in various specialties including cancer care, [[palliative care|chronic care]], dementia nursing, diabetes nursing, dialysis nursing, emergency care, heart care, infection control, infertility nursing, neonatal care, rehabilitative care, respiratory care, and other specialized fields.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}}

'''Certified Nurse Administrators''' (CNA) are required to complete a master’s program in management at a graduate school or university or a certification from a nurses training education program.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}}

'''Certified Nurse Specialists''' (CNS) are required to complete a master’s program for specialized fields, including Cancer Nursing, Child Health Nursing, Chronic Care Nursing, Community Health Nursing, Critical Care Nursing, Family Health Nursing, Gerontological Nursing, Home Care Nursing, Infection Control Nursing, Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing or Women's Health Nursing, after obtaining their national licensing.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}} In addition, certification requires a minimum of five years clinical experience.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}}

Other professional groups also provide certification for clinical specialties such as community health, diabetes, disaster nursing, emergency nursing, intractable illness, nursing administration, and psychiatric nursing. These organizations predominantly emerged in the 1990s. They include the '''Japan Visiting Nursing Foundation''', which was founded in 1994 to create and improve home care services for the elderly; the '''Japanese Family Nursing Society''', which emerged in 1994 to focus on the education, practices and development of theory for family nurse practitioners; the '''Japanese Nursing Diagnosis Association''' and the '''Japan Society of Nursing Diagnosis''' focus on nursing diagnosis. Additional professional organizations include the '''Federation of Nursing Colleges and Association of Nurses''', the '''International Nursing Foundation of Japan''', the '''Japanese Midwives Association''', and the '''Japanese Society of Nursing Research'''.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}}

===Nurse practitioners===
Until 2015,{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}} nurses in Japan were required to work under the guidance of physicians. They were not allowed to diagnose conditions or prescribe medications without a doctor's directive. Socio-cultural custom giving doctors higher perceived social status and nurses the role of caretaker, led to nurses' lack of autonomy.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} In October 2015, the Act on Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses was amended to allow nurses who had received specific training to act as [[nurse practitioner]]s and intervene in certain situations without awaiting a physician's decision.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=12}}

The training curricula requires completion of 315 study hours of common subjects and 15 to 72 study hours of subjects for specified categories of medicine. Participants must attend both lectures and participate in practical applications. Upon completion of the coursework, applicants must receive a certificate of completion. They may then perform specific medical interventions based upon those described in procedure manuals prepared by physicians.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=13}}

== Current state ==
There is currently a shortage of nurses in Japan, in part due to the [[Aging of Japan|expanding population of elderly]].  Other reasons for the deficit in nursing applicants are poor working conditions, an increase in assigned workloads, the low social status of nurses, and the cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}}  On average, Japanese nurses will make around 280,000 [[yen]] a month.{{sfn|World Salaries|2008}} Until 2000, nurses made up about 4.5% of the women's work force in Japan with almost two-thirds having nursing diplomas and only one percent having a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|BSN degree]]. The majority of nurses were female with only around three percent of the field being male.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}} The largest segment of nurses are in their 30s and 40s with the average age being 41 in 2016 and hospitals are the major employer (61%) of nursing staff, followed by private clinics (21%).{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=14}}

After 1992, Nurse Centers were created in each prefecture by the ''Act on Assurance of Work Forces of Nurses and Other Medical Experts''. These Centers provide placement, job training and recertification, if desired. They monitor nurses who are unemployed and support those who may wish to re-enter the work force.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=14}} The most common reason for nurses to leave the work force is to raise a family, though heavy responsibilities, irregular shift work, long working hours, night shift duty, and poor working conditions/treatment accounted for part of the turnover. Government programs to improve working environments have been on-going since 2011.{{sfn|"Nursing in Japan"|2016|p=15}}

One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union, which was created in 1957.  It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the creation of the ''Nursing Human Resource Law''.{{sfn|Primomo|2000}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">The '''Ontario Health Coalition (OHC)''' is an organization in [[Ontario]] that advocates publicly funded health care. The OHC authors and releases research reports related to health care provision issues and opposing [[privatization]] of health care. The organization is made up of an advocacy  network of over 400 grassroots community organizations representing virtually all areas of the province that lobbies for its goals through rallies and lobbying.

The Ontario Health Coalition supports preserving Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system and the overall goal and policy of  [[universal health care|universal public health care]].

In January 2018, the OHC released a report that due to underfunding, hospitals are operating above their capacity resulting in higher infection rates and waiting times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/hospital-overcrowding-windsor-crisis-1.4503107|title=Overcrowding due to flu surge preventable with better planning, says Windsor Regional Hospital CEO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/hoskins-hospital-bed-funding-announcement-1.4516510|title=Ontario pledges $187M to ease hospital crowding next year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the OHC conducted a series of 14 public hearings across the province in order to gather personal testimony regarding hospital care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3819197/ontario-health-coalition-brings-hospital-hearings-to-hamilton/|title=Ontario Health Coalition brings hospital hearings to Hamilton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, the organization conducted a cross-province tour against for-profit medical clinics conducting [[MRI]]s and other diagnostic tests as well as [[cataract]] and other minor surgical procedures claiming that this is s form of privatization that undermines the public health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3489742/ontario-health-coalition-launches-tour-railing-against-privatization/|title=Ontario Health Coalition launches tour railing against privatization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Health Coalition has more than 400 member organizations as well as a network of Local Health Coalitions and individual members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca/index.php/about-us/mission-mandate/|title=Mission + Mandate - Ontario Health Coalition|website=www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario Health Coalition is affiliated to the [[Canadian Health Coalition]] and provides provincial coordination of community-based health coalitions.

==Early life and education==
Pronovost grew up in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]].  His parents were an elementary school teacher and a math professor.  He received his B.S. from [[Fairfield University]], M.D. from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and Ph.D. from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]].&lt;ref name="NYer"/&gt; In his Ph.D. thesis at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, he documented that in intensive-care units in Maryland, an intensive care specialist on the staff reduced death rates by a third.

In 2003 he founded the Quality and Safety Research Group.  He has published over 200 articles and chapters on patient safety and advises the [[World Health Organization]] on improving patient safety measurement through WHO's World Alliance for Patient Safety.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

He started studying hospital-acquired infections in 2001, concluding that a simple 5 item check-list protocol would greatly reduce infections when inserting a [[central venous catheter]];&lt;ref name="NYTimesA"&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Brody
  | first = Jane E.
  | title = A Basic Hospital To-Do List Saves Lives
  | work =[[The New York Times]]

  | accessdate = 2009-01-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors should: 
# Wash their hands with soap.
# Clean the patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic.
# Put sterile drapes over the entire patient.
# Wear a sterile mask, hat, gown and gloves.
# Put a sterile dressing over the catheter site.

In the Keystone Initiative, a 2003 study by a collection of Michigan hospitals and health organizations, the median rate of infections at a typical ICU dropped from 2.7 per 1,000 patients to zero after three months.&lt;ref name="Beaumont"&gt;{{citation 
  | title = Keystone Initiavites
  | url = http://www.beaumont.edu/quality/keystone-initiatives
  | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keystone Initiative published its results in the December, 2006 ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
   |vauthors=Pronovost P, Needham D, Berenholtz S, etal | title = An intervention to decrease catheter-related bloodstream infections in the ICU
  | journal = N. Engl. J. Med.
  | volume = 355
  | issue = 26
  | pages = 2725–32
  |date=December 2006
  | pmid = 17192537
  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa061115
  | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/26/2725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first three months of the project, the infection rate in Michigan’s ICUs decreased by sixty-six per cent. In the Initiative’s first eighteen months, they estimated that 1500 lives and $100 million were saved. These results were sustained for almost four years.&lt;ref name="NYer"/&gt;

Several reasons may explain why a simple checklist protocol is not more widely adapted:&lt;ref name="BWeek"&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Goldsmith
  | first = Marshall
  | title = Preparing Your Professional Checklist
  | work = [[Business Week]]
  | publisher =
  | date = 2008-01-15
  | url = http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-01-15/preparing-your-professional-checklistbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice
  | accessdate = 2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many physicians do not like being monitored by nurses or otherwise being forced to follow a checklist;
*A wish to avoid standardized tasks and bureaucracy; and
*A focus by researchers on "more exciting" issues such as disease biology and new treatment therapies.

According to Pronovost,&lt;ref name="NYer"/&gt;
:The fundamental problem with the quality of American medicine is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.

===Recent work===
In 2013, Pronovost co-founded Doctella, a startup that provides surgical checklists for patients to improve patient engagement, patient safety, and lead to better health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctella.com Doctella.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, Pronovost advocated for a system of alcohol and drug testing for doctors in a Journal of the American Medical Association article.&lt;ref name="jamawhama"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuong Pham|first1=Julius|last2=Pronovost|first2=Peter J.|last3=Skipper|first3=Gregory E|title=Identification of Physician Impairment|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=May 22, 2013|volume=309|issue=20|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.4635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbj"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gantz|first1=Sarah|title=Johns Hopkins researchers say drug testing needed for doctors|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2013/05/07/johns-hopkins-researchers-say-drug.html|publisher=Baltimore Business Journal|accessdate=April 9, 2016|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has participated in an online course, or [[MOOC]], from Johns Hopkins provided via [[Coursera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Safety in Healthcare|url=https://www.coursera.org/course/healthcaresafety|website=Coursera|publisher=Johns Hopkins School of Nursing|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, he announced that he would be taking a position at United HealthCare. Shortly after taking the position he was promoted to Chief Medical Officer. Within weeks of taking this position, his departure from the position and the company was confirmed, although no reason was given.

==Honors==
In 2008, he was named in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine's [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]], and was also named a [[MacArthur Fellow]].&lt;ref name="NYer"/&gt; In 2011, Pronovost was recognized for his outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service with election to membership in the [[Institute of Medicine]], one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newswise.com/articles/johns-hopkins-scientists-elected-into-institute-of-medicine Johns Hopkins Scientists Elected Into Institute of Medicine]". [[Newswise]], accessed October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2013, he was named a Gilman Scholar at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name="HUB"&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Medicine's Nathans, Pronovost named Gilman Scholars|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2013/03/28/gilman-scholars-nathans-pronovost|work=HUB|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=March 29, 2014|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Peter Pronovost has two children, Ethan and Emma Pronovost. His wife, Marlene, is a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins.

The '''Philippine Physician Licensure Examination''', also called '''Philippine Medical Boards''', is the professional licensure examination for incoming physicians in the Philippines, exclusively administered twice a year by the [[Professional Regulation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPUBLIC ACT No. 2382|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1959/ra_2382_1959.html|website=Lawphil Project|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission requirements==
According to Article III, Section 9 of Republic Act 2382, also known as the ''Medical Act of 1959'', a board examinee must meet the following qualifications:
*is a holder of the degree of Doctor of Medicine or its equivalent.
*is a holder of a valid Certificate of Registration duly issued to him by the Board of Medical Examiners
*is a citizen of the Philippines or a citizen of any foreign country who has submitted competent and conclusive documentary evidence, confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs showing that his country's existing laws permit citizens of the Philippines to practice medicine under the same rules and regulations governing citizens thereof.
*of good moral character (usually with a certificate from the dean of medical school or an immediate superior at work).
*has no charges involving moral turpitude have been filed against the candidate or are pending in any court in the Philippines.

===Boards review programs===
After graduating from medical school, candidates who meet all the admission requirements usually enroll in special review classes held from May to July in medical schools, colleges, universities, and review centers.

Program schedule, content, and delivery differs from one review program to another. In these programs, lecturers, called medical board reviewers, are usually full-time professors and part-time professorial lecturers in medical schools and universities.

The review center with the highest number of enrollees is '''Topnotch Medical Board Prep'''. Other review centers in the country include '''Cracking D' Boards''', '''Medprime''' and '''Brains Medical Boards Review Center'''. Only Cracking D' Boards holds review classes both in Cebu and Manila, with Medprime in Baguio City.

The Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, Ateneo de Zamboanga University, De La Salle University College of Medicine, Fatima College of Medicine, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, University of Santo Tomas, University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center, and University of the Philippines offer review classes for their respective graduates.

===Coverage===
During the entirety of the examination, the following topics are included, pursuant to Section 6:

*'''First Day'''
** Biochemistry (8:00 AM–10:00 AM)
** Anatomy and Histology (11:00 AM–2:00 PM)
** Microbiology (2:00 PM–4:00 PM)
*'''Second Day'''
** Physiology(8:00 AM–10:00 AM)
** Legal Medicine, Ethics, and Medical Jurisprudence (11:00 AM–2:00 PM)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11459">The field of '''population informatics''' is the systematic study of populations via secondary analysis of massive data collections (termed "[[big data]]") about people.  Scientists in the field refer to this massive data collection as the [[social genome]], denoting the collective [[digital footprint]] of our society.  Population informatics applies [[data science]] to social genome data to answer fundamental questions about human society and population health much like [[bioinformatics]] applies data science to [[human genome]] data to answer questions about individual health. It is an emerging research area at the intersection of SBEH (Social, Behavioral, Economic, &amp; Health) sciences, computer science, and statistics in which quantitative methods and computational tools are used to answer fundamental questions about our society.

== Introduction ==

=== History ===
The term was first used in August 2012 when the [http://research.tamhsc.edu/pinformatics/about-us/#history Population Informatics Research Group] was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The term was first defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Privacy-by-Design: Understanding Data Access Models for Secondary Data|journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings AMIA Summit on Translational Science|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2153-4063|pmc = 3845756|pmid = 24303251|pages = 126–130|volume = 2013|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = Stanley|last2 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated on in another article in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Genome: Putting Big Data to Work for Population Informatics|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678338&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fiel7%252F2%252F5306045%252F06678338.pdf%253Farnumber%253D6678338|journal = Computer|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 56–63|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/MC.2013.405|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = A.|last2 = Krishnamurthy|first3 = A.|last3 = Machanavajjhala|first4 = S.C.|last4 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [http://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in August 2015.

=== Goals ===
To study social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences using the massive data collections, aka [[social genome]] data, about people.  The primary goal of population informatics is to increase the understanding of social processes by developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to the [[social genome]] data.

Some of the important sub-disciplines are :
* [[Business analytics]]
* [[Social computing]]: social network data analysis
* Policy informatics
* [[Public health informatics]] 
* [[Computational journalism]]
* [[Computational transportation science]]
* [[Computational epidemiology]]
* [[Computational economics]]
* [[Computational sociology]]
* [[Computational social science]]

=== Approaches ===
[[Record linkage|Record Linkage]], the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources, is a major activity in the population informatics field because most of the digital traces about people are fragmented in many heterogeneous databases that need to be linked before analysis can be done.

Once relevant datasets are linked, the next task is usually to develop valid meaningful measures  to answer the research question.  Often developing measures involves iterating between inductive and deductive approaches with the data and research question until usable measures are developed because the data were collected for other purposes with no intended use to answer the question at hand.  Developing meaningful and useful measures from existing data is a major challenge in many research projects.  In computation fields, these measures are often called features.

Finally, with the datasets linked and required measures developed, the analytic dataset is ready for analysis.  Common analysis methods include traditional hypothesis driven research as well more inductive approaches such as [[data science]] and [[predictive analytics]].

=== Relation to other fields ===
[[Computational social science]] refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include [[computational economics]] and [[computational sociology]].  The seminal article on computational social science is by Lazer et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|journal = Science |date = 2009-02-06|issn = 0036-8075|pmc = 2745217|pmid = 19197046|pages = 721–723|volume = 323|issue = 5915|doi = 10.1126/science.1167742|first = David|last = Lazer|first2 = Alex (Sandy)|last2 = Pentland|first3 = Lada|last3 = Adamic|first4 = Sinan|last4 = Aral|first5 = Albert Laszlo|last5 = Barabasi|first6 = Devon|last6 = Brewer|first7 = Nicholas|last7 = Christakis|first8 = Noshir|last8 = Contractor|first9 = James|last9 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a summary of a workshop held at Harvard with the same title.  However, the article does not define the term computational social science precisely.

In general, computational social science is a broader field and encompasses population informatics.  Besides population informatics, it also includes complex [[simulation]]s of social phenomena.  Often complex simulation models use results from population informatics to configure with real world parameters.

Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) is another similar field coming about.  But again, DSSG is a bigger field applying data science to any social problem that includes study of human populations but also many problems that do not use any data about people.

Population reconstruction is the multi-disciplinary field to reconstruct specific (historical) populations by linking data from diverse sources, leading to rich novel resources for study by social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Population Reconstruction - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|last = Bloothooft|first = G.|last2 = Christen|first2 = P.|last3 = Mandemakers|first3 = K.|last4 = Schraagen|first4 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related groups and workshops ===
The first [https://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. The workshop brought together computer science researchers, as well as public health practitioners and researchers.  This Wikipedia page started at the workshop.

The [http://www.ipdln.org/ International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN)] facilitates communication between centres that specialize in data linkage and users of the linked data. The producers and users alike are committed to the systematic application of data linkage to produce community benefit in the population and health-related domains.

=== Challenges ===
Three major challenges specific to population informatics are: 
# Preserving privacy of the subjects of the data – due to increasing concerns of privacy and confidentiality sharing or exchanging sensitive data about the subjects across different organizations is often not allowed. Therefore, population informatics need to be applied on encrypted data or in a privacy-preserving setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinusha Vatsalan, Peter Christen, and Vassilios S.

# Scalability – databases are continuously growing in size which makes population informatics computationally expensive in terms of the size and number of data sources.&lt;ref&gt;Thilina Ranbaduge, Dinusha Vatsalan, and Peter Christen.

'''''Project Happiness''''' is a 2011 documentary film created, narrated, and produced by Randy Taran and directed by John Sorenson. The documentary follows students on three continents as they search for the meaning of "lasting happiness".

==Background==
''Project Happiness'' started as personal story. The film came into being after creator Randy Taran discovered that her daughter was stressed, saying "I want to be happy, I just don't know how". Randy, after speaking with experts, discovered that this situation was more widespread than she had known.

Determined to find a way for her and other parents to speak to their children about happiness, she decided to make a film to educate and initiate the conversation for youth, families and the communities to which they belong.&lt;ref name="Project Happiness, official site"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Project Happiness
  | url = http://www.projecthappiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film context==
The film connects students from three continents – North America, Africa and Asia – and throughout their senior year, they students discuss amongst themselves with several notable individuals one central question: "What brings lasting happiness?" During the filming, the students involved conducted interviews with scientists, celebrities, and world political and spiritual leaders including [[Richard Gere]], Dr. [[Richard Davidson]], [[Adam Yauch]], the late [[Nirmala Deshpande]], Dr. [[A.P.J Abdul Kalam]], [[George Lucas]], and Tenzin Gyatso, the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1972">'''Raymond T Carhart''' was a [[Speech/Language Pathologist]]. As a founder and pioneer of the science, he is frequently referred to as the "Father of Audiology."
Carhart was born on March 28, 1912, in [[Mexico City]]. He studied at [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] (BA in Speech and Psychology, 1932), and at [[Northwestern University]] (MA, 1934, and PhD, 1936, in [[Speech and language pathology|Speech Pathology]], Experimental [[Phonetics]] and [[Psychology]]).
He remained at Northwestern until 1944, first as Instructor in Speech Re-education and later as Assistant (1940) and Associate (1943) Professor.

The [[standard of living]] in the United States is high by the standards that most economists use, and for many decades throughout the 20th century, the United States was recognized as having the highest standard of living in the world. [[Personal income in the United States|Per capita income]] is high but also less evenly distributed than in most other developed countries; as a result, the United States fares particularly well in measures of average material well being that do not place weight on equality aspects.

==Measures==
In the United Nations [[Human Development Index]], which measures health, education, and per capita income levels, the United States is relatively high, currently ranking 8th. However, the Human Development Index is not considered a measure of living standards, but a measure of ''potential'' living standards were there no inequality: rather, the [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|inequality-adjusted Human Development Index]] is considered the actual level of human development, taking inequality into account. On the inequality-adjusted HDI, the United States ranked 27th in 2014, tied with [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/IHDI|title=- Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ''[[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]]'' [[Where-to-be-born Index]], which takes into account material well-being as measured by [[GDP per capita]], life expectancy, political stability, the quality of family life based on divorce rates, community life, crime and terrorism rates, gender equality, the quality of governance, climate, and unemployment rates, ranked the United States at 16th place, tied with [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/01/daily-chart|title=Birth right|website=Economist.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OECD Better Life Index]], which measures quality of life according to 11 factors, ranks the United States as 7th among 34 OECD countries.

The homeownership rate is relatively high compared to other post-industrial nations. In 2005, 69% of Americans resided in their own homes, roughly the same percentage as in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Israel and Canada.&lt;ref name = "EU homeownership rates, 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Percentage of those residing in owned dwellings, Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/expenditure_survey05/pdf/t16.pdf|title=OWNED DWELLINGS, Israel|website=Cbs.gov.il|accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Percentage of those residing in owned dwellings, Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtcpages/20050310_canmarket.htm|title=Home Ownership Rate Soars in Canada|website=Realtytimes.com|accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Americans enjoyed more cars and radios per capita than any other nation&lt;ref name="Median radios per capita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_rad_percap-media-radios-per-capita|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222160715/http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_rad_percap-media-radios-per-capita|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 22, 2006|title=Median radios per capita|accessdate=February 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more televisions and personal computers per capita than any other nation with more than 200 million people.&lt;ref name="Median TVs per capita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_tel_percap-media-televisions-per-capita|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223082414/http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_tel_percap-media-televisions-per-capita|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 23, 2006|title=Median TVs per capita|accessdate=February 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Median PCs per capita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_per_com_percap-media-personal-computers-per-capita|title=Median PCs per capita|website=Nationmaster.com|accessdate=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing over the past==
In colonial America, the standard of living was high by 18th century standards. Americans could choose their diet from a diverse range of plants and animals from Europe and the Western Hemisphere, and this, combined with favorable weather conditions, ensured that Americans never had to deal with harvest failures. There was little exposure to epidemic diseases, and low wealth inequality, ensuring that even the poor were well-fed.

Historians have used height to measure living standards during this time as average adult heights can point to a population's net nutrition - the amount of nutrition people grew up with as compared to biological stress which can cause lower heights in adulthood, stemming from things like food deprivation, hard work, and disease. According to military records of American and European men, Americans were on average two to three inches taller than Europeans.

Average heights showed little change until the second quarter of the 19th century, with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The growth of canals, steamboats, and railways, as well as the public school system, mass immigration, and urbanization, increased exposure to diseases. Food prices rose in the 1830s, and industrialization brought along with it growing wealth inequality and business depressions that further worsened the situations of the poor. As a result, average stature and life expectancy declined, and only rebounded from 1910 to 1950, as incomes rose, urban conditions became less crowded, and public health measures were put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/a-history-of-the-standard-of-living-in-the-united-states/|title=A History of the Standard of Living in the United States|website=eh.net|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s up until 1980, the average American after-tax income adjusted for inflation tripled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfAcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ymcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6329,5670610&amp;dq=american+standard+of+living+1969&amp;hl=en|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, median family incomes increased by over 33%, while per capita expenditures on recreation and meals grew by over 40%. From 1959 to 1969, median family income (in 1984 dollars) increased from $19,300 to $26,700.&lt;ref&gt;Dollars and Dreams: The Changing American Income Distribution by Frank Levy&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, 79.6% of all households owned at least one car, 82.6% owned a refrigerator or freezer, 79% owned a black and white television set, 31.9% owned a color television set, and 70% owned a washing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTDD84r4NlYC&amp;pg=PA51|title=Conquest of Poverty, The|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leisure time also increased. By 1970, it was estimated that the average workingman in America had 140 days off work each year.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Book of the Year 1971, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., William Benton (Publisher)&lt;/ref&gt; US work hours fell by 10.7% between 1950 and 1979, though the decline was still around half that of Western Europe.

In 1980, the American standard of living was the highest among the industrial countries, according to the [[OECD]]. Out of the 85 million households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters, 55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% had more than one vehicle. In terms of possession of telephones, TV sets, school enrollments, animal protein in diets, and energy consumption, the United States was far ahead of other industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/20/business/us-living-standard-found-highest.html|title=U.S. LIVING STANDARD FOUND HIGHEST|first1=Steven|last1=Rattner|first2=Special to the New York|last2=Times|date=April 20, 1982|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy and middle class and a majority of poor Americans had higher after-tax incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/this-simple-table-summarizes-our-story-on-american-living-standards.html|title=This simple table summarizes our story on American living standards.|first1=David|last1=Leonhardt|first2=Kevin|last2=Quealy|date=April 22, 2014|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among industrialized countries.

In the 1990s, the average American standard of living was regarded as amongst the highest in the world, and middle class and poor Americans were still, on average, richer than their counterparts in almost all other countries, though the gap with some European countries had noticeably narrowed.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ExTFM-jr0NEC&amp;pg=PA472]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217073529/https://books.google.com/books?id=ExTFM-jr0NEC&amp;pg=PA472&amp;lpg=PA472&amp;dq=american+standard+of+living+highest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5hZ3DgSCq&amp;sig=-0jUjn21bDQGCWxQTGvUG6fC6PA&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20standard%20of%20living%20highest&amp;f=false |date=December 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has one of the widest rich-poor gaps of any high-income nation today, and that gap continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Rich-Poor Gap Widening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/82|title=Rich-Poor Gap Widening|website=Worldwatch.org|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent economists have warned that the widening rich-poor gap in the U.S. population is a problem that could undermine and destabilize the country's economy and [[standard of living]]. In 2006, [[Alan Greenspan]] wrote that "The income gap between the rich and the rest of the US population has become so wide, and is growing so fast, that it might eventually threaten the stability of democratic capitalism itself".&lt;ref name="Rich-poor gap gaining attention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0614/p01s03-usec.html|title=Rich-poor gap gaining attention|website=Csmonitor.com|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[George Friedman]], the head of [[Stratfor]], wrote that the middle class' standard of living was declining, and that "If we move to a system where half of the country is either stagnant or losing ground while the other half is surging, the social fabric of the United States is at risk, and with it the massive global power the United States has accumulated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/crisis-middle-class-and-american-power|title=The Crisis of the Middle Class and American Power|website=Stratfor.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a report was done that showed that 71 percent of all workers in America made less than $50,000 in 2014. For a family of four to live a middle class lifestyle, it was estimated that they would need $50,000 a year. For workers that make less than that, their standard of living is lacking.{{Better source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Michael|title=Goodbye Middle Class|url=http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/goodbye-middle-class-51-percent-of-all-american-workers-make-less-than-30000-dollars-a-year.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 1971, the middle income was above 50% of the population in the U.S.  In 2015, the middle class income consisted of 49.9% of the population. The  middle class continues to shrink and standard of living continues to decrease.

[[File:Testicular microlithiasis.jpg|thumb|testicular microlithiasis on ultrasound]]
'''Testicular microlithiasis''' is an unusual condition diagnosed on testicular ultrasound. It is found in between 1.5 to 5% of normal males, and may be found in up to 20% of individuals with subfertility. It is an asymptomatic, non-progressive disease. The cause is unknown, but this condition has been associated with [[testicular cancer]] in a small group of individuals, [[cryptorchidism]], [[mumps]], infertility and intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia. Classic testicular microlithiasis is defined as five or more echogenic foci per view in either or both testes, and limited testicular microlithiasis defined as one or more echogenic foci that do not satisfy the criteria for classic testicular microlithiasis. In 80% of cases, both testicles are affected.

Testicular microlithiasis is not associated with risk of testicular cancer in asymptomatic individuals with no risk factors for testicular germ cell tumor. However, a large [[meta-analysis]] has shown that in individuals with associated risk factors for testicular [[germ cell tumor]], the increase in risk of concurrent diagnosis of testicular germ cell tumor, or testicular carcinoma-in-situ upon biopsy is approximately eight to ten-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=IB |author2=Ang, KK |author3=Ching, BC |author4=Mohan, C |author5=Toh, CK |author6=Tan, MH|title=Testicular microlithiasis predicts concurrent testicular germ cell tumors and intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type in adults: a meta-analysis and systematic review.|journal=Cancer|date=2010-10-01|volume=116|issue=19|pages=4520–32|pmid=20578177|doi=10.1002/cncr.25231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is extensive controversy over whether testicular microlithiasis in individuals with testicular germ cell tumor, or risk factors for such, should undergo testicular biopsy to exclude the presence of testicular carcinoma-in-situ, also known as intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type. Additionally, whether the presence of testicular microlithiasis should influence decision for [[adjuvant chemotherapy]] or surveillance in individuals with testicular germ cell tumor remains unclear. A recent review in Nature Reviews Urology has comprehensively evaluated these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nrurol/journal/v8/n3/full/nrurol.2011.1.html | title=Testicular microlithiasis: recent advances in understanding and management | accessdate=March 16, 2011 | volume=8|doi=10.1038/nrurol.2011.1 | journal=Nature Reviews Urology | pages=153–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no cure or treatment for testicular microlithiasis, however, patients may be monitored via ultrasound to make sure that other conditions do not develop. Emphasis on testicular examination is the recommended follow up for asymptomatic men incidentally identified with testicular microlithiasis. For men with risk factors for testicular germ cell tumor such as [[subfertility]] however, individualized discussion with their urologists is necessary.

'''Theiler's disease''', also known as idiopathic acute hepatitis disease (IAHD), serum-associated hepatitis, serum sickness, and postvaccinal hepatitis, is a viral [[hepatitis]] that affects [[horse]]s. It is one of the most common cause of acute hepatitis and liver failure in the horse.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
There is a rapid onset of clinical signs over the period of 2–7 days, beginning with [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], lethargy, and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] ([[jaundice|icterus]] and discolored urine). Signs of [[hepatic encephalopathy]] (ataxia, blindness, aggression, and coma) and fever can also occur.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orsini, James and Thomas Divers.|title=Equine Emergencies|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|location=St. Louis, MO|isbn=978-1-4557-0892-5|pages=269–270|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other signs include [[photodermatitis]], [[hemorrhagic diathesis]], dependent [[edema]], and [[horse colic|colic]]. The reason for colic is unknown, but is thought to be due to rapid decrease in the size of the liver, and the increased risk of [[horse colic#types#gastric impaction|gastric impaction]].&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Rarely, weight loss can occur.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt;

==Cause==
The most current theory is a result of a recent study that suggests it is caused by a [[pegivirus]], referred to as [[Theiler's disease-associated virus]] (TDAV).&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"&gt;Chandriani S, Skewes-Cox P, Zhong W, Ganem DE, Divers TJ, Van Blaricum AJ, Tennant BC, Kistler AL (2013) Identification of a previously undescribed divergent virus from the Flaviviridae family in an outbreak of equine serum hepatitis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(15):E1407-15. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1219217110&lt;/ref&gt; Eight horses that had received prophylactic botulinum antitoxin and developed subsequent signs of Theiler's disease were subjected to a test for a viral infection based on RNA sequencing techniques. When TDAV was found, the original source of virus (the antitoxin) was injected into 4 additional healthy horses, with one displaying increased liver enzymes and all 4 having increased levels of TDAV, showing that the virus can be spread by inoculation. Measuring levels of virus in the originally infected horses has shown that the disease can become chronic, with some horses displaying low virus levels one year after initial infection. All horses that were initially negative remained so, suggesting that the virus is poorly transmitted horizontally.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature2013&gt;{{cite news|work=Nature|author=[[Ed Yong]]|date=18 March 2013|accessdate=11 February 2015|title=Distinctive virus behind mystery horse disease|url=http://www.nature.com/news/distinctive-virus-behind-mystery-horse-disease-1.12624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all horses that tested positive for this virus showed clinical signs, so additional causative factors such as immune mediated hypersensitivity or co-infections with other agents may be required to produce disease.

==Diagnosis==
At present this can only be made definitively by liver biopsy or post mortem examination.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; Given the isolation of a causative virus it should soon be possible to diagnose this by serology, polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. On necropsy, the liver will be small, flaccid, and "dish-rag" in appearance. It has a mottled and bile stained surface. On microscopy there is marked centrilobular to midzonal hepatocellular necrosis and a mild to moderate mononuclear infiltrate. Mild to moderate bile duct proliferation may also be present. On radiology, the [[liver]] may be shrunken and difficult to visualize on [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Ascites may be present.

===Lab tests===
The most characteristic feature are elevated levels of [[gamma glutamyl transferase]] (100–300 IU/L),&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; [[aspartate transaminase]] (&gt;1000 IU/L)&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; and [[sorbitol dehydrogenase]], with AST levels &gt; 4000 IU/L indicating a poor prognosis.&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; High levels of unconjugated and total bilirubin, and serum bile acids, can be seen. Moderate to severe acidosis, leukocytosis, [[polycythaemia]], increased [[creatine kinase]] and hyperammonemia may be present, and hemolysis can occur at the end stage. The [[prothrombin]] time (PT) and [[partial thromboplastin time]] (PTT) is often prolonged.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Subclinical horses may only show elevated liver enzymes without any other clinical signs.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt; Horses are rarely [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]], but blood glucose monitoring is ideal to indicate which horses may be benefited by glucose treatment.&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
This is quite extensive and includes

*acute infectious hepatitis
*acute mycotoxicosis
*acute pyrrolizidine toxicosis
*haemolytic disease
*hepatotoxins

==Treatment==
There is currently no specific therapy. Intravenous fluids and treatment of the hepatic encephalopathy may help. Increasing dietary levels of branched chain amino acids and feeding low protein diets can help signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is often accomplished by feeding small amounts of grain and/or [[beet pulp]], and removing high-protein feedstuffs such as [[alfalfa|alfalfa hay]].&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Grazing on non-legume grass may be acceptable if it is late summer or fall, although the horse should only be permitted to eat in the evening so as to avoid photosensitization.&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Due to the risk of gastric impaction, stomach size should be monitored.

Sedation is minimized and used only to control behavior that could lead to injury of the animal and to allow therapeutic procedures, and should preferably involve a sedative other than a [[benzodiazepine]]. Stressing the animal should be avoided if at all possible. Plasma transfusions may be needed if spontaneous bleeding occurs, to replace clotting factors.  Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to prevent bacterial translocation from the intestines.&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt; Antioxidants such as [[vitamin E]], B-complex vitamins, and [[acetylcysteine]] may be given. High blood ammonia is often treated with oral [[neomycin]], often in conjunction with lactulose, [[metronidazole]] and probiotics, to decrease production and absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Equine Emerg"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
This depends on the degree of hepatocellular necrosis that has occurred. Decreases in the SDH and prothrombin time along with improvement in appetite are the best positive predictive indicators of recovery.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; GGT may remain elevated for weeks even if the horse is recovering. Horses that survive for greater than one week&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; and that continue to eat usually recover. Cases with rapid progression of clinical signs, uncontrollable encephalopathy, haemorrhage or haemolysis have a poor prognosis.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt; Horses that display clinical signs have a mortality rate of 50–90%.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
This condition most commonly occurs after the administration of a horse origin biological agent such as equine-derived antiserum, and usually occurs 4–10 weeks&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; after the event. Diseases that have been vaccinated against using equine-origin antiserum, resulting in subsequent Theiler's disease, include: [[African horse sickness]], [[Eastern Equine Encephalitis|Eastern]] and [[Western equine encephalitis virus|Western Equine Encephalitis]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', [[tetanus|tetanus antitoxin]], ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', ''[[Botulism|Clostridium botulinum]]'', [[Strangles|''Streptococcus equi'' subspecies ''equi'']], [[Equine influenza]], [[Equine herpesvirus 1|Equine herpesvirus type 1]], pregnant mare's serum, and plasma.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; Although it occurs sporadically, It appears to be spreadable within a premises, and there have been outbreaks occurring on farms involving multiple horses over several months.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt; In the Northern hemisphere it is most common between August to November. It is seen almost exclusively in adult horses, and lactating broodmares given tetanus antitoxin post foaling may be more susceptible.&lt;ref name="EIM"/&gt;

==History==
This disease was described in 1919 by [[Arnold Theiler]], a [[South Africa]]n [[veterinary surgeon]], after vaccinating horses against [[African horse sickness]] using a live virus vaccine and equine antiserum. It was later described in the United States after vaccinating horses for [[Eastern Equine Encephalitis]], again using live virus vaccines and equine-derived antiserum.&lt;ref name="EIM"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed, Stephen M., Waewick M. Bayly, and Debra C. Sellon.|title=Equine Internal Medicine|date=2010|publisher=Saunders|location=St Louis, MO|isbn=978-1-4160-5670-6|pages=957–959|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reported throughout North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="Chandriani2013"/&gt;

URGE changed its name in July 2014 and was formerly called Choice USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2014/07/11/beyond-choice-youth-focused-reproductive-rights-justice-organization-renames-urge/|title=Beyond 'Choice': Youth-Focused Reproductive Rights and Justice Organization Renames Itself URGE - Rewire|website=Rewire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a statement on its website, the group said the name change reflected work it was already doing outside of abortion rights advocacy. It described its mission as "catalyzing the power of young people to fight for the ability of all people to build the families they want, access the healthcare they need, and to live and love in the way that's true to who they are."&lt;ref name=ChoiceUSA&gt;{{cite web |title=About Our Name Change|work=URGE |url=http://urge.org/about/about-our-name-change/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and organization==
URGE was co-founded in 1992 by [[Gloria Steinem]], an American feminist, activist, and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/profiles/gloria-steinem/|title=Gloria Steinem {{!}} Profiles {{!}} Finding Your Roots {{!}} PBS|website=Finding Your Roots|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's first projects analyzed the activities of the religious right in elections and promoted electoral participation by women, young people, and people of color.

In recent years, the organization has focused its efforts on mobilizing people under 30 in support of abortion rights, comprehensive sex education, and access to sexual health and wellness services.&lt;ref name=NYT2009&gt;{{cite news |title=A Pregnant Pause |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg |date=November 29, 2009 |work=New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E3DE1E31F93AA15752C1A96F9C8B63&amp;pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athensnews.com/news/campus/rally-at-ohio-university-touts-abortion-rights/article_7b742c60-ff3d-11e5-bddc-33ef35b865e6.html |title=Rally at Ohio University touts abortion rights |last=Nelson |first=Samantha |date=April 10, 2016 |website= |publisher=The Athens News |access-date=December 23, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ultimate issue''' in [[criminal law]] is a legal issue at stake in the [[prosecution]] of a [[crime]] for which an [[expert witness]] is providing [[testimony]].

==Example==
If the issue is the [[defendant]]'s [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]] at the time of the offense, the ultimate issue would be the defendant's sanity or [[insanity]] during the commission of the crime. In the past, expert witnesses were allowed to give testimony on ultimate issues, such as the applicability of the [[insanity defense]] to a particular defendant. However, after the 1982 trial of [[John Hinckley, Jr.]], the federal [[rules of evidence]] were changed. Now in the [[United States]], federal courts and some states have rules of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that specifically rule out legal conclusions drawn by expert witnesses in their testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Barring ultimate issue testimony
|publisher=Springerlink
|accessdate=2007-10-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, a large amount of judicial discretion is allowed in how this rule is applied, resulting in an uneven application of rules across [[jurisdiction]]s.&lt;ref name="ultimate"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Federal Rules do not say what falls within the definition of an "ultimate issue." However,  a long history of [[case law]] on the subject suggests that an expert witness runs afoul if he uses the same words (words with legal meaning) that will ultimately be presented to the [[jury]]. One court excluded a [[psychologist]]'s [[evidence (law)|evidence]] on the [[credibility]] of prosecution's [[witness]] on the grounds that it amounted to an "ultimate opinion", meaning this was an opinion that could only be properly reached by a jury.&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt;

The expert witness testimony is confined to giving an opinion on whether the defendant had a serious [[mental disorder]] at the time of the offense, and explaining the [[symptom]]s and characteristics of any [[diagnosis]] given, including other testimony regarding the defendant's [[mental status]] (''[[mens Rea]]'') and [[motivation]]. The expert witness cannot make a statement addressing the issue of whether the legal test for insanity has been met. That is left to the [[judge]] and jury. The restriction of expert opinion on ultimate issues includes any testimony on the [[Element (criminal law)|criminal elements]], including testimony that would bear on the  mental state of the defendant relevant to ultimate legal decisions to be decided by the triers of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] adopted in 1975 (and their state counterparts) expressly allowed [[expert testimony]] to include statements on ultimate issues if such statements will be helpful to the judge or jury. In 1984, Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) was added following the trial of [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] for the [[Reagan Assassination Attempt|attempted assassination of U.S. President Ronald Reagan]]. The changes were in part a result of the public [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] due to Hinckley's successful use of the [[insanity defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|month=|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyinsanity.htm|title=The John Hinkley Trial and its Effect on the Insanity Defense|publisher=|accessdate=2007-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914170410/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyinsanity.htm|archivedate=2008-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, in particular Rule 704(b), put limits on expert witness testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=639 Insanity -- Scope of Expert Testimony - Rule 704. Opinion on ultimate issue
|publisher=
|accessdate=2007-10-26 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Rule 704(b) states "Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable solely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.courts.state.nh.us/rules/evid/evid-704.htm
|title=Rule 704. Opinion on Ultimate Issue
|publisher=www.courts.state.nh.us
|accessdate=2007-10-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 

The new rules of evidence restrict the testimony allowed on the ultimate issue. Rule 704(b) states that the mental health expert may testify to the defendant's [[mental disorder]] or defect and its symptoms, but may not offer a conclusion on an ultimate issue such as the sanity or insanity of the defendant. The expert witness must refrain from merely giving the jury a conclusion that pertains to the legal issues at hand and cannot testify to legal conclusions (ultimate issues), the rationale being that mental health professional are not attorneys.&lt;ref name="expertwit"/&gt; [[Judicial discretion]] remains in determining the limits of testimony as well, such that any testimony that "wastes time' or is irrelevant can be barred.&lt;ref name="expertwit"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2007-10-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this restriction was stated in the legislative history of the rule as the following:&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt;
{{quotation|The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate the confusing spectacle of competing expert witnesses testifying to directly contradictory conclusions as to the ultimate legal issue to be found by the trier of fact.}}
The result is that large gray areas remain regarding exactly what testimony is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-10-25

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] in ''United States v. Rutland'' ruled that testimony from "an extraordinarily qualified handwriting expert" was admissible on the "ultimate issue of authorship of key documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeffrey  R. MacDonald trial==
An example of how this change in the rules of evidence can affect trial testimony is demonstrated in an analysis of the 1979 trial of [[Jeffrey R. MacDonald]], a physician, for the murder of his wife and children, if his trial occurred today. In that trial, an expert testified in support of the [[defense (legal)|defense]] hypothesis that someone else committed the murders. Expert testimony that the defendant had a "personality configuration inconsistent with the outrageous and senseless murders of [his] family"&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt; was not allowed under the rules of evidence in effect at the time because it was considered confusing and misleading. However, under Rule 704(b) this character testimony would not be barred since testimony regarding "personality configuration" is general psychological evidence unrelated to any ultimate issues such as [[intent (law)|intent]] or [[malice aforethought]]. Also, an expert witness  would not be in violation of 704(b) in use today if he gave testimony regarding the defendant's positive behaviors, such as acting like a loving father and husband, which might create the impression that he was not capable of committing such a crime, but is an opinion unrelated to [[guilt (law)|guilt]].&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt;

==Conclusions==
Rules of evidence are meant to screen what evidence the jury may consider to prevent testimony that is mere opinion from infringing upon the territory of jury decision-making. Rule 704(b) reversed the trend toward permitting the testimony of experts on the ultimate issue. Since so much faith is placed in the jury system, limiting what a jury can consider narrows the jury's options. As in the past, lay witnesses may testify to facts only.&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt;

The result of rule 704(b) is to prevent expert witnesses such as psychologists and psychiatrists from testimony regarding how the defendant's mental state affected an [[element (criminal law)|element]] of the crime or an element of the defense. It has been ruled that 704(b) bans expert opinions on mental states affecting other [[element (criminal law)|elements]], not only on questions of insanity, but also on questions on all mental states forming an element of a crime or defense such as [[malice aforethought|premeditation]] in a [[murder]] case or [[specific intent]] and [[mens rea]].&lt;ref name="ultimate"/&gt;

==English law==
The position under English law is different from that in the United States as there is no rule preventing an expert from giving an opinion on the 'ultimate issue' in England and Wales.  This has been confirmed by the English Courts in both criminal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/1876.html R v Atkins 2009 EWCA Crim 1876]&lt;/ref&gt; and civil&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2001/17.html Barings PLC v Coopers &amp; Lybrand 2001 EWHC Ch 17]&lt;/ref&gt; cases.

Until 1972 the site was one of the many commercial [[watercress]] beds in the area. It was then used partly as allotments, with fly tipping in some areas. In 1991 the council leased the site to the Watercress Wildlife Association, which cleared the site to become a nature reserve and gradually took over the allotments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watercresslnr.org.uk/history/|title=History|publisher=Watercress Wildlife Association| accessdate=  28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has a wide variety of wildlife, including [[water rail]]s, kingfishers, little grebes and muntjac deer.&lt;ref name=LNR/&gt; 

==Facilities==
There is access from the junction of Riverside Road and Cornwall Road. Facilities include a hide, seating area and information board.

The [[Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust]] has a reserve at [[Lemsford Springs]], [[Lemsford]], which is also a former watercress bed.
