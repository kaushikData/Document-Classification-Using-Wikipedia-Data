==Plot==
In 1967 in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica, CA]], John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage porcelain doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.

That night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.

In the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter. The next night, Mia is haunted by a malevolent presence in her apartment and believes it to be Annabelle's ghost. During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the building's basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.

Mia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to [[Evocation|summon supernatural beings]]. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], which summoned a [[demon]] who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|the Warrens]] for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.

The priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her own life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As the Forms are reunited, the demon and the doll disappear, while Leah is safely inside her crib.

Six months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the [[The Conjuring|first film]].

==Production==

===Development===
The film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film ''[[The Conjuring]]'', focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film. The film was designed to be stand alone yet at the same time catering to fans of "The Conjuring" who would already be familiar with the latter film.&lt;ref name="Backstage"/&gt; According to Backstage.com, the film was one of the first in a new strategy by distributors Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema "that capitalizes on the built-in fan bases for successful films, allowing for smaller budgets and production time with a bigger payout on the back end."&lt;ref name="Backstage"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Briana |title=1 Strategy That Helps ''Annabelle'' Director John R.

===Critical response===
''Annabelle'' received generally negative reviews from critics, the majority of which felt the film inferior to its [[The Conjuring|predecessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-annabelle-movie-reviews-critics-20141002-story.html |title=''Annabelle'': Horror prequel scares up lackluster reviews |first=Oliver |last=Lackluster |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 3, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 29% based on 125 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Annabelle'' borrows unabashedly from better horror films, content to leave viewers with a string of cheap jolts that fail to build on the far more effective ''The Conjuring''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annabelle/ |title=Annabelle (2014) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/annabelle |title=Annabelle |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the film for its cheap production and screenplay, but was positive towards the performances of the cast and saying, "the film is ultimately so scary and formulaic that you won't forget it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/annabelle/review/737562 |title=''Annabelle'': Film Review |first=Frank |last=Scheck |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling the film "inspired" but periodically cheap. He added "a cut-rate spinoff from James Wan's superlative haunted-house hit ''The Conjuring'' that (partly) makes up in crude shock effects, but lacks in atmosphere. Designed mainly as a starring vehicle for the eponymous, creepy-as-hell doll (who easily outclasses her human co-stars), this WB/New Line quickie is the thirst of die-hard genre fans and is by the far the best horror movie of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-annabelle-1201319522/ |title=Film Review: ''Annabelle'' |first=Scott |last=Foundas |website=Variety |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Hammond of ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' gave the film a positive review and said that the scary doll show has left him pining for [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] in ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''. He further added, "''Annabelle'' may still draw horror fans in this Halloween month, and they will be quaking over the scares in this film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/annabelle-review-the-conjuring-prequel-pete-hammond-845104/ |title=''Annabelle'' Review: Pete Hammond On Scary ''The Conjuring'' Prequel |last=Hammond |first=Pete |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenian art''' is the unique form of art developed over the last five millennia in which the [[Armenian people]] lived on the [[Armenian Highland]].  Armenian architecture and miniature painting have dominated Armenian art and have shown consistent development over the centuries.&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction"&gt;{{Arts of Armenia|chapter=Introduction|chapterurl=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm}} {{cite web|url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143752/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm |archivedate=May 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of Armenian art include sculpture, fresco, mosaic, ceramic, metalwork, engraving, and textiles, especially [[Armenian carpet]]s.

[[Prehistoric Armenia]] was home to the [[Urartu]] culture in the [[Iron Age]], notable for its early metal sculptures, often of animals. The region was, as later, often contested by the large empires holding the nearby regions of [[Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]], and these all had considerable influence of Armenian art.  The Armenians adopted Christianity very early, and developed their own version of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] art, with much use of [[icon]]s, [[Armenian miniature]]s in books, and the very original [[Armenian church architecture|architecture]] of their churches and monasteries.  A distinctive Armenian feature, which may have influenced the [[Medieval art]] of Europe, was the popularity from early on of figurative [[relief]] carvings on the outside of churches, unknown in [[Byzantium]]. 

Armenians specialized in arts and crafts such as [[Armenian carpet|carpet]]-weaving.

== Study of Armenian art history ==
The study of Armenian art began in the early 20th century.  Notable scholars of Armenian art were [[Catholicos Garegin Hovsepian]] and professor [[Sirarpie Der Nerséssian]].&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction"/&gt;  More recently, [[Jean-Michel Thierry]] and Professor [[Dickran Kouymjian]] are prominent scholars of Armenian art.

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Armenian architecture}}
The first Armenian churches were built during the lifetime of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], were often built on the sites of destroyed pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="tacentral"&gt;[http://www.tacentral.com/architecture.asp?story_no=2 Sacred Geometry and Armenian Architecture | Armenia Travel, History, Archeology &amp; Ecology | TourArmenia | Travel Guide to Armenia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical and Medieval Armenian architecture is divided into four separate periods.

The first period, from the 4th to the 7th centuries, began with Armenia's conversion to Christianity, and ended after the Arab invasions of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple [[basilica]]s, some with side apses. By the 5th century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century, centrally-planned churches had been built and the more complicated ''niched buttress'' and radiating ''Hrip'simé'' style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasions, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.

The second period lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries. Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] dynasty with many buildings erected in the regions of [[Ani]] and [[Lake Van]]: these included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian [[khachkars]] were developed during this time.&lt;ref name="past"&gt;Armenia, Past and Present; Elisabeth Bauer, Jacob Schmidheiny, Frederick Leist , 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at [[Lake Van]] and a [[Cathedral on Akdamar Island]] to match. The [[Cathedral of Ani]] was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as [[Haghpat Monastery|Haghpat]]  and [[Haritchavank Monastery|Haritchavank]] were founded. This period was ended by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] invasion.

== Miniatures ==
{{Main|Armenian illuminated manuscripts}}
[[File:Matenadaran Gospel313 Last Supper.jpg|right|thumb|The Last Supper, from the illuminated manuscript, end of the 14th century, Artsakh]]
Illuminated manuscripts were produced in Armenia mainly between the 5th and the 17th centuries. The highest point of this art is associated with the 13th century and the name of [[Toros Roslin]], considered to be the most prominent medieval Armenian manuscript illuminator. The majority of the manuscripts were lost, and scholarly approach to studies of Armenian illuminated manuscripts was only developed in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vremennik.biz/sites/all/files/002_%D0%A2.%20%D0%90.%20%D0%98%20%D0%B7%20%D0%BC%20%D0%B0%20%D0%B9%20%D0%BB%20%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%20%D0%B0%20.%20%28%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%29%20%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%83%20%D0%9B.%20%D0%90.%20%D0%94%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE_0.pdf|title=Рецензия: Л.

== Sculptures ==
[[Image:Jugha-khachkar-CIMG1581.JPG|thumb|right|Late-medieval Armenian [[Khachkars]] from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]|150px]]
{{Main|Khachkar}}
Each culture possesses a certain original element which becomes a symbol of the entire national culture. In Armenia such symbol is “''[[khachkar]]'', the so-called cross-stones, the monuments of Armenia which are not found anywhere in the world. The word “khachkar” is formed by two Armenian roots: “khach” (cross) and "kar" (stone). Armenia has been called “a country of rocks” and has a rich heritage when it comes to sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://araratour.com/the-monuments-and-sculptures-of-yerevan/|title=The Monuments and Sculptures of Yerevan • Arara Tour|date=2016-01-25|work=Arara Tour|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sculptures in the country date way back even before the formation of Armenia as a nation. Such sculptures were created by empires that existed in the region before the modern period. A good example of these is the “Khachkar” which were ancient religious sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallery.am/en/Armenian/Sculpture/|title=Sculpture|date=|website=National Gallery of Armenia|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these ancient sculptures, Armenia also has plenty of post-war sculptures which show the influence of modern times and also foreign traditions that have been adopted.

== Frescoes, Mosaics, and Ceramics ==
[[Image:Armenian mural of Christ at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|An Armenian fresco of Christ at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
Ceramics, mosaics, and frescoes constitute a different category of Armenian artwork. The creation of the outlined artifacts dates back to the days of the Urartian Empire that existed long before the establishment of Armenia as a nation. Therefore some of the ancient art is shared among several countries in the region that were part of the Urartian Empire. While the evidence of these forms of art was realized through excavations in the country, their remains have been reconstructed thus providing physical evidence of what they looked like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/armenianstudies/resources/frescoesmosaicceramics.html|title=Frescoes, Mosaics, and Ceramica|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Metalwork and Engravings ==
[[Image:Akdamar Church.JPG|thumb|right|Biblical scenes carved into the external wall of the 10th-century Cathedral of the Holy Cross on [[Akhtamar Island]] on [[Lake Van]]]] 
Armenia has a history of making engravings and metalwork which are also considered as part of the art. Artifacts in this category can be subdivided into coins, silver and gold, and bronze and tinned copper.&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/armenianstudies/resources/metalworkengraving.html|title=Metalwork and Engraving|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins refer to the pieces of metals that were designed during the ancient times for trading purposes between Armenia and its neighbors such as Greece. On the other hand, gold and silver were luxury items during ancient Armenia which were fashioned in various ways such as drinking vessels, medallions, and statues just to mention a few. Besides, tinned copper and bronze were also used. Excavations in the country have revealed that these were used to make household items, weapons, and even statues.

== Textiles ==
{{Main|Armenian dress}}
Textiles are another part of Armenian art and also a significant part of their economy both in the ancient and present times. One of the most extensive collections of Armenian textiles can be found in the Armenian Museum of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armenianmuseum.org/collection/textiles/|title=Textiles|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current world, textile products from Armenia are a major trade commodity between Armenia, Europe, and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armenianmuseum.org/collection/textiles/|title=Textiles|last=|first=|date=|work=Armenian Museum of America|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Armenian carpets ===
{{main|Armenian carpet}}
{{Main|Karabakh carpet}}

== Music and dance ==
{{Main|Music of Armenia}}
{{Main|Armenian dance}}
Dance and Music are also an essential aspect of the Armenian Heritage. Initially, Armenian music consisted of Armenian Church music and folk songs that were based on an indigenous tonal system (Tetrachords) as opposed to the European tonal system. However, in the present time, other genres of music have influenced Armenian music thus resulting in the production of modern styles in the country such as Hip Hop, Pop, Rock, among many others. Accompanying original Armenian songs was Armenian dance. Native Armenian dance is one of the oldest practices of the inhabitants of the region. Armenian dance is even depicted in some of the ancient paintings on rocks.

== Contemporary Art == 
In 2015, Armenia won the Leone d'Oro for Best Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/56th-venice-biennale-highlights/?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the above-discussed art categories, Armenia also has well developed contemporary art which is overseen by the Biennale Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for organizing exhibitions in the country which are termed as Art Biennale. The name is used so as to distinguish its exhibitions from other shows conducted by different organizations. The institution has been doing its activities that date back from 1948 to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7771">[[File:Braak Bog Figures.JPG|thumb|Braak Bog Figures in the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum at Gottorf Castle.]]The '''Braak Bog Figures''' are two wooden carvings discovered in 1947 in a peat bog in [[Braak]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Northern Germany]]. Part of a larger tradition of [[Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines of Central and Northern Europe|similar figures]] spanning the period from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Middle Ages]], they are [[Anthropomorphism|human-like]] in appearance and have been [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE; the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum puts them as far back as 400BCE. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their function and what they may represent, from depictions of deities to ancestor worship.

==Appearance and dating==
Carved from carefully selected naturally forked oak branches,&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"&gt;Aldhouse Green (2004:59&amp;ndash;60).&lt;/ref&gt; the figures are [[Anthropomorphism|human-like]] and are {{convert|275|cm|in}} (male) and {{convert|230|cm|in}} (female) in height.&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"&gt;Sierksma (1960:168).&lt;/ref&gt; They have sockets for arms (the appendages are missing) and pebbles may have been used for their eyes.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-1988-17"&gt;Davidson (1988:17).&lt;/ref&gt; The figures exhibit marked sexual dimorphism: in addition to the difference in height, the female has her hair in a topknot and the male has short hair with [[Fringe (hair)|bangs]],&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; and the sexual organs are emphasized.&lt;ref name="TODD-108"&gt;Todd (2009:108).&lt;/ref&gt; The breasts of the female figure are "set in separately" and the male figure's genital had been "struck off".&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"/&gt; The noses are also differentiated, but both have open mouths as if screaming.&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; Fires had repeatedly been built near the site of the find.&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-61"&gt;Aldhouse Green (2004:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Braak figures are [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to the 3rd to 2nd century BCE,&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; but have also been dated to the early 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name=exhibit&gt;Hansen (2010:34).&lt;/ref&gt; They are among several [[Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines of Central and Northern Europe|anthropomorphic wooden figures]] of varying form unearthed from the [[Neolithic]] and into the [[Middle Ages]], in areas of Northern Europe ranging from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany to [[Norrland]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Oldeberg&gt;Oldeberg (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these figures date to the [[Iron Age]] and the [[Roman period]].&lt;ref name="TODD-AND-DAVIDSON-1988"&gt;See Davidson (1988:15-19) &amp; Todd (2009:108).&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Braak Bog Figures are the largest found in Germany,&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt; and [[Malcolm Todd]] calls them the "most imposing".&lt;ref name="TODD-108"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Fokke Sierksma]] commented in 1960 that as the figures were found together in a peat bog, near a pile of stones containing fragments of pottery and evidence of fire, these find circumstances "together with the considerable dimension of the figures, and the combination of a male and a female figure, make it virtually certain that they represent deities of Northern Germanic tribes. These located the residence of their gods in peat bogs, and regarded the sacred union of a fertility god and a fertility goddess as prerequisite for the continued propagation of life in all its forms".&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"/&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1975) comments that these figures may represent a "Lord and Lady" of the [[Vanir]], a group of [[Norse gods]], and that "another memory of [these wooden figures] may survive in the tradition of the creation of [[Ask and Embla]], the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-1975-89"&gt;Davidson (1975:88—89).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to regard them as part of ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;Capelle (1995:13).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freudenberg (2007:85).&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Todd (2009) comments that the Braak Bog Figures and other similar bog figures have a "significance [that is] difficult to determine but [they] should be related to the supra-mundane and perhaps specifically to the presiding deities of fertility and war".&lt;ref name="TODD-108"/&gt;

==Current location and controversy==
The Braak Bog Figures are in the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum at [[Gottorf Castle]]. The post-war [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] there, [[Karl Schlabow]], has been accused of over-restoring archaeological exhibits, including accentuating the sexual characteristics of the Braak figures.&lt;ref&gt;Brock (2007:[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/windeby-geheimnis-der-moorleichen-gelueftet-a-466195-2.html 2]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10231">'''COBE''' is an architectural firm based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Berlin]]. Founded by Danish architect Dan Stubbergaard and German architect Vanessa Miriam Carlow in 2005, the practice has been particularly successful within the area of urban planning but also made a number of award-winning designs of buildings and urban spaces. The name of the practice is an acronym for the two cities the two founders are coming from, COpenhagen and BErlin.

==History==
COBE was founded in 2005 by Danish architect Dan Stubbergaard and German architect Vanessa Miriam Carlow. In 2006 the firm won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[10th International Architecture Exhibition]] of the [[Venice Biennale]] for the project CO-Evolution which was made in collaboration with three other young Danish practices.

In March 2009 the firm won the large international competition for a masterplan for the [[Nordhavnen|North Harbour]] area in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cphx.dk/index.php?id=224337#/224336/|title=Vinderen af Nordhavnen fundet|language=Danish|publisher=Copenhagen X|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success has been followed by a number of other wins in planning competitions, such as those of the North Campus area in Copenhagen (2011), the Central Station area in [[Aarhus]] and Lund Science Village in [[Lund]], Sweden. The practice has also designed a number of buildings and urban spaces.

'''''Carbon Copy''''' is a 1981 British-American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Michael Schultz]]. The film stars [[George Segal]], [[Susan Saint James]], [[Jack Warden]], and features [[Denzel Washington]] in his feature-film debut. It was the first [[feature film]] produced by [[RKO Pictures]] after a break of many years, though they were only co-distributor with Avco/Embassy Pictures and Hemdale Film Corporation.

==Plot==
Roger Porter (Washington), a black man, is the long-lost son of Walter Whitney (Segal), a white businessman living in the exclusive, predominantly white community of [[San Marino, California]]. Walter, who is Jewish, lives a frustrating life in his gated community, sexually and otherwise. One day he finds out about his former girlfriend son's existence. Once Roger turns up at Walter's office, it turns out that he is the result of Walter's relationship with a black woman, who is now dead. For purposes of professional advancement in the business, he left Roger's mother. The only person who knew about Roger's mother was his anti-Semitic father-in-law (Warden) who is also his boss. Walter's father-in-law had warned him that the relationship would be harmful to his career, so Walter under pressure broke it off.

Walter attempts to help Roger by telling his wife Vivian (Saint James) that he wants to adopt him. She accepts, but soon regrets the decision after she finds out about Roger's real relationship with Walter and ends up kicking Walter out. Her father also fires him, taking his car and benefits in the process. Walter's friends alienate him. He comes to the realization that his job and his wife receive all of his benefits, leaving him penniless. Walter realizes he is going through "social menopause", a change of color. Per his new accountant, "They don't want you to participate as a White man, so they are going to make you watch like a Black man." Afterwards, Roger checks into a motel and tries to make ends meet. Meanwhile his father-in-law watches Walter's every move to make sure Walter receives no help from the world he knew so Walter can come back to his old world WITHOUT Roger. Later, Walter and Roger move into an apartment. Walter ends up as a menial manual laborer, shoveling horse manure.

The final ten minutes makes the transition from comedy to [[drama film|drama]], where Walter has to choose between either acceptance that Roger is his son, or alienation of Roger to salvage his own position in society.

{{costume}}
'''Costume design''' is the investing of [[clothing]] and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character.&lt;ref name=Eubank&gt;{{cite book|last=Eubank, Tortora|first=Keith, Phyllis G.|title=Survey of Historic Costume|year=2005|publisher=Fairchild Publications|location=New York|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costume]]s may be for a [[theater]], [[film|cinema]], or musical performance but may not be limited to such. Costume design should not be confused with [[costume coordination]] which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both create [[stage clothes]].

Four types of costumes are used in theatrical design: historical, fantastical, dance, and modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Costuming a Play: Inter-Theatre Arts Handbook| last=Grimball and Wells| first=Elizabeth B. and Rhea | publisher = The Century Co.|year =1925| pages = 6| asin=B0000D5ITV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Village festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus (See also: [[Dionysia]]) amongst the ancient Greeks, are believed to be the origin of theatre, and therefore theatre costume. The sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of this costume.&lt;ref name="Eubank"/&gt; Because of their ritualized style of theatre many masks were used giving each character a specific look and they varied depending if they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes. Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true for the Romans, who continued the mask tradition, which made the doubling of roles easier.

During the late Middle Ages in Europe, dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent, therefore actual Christian vestments, stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress, were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible.&lt;ref name="Eubank"/&gt; Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre. In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in Elizabethan performance during the 1500-1600s in England, costume became the most important visual element. Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used. The majority of characters were clothed in Elizabethan fashion, otherwise the costumes could be divided into five categories; 
"Ancient", which was out of style clothing used to represent another period; "Antique", older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters; Dreamlike, "fanciful" garments for supernatural or allegorical characters; "Traditional" clothing which represented only a few specific people, such as Robin Hood, or "National or Racial" costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ordinarily, fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727, when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy. Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major actors began to compete with one another as to who would have the most lavish stage dress. This practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again. Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century. For example, Georg the second, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes. He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period, therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes. He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific, using real chain mail, armor, swords, etc. No cheap substitutes would be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1823, in an issue of ''The Album'', [[James Planché]] published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare's plays, especially when it comes to costumes.  In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to [[Charles Kemble]], the manager of Covent Garden, that "while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters."&lt;ref name="obituary-nyt"&gt;Obituary, ''The New York Times'', 15 June 1880, p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, ''The Costume Designs of James Robinson Planché'', argues that a letter published in ''The Album'', August 1823, pp298–304, signed only 'P', which called for more attention to be paid to the costuming of Shakespeare's plays, and proposed a wardrobe system whereby all locations and periods could be accommodated, was in fact written by Planché.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemble "saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town" and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The New York Times''.  The [[:Image:King John playbill 1823.jpg|playbill]] for ''King John'' states that if the play meets with "approbation and patronage" more of Shakespeare's plays will be performed "Dressed in the same splendid, novel, and interesting style".&lt;/ref&gt; Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as [[Francis Douce]] and [[Samuel Meyrick|Sir Samuel Meyrick]]. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.&lt;ref name="reinhardt526"&gt;Reinhardt, ''The Costume Designs of James Robinson Planché'', p526–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the actors' reservations, ''King John'' was a success and led to a number of similarly-costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (''[[Henry IV, Part I]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'').&lt;ref name="reinhardt526"/&gt; The designs and renderings of ''King John'', ''Henry IV'', ''As You Like It'', ''Othello'', ''Hamlet'' and ''Merchant of Venice'' were published, though there is no evidence that ''Hamlet'' and ''Merchant of Venice'' were ever produced with Planché’s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (''Cortez'', ''The Woman Never Vext'', ''The Merchant's Wedding'', ''Charles XII'', ''The Partisans'', ''The Brigand Chief'', and ''Hofer'').&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Roy, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in ''King John'' had brought about a "revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice"&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; which lasted for almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;Granville-Barker, ''Exit Planché—Enter Gilbert'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 the first of a series of innovative [[modern dress]] productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays, ''[[Cymbeline]]'', directed by [[H. K. Ayliff]], opened at [[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]]'s [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sylvia|last=Morris|title=Innovating in Birmingham: Barry Jackson and modern dress Shakespeare|url=http://theshakespeareblog.com/2012/01/innovating-in-birmingham-barry-jackson-and-modern-dress-shakespeare/|work=The Shakespeare blog|date=2012-01-13|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costumes in Chinese theatre are very important, especially in Beijing Opera. They are usually heavily patterned and loud in color. The standard items consist of at least 300 pieces and describe the actors character type, age and social status through ornament, design, color and accessories. "Color is always used symbolically: red for loyalty and high position, yellow for royalty, and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems. For example, the tiger stands for power and masculine strength. A majority of the clothing, regardless of rank, is made out of rich and luxurious materials. Makeup is also used symbolically and very important to the overall look.

In Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume. They are made of wood and usually used for generations. There are five basic types; male, female, aged, deities and monsters, all with many variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masks are changed often throughout the play. 
In Kabuki, another form of Japanese theatre, actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the overall look. Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern. Traditional costumes are used for each role, based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect. "Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds, and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett, Hildy|first=Oscar G., Franklin J.|title=History of the Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=USA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design process ==
[[File:Costume workshop at a theatre, Prague - 8581.jpg|thumb|A woman creating in a costume workshop in [[Prague]] theater.]]
The costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used.

1.) '''Analysis''':
The first step is an analysis of the script, musical composition, choreography, etc. Costume Parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created. A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene, when the actors change, and what costumes are mentioned in the script.

2.) '''Design Collaboration''':
An important phase in the process where all of the designers meet with the director. There must be a clear understanding of where the show is headed. The designers get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what message they want the audience to get from the show.

3.) '''Costume Research''':
Once the director and designers are on the same page, the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research. Costume designers usually begin with world of the play research where they find research to establish the world where the play takes place. This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better. The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume.

4.) '''Preliminary Sketching and Color Layout''':
Once enough information is obtained, Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches. beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained. The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character. Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them.

5.) '''Final Sketches''':
Once the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out, the designer will create final sketches. These are called rendering and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints. These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume.

==Production process==

[[File:Draping example by Jeanette Aultz 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Example of draping muslin fabric onto a dress form]]
Once the show is designed, it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced. There are four options. Garments can be: 
*	Pulled, which refers to searching through a costume shops stock
*	Rented
*	Shopped
*	Constructed, or also known as made to order.

There are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed; either pattern drafted or draped, and many times both methods will be used together.
'''Pattern drafting''' begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor’s measurements. They are drawn out on paper first, then transferred to fabric, and sewn together to test fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Covey, Ingham|first=Liz, Rosemary|title=The Costume Technician's Handbook|year=2003|publisher=Heinemann|location=Portsmouth, NH|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Draping''' involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that have measurements closely related to the actors. It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three-dimensional body by cutting and pinning.

Once constructed, however, the costume has not finished "working." A most important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors' performances and function within their settings. The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lugli |first1=Emanuele |title="Costume as Appearance: A Study in the Modalities of Existence of Film Costumes |url=https://www.academia.edu/26091504/Costume_as_Appearance_A_Study_in_the_Modalities_of_Existence_of_Film_Costumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dalailkhayrat.jpg|thumb|A detail from a 15th-century manuscript of ''Dala’il al-Khayrat'' showing [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] and [[Kaaba]].]]

'''''Dala'il al-Khayrat''''' or '''''Dalaail u'l Khayraat Wa Shawaariq u'l Anwaar Fee Zikri's Salaat Alan Nabiyyi'l Mukhtaar''''' (meaning the ''Waymarks of Benefits and the Brilliant Burst of Lights in the Remembrance of Blessings on the Chosen Prophet'') is a famous collection of prayers for the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], which was written by the Moroccan Shadhili [[Sufism|Sufi]] and Islamic scholar [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Muhammad Sulaiman al-Jazuli ash Shadhili]] (died 1465). It is popular in parts of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] amongst traditional Muslims - specifically [[North Africa]], the [[Levant]], [[Turkey]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[South Asia]] and is divided into sections for daily recitation.

Moroccan ''[[hadith]]'' scholar ‘Abdullah al-Talidi wrote of the ''Dala’il al-Khayrat'': "Millions of Muslims from East to West tried it and found its good, its blessing, and its benefit for centuries and over generations, and witnessed its unbelievable spiritual blessings and light. Muslims avidly recited it, alone and in groups, in homes and mosques, utterly spending themselves in the Blessings on the Most Beloved and praising him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalail.co.uk/dalail.htm |title=The Story of Dala'il al-Khayrat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dala’il al-Khayrat'' is the first major book in Islamic history which compiled litanies of peace and blessings upon Muhammad. It is also the most popular and most universally acclaimed collection of litanies asking [[God in Islam|God]] to bless him. Among some [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] religious orders, most notably the [[Shadhili|Shadhili-Jazuli]] order, its recitation is a daily practice. In others however, its recitation is a purely voluntary daily practice. The work begins with the [[Names of God in Islam|ninety nine names of God]], and then the a collection of over [[Names and Titles of Muhammad|one hundred names of Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iqra.net/Salawaat/dalaail/index.html|title=Dala'il Khayrat: An Appreciation by Siddiq Osman Noormuhammad (IQRA.net)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend behind the origin of the ''Dala’il al-Khayrat'' claims that al-Jazuli once awoke late for his morning prayers and began to look in vain for pure water to perform ritual ablutions. In the midst of his search al-Jazuli encountered a young girl who was aware of al-Jazuli's famed religiosity and was bewildered on why al-Jazuli could not find pure water. The girl then spat into a well which miraculously overflowed with pure sweet water for al-Jazuli to perform ablutions. Consequent to performing prayer, al-Jazuli inquired to the means by which the girl achieved such a high spiritual station. The girl replied it was simply by "Making constant prayer for God to bless the best of creation by the number of breaths and heartbeats." Al-Jazuli then resolved to write a work collecting litanies of prayers asking God to bless and show mercy and kindness to Muhammad.

Al-Jazuli then moved east to [[Medina]] where he would recite the whole of the ''Dala’il al-Khayrat'' twice daily at Muhammad's grave in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]]. The ''Dala'il Khayrat'' has since been seen as a testament of love and passionate longing for Muhammad.

Many of [[exegesis]] were written on the ''Dala'il Khayrat'' - most notably by the scholar [[Yusuf an-Nabhani]] in his work ''Afdal al-Salawat'', and 'Abd al-Majid al-Sharnubi al-Azhari's ''Sharh Dala'il Khayrat''. A classic [[Ottoman era]] work by [[Kara Davud]] is popular in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], titled ''Muwafik-ul Khayrat Linayl-el Barakat Fi Khidmat-as Saadat'', in short known as "Kara Davud".

{{Comics navbar|title=Editorial cartoon}}

An '''editorial [[cartoon]]''', also known as a '''political cartoon''', is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an [[editorial cartoonist]]. They typically combine artistic skill, [[hyperbole]] and [[satire]] in order to question [[authority]] and draw attention to [[corruption]], [[political violence]] and other [[social ills]].&lt;ref name=Sterling&gt;{{cite book | last = Sterling | first = Christopher | title = Encyclopedia of Journalism | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | location = Thousand Oaks | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-7619-2957-6 |pages=253–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hti.osu.edu/opper/editorial-cartoons|title=Editorial Cartoons: An Introduction {{!}} HTI|last=Shelton|first=Mitchell|website=hti.osu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in England in the latter part of the 18th century, [[James Gillray]] was a pioneer of the political cartoon.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Founded in 1841, the British periodical ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' appropriated the term cartoon to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term's widespread use.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=15}}

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en p.193] "Retouched by the Author, 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in ''The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780'', states that "English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's ''Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Richetti| first = John J.| title = The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780| date = 2005| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-78144-2 }}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hogarth]]’s pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18thcentury British politics. An early satirical work was an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

His art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake’s Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|James Gillray’s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in Danger]]'' (1805). The world being carved up into spheres of influence between [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon]]. According to [[Martin Rowson]], it is “probably the most famous political cartoon of all time—it has been stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Rowson]], speaking on The Secret of Drawing, presented by [[Andrew Graham Dixon]], BBCTV&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the [[French Revolution]]—under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=''The Guardian''|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/mark-bryant/james-gillray-scourge-napoleon|title=James Gillray: The Scourge of Napoleon|publisher=HistoryToday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 "not to caricature His Majesty" ([[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]) "in any immoral situation". His work included a personification of England named [[John Bull]] who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.&lt;ref&gt;Gatrell, Vic.

=== Cartoonist's magazines ===

[[File:BritishLionTenniel1857Punch1.jpg|thumb|right|''The British Lion's Vengeance...'', cartoon by [[John Tenniel]] in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]]]
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|An editorial cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], 1865, entitled ''The Rail Splitter at Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads: (Johnson): "Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever." (Lincoln): "A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended."]]
The art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1841, founded by [[Henry Mayhew]] and engraver [[Ebenezer Landells]] (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was ''Monthly Sheet of Caricatures'', printed from 1830 and an important influence on ''Punch'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1347521/caricature-and-cartoon/59402/Early-19th-century|title=Caricature and cartoon|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by [[Bradbury and Evans]] in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term "[[cartoon]]" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and "carttons" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term "cartoon" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or {{lang|it|cartone}} in Italian.  ''Punch'' humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the ''Punch'' cartoons led to the term's widespread use.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=15}}

Artists who published in ''Punch'' during the 1840s and 50s included [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], [[John Tenniel]] and [[Charles Keene (artist)|Charles Keene]]. This group became known as "The ''Punch'' Brotherhood", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1843. ''Punch'' authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called ''[[Once A Week (magazine)|Once A Week]]'' (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from ''[[Household Words]]''.

The most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was [[John Tenniel]], chief cartoon artist for ''Punch'', who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] and the public outrage that followed, ''Punch'' published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel's ''Justice'' and ''The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger''.

=== Maturation ===
[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]] depicts the Tweed Ring: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."]]
[[File:School Begins (Puck Magazine 1-25-1899).jpg|thumb|1899 cartoon showing [[Uncle Sam]] lecturing four children labeled [[Philippines]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]]. The caption reads: School Begins. Uncle Sam (to his new class in Civilization)!]]
[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 political cartoon. The U.S.'s intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]]]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher's opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was [[Thomas Nast]] in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]'s political machine in New York City. Albert Boime argues that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Boime, "Thomas Nast and French Art", ''American Art Journal'' (1972) 4#1 pp. 43–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notable editorial cartoons include [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Join, or Die]]'' (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; ''[[The Thinkers Club]]'' (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the [[Carlsbad Decrees]]; and [[E. H. Shepard]]'s ''The Goose-Step'' (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Hitler. ''The Goose-Step'' is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.

== Recognition ==
Institutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/collection|title=CSPG, politicalgraphics|website=CSPG, politicalgraphics|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Cartoon Archive]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000465|title=British Cartoon Archive at University of Kent {{!}} Culture24|website=www.culture24.org.uk|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editorial cartoons and [[editorial cartoonist]]s are recognised by a number of awards, for example the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the [[British Press Awards]]' "Cartoonist of the Year".

== Modern political cartoons ==
Political cartoons can usually be found on the [[editorial page]] of many newspapers, although a few (such as [[Garry Trudeau]]'s ''[[Doonesbury]]'') are sometimes placed on the regular [[comic strip]] page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.

Yaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip ''[[Dry Bones (comic strip)|Dry Bones]]'', says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to "seduce rather than to offend." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Barry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=1244 |title='Dry Bones': Row shows clash of civilizations, Jerusalem Post|publisher=Jpost.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as [[Uncle Sam]], the [[Democratic donkey]] and the [[Republican elephant]]. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in ''Doonesbury'' which tells a linear story in comic strip format. 

Cartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through speciﬁc frames of understanding (Mateus, 2016). Mateus' analysis "seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reﬂect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life" (Mateus, 2016:216). The paper does not tell that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that t[https://www.academia.edu/30728270/Political_Cartoons_as_Communicative_Weapons_the_hypothesis_of_the_Double_Standard_Thesis_in_three_Portuguese_cartoons he double standard thesis in Political Cartoons] may be a frequent frame among possible others.

A political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people's political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.

== Pocket cartoons ==
A pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by [[Osbert Lancaster]] in 1939 at the ''[[Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Smith, ''[[The Observer]]'', 23 November 2008, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/23/osbert-lancaster-exhibition Timeless appeal of the classic joke]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 obituary by ''[[The Guardian]]'' of its pocket cartoonist [[David Austin (cartoonist)|David Austin]] said "Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope."&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Jennings and Patrick Barkham, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 November 2005, [https://www.theguardian.com/arts/news/obituary/0,12723,1647210,00.html David Austin: Guardian pocket cartoonist with a sceptically humanist view of the news]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Editorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/why-are-political-cartoons-incendiary.html|title=Why Are Political Cartoons Incendiary?|first=Victor S.|last=Navasky|date=12 November 2011|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (stemming from the publication of cartoons of [[Muhammad]]) and the [[2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy]].

Libel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when [[J.H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday"—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521–550&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Askew Sothern''' (1 April 1826 – 20 January 1881) was an English actor known for his comic roles in Britain and America, particularly [[Lord Dundreary]] in ''[[Our American Cousin]]''.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===
Sothern was born in [[Liverpool]], the son of a merchant. He began studying medicine, and his parents hoped that he would become a minister,&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 22 January 1881, p. 9, col. F&lt;/ref&gt; but he decided against pursuing those professions. He worked as a clerk in the late 1840s and married Frances Emily "Fannie" Stewart (d. 1882). He began acting as an amateur in 1848 under the stage name of Douglas Stewart.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Holder, Heidi J. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26040 "Sothern, Edward Askew (1826–1881)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 7 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 he appeared in his first professional engagement at [[Saint Helier]] in [[Jersey]], as Claude Melnotte in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]]'s ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]''. In the early 1850s, he played in various English companies without particular success in [[Portsmouth]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]].

Sothern travelled to America in 1852, first playing Dr. Pangloss in ''[[The Heir at Law]]'' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], with John Lacy's company at the [[National Theatre, Boston (1836)|National Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; He then played at the [[Howard Athenaeum]] in Boston and at [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1854, he joined the company at [[Wallack's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern" at the ''American Theater Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of his career, Sothern's wife often performed with him. By 1856, he had begun using his own name, Sothern, on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VI, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; He had become associated with [[Laura Keene]]'s company in New York by 1856.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfaff&gt;Whitley, Edward. [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/pfaffs/p132/ "Sothern, Edward Askew (Douglas Stewart)"], The Vault at Pfaff's, Lehigh University's digital library&lt;/ref&gt; He finally gained attention at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York starring as Armand in ''Camille''. The critic [[Clement Scott]] noted that while Sothern was "as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage", he was not naturally suited to romantic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, vol. 1, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Our American Cousin'' ===
[[File:Lord Dundreary.jpg|thumb|right|Sothern as [[Lord Dundreary]]]]
As a result of his success in ''Camille'', Sothern was given a part in [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Laura Keene]]'s Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that [[Abraham Lincoln]] was watching when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was so small and unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VII, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned his qualms to his friend, [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: "There are no small parts, only small actors."&lt;ref&gt;Havard, Bernard. ''Walnut Street Theatre'', p. 40, Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1858, ''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York. After a couple of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his "bwother" Sam.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery on both sides of the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as "Dundrearys". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1861, earning rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern", ''Virtual American Biographies'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' wrote, "it is certainly the funniest thing in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent".&lt;ref&gt;''The Athenaeum'', 16 November 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundreary became a popular recurring character, and Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role. A number of spin-off works were also created, including Charles Gayler's sequel, ''Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad'' (Buffalo, New York, 1860,&lt;ref&gt;''Buffalo Daily Courier'', 1 November 1860&lt;/ref&gt; and then New York City, 1861&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. Allston (1903). ''A History of the New York Stage, Volume I'', New York: Dodd, Mead, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Dundreary Married and Done For''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern wrote his own play, ''Suspense'', produced for Keene's 1860-61 season.&lt;ref name=Pfaff/&gt; He won wide popularity from his interpretation of Sam Slingsby in [[John Oxenford]]'s ''Brother Sam'' (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary's brother.

=== 1860s and 1870s ===
In 1864, Sothern created the title role in [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]]'s ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'' at the Haymarket Theatre. The play was a great success. ''[[The Times]]'' praised Sothern's acting in the Act II scene where Sothern depicted "the most extravagant form of drunkenness... perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 May 1864&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in Robertson's ''Home'' and later claimed to have written some of the best scenes in each work (a claim that was disputed by Robertson).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Other plays written for the now-famous Sothern were ''The Woman in Mauve'', by Watts Phillips; ''The Favourite of Fortune'' and ''A Hero of Romance'' by [[John Westland Marston|Westland Marston]]; ''A Lesson for Life'' by [[Tom Taylor]]; and ''An English Gentleman'' by [[H. J. Byron]] (1871) at the Haymarket.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Sothern continued to act mostly in London until 1876, but also toured extensively in the British provinces, North America and Europe.

Sothern became popular with Robertson's crowd, including with the Haymarket's manager, [[John Baldwin Buckstone]], actor [[J. L. Toole]], and dramatists Byron and [[W. S. Gilbert]], who later wrote three plays for him, ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20; 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/neerdowell/index.html Information about ''The Ne'er do Weel'' at the G&amp;S Archive], accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 124 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Foggerty&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/foggerty/failure.html "Foggerty's Failure: A few background notes on ''Foggerty’s Fairy''"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2007, accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known as a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his [[practical jokes]] (he was born on [[April fool's day]]).  Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth.  At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table.  When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft.  By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table as if nothing had happened.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Sothern left England to tour in America in early 1876 and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with a play by October that would feature him in a serious role.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;  This play eventually became ''Dan'l Druce''.  However, Sothern produced but did not star in the play.  Gilbert soon wrote another play for Sothern, this time a comedy, ''The Ne'er-do-Weel''.  Sothern was not pleased with the work, and Gilbert offered to take it back.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 123–24 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was eventually produced, Sothern did not appear in it.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back.  After various arrangements between Gilbert and Sothern involving American productions of another Gilbert play, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), Gilbert finally promised, in 1878, to write a new play for Sothern.  This was to be ''Foggerty's Fairy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 134–35 and 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's biographer T. Edgar Pemberton noted that one role he regretted not playing was Cheviot in ''Engaged''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern continued to tour and perform Dundreary and other works.  In October 1877 at the Academy of Music in New York, he played the title role in ''[[Othello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Brander and Hutton, Laurence. [https://archive.org/details/lifeandartofedwi00mattrich ''The Life and art of Edwin Booth and his contemporaries''] (1906), p. 118, Boston: L. C. Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's next great role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's ''The Crushed Tragedian'' (1878, originally named ''The Prompter's Box'') at the Haymarket.  ''The Era'' admired "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" of his portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 19 May 1878&lt;/ref&gt;  He next appeared in ''The Hornet's Nest'' by Byron at the Haymarket.  ''The Crushed Tragedian'' was not a great success in London, but it became a hit in New York.  ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' raved, "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pemberton, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in [[Lord Lytton]]'s play ''Money'' as Sir Frederick Blount.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 April 1879, p. 8, col. B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last years and family ===
In the autumn of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another [[United States|American]] tour.  ''The Era'' wrote in October 1879 that "It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of ''The Crushed Tragedian'', ''Dundreary'', and ''David Garrick'', the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', Drama in America column, 12 October 1879&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 February 1880 ''The Era'' reported: "Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now.  It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 29 February 1880&lt;/ref&gt;  The same issue of ''The Era'' states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] in ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour.  Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern returned to [[England]] for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce ''Fogerty's Fairy'' in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.

[[File:Edward Askew Sothern gravestone.JPG|thumb|Sothern's grave in Southampton Old Cemetery]]
Sothern died at his home in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in [[Southampton Old Cemetery]], Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186299-d216086/Southampton:United-Kingdom:The.Old.Cemetery.html Information about Sothern's burial site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sothern was such a notorious practical joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke.  His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death.  A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children.  Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Gilbert suggested that she "underlet" ''Foggerty's Fairy'' to him, and he eventually had it produced.  Later, she wrote to him: "Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness &amp; fairness &amp; I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern and his wife had four children, all of whom became actors: Lytton Edward (1851–1887), [[Edward Hugh Sothern|Edward Hugh (E. H.)]], George Evelyn Augustus T. (b. 1870; who used the stage name Sam Sothern) and Eva Mary.  E. H. Sothern became prominent on the American stage.  Sothern's house in [[Kensington]], London was a resort for people of fashion, and he was as much a favourite in America as in the United Kingdom.

== Famous hoax ==
Sothern's passion for practical joking amounted almost to a mania. He would often falsely announce the death of a friend or send people on fool's errands.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, Chapter IV, "Sothern in High Spirits", pp. 199 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most elaborate practical jokes was the following.  When the husband of actress [[Adelaide Neilson]], Philip Henry Lee, visited New York in the mid-19th century, he had been warned about the wild, bohemian behaviour of American authors, but expressed his doubt as to the veracity of the stories. Sothern assured him it was true and arranged a private dinner for Lee with twelve "writers and critics", who were really actors.  During the dinner, a quarrel arose over literary matters, culminating in a fight breaking out. The men, apparently drunk, brandished an axe, knives and revolvers. The room was filled with shouts, shots and struggle. Someone thrust a knife into Lee's hand, saying, "Defend yourself! This is butchery, sheer butchery!" Sothern advised him to "Keep cool, and don't get shot", before the joke was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, pp. 223–226&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alison Carroll 6.jpg|thumb|Video game heroine [[Lara Croft]], here portrayed by [[Alison Carroll]], is a common example cited for the [[sexual objectification]] of women in games.]]

The portrayal of men and women in [[video games]], as in other media, is a subject of research in [[gender studies]] and is discussed in the context of [[sexism in video gaming]].

Although women make up about half of video game players, they are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, despite the prominence of iconic heroines such as [[Samus Aran]] or [[Lara Croft]]. The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]] or negative stereotypes, such as that of the "[[damsel in distress]]". Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and [[LGBT]] characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the [[heteronormativity]] of the medium.

Research indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do. On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.

[[File:Girl plays Pac Man.JPG|thumb|A young girl playing a video game]]

A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that half of all American video game players were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"Teens, Video Games and Civics." Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech. N.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women play video games, but studies suggest differences in platform and game genre preference.&lt;ref name=Joystiq&gt;{{cite web|title=LReport: Men play more MMOs, FPSes; women rule mobile, RPG|author=Jessica Conditt|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/27/report-men-play-more-mmos-fpses-women-rule-mobile-rpg|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Entertainment Software Rating Board reports that in 2010, 80% of female console gamers played on Wii, 11% on Xbox360 and 9% on PS3. By comparison, 38% of male console gamers in the year 2014 played Xbox 360, 41% played Wii and 21% played PS3.&lt;ref name="Video Game Stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Do You Know About Video Games?|author=ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/video-game-industry-statistics.jsp|accessdate=2014-11-09|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]] looked at the different mobile gaming preferences between men and women. Women made up 60–80% of the solitaire, slots, social turn-based, match-three / bubble-shooter, management / simulation and quiz game markets. Men on the other hand, made up between 60–80% of the strategy, shooter, card battle, racing and action RPG markets.&lt;ref name="Furry App statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Love, Courtship and the Promiscuous Male Mobile Gamer |author=Dan Laughlin |url=http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer#.VIl21DGUfjU=2014-11-09 |date=2014-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125905/http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer |archivedate=2014-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres are attracting one gender more than the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; {{Clear}}

===As player characters===

====Prevalence====
Playable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivory, J. D. (2006). [http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf Still a man's game: Gender representation in online reviews of video games.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224015022/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf |date=2014-12-24 }} Mass Communication &amp; Society, 9(1), 103-114. The sample of reviews was taken from the "Top Rated" and "Most Popular" lists from [[GameSpot]] on March 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. K., &amp; Summers, A. (2007). [http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf Gender differences in video game characters' roles, appearances, and attire as portrayed in video game magazines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101083815/http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf |date=2015-01-01 }} Sex roles, 57(9-10), 733-742.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by Melinda C. R. Burgess et al. found that men are featured much more often than women on the covers of console video games.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Melinda C. R. |author2=Steven Paul Stermer |author3=Stephen R. Burgess|title=Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Portrayal of Male and Female Characters on Video Game Covers|journal=Sex Roles|date=30 June 2007|pages=419–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9250-0|volume=57|issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"/&gt;

According to Madeline Messer writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2015, among the top 50 [[Platform game#Endless running game|endless running]] games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. Only 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=Madeline|title=I’m a 12-year-old girl. Why don’t the characters in my apps look like me?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/04/im-a-12-year-old-girl-why-dont-the-characters-in-my-apps-look-like-me/|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
[[Samus Aran]], the heroine of ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and its successors, is often cited as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream video game".&lt;ref name="Guinness2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd | authorlink=Feature: Girl Power-Up | year=2012 | page=154 | isbn=9781904994954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other earlier games featured female player characters, such as Toby Masuyo ("Kissy") from ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/namcoxcapcom/namcoxcapcom2.htm#tobymasuyo | title=Obscure Namco characters | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Kurt Kalata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2009/10/nintendo_download_13_14_october_2009_japan | title=Nintendo Download: 13-14 October 2009 (Japan) | publisher=nintendolife.com | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Sean Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Kurumi-Hime from ''[[Sega Ninja]]'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-princess/ | title=Ninja Princess | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=12 September 2017 | author=Sam Derboo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in ''Psychological Record'' (Vol.29, No.1. Pp.&amp;nbsp;43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer).&lt;ref name=leroux&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''Revue des Sciences de l'Education''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, professor [[Sara Kiesler]] et al. published a study in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (Vol.17, No.3.

The year 2013 featured women in leading roles in a number of award-winning games such as ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013), ''[[BioShock Infinite|Bioshock Infinite]]'' (2013), the rebooted ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2013), and ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'' (2013). A study of these games found that although the leading female characters in these games were able to subvert predominant gender stereotypes, women were still limited by men in the narratives, in particular through benevolent sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perreault|first=Mildred F.|last2=Perreault|first2=Gregory Pearson|last3=Jenkins|first3=Joy|last4=Morrison|first4=Ariel|date=2016-12-16|title=Depictions of Female Protagonists in Digital Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412016679584|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|doi=10.1177/1555412016679584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'' became a focus of discussions in gaming media. This indicated, according to game industry professionals cited by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', a shift in the industry's attention towards issues of diversity in gaming, in conjunction with video games as a whole growing beyond their former core audience of younger men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crecente|first1=Brian|title=As game players diversify, developers start to rethink the stars of their games|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/23/5834628/women-in-video-games-heroines-e3-2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=Polygon|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of color or [[people of color]] as a whole are less likely to be represented by the popular games and more likely to be represented as a stereotype.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Video Games|last=Peng|first=Mou|publisher=IGI Global|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a higher chance of people of color, especially women, to be portrayed as villains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blonde hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the evil villain character Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games that Peach was not kidnapped in were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series or had the pattern altered.&lt;ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games"&gt;[http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games "Objectification of Women in Video Games"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518004756/http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games |date=2015-05-18 }}, Retrieved 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In video games, the major stereotyped myths of women are typically the damsel in distress, hyper-sexualized villain (Sylvia Christel from ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'') and the sexy/strong best friend ([[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''). ... In all of these instances, the female character is, more likely than not, in love with the male protagonist or trying desperately to bang him."&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of games feature a female character as an ally or [[sidekick]] to the male hero. Some of them, like [[Ada Wong]] of ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and [[Mona Sax]] of ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', were turned into [[player character]]s in later instances of their series. [[Alyx Vance]], a supporting protagonist of ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was praised for her "stinging personality" and intelligence, developing a close bond with the player without simply being "eye candy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 Top 50 Videogame Hotties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002247/http://ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 |date=2009-02-15 }}.

===Sexualization===
The portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexualization]] of female characters, done to appeal to a presumed male audience,&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"/&gt; as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. Research on exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines has asked whether it reduces male compassion toward women, and reduces women's perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

====Prevalence====
In their 2005 study, Dill and Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as "eroticized aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dill|first=Karen E.|author2=Thill K. P.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles: Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions|journal=Sex Roles|year=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociology professor and researcher Tracy Dietz, women are often depicted in stereotypical roles that typically pertain to sexuality in which the woman focuses upon beauty/physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; According to an analysis conducted by Downs and Smith, playable and plot relevant characters in the 60 best selling video games of 2003 were predominantly male. Females who were depicted were frequently sexualized. The female characters analyzed were depicted partially naked or with unrealistic proportions more often than the male characters were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|date=2 September 2009|volume=62|issue=11-12|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|language=en|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 225 video game covers found that both male and female character's physiques were over-exaggerated, but women were more "physically altered" (especially in the bust) than their male counterparts, and even more so if the female was the main character of the game.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

A 2016 study of 571 games released between 1984 and 2014&lt;ref name="Lynch et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynch|first1=Teresa|last2=Tompkins|first2=Jessica E.|last3=van Driel|first3=Irene I.|last4=Fritz|first4=Niki|title=Sexy, Strong, and Secondary: A Content Analysis of Female Characters in Video Games across 31 Years|journal=Journal of Communication|date=30 June 2016|doi=10.1111/jcom.12237}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the sexualization of female characters was at its height between 1990 and 2005, and then began to significantly decline. It also determined that there was no significant difference in sexualization between games rated as "Teen" (for ages 13 and up) and "Mature" (17 and up) by the [[ESRB]], indicating that sexualized women in games are so prevalent that they are not thought of as objectionable to children. Less sexualization was found in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], which are played more often by women, than in action and fighting games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survey of 31 years of video games shows a decline in sexualized female characters|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-survey-years-video-games-decline.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 reboot of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' drew controversy when ''[[Kotaku]]'' described it as using rape for Lara Croft's character development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You'll 'Want To Protect' The New, Less Curvy Lara Croft|url=http://kotaku.com/5917400/youll-want-to-protect-the-new-less-curvy-lara-croft |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers denied that the scene depicted an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Are No Longer Referring to Game's Attempted 'Rape' Scene As an Attempted Rape Scene|url=http://kotaku.com/5918193/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-attempted-rape-scene-as-an-attempted-rape-scene |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Say 'Rape' Is Not A Word In Their Vocabulary|url=http://kotaku.com/5922228/tomb-raider-creators-say-rape-is-not-a-word-in-their-vocabulary |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of men==
Men are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. A recurring depiction of male sexuality is the ''power fantasy,'' where an apparent sexualization as an object of desire and [[hypermasculinity]] are overruled by the character's agency as the protagonist and  avatar for the player’s power within the game world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames.html|title=The Three Modes of Male Sexuality in Videogames|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As powerful===
Men in games tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Virtual muscularity: a content analysis of male video game characters|date=2011|journal=Body Image|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–51|vauthors=Martins N, Williams DC, Ratan RA, Harrison K|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2010.10.002|pmid=21093394}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Following the releases of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, [[Trevor Philips]] and [[Michael De Santa]], have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as "liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=On Gender and 'GTA 5'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/09/26/on-gender-and-gta-5/|accessdate=April 24, 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as "the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/are-video-games-really-sexist/?page=2|title=Are video games really sexist?|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamin Warren]] on PBS Game/Show highlighted that video games could promote "unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader". He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.&lt;ref name= GameShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrActT_7X6U |title=Do Videogame Stereotypes Hurt Men? |accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As sexualized===
Multiple critics point out the "[[male gaze]]" as the reason why male characters are not overtly sexualized in the same way as female characters are, mentioning the assumption in the video game industry that a majority of [[gamer]]s are heterosexual men, to whom companies cater.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/151713-on-mens-sexualization-in-video-games/|title=On Mens Sexualization in Video Games|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante Douglas of [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]] identifies the "power fantasy" alongside two other stereotypes, men as ''gender performance'' and as ''fan interpretation'':&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In the interpretation as gender performance under an heteronormative perspective, a male being sexy is seen as an opposite of masculinity. In this view, depictions of males as objects of desire are coded by including feminine traits, vanity and attention to personal attires, or [[queer]] codes, often depicted as humorous.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.your-critic.com/2011/06/gamers-gaze-part-1.html|title=Your Critic is in Another Castle: The Gamer's Gaze, part 1|website=www.your-critic.com|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishōnen]] archetype is an example of this portrayal, as well as characters like [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]] from ''Street Fighter'', [[Mettaton]] from ''Undertale,'' [[Maxi (Soulcalibur)|Maxi]] and [[Raphael (Soulcalibur)|Raphael]] from ''Soul Calibur'', and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] from ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A different way of sexualizing male characters is that performed by players and fans communities, in particular for characters open to their own emotions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Douglas identifies as traits of these characters the space dedicated in the game to show their personality, shown through their interactions with other characters, and their agency through those interactions rather than pure displays of strength and power. Because of these traits, this category of characters occurs most often with non-player characters.

==Portrayal of LGBT characters==
{{main article|LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters in video games}}

[[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]]) characters have been included in video games as early as the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":rated m"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rated M for Mature : Sex and Sexuality in Video Games|last=Wysocki|first=Matthew|last2=Lauteria|first2=Evan W.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781628925760|location=New York, NY|pages=42–57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 4 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Laura Kate|title=The Video Game Characters You Never Knew Were LGBT|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/10/04/the-video-game-characters-you-never-knew-were-lgbt|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Kotaku]] UK|date=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]], in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. Companies [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]] and [[Maxis]] policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt; Some games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as [[Birdo|Birdo from Super Mario Bros]], [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison from the Final Fight series]], and Flea from Chrono Trigger. Due to adherence to Nintendo's quality standards and translations based on preserving gameplay rather than literal meaning, these characters' identities were altered or erased in translation.&lt;ref name=":rated m" /&gt;

The video game industry is regarded as having [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] bias by numerous analysts.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hot Dates and Fairytale Romances: Studying Sexuality in Video Games|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415965780|location=New York, NY|pages=172–191|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":gay in games"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2009-07-01|title=Putting the Gay in Games Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/4/3/228|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=228–253|doi=10.1177/1555412009339729|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to industry professionals interviewed by Shaw, reasons for this [[heteronormativity]] include the demographic of those who play games, the views of those who create games, the risk of backlash in the industry, and the storytelling limitations of the medium.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;

Choice based LGBT content, such as optional same sex romance in Bioware games,&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krobová|first=Tereza|last2=Moravec|first2=Ondřej|last3=Švelch|first3=Jaroslav|title=Dressing Commander Shepard in pink: Queer playing in a heteronormative game culture|url=http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2015081905&amp;article=3|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=9|issue=3|doi=10.5817/cp2015-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a low- risk&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; form of representation that occurs only in video games.&lt;ref name=":at the edge"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaming at the Edge: Sexuality and Gender at the Margins of Gamer Culture|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8166-9315-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=13–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When representation is included, it is often through these in-game choices, which place the responsibility for representation on players instead of developers.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; Because they afford the most opportunity for player choice and in game romance, genres such as [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] are the most LGBT representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/25/a-gay-history-of-gaming|title=A Gay History of Gaming|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|date=2012-01-25|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another low risk method of LGBT representation is "Gay window gaming," which is LGBT representation that is either subtle or avoidable in games that serves to appeal to LGBT players without alienating straight or homophobic players. This can occur in sandbox games such as [[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]].&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

In games with LGBT characters or the option of an LGBT avatar, some aspects of marginalization that occur in contemporary culture are depicted despite the game's overall adherence to reality.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; These real social constraints are imposed on a virtual world due to the way games are constructed and the community that inhabits them. Games are made on contemporary culture's heteronormative basis, and this shapes narrative and characters. In the popular [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', for example, this has "created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle", according to a 2013 assessment of the game's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulos|first=Alexis|date=2013-03-01|title=Confronting Heteronormativity in Online Games A Critical Discourse Analysis of LGBTQ Sexuality in World of Warcraft|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/8/2/77|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=77–97|doi=10.1177/1555412013478688|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both members of the industry&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; and LGBT players&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; prefer LGBT representation to be normalized in game narratives rather than made to seem abnormal or special. There are no games produced specifically to appeal to an LGBT audience.&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2012-02-01|title=Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/14/1/28|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=28–44|doi=10.1177/1461444811410394|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT players prefer this so they can avoid marginalization in the gaming community.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer" /&gt;

LGBT gamers use queer readings of media to compensate for their lack of representation in it.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; As concluded in a study by Moravec, this "imaginative play" is the most common method LGBT gamers use to relate to in game avatars&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; that are typically created for a presumed straight male player to relate to.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the Ubisoft blog, Lucien Soulband, who is openly gay and was the writer for ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]'', said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5456234/video-games-wont-feature-gay-protagonists-for-a-while-says-far-cry-3|title=Video games won't feature gay protagonists 'for a while,' says Far Cry 3 writer Lucien Soulban|author=Gera, Emily|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2014-02-28|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Dorian in [[Dragon Age: Inquisition]] was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.&lt;ref name="outDorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/7/13/dorian-dragon-age-inquisition-why-gamings-breakout-gay-character-matters|last=Baume|first=Matt|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|title=Dorian of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Why Gaming's 'Breakout' Gay Character Matters|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more video games featuring themes related to LGBT characters and themes, the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) will include a video game awards category, the "Outstanding Video Game Award" for games with "outstanding LGBTQ-inclusive content", starting in its 30th [[GLAAD Media Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/27/17909964/glaad-media-awards-video-game-category | title = GLAAD awards will spotlight video games for the first time | first=  Owen | last =Good | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of gender representation in games==

=== Effect on attitudes towards gender ===
A 2008 study found that males reported playing more violent video games than females. This exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with attitudes supportive of rape.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, Karen E., Brian P. Brown, and Michael A. Collins. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001005 Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment]." Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 44.5 (2008): 1402-1408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===
Canadian non-profit [[MediaSmarts]] writes that "video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others", and despite their impact on the youth, "there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization."&lt;ref name=MediaSmarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/video-games/concerns-about-video-games |title=The Concerns About Video Games |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Tracy|title=An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior|journal=Sex Roles|year=1998|volume=38|pages=425–442|doi=10.1023/A:1018709905920|issue=5/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;

==Players' preferences==
Although games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better review scores, they sold fewer copies than games with exclusively male protagonists. [[Penny Arcade Report]] attributed the difference to larger marketing budgets for games with male heroes.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Games with exclusively female heroes don't sell (because publishers don't support them)|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321064024/http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them||archivedate=21 March 2013|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Penny Arcade Report|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012" /&gt; Male-only games included popular sports and war franchises such as ''Madden'' and ''Call of Duty'', and EEDAR's Jesse Divnich stated in 2010, "The factors that drive sales are based more on brand licensing, marketing budgets, development budget and a thousand other factors that have little to do with the gender of playable avatars."&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103045-EEDAR-Says-the-Chicks-Are-Alright|last=Chalk|first=Andy|work=The Escapist|title=EEDAR Says the Chicks Are Alright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling in 2015 by Pew Research Center showed 16% of adults who play video games believe most games portray women poorly, compared to 26% who disagree, and 34% who say it depends on the game. Among those who do not play, 55% are unsure if games portray women poorly. Minimal differences were seen between male and female responses.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by [[Rosalind Wiseman]] and [[Ashly Burch]] indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 survey of 1,266 gamers by Quantic Foundry, 89% of female gamers considered the inclusion of female protagonist option in games somewhat, very or extremely important; 64% of male gamers expressed the same views. Self-identified "hardcore" gamers of both genders, on average, considered a female protagonist less important than "core" or "casual" gamers did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Just How Important Are Female Protagonists?|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/08/29/just-important-female-protagonists/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guerrilla Tarbut''' (Hebrew: גרילה תרבות, "Cultural Guerrilla") is an [[activism|activist]] group of Israeli poets. Founded in 2007, the group aims to promote social and political causes through poetry, both in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], performed by its members during demonstrations against social injustice.

==Activities==
Guerrilla Tarbut's activities take a form which is somewhere between a [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]], and a poetry reading using a [[megaphone]]. 

The poets involved with Guerrilla Tarbut's activities read of their works during demonstrations. Sometimes singer-songwriters will attend also, and perform live during the activities in various musical styles. Although independent by nature, many of the group's activities are sponsored by Israeli poetry magazines, and coordinated with Israeli [[non-governmental organization]]s, including [[B'Tselem]], [[New Israel Fund]], and the [[Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition]]. Participants include poets and musicians of various ages and artistic styles, Jews and Arabs alike.

==Publications==
Guerrilla Tarbut's poets have also published three collections of their poems. The first collection, named ''Aduma'' (Hebrew: אדומה, "Red"), was published 1 May 2007 and concerned with workers' rights. The second collection, ''Latzet!'' (Hebrew: לצאת, "Out Now!"), was published on January 2009 as a response to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. The third, ''Poetry Dismantles A Wall'' (Hebrew: שירה מפרקת חומה) was published on 25 March and was a bilingual collection of Arabic and Hebrew poetry against the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] .

==Participants==
Poets who have taken part in Guerrilla Tarbut's events include: [[Eran Tzelgov]], [[Aharon Shabtai]], [[Yudit Shahar]], [[Roy Arad|Roy "Chicky" Arad]], [[Mati Shemoelof]], [[Ronny Someck]], [[Yuval Ben-Ami]], [[Joshua Simon]], [[Maya Bejerano]], [[Almog Behar]], [[Bo'az Yaniv]], [[Ronnie Hirsch]] and others.

==Ideology==
The group doesn't subscribe to a particular political manifesto, nor is it associated with any political party or movement. Similarly, the participating poets employ various poetical styles.

==Critical commentary and response==
The group's activities draw significant attention in the Israeli mainstream media, and in literary circles. [[Yitzhak Laor]], prominent leftist poet and publicist, argued that poetry cannot bring about change, and "teaching literature in the periphery is more important than reading poetry in front of a factory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3819266,00.html "Still Gloriously Bad"], [[Ynet]] (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Mr. Laor hinted that Guerilla Tarbut's activity "has emptied the term Guerrilla of al meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yitzhak Laor |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/literature/1.1206408 |title=כשהגרילה היתה גרילה |trans-title=When Guerrilla Was Guerrilla |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |language=Hebrew |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some poets object to the mixture of poetry and political activism, claiming that this mixture is "[[narcissistic]]", and self-serving for the poets themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.bananot.co.il/showPost.php?itemID=16682&amp;blogID=219 "Hot Firearm"], 5 June 2010 ''[[Makor Rishon]]'' (scan of newspaper clip, Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The group members, on the other hand, point out that less than a week after the poetic demonstration in the Akerstein factory in Yeruham, the hard-liner local executive was fired and some of the workers' demands were accepted. Similarly, following the demonstration in the coffee-shop in Tel Aviv, the waitresses' demands were fully granted. Each and every event gained valuable publicity for the corresponding campaign. Moreover, as one of the striking Akerstein's employees put it: "[Guerrilla Tarbut's visit] is empowering us in our struggle, it raises our spirits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleId=694333&amp;sid=126 "United Against Subjugation"], [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10 News]] (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roy Halston Frowick''' (April 23, 1932 – March 26, 1990), known simply as '''Halston''', was an American [[fashion designer]] who rose to international fame in the 1970s.

His minimalist, clean designs often made of [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] or [[ultrasuede]] were a new phenomenon in the mid-1970s [[discotheque]]s and redefined American fashion. Halston was known for creating a relaxed urban lifestyle for American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/fashion/1970s-fashion-moments-that-defined-seventies-style-96107|title=1970s Fashion: The Moments That Defined Seventies Style|date=2016-09-26|newspaper=Marie Claire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was frequently photographed at [[Studio 54]] with his close friends [[Liza Minnelli]], Bianca Jagger and artist [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name="sporkin"/&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Roy Halston Frowick was born on April 23, 1932 in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the second son of [[Norwegian-American]] [[accountant]] James Edward Frowick and his stay at home wife Hallie Mae (née Holmes). Halston developed an interest in sewing from his grandmother, and he began creating hats and altering clothes for his mother and sister as a boy. He grew up in Des Moines, and moved to [[Evansville, Indiana]] at the age of ten. He graduated from [[Benjamin Bosse High School]], in 1950.  He briefly attended [[Indiana University]] before enrolling at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="sporkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sporkin|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Waggoner|first2=Dianna|last3=McNeil|first3=Liz|last4= Stark|first4=John|last5=Kahn|first5=Toby|last6=Wilson|first6=Jana|date=April 9, 1990|title=The Great Halston|journal=People|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=33|issue=14|issn=0093-7673|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-great-halston-vol-33-no-14/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===

In 1952, Halston moved to [[Chicago]], where he enrolled in a night course at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] and he worked as a window dresser. In 1953, he opened his own hat business. His first customer was radio actress and comedian [[Fran Allison]]. Halston's hats were also bought by [[Kim Novak]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Hedda Hopper]].&lt;ref name="oliver1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-28/news/mn-228_1_fashion-industry|title=Halston, 57, Icon of Fashion Industry, Dies|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=March 28, 1990|publisher=latimes.com|page=1|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halston's first big break came when the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' ran a brief story on his fashionable hats. In 1957, he opened his first shop, the Boulevard Salon, on North [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]]. It was at this point that he began to use his middle name as his professional moniker. During his childhood he had been referred to as Halston to distinguish between himself and his uncle Roy. Halston moved to [[New York City]] in late 1957, first working for [[Hatmaking|milliner]] [[Lilly Daché]]. Within a year, he had been named the co-designer at Daché, became acquainted with several fashion editors and publishers, and left Daché's studio to become head milliner for department store [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in their customer milliner salon.&lt;ref name="oliver1"/&gt;

Halston achieved great fame after designing the [[pillbox hat]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] wore to her husband's [[John F. Kennedy 1961 presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]] in 1961, and when he moved to designing women's wear, ''[[Newsweek]]'' dubbed him "the premier fashion designer of all America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.januarymagazine.com/artcult/halston.html "As Good As the People He Dressed"], ''January Magazine''. Accessed February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When hats fell out of fashion, Halston moved on to designing clothing, made possible by Estelle Marsh, a millionaire from [[Amarillo, Texas]]. Mrs. Marsh was his sole financial backer during this critical time of development. He opened his first boutique on [[Madison Avenue]] in 1968. The collection that year included a dark jade velvet wedding gown for advertising executive [[Mary Wells Lawrence]]. Lawrence was married to the CEO of [[Braniff International Airways]], [[Harding Lawrence]]. She would be instrumental in bringing Halston to Braniff in 1976 to design Braniff's [[Air hostess|hostess]], pilot, ticket agent, and ground personnel uniforms.&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Mary Wells|title=A Big Life In Advertising|year=2002|publisher=Touchstone Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-7432-4586-5|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halston launched his first [[ready-to-wear]] line, Halston Limited, in 1969.&lt;ref name="wallstreet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122064202376704587|title=Halston: A Brand's Lifetime|date=September 8, 2008|publisher=wsj.com|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halston's design was usually simple and minimalist but sophisticated, glamorous but also comfortable at the same time. Halston like to use soft, luxurious fabric like silk and chiffon. He later told ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' that he got rid of "...all of the extra details that didn't work—bows that didn't tie, buttons that didn't button, zippers that didn't zip, [[wrap dress]]es that didn't wrap. I've always hated things that don't work."&lt;ref name="vogue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Halston|title=Halston|publisher=vogue.com|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another design characteristics was the use of bias. He believed that clothes cut and sewn from the [[bias]] of every fabric can develop a sexy, polished image. In past history, people had the interpretation that shows a woman's body shape was mainly through the curve of the clothing. Halston changed the fitted silhouette and created a new definition of showing the female body shape by allowing the natural flow of the fabric to create its own shape. Halston said "Pants give women the freedom to move around they've never had before. They don't have to worry about getting into low furniture or low sportscars. Pants will be with us for many years to come—probably forever if you can make that statement in fashion." In the 1970s, his ultra-suede suit was a big hit. He brought in functionality into fashion. He designed the Ultrasuede shirtdress and re-introduced pants for women. The shirtdress was interpreted as an elongated men's shirt. He also included elements of sportswear and combined it into women's clothing, merging features from both women wear and menswear together.

Halston's boutique drew celebrity clients like [[Babe Paley]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Margaux Hemingway]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Bianca Jagger]] and [[Liza Minnelli]] (both Jagger and Minnelli would become close friends).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/halston.html "Halston (Roy Halston Frowick) (1932–1990)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205065553/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/halston.html |date=February 5, 2007 }} Obituary. Accessed February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1973, his line earned an estimated $30 million.&lt;ref name="vogue"/&gt; In 1973, Halston sold his line to [[Norton Simon|Norton Simon, Inc.]] for $16 million but remained its principal designer. This afforded him creative control with near unlimited financial backing. In 1975, [[Max Factor]] released Halston's first namesake fragrance for women. By 1977, sales from the perfume had generated $85 million in sales.&lt;ref name="wallstreet"/&gt; Throughout the 1970s, Halston had expanded his line to include menswear, luggage, handbags, lingerie and bedding.&lt;ref name="blanks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3292682/The-mad-hatter.html|title=The Mad Hatter|last=Blanks|first=Tim|date=December 6, 2001|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=November 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031437/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3292682/The-mad-hatter.html|archivedate=April 30, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vogue'' later noted that Halston was responsible for popularizing [[caftan]]s, which he made for Jacqueline Kennedy;&lt;ref name="blanks"/&gt; [[matte jersey]] halter top dresses; and [[polyurethane]] in American fashion.&lt;ref name="vogue"/&gt;

===Uniforms for Braniff Airways===

Halston was very influential in the design of uniforms. In 1977 he was contracted by [[Braniff International Airways]] to create a new look for their flight attendants. He created muted brown uniforms with a distinctive "H" logo. Halston created interchangeable separates in shades of bone, tan and taupe which the airline extended to the seat covers, using brown Argentinean leather. The entire scheme was dubbed "Ultra Touch" by the airline in reference to Halston's ultrasuede designs, and was extremely evocative of the late 1970s. An elaborate party was thrown in February, 1977, dubbed Three Nights In Acapulco, to introduce the new Halston fashions along with the new and elegant [[Braniff International Airways]].

Braniff chairman [[Harding Lawrence]], his wife [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], First Lady [[Lady Bird Johnson]], and Halston himself along with his Halstonettes were in attendance for the grand presentation. Halston and his entourage would arrive at selected points during the party in outfits that matched the deep tones of Braniff Airways' new color schemes that would be applied to their aircraft as part of the new so-called Elegance Campaign. The party and the Halston creations were a hit not only with the fashion press but also with Braniff employees, who thought they were the easiest and most comfortable uniforms they had ever worn.&lt;ref name=Nance&gt;{{cite book|last=Nance|first=John J|title=Splash Of Colors The Destruction of Braniff International Airways|year=1984|publisher=William and Morrow Company|location=New York|isbn=0-688-03586-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was asked by the [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] to design the Pan American Games and [[U.S. Olympic Team]]'s uniforms in 1976. He also designed the uniforms for the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]], the [[New York Police Department]], and the [[Avis Rent a Car System]].

=== Later years ===

In 1983, Halston signed a six-year licensing deal, worth a reported $1 billion, with the retail chain [[J. C. Penney]]. The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200. At the time, the move was considered controversial, as no other high end designer had ever licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store. While Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been "cheapened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2013/02/28/retailerdesigner-collaborations-the-missing-link/|title=Retailer/Designer Collaborations -- The Missing Link|last=Petro|first=Greg|date=February 28, 2010|publisher=forbes|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bergdorf Goodman]] at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced.&lt;ref name="hyland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/halston-j-c-penney-3068848|title=Halston's Penney's Serenade|last=Hyland|first=Veronique|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=wwd.com|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Halston III line for J. C. Penney was poorly received and was eventually discontinued; however, this would pave the way for other high-end designers to sell their lines at stores of varying price levels in the future.

In 1983, Halston Limited, which was owned by Norton Simon, Inc., was acquired by Esmark Inc. After the acquisition, Halston began to lose control over his namesake company and grew frustrated. As the label changed hands (it would be owned by [[Playtex|Playtex International]], [[Beatrice Foods]] and four other companies),&lt;ref name="wallstreet"/&gt; Halston continued to lose control and, by 1984, was banned from creating designs for Halston Enterprise. He attempted to buy back his company through protracted negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/05/nyregion/making-it-work-dig-out-the-ultrasuede-halston-s-coming-back.html|title=Making It Work; Dig Out the Ultrasuede!

Halston was paid a salary by Revlon but had stopped designing clothing for the company but continue designing for family and friends most notably Liza Minnelli and Martha Graham. After his contract with Revlon expired, he was in talks to sign a new contract with the company but stopped negotiations after he learned that Revlon planned to continue the line without his input.&lt;ref name="oliver1"/&gt; The line continued on with various designers until 1990, when Revlon discontinued the clothing portion of the line but continued selling Halston perfumes.&lt;ref name="hochswender"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/18/business/revlon-will-discontinue-the-halston-label.html|title=Revlon Will Discontinue the Halston Label|last=Hochswender|first=Woody|date=August 18, 1990|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===

In 1988, Halston tested positive for [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]].&lt;ref name="wallstreet"/&gt; After his health began to fail, he moved to [[San Francisco]], where he was cared for by his family. On March 26, 1990, he died of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], an [[AIDS-defining clinical condition|AIDS-defining illness]], at the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="oliver1"/&gt; His remains were cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19900328&amp;id=YklWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6767,9034884|title=Designer dies from AIDS complications|date=March 28, 1990|work=Gainesville Sun|page=3A|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halston's favored troupe of models were known as the ''Halstonettes'', and included [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Heidi Goldberg]], [[Karen Bjornson]], [[Beverly Johnson]], Nancy North, Chris Royer, [[Alva Chinn]], Connie Cook, and [[Pat Ast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Story Lately Told: Coming of Age in Ireland, London, and New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NO5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-5630-5|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration ==

In June 1990, Halston's longtime friend, singer and actress [[Liza Minnelli]] sponsored a tribute at [[Lincoln Center]]'s [[Alice Tully Hall]] that was followed by a reception hosted by his friend [[Elsa Peretti]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed, J.D.  and Kathryn Jackson Fallon.

In 2010, Halston was the subject of the documentary ''Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1422786/|title=Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston|date=September 23, 2011|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2014 to January 2015, a traveling exhibition entitled ''Halston and Warhol Silver and Suede'' was sponsored by the Warhol Museum and co-curated by Halston's niece Lesley Frowick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/halston-and-warhol|title=Halston and Warhol: Silver and suede|website=Desmoisnesartcenter.org|date=2014|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February to April 2015, an exhibition was held in the museum of the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in New York City to celebrate Halston's 1970s fashions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/yves-saint-laurent-halston.php|title=Yves Saint Laurent + Halston: Fashioning the 70s|website=Fitnyc.edu|date=2015|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, ''Halston Style'', a retrospective of his career, opened at the [[Nassau County Museum]]. Curated by Lesley Frowick, it features material derived from his personal archives that he gave to her before his death.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to fashion critic [[Robin Givhan]], when [[Tom Ford]] relaunched [[Gucci]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] in the late 1990s, he found his inspiration in the glittering glamour of Halston's style: "When Ford added Yves Saint Laurent to his workload in 1999, he did due diligence in researching the house's history. But his work continued to display a louche attitude that recalled the best of Halston."&lt;ref name="fashionista 201505"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2015/05/halston-h-by-halston|title=Why the Halston name lives on|website=Fashionista.com|date=26 May 2015|author=Lauren Sherman|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Halston Heritage ==
=== History ===

Since Halston's death in 1990, his namesake company changed hands several times.

After Revlon ceased production of the clothing portion of the company in 1990, it was purchased by Borghese in 1991. In 1996, sportswear firm Tropic Tex bought the Halston clothing license (Revlon still retains the rights to Halston fragrances) and hired designer Randolph Duke to relaunch the line. Duke's first collection debuted in fall 1997 to critical acclaim. [[Mariah Carey]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Minnie Driver]] (who wore a crimson Halston dress to the [[70th Academy Awards]] ceremony) were among the celebrities to wear the new Halston creations. By 1998, Duke left the company after it was sold to [[Catterton Partners|Catterton-Simon]], a private equity fund.&lt;ref name="holson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/fashion/the-men-and-women-who-would-be-halston.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=The Men (and Women) Who Would Be Halston|last=Holson|first=Laura M.|date=September 2, 2011|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, African-American designer, Kevin Hall was hired to design the collection. He left Halston in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/halston/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Catterton-Simon sold Halston Enterprises to Neema Clothing. Neema's owner, James J. Ammeen, planned to relaunch the Halston line as a luxury brand and hired designer Bradley Bayou. Bayou's line, Bradley Bayou for Halston, was worn by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Queen Latifah]]. Bayou left Halston in 2005 after Ammeen refused to give Bayou more money for advertising.

In 2006, [[Jimmy Choo]] co-founder [[Tamara Mellon]], stylist [[Rachel Zoe]], and film producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] partnered with Hilco Consumer Capital to purchase the line in another effort to relaunch it. Problems about the line's new direction quickly arose when Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe could not agree on a designer. Former Versace designer Marco Zanini was eventually hired in July 2007. Zoe later said she was disappointed with Zanini's designs and was shut out of the designing process.

Zanini's Halston collection debuted in February 2008 to mixed reviews. Zanini left Halston in July 2008 and British designer, Marios Schwab, was hired in May 2009.&lt;ref name="holson"/&gt; Halston Enterprises then decided to launch a second line called Halston Heritage. The Heritage line is based on archived sketches by Halston with modern updates.&lt;ref name="fashionista 201505"/&gt; In 2009 actress [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] wore two Halston Heritage dresses in the film ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' and the company hired her as the president and chief creative officer for the main line. She also oversaw the Halston Heritage line.&lt;ref name="holson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sarah-jessica-parker-reportedly-signs-creative-director-halston-heritage-line-article-1.458647|title=Sarah Jessica Parker reportedly signs on to be 'creative director' for Halston Heritage line|website=Nydailynews.com|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Marios Schwab released his first Halston collection for the Autumn/Winter season.&lt;ref name="holson"/&gt; During her tenure as Creative Director, [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] choose iconic jeweler [[Jacqueline Rabun]] to design a selection of custom-made silver accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionaljeweller.com/jacqueline-rabun-jewels-light-up-ny-fashion-week/|title=Jacqueline Rabun jewels light up NY Fashion Week|website=Professionaljeweller.com|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, Schwab's collection debuted to negative critical reception.&lt;ref name="holson"/&gt;  In the August 2011 issue of American ''Vogue'', Sarah Jessica Parker revealed that she had left the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/sarah-jessica-parker-exits-halston-3718003|title=Sarah Jessica Parker Exits Halston, Is Harvey Weinstein Next?|last=Karimzadeh|first=Marc|date=July 13, 2011|publisher=wwd.com|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwab and [[Harvey Weinstein]] left the company shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="holson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2011/07/harvey-weinstein-marios-schwab-exit-halston|title=Harry Weinstein, Marios Schwab exit Halston|website=Fashionista.com|date=15 July 2011|author=Lauren Sherman|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Hilco Consumer Capital consolidated ownership and brought in Ben Malka, former president of BCBG, to continue the Halston Heritage business as Chairman and CEO. Malka enlisted the help of Marie Mazelis, the former creative director of Max Azria and Hervé Léger, to spearhead the re-launch of the contemporary line. Hilco decided to focus exclusively on the Halston Heritage ready-to-wear activity, and invested an additional $7.5 million for its development.&lt;ref name="fashionista 201505"/&gt;

In September 2012, the company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2012/09/halston-heritage-moves-operations-to-l-a-will-lose-the-studio-54-image|title=Halston Heritage moves operations to LA, will lose the 'Studio 54' image|website=Fashionista.com|date=21 September 2012|author=Dhani Mau|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Halston Heritage signed a deal with the [[Majid Al Futtaim Group]] for distribution of its products in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emirates247.com/business/corporate/halston-heritage-enters-uae-2013-02-25-1.496377|title=Halston Heritage enters UAE|website=Emirates247.com|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the company sold H by Halston and H Halston to the company Xcel that specializes in bringing fairly known brands to mass market outlets.&lt;ref name="fashionista 201505"/&gt;

The fall 2018 collection was focused on [[athleisure]] apparels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2018-ready-to-wear/halston-heritage|title=FALL 2018 READY-TO-WEAR Halston Heritage|website=Vogue.com|date=9 February 2018|author=Brooke Bob|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwd.com/runway/fall-2018/new-york/halston-heritage/review/|title=Halston Heritage RTW Fall 2018|website=Wwd.com|date=9 February 2018|author=Andrew Shang|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans-Joachim Bohlmann.jpg|thumb|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann in 2000.]]
'''Hans-Joachim Bohlmann''' (20 September 1937  –  19 January 2009) was a German serial [[Vandalism of art|vandal]] who primarily targeted artworks at public exhibitions. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138 million euro) by such artists as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave] Spiegel, 1 October 2005 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bohlmann was born in [[Breslau]] (modern Wrocław).

Since his youth, Bohlmann suffered from a serious [[personality disorder]]. At the age of 16, he voluntarily went to the psychiatric clinic of the [[University of Kiel]] and underwent [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock]] and [[insulin]] treatments. Around that time, he was a plumber apprentice, but could not focus on a single occupation and was doing various jobs. He had several therapy courses involving [[Sedative|tranquilizers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]] drugs, [[behavior therapy]] and [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]], but with very limited success.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In 1968, Bohlmann married and worked for six years at a warehouse. He then frequently took [[valium]] and [[haloperidol]] and regularly attended church masses. In 1974, he met the neurosurgeon Dieter Müller from the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]] who suggested a [[lobotomy]] treatment. Although Müller predicted a 75–80% chance of success, the operation brought no improvement. It was later criticized as obsolete and merely reduced Bohlmann's intelligence. On 11 March 1977, his wife fell from a window while cleaning and died from injuries soon after. According to Bohlmann, the death of his wife turned him to vandalism. Previously, he often visited museums with his wife and saw the importance of art in society. He then started to buy [[sulfuric acid]] at pharmacies and spray it on paintings.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

His vandalism began on 16 March 1977 in a city park and followed on 29 March 1977 in [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]], where he damaged the painting ''Golden Fish'' by [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/goldfish.jpg.html Klee: The Goldfish]. Artchive.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by other attacks in [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Essen]], [[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]], [[Bochum]], [[Kassel]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamelin]]. On 16 August 1977, he poured sulfuric acid on several artworks including portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the [[Lower Saxony State Museum]] of Hanover. On 24 August 1977, he damaged the painting ''Archduke Albrecht'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/sir-peter-paul-rubens-and-studio-siegen-1577-16-1-c-vcdsddiqxk Lot 89: Sir Peter Paul Rubens and Studio Siegen 1577 – 1640 Antwerp]. Invaluable.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; in Düsseldorf and on 7 October 1977 four paintings in [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in Kassel, estimated at more than 25 million euros, among them Rembrandt's [[:File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 062.jpg|''Jacob blessing Joseph's second son, 1656'']], a self-portrait by Rembrandt and [[Willem Drost]]'s ''Noli me tangere''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 30 Jahre nach Säureattentat: Willem Drosts "Noli me tangere" erstrahlt in neuem Glanz (30 years after acid attack: Willem Drosts' "Noli me tangere" shines in new splendor)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064922/http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 |date=19 July 2011 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In his attacks, Bohlmann was primarily targeting the faces of the personages, trying to inflict maximum damage. Bohlmann's activity was not restricted to paintings and museums; he ignited an altar in Lübeck and sprayed hundreds of tombstones with swastikas at night in Hamburg. The resultant outrage in the press encouraged him. As he felt he was becoming a celebrity, he abandoned the antidepressant drugs he had been taking.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

Bohlmann was arrested in October 1977 and in 1979 convicted by the Hamburg Regional Court to five years in prison for 17 cases of damage to public property, 3 cases of damage to private property and one case of cruelty to animals. He served the term in full until 6 October 1982.&lt;ref name=sp1&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,147904,00.html "Dürer-Attentäter" auf der Flucht] Spiegel, 31 July 2001 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; After release from prison, Bohlmann resumed vandalism. He was then banned from buying acid and instead committed arson at a construction site near Hamburg inflicting damage estimated at 65,000 euros. For this crime, the Hamburg Regional Court sentenced him to three years ending on 5 May 1986. A part of his pension was seized for the damage done to Ruben's ''Archduke Albrecht'', and in the autumn of 1987 he went for treatment in the psychiatric department of the Hospital Hamburg-[[Eilbek]].&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In March 1988, Bohlmann bought two litres of sulfuric acid and hid them in a park. On 20 April 1988, he took a leave from the hospital and the next day splashed acid on three paintings by Albrecht Dürer in Munich's [[Alte Pinakothek]], namely [[Lamentation of Christ (Dürer, Munich)|''Lamentation for Christ'']], [[Paumgartner altarpiece|''Paumgartner Altar'']] and [[:File:Albrecht Dürer 025.jpg|''Mater Dolarosa'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xKyeh1_V7IC&amp;pg=PA283|page=283|title=Albrecht Dürer: a guide to research|author=Jane Campbell Hutchison|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8153-2114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicting damage estimated at 35 million euros. Immediately after the attacks, he was arrested and held in the psychiatric hospital of [[Haar, Bavaria]]. In 1989 he was convicted by the Munich District Court to a two-year imprisonment, concurrent with treatment as long as necessary in a psychiatric hospital, and in March 1990 transferred to the clinic in Hamburg-Ochsenzoll. Bohlmann escaped from the facility in January 1998 and after being at large for two days he was found at a subway station, possibly on the way back to the hospital. On 30 July 2001 he escaped again but returned to hospital the next morning.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sp1/&gt;

In Ochsenzoll he attended art therapy and for nine years painted pictures, almost every day, with a total number of about 1,500. In January 2005, more than 16 years after his arrest in Munich, Bohlmann was released to public life. On 25 June 2006, in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, he splashed lighter fuel on the painting ''[[:File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster]]'' (1648) by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]] and set fire to it. Most damage was to the varnish layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en Van der Helst painting vandalised in Rijksmuseum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311023730/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en |date=11 March 2007 }} News item [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], retrieved 30-aug-09&lt;/ref&gt; Bohlmann was sentenced to 3 years by the court in Amsterdam. After serving two-thirds of the sentence, on 24 June 2008 he was released from prison, returned to Hamburg and died there on 19 January 2009 of cancer.

'''''In Vanda's Room''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''No Quarto da Vanda''''', 2000) is a [[docufiction]] (a subgenre of [[cinéma vérité]]) film by Portuguese director [[Pedro Costa]].

== Overview ==
The film follows the daily life of Vanda Duarte, a [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], in the [[Shanty town|shanty]] outskirts of [[Lisbon]]. The film's focus is also on the community of the district and its townscape. ''No Quarto da Vanda'' follows the drama film ''[[Ossos]]'' (1997) in which Vanda Duarte plays as an [[actress]].

The film took a year to shoot after the (mostly) one-person crew settled in the location, ''Fontainhas district'', where Vanda and the community including [[Cape Verde]]an [[immigrants]] lived depressed lives.

In spite of its three-hour length, the director Pedro Costa made the film in a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] style by using fixed shots entirely. Melancholic life of the community was shot on [[DV]] in a low-key way. Costa said about his impression of the district:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I entered the Fontainhas area, there were colors and smells that made me remember the things and events of the past, and also ideas about people to which I am attracted. These ideas nestled close to each other, living together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yidff.jp/2001/cat021/01c031-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film also sees this shanty district slowly being [[demolished]]. The displaced inhabitants are featured in Costa's next film ''[[Juventude em Marcha]]'' (''Colossal Youth'', 2006).

==Acclaim==
Despite its highly fictional nature, its elusive classification and its documentary-like hybridization allowed it to win the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize at the [[Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival]] in 2001 "for presenting life in its near-original form".&lt;ref&gt;http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Yamagata_International_Documentary_Festival/2001#FIPRESCI_Prize&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fipresci.org/awards/awards/awards_2001.htm#yamagata {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203083711/http://www.fipresci.org/awards/awards/awards_2001.htm |date=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Costa collected the France Culture Award (Foreign Cineaste of the Year) for directing the film at [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cannes_Film_Festival/2002#France_Culture_Award&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology''''', published in 1877, is a book of [[esoteric]] [[philosophy]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]'s first major work and a key text in her [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical movement]]. 

The work has often been criticized as a plagiarized occult work, with scholars noting how Blavatsky extensively copied from a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. Hart|Hart, James D]]; Leininger, Phillip. (1995). ''The Oxford Companion to American Literature''. Oxford University Press. pp. 71-72. {{ISBN|0-19-506548-4}} "After a period of spiritualism in America, Mme Blavatsky with the aid of Colonel Henry S. Olcott founded her Theosophical Society and published ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877), a plagiarized occult work denouncing the spiritualism she had formerly advocated."&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Isis Unveiled'' is nevertheless also understood by modern scholars to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. (1994). ''The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge''. State University of New York Press. pp. xv-x-x, 241-245. "The Western Esoteric Tradition has no more important figures in modern times than Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;Godwin, Joscelyn. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevir"&gt;Bevir, Mark. ''The West Turns Eastward: Madame Blavatsky and the Transformation of the Occult Tradition''. Journal of the American Academy of Religion. 62.3 (1994), pp. 747-767.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna'', in ''Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism''. ed. by Wouter J. Hanegraff (Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The work was originally entitled ''The Veil of Isis'', a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 [[Rosicrucian]] work by W.W. Reade. ''Isis Unveiled'' is divided into two volumes. Volume I, ''The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science'', discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, [[elementals]], [[psychic phenomena]], and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, ''Theology'', discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to [[Eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], the [[Vedas]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. It follows the [[Renaissance]] notion of ''[[prisca theologia]]'', in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient "Wisdom-Religion".&lt;ref name="Santucci"/&gt; Blavatsky writes in the preface that ''Isis Unveiled'' is "a plea for the recognition of the [[Hermetic philosophy]], the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena P., ''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology'' (Pasadena, CA: Theosophical University Press, 1999), vol. I. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Isis Unveiled'' is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction'' (Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition—[[perennial philosophy]], a [[Neo-Platonic]] [[Emanationism|emanationist cosmology]], [[adepts]], [[esoteric Christianity]]—and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, ''Isis Unveiled'' reflected many contemporary controversies—such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories on [[evolution]] and their impact on religion—and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Bruce F. ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 34-38, 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.

In later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in ''Isis Unveiled'' appeared in a significantly altered form,{{refn|group=note|name="conceptual shift in move to india"|This shift in thought is marked by Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society's move eastward to India.&lt;ref name="WEMS"&gt;''Helena Blavatsky: Western Esoteric Masters Series'', ed. by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2004), pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}} drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction.  Specifically, the few and—according to many—ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of ''Isis Unveiled'' stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888).  Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in ''Isis Unveiled'', attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in ''Isis Unveiled'' compared to those of later works.{{refn|group=note|name="HPBs elaboration on reincarnation in IU"|In the article ''Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits'' Blavatsky elaborately addressed the confusion related to the statements on reincarnation of ''Isis Unveiled'', stating in particular that: "[… T]he doctrine [of reincarnation] is maintained now as it was then.  Moreover, there is no 'discrepancy' but only incompleteness — hence, misconceptions arising from later teachings.".&lt;ref name=trs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits|journal=Articles from The Path — April 1886 to March 1896 |date=November 1886|volume= I|issue= 8|page=232|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/path/v01n08p232_theories-about-reincarnation-and-spirits.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|name="HPB on three- and sevenfold conception of man"|In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' Blavatsky explains that the sevenfold conception of man is the threefold conception of man, refined.  In section 6, ''Theosophical Teachings as to Nature and Man'', under the heading ''The Septenary Nature of Man'' it is asked: "Is it what we call Spirit and Soul, and the man of flesh?", to which is replied: "It is not. That is the old Platonic division. Plato was an Initiate, and therefore could not go into forbidden details; but he who is acquainted with the archaic doctrine finds the seven in Plato's various combinations of Soul and Spirit.".&lt;ref name=keytotheosophy&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=The Key to Theosophy|orig-year=1889|publisher= Theosophical University Press: Online Literature|isbn=1-55700-046-8|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern Theosophists hold the book as a [[Revelation|revealed]] [[Religious text|work]] dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's [[Ascended master|Masters]].&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ‘The Coming of the Masters: The Evolutionary Reformulation of Spiritual Intermediaries in Modern Theosophy’, in ''Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western Esotericism'', ed. Andreas B. Kilcher (Leiden &amp; Boston, MA: Brill, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Emmette Coleman.png|thumb|[[William Emmette Coleman]]]]
Detractors often accuse the book of extensive unattributed [[plagiarism]], a view first seriously put forth by [[William Emmette Coleman]] shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as [[Mark Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Sedgwick|Sedgwick, Mark]]. (2004). ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|0-19-515297-2}} "''Isis Unveiled'' was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's ''Sod, the Son of Man'', 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's ''History of Magic'', and so on)."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Geoffrey Ashe]] notes that ''Isis Unveiled'' combines "comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a mélange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]]. (2001). ''Encyclopedia of Prophecy''. ABC-CLIO. p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Isis Unveiled'' makes use of a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: "Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas."&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Modern copies of ''Isis Unveiled'' are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.

Historian [[Ronald H. Fritze]] considers ''Isis Unveiled'' to be a work of [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009). ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions''. Reaktion Books. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Henry R. Evans]], a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a "hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry R. Evans|Evans, Henry R]]. (1897). ''Hours with the Ghosts, or, Nineteenth Century Witchcraft: Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Theosophy''. Laird &amp; Lee. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing ''Isis Unveiled'' and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time.&lt;ref name="Olcott"&gt;Olcott, Henry. ''Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, I'' (Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1972), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci 2"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''The Notion of Race in Theosophy'', in ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 11.3 (2008), pp. 37-63&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and [[Occultism]] as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding [[Spiritualism]] movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later [[Ascended master|Masters]], rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals—who helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her—under a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"/&gt;

[[Sten Bodvar Liljegren]] notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing [[orientalism]] of the period, the novels of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, A. L. (1958). ''Through a Glass Darkly: Spiritualism in the Browning Circle by Katherine H. Porter; Bulwer-Lytton's Novels and "Isis Unveiled" by S. B. Liljegren''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 2, No. 2. pp. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:005-1134.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] of actor with three Kuroko]]
[[File:Kurogo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Kuroko'' behind actors on stage]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kuroko''''' |黒子|"black person"/"black clothes"}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/unesco/kabuki/jp/4/4_04_07.html&lt;/ref&gt; are [[stagehand]]s in traditional [[theatre of Japan|Japanese theatre]], who dress all in black. 

In [[kabuki]], the ''kuroko'' serve many of the same purposes as [[running crew]]. They move [[scenery]] and [[Theatrical property|props]] on stage, aiding in scene changes and costume changes. They will also often play the role of animals, will-o-the-wisps, or other roles which are played not by an actor in full costume, but by holding a prop. ''Kuroko'' wear all black, head to toe, in order to imply that they are invisible and not part of the action onstage.

The convention of wearing black to imply that the wearer is invisible on stage is a central element in ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre as well. ''Kuroko'' will wear white or blue in order to blend in with the background in a scene set, for example, in a snowstorm, or at sea, in which case they are referred to as {{nihongo|"Yukigo"|雪子|snow person}} or {{nihongo|"Namigo"|波子|wave person}} respectively. As this convention was extended to kabuki actors depicting stealthy [[ninja]], historian [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]] suggested that the stereotypical image of a ninja dressed all in black derived from kabuki. The theatrical convention of dressing ninja characters as apparent stagehands to imply stealth and to surprise audiences contributed to this popular image, in contrast to the historical reality that real ninjas usually dressed like civilians.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Stephen (2003). "Ninja: AD 1460-1650." Oxford: Osprey Publishing. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Noh]] theatre, a ''kōken'', wearing black but no mask, serves much the same purpose.

==Examples from popular culture==
* Kuroko methods were often used by the late [[Nagi Noda]], notably in the [[Scissor Sisters]] music video for [[She's My Man]] and the [[Meg (singer)|MEG]] video for  Precious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wearepopslags.com/2008/meg-precious-j-pop/ Precious] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529081022/http://www.wearepopslags.com/2008/meg-precious-j-pop/ |date=2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Kuroko character appears in some of the [[Samurai Shodown (series)|Samurai Shodown]] and [[Power Instinct (series)|Power Instinct]] video games as the referee, and also a secret playable character occasionally.
* Kuroko were Ryoko Mendou's personal servants in the manga and anime series ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]''.
* Kuroko are used extensively in two [[Super Sentai]] series, namely "''[[Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger]]''" (2002) and "''[[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger]]''" (2009). In the latter's case, when ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' crossed over with ''Shinkenger'', Tsukasa Kadoya a.k.a. [[Kamen Rider Decade (character)|Kamen Rider Decade]] appears in the Sentai's world as one of the Kuroko of the Shiba household.
*The title character of [[Kuroko's Basketball]] has the ability of misdirection, which makes him quasi invisible. This is a reference to the invisibility of the kuroko.
* In [[Monster Musume]] Kuroko is the first name of the government agent, Ms.Smith. She wears all black and likes to manipulate the other characters and events of the series from the background.
* In the variety show [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]], [[Hitoshi Matsumoto]] is assisted by the other show members -whom are all dressed as Kuroko- in order to achieve nonsensical sports challenges.

A '''lamba''' is the traditional garment worn by  men and women that live in  [[Madagascar]]. The textile, highly emblematic of Malagasy culture, consists of a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the body.&lt;ref&gt;Tortora, P.G. &amp; Merkel, R.S. (1996). ''Fairchild's Dictionary of Textiles.'' New York: Fairchild Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional lambas used for burial were often made of [[silk]] and cow hides while those for daily wear were more often made of [[raffia]], pig skin, [[cotton]] or [[Bast fibre|bast]]. They could range in color from a tie-dyed mess or solid white cloth, to striped red, white and black cloth found in most parts of the island, the geometric patterns in unique shades of green and brown produced by a handful of [[Sakalava]] villages, or the brilliantly multi-colored, complex weaves favored by the pre-colonial [[Merina]] aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. (Ed.). (1996). "Madagascar", in ''The Dictionary of Art, Volume 20''. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is common to find printed cotton or rayon lambas produced in India for the Malagasy market in addition to those fabricated locally.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;Green, R.L. (2003). Lamba hoany: proverb cloths from Madagascar. ''Africa Arts, 36''(22), pp. 30–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides its daily use as basic clothing, the lamba is also used for tying children to mothers' backs or as a cushion when carrying a heavy object on top of the head. The lamba is also used ritually to wrap the remains of the dead before placing them in the family tomb. Which after the ceremony are then 
placed on the dead for an order of respect to their souls.

==In Malagasy culture==
[[File:Merina woman wearing lamba.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Merina woman in a white lamba]]
The term ''lamba'' is the name in the Highlands dialect of the woven cloth that traditionally formed the essential article of clothing throughout Madagascar.  This garment is known by other words in various regions where other dialects are spoken; in some parts of the east, for instance, the garment is known by the word ''simbo''.&lt;ref name="envoys"&gt;Mullen Kreamer, Christine and Fee, Sarah. ''Objects as Envoys: Cloth, Imagery and Diplomacy in Madagascar.'' Smithsonian Institution, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ways in which the cloth may be wrapped around the wearer are specified by a wide variety of terms that vary from region to region.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt; The color, print and type of cloth varies from region to region.  The largest lambas (''lambamena'') are made of a heavy white silk and are used to wrap the bodies of the deceased before placing them in [[architecture of Madagascar|the family tomb]].  Among some ethnic groups, lambas were also traditionally exchanged between a man and woman as part of their engagement ceremony, or as diplomatic gifts, as demonstrated by the two detailed silk ''lamba akotofahana'' (one multicolored, the other white-on-white) given in 1886 to President [[Grover Cleveland]] by Queen [[Ranavalona III]] on display at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of African Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/malagasy/queen.html ''Gifts and Blessings: The Textile Arts of Madagascar.''] Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Accessed on November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - comparison coastal style.JPG|thumb|lright|Colorful prints from Asia are popular in coastal towns.]]
There are numerous types of lambas produced in Madagascar.  The names can serve to distinguish the material used, pattern type, ritual purpose of the garment or the intended wearer.  Names of lambas vary from one region to the next according to local dialects, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather representative of some of the most commonly distinguishable types of lamba.It is many types in Madagascar

====Lambahoany====
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - detail lambahoany.JPG|thumb|right|Lambahoany reading ''Coming home is lovely'']]
A printed cotton lamba typically featuring a proverb on the lower border of the design, identical to the [[Kanga (African garment)|kangas]] worn throughout eastern Africa.  The lambahoany is presently the most commonly worn type of lamba.  These are traditionally made of printed cotton featuring a repeated border design that encloses either a secondary pattern (often around a central medallion) or a large image depicting a pastoral scene from daily life.  A popular proverb, or ''[[hainteny#Ohabolana|ohabolana]]'', is typically written just above the center of the lower border. 
The uses of the ubiquitous lambahoany are numerous and varied.  They are often wrapped to attach an infant to its mother's back, freeing her hands for other uses.  They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a transport sack, a table cloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they can be used as a cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

====Lamba akotofahana====
A woven silk lamba featuring highly complex geometric designs.

====Lamba mpanjaka====
A ceremonial lamba traditionally worn by nobles, the wealthy, or elders.

====Lambamena====
[[File:Madagascar lambas in shop.JPG|thumb|Lambamena shop]]
A silk burial shroud.

====Lamba arindrano====
A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and cotton.

====Jabo-landy====
A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and raffia fibers.

====Laimasaka====
A traditional [[Sakalava]] raffia lamba commonly decorated with geometric [[ikat]]-dyed patterns and often used as a burial shroud.
It is still a tradition in Madagascar..

====Salaka====
A lamba worn as a loincloth, measuring about 30&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 300&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt;

===Modes of use===
[[File:Hira gasy musicians 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Hiragasy musicians wearing coordinating lambas]]
The style of wearing the lamba likewise varies between regions and according to the gender of the wearer.  Both sexes will wrap it around the waist, much like a sarong.  Women will also wear it wrapped over or beneath the bust to form a sheath dress, often with matching lamba headdress.  These styles can be paired with a tank top or other light shirt.

Men may drape the lamba over one shoulder as a shawl over shorts or – in cooler weather – over a ''malabary,''  a long-sleeved, knee-length cotton tunic.  Traditionally, the lamba is draped over the left shoulder but is draped over the right when in mourning.  Among mature [[Merina]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Betsileo]] women, wearing a narrower version of the traditionally white lamba around the shoulders is a mark of "elegance, dignity, femininity and respect for tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Ranaivoson, D. (2007). ''100 Mots pour comprendre Madagascar.''  Paris: Maisonneuve &amp; Larose. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrow lambas may be worn like a sash.  Men drape them diagonally across the chest or knot them around the waist, while women may wear them loosely over the shoulders.  The sash-like fashion was popularized due to European influence and is especially typical of the costume of [[hiragasy]] dancers.

==Production==
Traditional lambas were most often woven on horizontal ground looms, the most common type of loom found in Madagascar. The weaver was most often a woman and would be seated to one side of the loom as she worked the threads.&lt;ref name="unwrapping"&gt;Kusimba, Chapurukha; Odland, J. Claire; Bronson, Bennet (Eds.). ''Unwrapping the Textile Traditions of Madagascar.'' Regents of the University of California, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For many women, weaving formed a basic domestic responsibility required to produce clothing for family members. Surplus could be sold to supplement family income; this occurred most often among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt;

==As art==
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - three styles of lambahoany.JPG|thumb|left|Three lambahoany showing pastoral scenes from daily life]]
The ''lamba akotofahana,'' the highly colorful lamba weaving style associated with the [[andriana|Merina aristocracy]], consisted of complex geometric designs created by the uniquely [[Merina]] practice of using extra heddles across the loom to create raised bands of pattern.  This striking statement of [[andriana]] class distinction in the imperial era was preserved in a toned-down form under colonial rule: the same intricate patterns were retained but the designs were woven in white-on-white to draw less attention to the statement of class and ethnic identity they made.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, C. (2010). ''African Art in Detail.'' London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the interest in (and demand for) traditional, highly-colored ''lamba akotofahana'' has increased among well-to-do Malagasy expatriates, tourists and textile aficionados, which has led to a resurgence in their production and sale in fine art galleries in Antananarivo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/s/silk_textile_lamba_akotofahan.aspx Silk Textile: Lamba Akotofahana] British Museum.  Accessed on November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary artists have turned their attention to the resurrection of these ancient, half-forgotten techniques, producing unique works of art featured in exhibitions at internationally renowned museums.  At the [[American Museum of Natural History]], for instance, a ''lamba akotofahana'' was displayed that had been woven entirely from the silk threads produced by the female [[Nephila inaurata|golden orb-weaver spider]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/spidersilk/ One Million Wild Spiders from Madagascar Supplied Silk for Rare Textile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017002613/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/spidersilk/ |date=2010-10-17 }} American Museum of Natural History. Accessed on November 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lamba akotofahana'' exhibiting the full range of colors and detailed patterns of the shawls worn by pre-colonial nobles, woven by artist Martin Rakotoarimanana, has likewise been recently displayed at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Acquisitions: A Selection, 1998–1999," The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, v. 57, no. 2 (Fall, 1999).

The text says, "''Let the whole Party mobilize its membership to practice agriculture on a large scale; let them fight to popularize Dazhai County (''sic'')!''"]] --&gt;
The "'''Learn from Dazhai in agriculture'''" Campaign ({{zh|c={{linktext|农业|学|大寨}}|p=nóngyè xué Dàzhài}}, or in [[Wade-Giles]] [[Romanization]] '''Tachai''') was a campaign organized by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1963. The campaign encouraged peasants from all over China to follow from the example of the farmers of [[Dazhai]] village, [[Shanxi]], by practicing self-sacrifice and upright political activity.

It grew in importance after the introduction of the [[Cultural Revolution]], but [[Chen Yonggui]] and its other proponents were eventually eased out of power by [[Deng Xiaoping]] following the removal of the [[Gang of Four]].

==History==

Slogans associated with Dazhai included: "Move the mountains to make farm fields," "Change the sky and alter the land," "Work bitterly, diligently, and with extra energy, and build our village into a Dazhai-like one in three years."

During the years until the downfall of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, particularly the [[Cultural Revolution]], farmers from all over the country were organized to visit Dazhai, and well-trained tour guides took posts at important scenes to explain to visitors how the villagers in Daizhai made such achievements with their own hands. One of such scenes was the top of the [[Tiger Head Mountain]] where visitors could have a panoramic view of the farm fields, the major irrigation projects as well as the residential area of the villagers. Perhaps hundreds of millions of farmers visited the place during the period and the expenses on their trips were paid{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} by the government.

At this time, farmers throughout China were expected to show their political zeal in following [[Mao Zedong]]'s directive "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" ("农业|学大寨"). They not only worked during the day, but at night as well, not only in the warm season, but in the depth of winter—a dramatic deviation from their age-old practice. In many places, the farmers literally—and blindly—moved hills (sometimes proclaimed as "mountains"), built reservoirs, tunnels, canals, and so on. As mental motivation, loud speakers were installed at work sites to broadcast music and songs and films were shown at night on the scene while the farmers took a break. 

Meanwhile, a number of leaders of the village made dramatic advances in their political careers. [[Chen Yonggui]], the patriarchal leader of the village, was put to the position of [[vice premier]] of the central government despite the fact that he was only semiliterate. ([[Zhou Enlai]] was the [[premier]] of the time.) [[Guo Fenglian]], the Dazhai [[party secretary]], was a favorite of [[Jiang Qing]] (the wife of [[Mao Zedong]]), and played a significant part in the Chinese political scene.

This campaign was as much political as it was agricultural, and it came to an abrupt end upon Mao's death in 1976.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} After the victory of [[Deng Xiaoping]] over [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Chen Yonggui]], and others following the removal of the [[Gang of Four]] from power, his [[economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] has caused Dazhai to become a figure of ridicule, since it was so closely linked to Maoist communal agriculture and socialist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/0927/dazhai.html TIMEasia.com | Visions of China: Dazhai | 9/27/99&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacu.org/learntachai.html Learn from Dazhai&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Dazhai is a regional tourist attraction.

{{nihongo|'''''Maki-e'''''|蒔絵||literally: sprinkled picture}} is [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a ''makizutsu'' or a [[kebo]] brush. The technique was developed mainly in the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) and blossomed in the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power.

To create different colours and textures, maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, aluminum, platinum, and pewter, as well as their alloys. Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. Kōami Dōchō (1410–1478) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. Kōami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of [[Japan]].

Takamakie (or "raised maki-e") is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making. Developed in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573), the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder, lacquer, and charcoal or clay dust.

Another special kind of maki-e is togidashi maki-e, where a black lacquer without oil is put on the metal decoration as an additional coat.

'''''Metamorphosis of Narcissus''''' (1937) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the [[Catalan phonology|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. This painting is from Dalí's [[Paranoiac-critical method|paranoiac-critical]] period. According to [[Greek mythology]], [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalized him as a flower. Dalí completed this painting in 1937 on his long-awaited return to [[Paris]] after having had great success in the [[United States]].

The painting shows Narcissus sitting in a pool, gazing down. Not far away there is a decaying stone figure which corresponds closely to him but is perceived quite differently; as a hand holding up a bulb or egg from which [[Narcissus (plant)|a Narcissus]] is growing. The egg has been used as a symbol for sexuality in other paintings by Dalí. In the background, a group of naked figures can be seen, while a third Narcissus like figure appears on the horizon.

Dalí wrote the following poem, which accompanied the painting when it was initially exhibited:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
Under the split in the retreating black cloud 
the invisible scale of spring 
is oscillating 
in the fresh April sky. 
On the highest mountain, 
the god of the snow, 
his dazzling head bent over the dizzy space of reflections, 
starts melting with desire 
in the vertical cataracts of the thaw 
annihilating himself loudly among the excremental cries of minerals, 
or 
between [sic] the silences of mosses 
towards the distant mirror of the lake 
in which, 
the veils of winter having disappeared, 
he has newly discovered 
the lightning flash 
of his faithful image. 
It seems that with the loss of his divinity the whole high plateau 
pours itself out, 
crashes and crumbles 
among the solitude and the incurable silence of iron oxides 
while its dead weight 
raises the entire swarming and apotheosic 
plateau from the plain 
from which already thrust towards the sky 
the artesian fountains of grass 
and from which rise, 
erect, 
tender, 
and hard, 
the innumerable floral spears 
of the deafening armies of the germination of the narcissi.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith]], ''The Persistence of Memory: A Biography of Dalí'', New York 1993, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt;

the innumerable floral spears 
of the deafening armies of the germination of the narcissi.
Already the heterosexual group, in the renowned poses of preliminary expectation, conscientiously ponders over the threatening libidinous cataclysm, the carnivorous blooming of its latent morphological atavisms.
In the heterosexual group, 
in that kind date of the year 
(but not excessively beloved or mild), 
there are 
the Hindou 
tart, oily, sugared 
like an August date, 
the Catalan with his grave back 
well planted 
in a sun-tide, 
a Whitsuntide of flesh inside his brain,
the blond flesh-eating German, 
the brown mists 
of mathematics 
in the dimples 
of his cloudy knees, there is the English woman, 
the Russian, 
the Swedish women, 
the American 
and the tall darkling Andalusian, 
hardy with glands and olive with anguish.
Far from the heterosexual group, the shadows of the avanced [sic] afternoon draw out across the countryside, and cold lays hold of the adolescent’s nakedness as he lingers at the water’s edge.
When the clear and divine body of Narcissus 
leans 
down to the obscure mirror of the lake,
when his white torso folded forward 
fixes itself, frozen, 
in the silvered and hypnotic curve of his desire, 
when the time passes 
on the clock of the flowers of the sand of his own flesh,
Narcissus loses his being in the cosmic vertigo 
in the deepest depths of which 
is singing 
the cold and Dyonisiac siren of his own image. 
The body of Narcissus flows out and loses itself 
in the abyss of his reflection, 
like the sand glass that will not be turned again.
Narcissus, you are losing your body, 
carried away and confounded by the millenary reflection of your 
disappearance 
your body stricken dead 
falls to the topaz precipice with yellow wreckage of love, 
your white body, swallowed up, 
follows the slope of the savagely mineral torrent 
of the black precious stones with pungent perfumes, 
your body ... 
down to the unglazed mouths of the night 
on the edge of which 
there sparkles already 
all the red silverware 
of dawns with veins broken in ‘the wharves of blood’.
Narcissus, 
do you understand? 
Symmetry, divine hypnosis of the mind’s geometry, already fills up your 
head, 
with that incurable sleep, vegetable, atavistic, slow 
Which withers up the brain 
in the parchment substance 
of the kernel of your nearing metamorphosis.
The seed of your head has just fallen into the water.
Man returns to the vegetable state 
by fatigue-laden sleep 
and the gods 
by the transparent hypnosis of their passions. 
Narcissus, you are so immobile 
one would think you were asleep. 
If it were a question of Hercules rough and brown, 
one would say: he sleeps like a bole [sic]
in the posture 
of an Herculean oak. 
But you, Narcissus, 
made of perfumed bloomings of transparent adolescence, 
you sleep like a water flower.
Now the great mystery draws near, 
the great metamorphosis is about to occur.
Narcissus, in his immobility, absorbed by his reflection with the digestive slowness of carnivorous plants, becomes invisible.
There remains of him only 
the hallucinatingly white oval of his head, 
his head again more tender, 
his head, chrysalis of hidden biological designs, 
his head held up by the tips of the water’s fingers, 
at the tips of the fingers 
of the insensate hand, 
of the terrible hand, 
of the excrement-eating hand, 
of the mortal hand 
of his own reflection.
When that head slits 
when that head splits 
when that head bursts, 
it will be the flower, 
the new narcissus,|sign=[[Salvador Dalì]]|source=[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dali-metamorphosis-of-narcissus-t02343/text-catalogue-entry]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20164">'''More Fire! Productions''' was a women's theatre collective active in New York City from 1980 to 1988.  It was founded by [[Robin Epstein]] and [[Dorothy Cantwell]] and based in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] section of lower Manhattan, [[New York City]]. More Fire! Productions created and produced eight full-length plays between 1980 and 1988, becoming known as "one of the city's leading women's theatre groups" for its contributions to the downtown, [[experimental theatre]] and women's and [[lesbian]] theatre scenes of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Dunning, "What's Doing in Town and Out," ''New York Times'', 24 May 1985: C22.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein and Cantwell co-wrote, produced, and performed in the company's first three plays: ''As the Burger Broils'' (1980), ''The Exorcism of Cheryl'' (1981), and ''Junk Love'' (1981), which had numerous runs and became a neighborhood cult classic, "the longest running show on Avenue A."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Schulman, "E. Village Alternative to Therapy: ''Junk Love'' and ''Exorcism''," ''Womanews'' (February 1982). See also Stephen Holden, "Avant-Garde Antics for the Adventurous," ''New York Times'', 5 September 1986: C5.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein then wrote and produced ''The Godmother'' (1983). Novelist and writer [[Sarah Schulman]] joined the company in 1983 and collaborated on the writing and performing of three later plays: ''Art Failures'' (1983), ''Whining and Dining'' (1984), and ''Epstein on the Beach'' (1985). The final play, ''Beyond Bedlam'' (1987), was written and produced by Epstein, who was the only person involved in all More Fire! plays.

==Early history==
Along with [[Epstein]] and Cantwell, another founding member of More Fire! was Stephanie Doba, who collaborated on and performed in six More Fire! plays. In the mid-1970s Doba was working at The Kosciuszko Foundation, a [[Polish-American]] [[non-profit]] organization having its headquarters in New York City. She was asked by Polish theatre director [[Jerzy Grotowski]] to help facilitate the participation of Americans in the "Tree of People," a new project of his Polish Laboratory Theatre. Grotowski's work at that time embodied a search for authentic expression through [[improvisation]] and interaction among participants, rather than performance for audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Grimes, "The Theatre of Sources," ''The Drama Review'' 25, no. 3 (1981): 67; Daniel E. Cashman, "Grotowski: His Twentieth Anniversary," ''Theatre Journal'' 31, no. 4 (1979): 460-66; Robert Findlay, "Grotowski's 'Cultural Explorations Bordering on Art, Especially Theatre,'" ''Theatre Journal'' 32, no. 3 (1980): 349-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantwell and Doba met as participants in the Tree of People project in [[Wroclaw]], Poland, in the winter of 1979.&lt;ref name="Tarzian"&gt;Charles Tarzian, "Performance Space P.S. 122," ''The Drama Review'' 29, no. 1 (1985): 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grotowski's focus on improvisatory expression matched and nurtured a strong interest in movement improvisation in the downtown community of the East Village in the late 1970s. Open Movement, the weekly participatory event held at [[Performance Space 122]] (also known as P.S. 122), became a regular meeting ground for New York and European dancers, actors and other artists, a number of whom had taken part in Grotowski's projects. Cantwell, Doba and Epstein were all regular participants in Open Movement.&lt;ref name="Tarzian"/&gt; Cantwell and Doba began collaborating with Epstein, who was then primarily a painter, to create an avant-garde, experimental theatre style.&lt;ref name="Mernit"&gt;Susan Mernit, "Robin Epstein: From Painter to Playwright," ''New Women's Times Feminist Review'' (November/December 1984): 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another founding member was Marianne Willtorp, now a member of the [[Swedish Film Institute]] (Svenska Filminstitutet). Willtorp collaborated on and performed in ''The Exorcism of Cheryl'', ''Junk Love'', and ''The Godmother''. Willtorp's 1981 documentary film "More Fire!" explores the making of the collective's first original experimental play, ''As the Burger Broils'', which used the movement and physicality of restaurant work to create theatre. The film shows the company's improvisational use of restaurant movement and language, and its real-life context in Epstein and Cantwell's lives as busy East Village artists and actresses who earned their livings as waitresses.

As co-founders of More Fire! Productions, Epstein and Cantwell shared a joint vision and aesthetic. Cantwell's writing and acting abilities were crucial to the company's early success.  Her primary interest was in creating a passionate, funny, excessive style of acting, using characters and situations drawn with broad strokes and shameless exaggeration. Cantwell's ability to improvise and understanding of theatre inspired and shaped Epstein's own theatrical vision, which also developed out of her work as a painter, interest in popular film, and background as a working-class [[Jewish]] New Yorker.&lt;ref name="Mernit"/&gt; More Fire! used the superficial appearance of autobiography––particularly Epstein's––as a framework for the satirical exploration of a variety of themes and genres, including the confessional style of some East Village [[performance art]]. The company's style developed through collaborative improvising and writing, with lesbians and straight women working together to create and sustain an avant-garde, alternative theatre company.

==Later history==
In 1983, Cantwell began to perform with Good Medicine and Company, founded by carlos ricardo martinez and downtown actor/playwright [[Jeff Weiss]]. She performed in carlos ricardo martinez's ''Teddy and the Social Worker'' and ''Art the Rat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.test-traveler.de/performances.htm Peter Rose - performance history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She starred with Jeff Weiss in his long-running, episodic show, ''. . . and That's How the Rent Gets Paid (Part IV)''.&lt;ref&gt;William Harris, "How Weiss Pays the Rent," ''East Village Eye'', February 1984; Sarah Schulman, ''Stage Struck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America.'' Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1998, 57-61; Dianne Chisholm, ''Queer Constellations: Subcultural Space In The Wake Of The City'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantwell also performed with Weiss and members of the [[Wooster Group]], including [[Ron Vawter]] and [[Willem Dafoe]], at the [[Performing Garage]].&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, "Jeff Weiss's Rent Gets Paid," ''New York Times'', 30 August 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Cantwell debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] (at the [[Longacre Theatre]]) in [[Circle Repertory Company]]'s production of John Bishop's ''[[The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, "New Stars on Stage and Restaurant Row," ''New York Times'', 10 April 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epstein, who has been called the "lesbian equivalent of [[Woody Allen]],"&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Gevirtz, "Whining and Dining," ''Gay Community News'' 12, no. 27, 26 January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; continued as the central creative and organizing force behind More Fire! until she decided to disband the company in 1988. She was involved in every aspect of the production end as well as the artistic creation and design. She wrote, often in collaboration with others, all eight More Fire! experimental plays, performed in them, designed sets and painted scenery, created popular music soundtracks, and wrote songs.&lt;ref name="Mernit"/&gt;

Epstein's later work with More Fire! includes ''Beyond Bedlam'' and three plays written in collaboration with Sarah Schulman: ''Art Failures'', ''Whining and Dining'', and ''Epstein On the Beach''. Other downtown performers appeared with the company, including Stephanie Skura in the title role in ''The Godmother'', [[Jennifer Miller]] in ''Whining and Dining'' and ''Epstein on the Beach'', and [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]] in ''Whining and Dining''. Writer and performer [[Deb Margolin]] contributed monologues for ''The Godmother'' and ''Beyond Bedlam'', and a guest appearance in ''Junk Love''. Some productions (''Junk Love'' and ''Epstein on the Beach'') also included male actors, such as actor/playwright Paul Walker and comic Jerry Turner.

==Audience and critics==
More Fire! Productions developed a following among East Village theatre audiences. East Village, women's, and New York gay and lesbian publications commented on the company's energy, inventiveness, broad humor, and satire of the downtown arts scene. ''Other Stages'' described ''Junk Love'' as "savagely witty" and praised the company's "original and daring performers."&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Winer, review of ''Junk Love'', ''Other Stages'', 22 April 1982: 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Native'' called ''Whining and Dining'' "theater as carnival."&lt;ref&gt;Jolanta Benal, "Soul on Trial in Grossinger's Dining Room," ''New York Native'', 14 January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Flue'', published by Franklin Furnace, an avant-garde art and performance space, noted that "the business is fast and funny, ferociously local."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Baracks, "All You Need Is Junk," ''The Flue'' 2:3 (1982): 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''East Village Eye'' wrote of ''Art Failures'': "Perhaps Epstein and Schulman's greatest achievement was their ability to crystalize the contradictions at the heart of the theatre/performance world. . . . Along the way Epstein and Schulman knowingly poke fun at themselves and lots of other talented individuals."&lt;ref&gt;William Harris, "Review of ''Art Failures''," ''East Village Eye'', February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Performances by More Fire! received mixed reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Village Voice]]''. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote: "Obviously, ensembles like More Fire!, which has earned a loyal cult following, are determined to remain outside of the mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Holden, "Avant-Garde Antics for the Adventurous," ''New York Times'', 5 September 1986: C5.&lt;/ref&gt; C. Carr of the ''Village Voice'' wrote of ''Epstein on the Beach'': "Parts of the show were quite funny––especially a parody of ''Quarry'' which managed to recreate and mock many of the visual high points of [[Meredith Monk]]'s classic within a few minutes. But the gist of the story––that 'hypocrisy is the spice of life' and lesbians will sell out as fast as the next person––made it . . .  cynical."&lt;ref&gt;C. Carr, ''On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 1993), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The harshest commentary came from Alisa Solomon, also of the ''Village Voice'', who reviewed ''Art Failures'' after audience members sent hundreds of postcards demanding a review. Although the postcards were part of the performance, Solomon saw them as a "cry for reviews" and described the play as "politically irresponsible. . . . Instead of taking potshots from a fortress of self-indulgence, why not seriously engage issues of capitalist patriarchy?"&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Solomon, "Bold Whines in New Battles," ''Village Voice'', 21 December 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance venues==
Most productions were performed at the University of the Streets, located on Seventh Street and Avenue A in the East Village''. As the Burger Broils'' previewed at P.S. 122's [[Avant-Garde-Arama]] and then became the first full-length public play or performance ever to be presented in P.S. 122, in October 1980. In 1981, More Fire! participated in the Second Women's One World (WOW) Festival of women's and lesbian theatre, in New York City, where the company performed ''The Exorcism of Cheryl'' and an excerpt from ''Junk Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Baracks, "Deja WOW," ''Village Voice'' 14 October 1981: 103.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Exorcism of Cheryl'' was also performed at the 1981 Boston Women's Theatre Festival. In 1986, The [[Performing Garage]] hosted a More Fire! Productions retrospective that included performances of ''Junk Love'' and ''Epstein on the Beach''.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, "Junk Love, Modern Romance," New York Times, 18 September 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Indigenous Television''' ('''NITV''') is an Australian television channel that broadcasts programming produced largly by [[Indigenous Australians]].

NITV was initially only carried by cable and satellite providers, along with some limited over-the-air transmissions in certain remote areas. However, in 2010, the Australian Government commissioned a wide-ranging review of its investment in the Indigenous broadcasting and media sector. The review was headed up by retired senior public servant [[Neville Stevens]] with the assistance of Expert Panel members [[Laurie Patton (Internet executive)|Laurie Patton]] and Kerrynne Liddle. The review recommended that NITV continue to receive government funding only on the basis that it was re-structured.

Subsequently, Communications Minister [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Stephen Conroy]] invited NITV to enter in negotiations with the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] to access one of that network's unused digital terrestrial channels. SBS took over the management and operation of NITV on 1 July 2012, and the network was re-launched as a free-to-air channel on [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] channel 34 on 12 December 2012.

==History==

=== Predecessors of NITV ===
Indigenous groups and individuals lobbied the [[Australian Government]] to fund a nationwide Indigenous television service in the 1980s and 1990s, however no major political party championed this cause.

In the late 1990s the Imparja Info Channel (also known as "Channel 31") was launched free-to-view on the satellite [[Optus Aurora]] service, providing largely Aboriginal programming direct to homes and via network of BRACS transmitters to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as [[Indigenous Community Television]].

In 2004, Imparja stated a desire to run a better funded service, at least within its license area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a voluntary NITV Committee was formed and a summit was held in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]], Sydney. The summit involved a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media professionals and community members committed to the establishment of a national Indigenous broadcasting service.

In 2005 the [[Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts]] considered funding an indigenous public broadcaster, and subsequently conducted a review process. Following the conclusion of the report, the [[Government of Australia]] announced $48.5 million in funding for NITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 13 July 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of NITV ===
In 2007, NITV established a head office in [[Alice Springs]] and a television arm in Sydney. On 13 July 2007 NITV launched, replacing Imparja Info Channel on Optus Aurora and in the remote Aboriginal communities it previously reached. It soon after also became available free-to-air on Optus D1 to Australia and eastern Papua New Guinea [http://www.lyngsat-maps.com/maps/optusd1_aus.html].

NITV announced in September 2007 that it would also launch on Australian subscription television services, and has commenced on 1 November 2007 on [[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]]'s satellite service on channel 180, with it becoming available on its cable service soon after. It shows Australian programs and sports like ''[[The Marngrook Footy Show]]'', and the annual ''[[NSW Koori Knockout|NSW Aboriginal Rugby League Knockout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nitv.org.au/media/#foxtel NITV – Media Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NITV 2015 logo.png|140px|thumb|NITV logo (2012–2016)]]
On 30 April 2010, NITV ceased broadcasting on Sydney's [[Digital 44|digital television Datacasting service]] along with Teachers TV, [[Australian Christian Channel]], the [[home shopping]] channel [[Expo Channel|EXPO]] and other services. However, it remained available on subscription services Foxtel, Austar and Optus TV.

=== NITV as part of SBS ===
On 8 May 2012, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] received $158m in government funding, of which $15m a year would be dedicated to a new free to air Indigenous Australian channel which would replace NITV in July 2012, with 90% of staff transferring to this new channel. NITV was re-launched on 12 December 2012 by SBS as a free-to-air channel on [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] channel 34. Among its launch day programmes were two live broadcasts from [[Uluru]], including ''From the Heart of Our Nation'', a two-hour event to mark the channel's launch at Noon, and a concert in primetime simulcast by [[SBS One]].&lt;ref name="NITV Replaces SBS4"&gt;

From 1992 to 2013, she was also a panelist on the syndicated TV political commentary show ''[[Inside Washington]]''.

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine called her "the creme de la creme" of NPR, and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' refers to her as "Queen of the Leaks".&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair" /&gt; She has won many broadcast journalism awards for both her explanatory pieces and her scoops.

Among her scoops was her groundbreaking report of sexual harassment allegations made against [[Clarence Thomas]] by [[University of Oklahoma]] law professor [[Anita Hill]], leading the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to re-open [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings]]. Previously, in 1986, she broke the story that Supreme Court nominee [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] had [[smoked marijuana]], leading Ginsburg to withdraw his name. And in 1977, she reported on secret Supreme Court deliberations relating to the [[Watergate scandal]].

==Personal life and family==
Nina Totenberg was born in New York, the eldest daughter of violinist [[Roman Totenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = May 9, 2012 |access-date = May 9, 2012 |title = Roman Totenberg, Violinist and Teacher, Dies at 101 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/arts/music/roman-totenberg-violinist-and-teacher-dies-at-101.html |first = Bruce |last = Weber }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in [[Poland]], and Melanie (Shroder) Totenberg, who was a real estate broker. She is the widow of U.S. Senator [[Floyd K. Haskell]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Colorado]]), whom she married in 1979. She remarried in 2000 to H. David Reines, a trauma surgeon and Vice Chairman of Surgery at [[Inova Fairfax Hospital]]. On their honeymoon, he treated her for severe injuries after she was hit by a boat propeller while swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10183686_ITM |last = Warren |first = Larkin |title = My husband saved my life!: three heroic men who did much more than love, honor, and cherish |date = October 1, 2001 |access-date = July 30, 2009 |work = Good Housekeeping }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Totenberg's sister [[Amy Totenberg]] was nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="AJC"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/amy-totenberg-nominated-to-378449.html |title = Amy Totenberg nominated to be federal judge |work = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date = March 17, 2010 |first = Bill |last = Rankin |access-date = April 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Totenberg was confirmed the next year. Another sister, [[Jill Totenberg]], is a businesswoman married to [[Brian Foreman]].&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/style/weddings-vows-jill-totenberg-and-brian-foreman.html |title = WEDDINGS: VOWS; Jill Totenberg and Brian Foreman |work = The New York Times |date = April 21, 2002 |first = Jenny |last = Allen |access-date = August 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2015, the [[Ames Stradivarius]], which had been stolen from their father 35 years earlier, was returned to the three sisters.&lt;ref name="TOI2015"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/35-years-later-fbi-recovers-musicians-stolen-violin/ |title = 35 years later, FBI recovers musician’s stolen violin |work = [[The Times of Israel]] |date = August 7, 2015 |first = Ben |last = Nuckols |access-date = August 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2015&gt;{{cite news |title = Stolen Stradivarius violin found 35 years later |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33808012 |date = August 6, 2015 |access-date = August 6, 2015 |publisher = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = A Rarity Reclaimed: Stolen Stradivarius Recovered After 35 Years |publisher = NPR |date = August 6, 2015 |url = https://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/427718240/a-rarity-reclaimed-stolen-stradivarius-recovered-after-35-years }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/arts/music/roman-totenbergs-stolen-stradivarius-is-found-after-35-years.html|title=Roman Totenberg’s Stolen Stradivarius Is Found After 35 Years|last=Cooper|first=Michael|date=2015-08-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thestrad.com/cpt-latests/stolen-ames-stradivarius-violin-is-recovered-after-35-years/ |title = Stolen 'Ames' Stradivarius violin is recovered after 35 years |work = The Strad |dead-url = yes |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150808210634/http://www.thestrad.com/cpt-latests/stolen-ames-stradivarius-violin-is-recovered-after-35-years/ |archive-date = August 8, 2015 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Totenberg enrolled in [[Boston University]] in 1962, majoring in journalism, but dropped out less than three years later because, in her own words, she "wasn’t doing brilliantly".&lt;ref name="The Paley Center for Media" /&gt;  Soon after dropping out of college, Totenberg began her journalism career at the ''[[Boston Record American]]'', where she worked on the Women's Page and learned breaking news journalism skills by volunteering in the news department.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"&gt;{{cite book |chapter = Nina Totenberg |title = Current Biography Yearbook |year = 1996 |pages = 575–579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved on to the ''[[Peabody Times]]'' in Massachusetts and ''[[Roll Call]]'' in Washington, D.C.

At the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', Totenberg began covering legal affairs.  In 1971 she broke a story about a secret list of candidates President [[Richard Nixon]] was considering for the Supreme Court.  All the candidates were later rejected as unqualified by the [[American Bar Association]] and none were nominated.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;

After Totenberg wrote an ''Observer'' profile of [[FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the latter wrote a long letter to the paper's editor demanding she be fired.  Instead, the editor printed the letter in the ''Observer'' along with a rebuttal of Hoover's complaints regarding the article.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;

She was fired from that paper for [[plagiarism]] in 1972 regarding a profile she wrote of then-soon-to-be [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Tip O'Neill]] which included, without attribution, quotes from members of Congress that had previously appeared in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  Totenberg has said that the dismissal also related to her rebuffing of sexual overtures from an editor.&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61517672.html?dids=61517672:61517672&amp;FMT=ABS |title = Media Squabble Over Coverage of Thomas Hearings Conduct: One reporter has quit, another faces a sexual harassment investigation. The press is accused of being `out of the mainstream' of thought. |first = Thomas B. |last = Rosenstiel |page = 22 |date = October 18, 1991 |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Totenberg's colleagues have defended her, noting that this was a case of using previously reported quotes, a common journalistic practice in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link = Ann Louise Bardach |first = Ann Louise |last = Bardach |title = Nina Totenberg: Queen of the Leaks |journal = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date = January 1992 |pages = 46–57 |url = http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/v_19920100.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;  In 1995, Totenberg told the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', "I have a strong feeling that a young reporter is entitled to one mistake and to have the holy bejeezus scared out of her to never do it again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Trudy |last = Lieberman |url = http://archives.cjr.org/year/95/4/plagiarize.asp |title = Plagiarize, Plagiarize, Plagiarize... |journal = [[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date = July–August 1995 |volume = |issue = |pages = }}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She next worked for the New York-based news magazine ''[[New Times Magazine|New Times]]''.  At that publication, she wrote a celebrated article called "The Ten Dumbest Members of Congress", prompting the senator at the top of the list, [[William L. Scott]], to call a press conference to deny that he was the "dumbest member of Congress."&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsmakers"&gt;{{cite news |title = Nina Totenberg |work = Newsmakers |at = Issue Cumulation |publisher = Gale Research |year = 1992 |via = {{cite book |title = Biography Resource Center |location = Farmington Hills, MI |publisher = Gale |year = 2009 }}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Public Radio==
In 1975, Nina Totenberg was hired by [[Bob Zelnick]] to work at [[National Public Radio]] and has been there since.

===Watergate appeals===
In 1977, Totenberg broke a story about the Supreme Court appeal of three men who had been convicted in the [[Watergate]] scandal: [[H.R. Haldeman]], [[John N. Mitchell]], and [[John D. Ehrlichman]].  Totenberg revealed the results of their secret 5–3 vote against reviewing the case and that the three dissenters were appointees of President [[Richard Nixon]]. Nixon had resigned three years earlier, in the wake of Watergate.  Totenberg also revealed that Nixon-appointed Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] delayed announcing the results of the vote, hoping to sway his fellow justices.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt; Her reporting of private Supreme Court deliberations was a novel development in Supreme Court reporting and led to speculation about who on the Court gave her the information.&lt;ref name="ListenerSupported"&gt;{{cite book |last = Mitchell |first = Jack |title = Listener supported: the culture and history of public radio |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KIwTKWj04wEC&amp;pg=PA78 |access-date = October 10, 2010 |date = 2005 |publisher = Praeger |isbn = 978-0-275-98352-9 |page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Rehnquist's Chief Justice nomination===
In 1986, Totenberg broke the story that [[William H. Rehnquist]], who was nominated for [[Chief Justice of the United States]] by [[Ronald Reagan]], had written a memo in 1970 opposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], in which he said that the amendment would "hasten the dissolution of the family" and that would "virtually abolish all legal distinctions between men and women."&lt;ref name="WaPoKurtzERA"&gt;{{cite news |last = Kurtz |first = Howard |authorlink = Howard Kurtz |title = Rehnquist Argued ERA Would Harm the Family; '70 Memo Made Case Against Ratification |date = September 10, 1986 |work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memo was written when Rehnquist was head of the Justice Department's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] in the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Administration.

===Douglas Ginsburg's Supreme Court nomination===
Totenberg broke the story that Judge [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]], who had been nominated to the Supreme Court by [[Ronald Reagan]], had smoked marijuana "on a few occasions" during his student days in the 1960s and while an assistant professor at [[Harvard Law School]] in the 1970s, something that did not appear in Ginsburg's FBI background check. The revelations resulted in Ginsburg's withdrawing his name from consideration.  Totenberg was awarded the 1988 [[Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton award]] for outstanding broadcast journalism for the story.&lt;ref name="The Paley Center for Media"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=132 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313230916/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=132 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = March 13, 2012 |title = She Made It |access-date = January 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsmakers"/&gt;

===Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings===
{{Main|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}
In 1991, a few days before a confirmation vote was scheduled for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] nominee [[Clarence Thomas]], Totenberg disclosed allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Thomas by [[University of Oklahoma]] law professor [[Anita Hill]].&lt;ref name="abc news"&gt;{{cite news |title = Clarence Thomas: A Silent Justice Speaks Out |first = Jan |last = Crawford Greenburg |publisher = [[ABC News]] |date = September 30, 2007 |url = http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3665221&amp;page=1 |access-date = October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Totenberg's report about Hill's allegations led the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to re-open Thomas's [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings to consider Hill's charges.

Totenberg was criticized by many of Thomas' supporters,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |first1 = J. |last1 = Elson |first2 = S.S. |last2 = Gregory |title = When Reporters Make News |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = October 28, 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee.  The Senate appointed special counsel [[Peter E. Fleming Jr.]] to investigate the leak. Totenberg and ''[[Newsday]]'''s [[Timothy Phelps]] were subpoenaed by Fleming, but refused to answer questions about their confidential sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Neil |last = Lewis |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/second-reporter-silent-in-senate-leak-inquiry.html |title = Second Reporter Silent In Senate Leak Inquiry |work = The New York Times |date = February 25, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Totenberg was confronted by one Thomas supporter, Republican Senator [[Alan K. Simpson]], during and after the taping of an episode of ''Nightline''.  On the show, Simpson criticized Totenberg, saying "What politicians get tired of is bias in reporters. Let's not pretend your reporting is objective here.  That would be absurd."  After Totenberg defended her reporting and objectivity on the show, Simpson followed her out of the studio and continued to criticize her, even holding open the door of her limousine so she could not leave. "He was in a complete rage. He was out of control," Totenberg said.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsmakers"/&gt;  Accounts differ on Totenberg's response, but she used what she called "choice epithets" and said: "I think I told him to shut the fuck up."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

Following Totenberg's allegation to ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s [[Howard Kurtz]] that she had been sexually harassed at the ''National Observer'', [[Al Hunt]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' brought up the plagiarism incident in a column about media coverage of and responses to the Thomas hearings.&lt;ref name="Al Hunt"&gt;{{cite news |last = Hunt |first = Albert R. |authorlink = Al Hunt |title = Tales of Ignominy, Beyond Thomas and Hill |date = October 17, 1991 |work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some observers connected Hunt's rehashing of a then nearly 20-year-old incident to the stance of the ''Journal'', whose conservative editorial pages had "editorially championed" Thomas and had previously criticized Totenberg,&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; but Hunt denied any ideological motivation.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

For the report and NPR's gavel-to-gavel coverage, Totenberg received the [[George Foster Peabody Award]]. The same year, she won the [[George Polk Award]] for excellence in journalism and the [[Joan S. Barone]] Award for excellence in Washington-based national affairs/public policy reporting (the latter also in part for her coverage of the retirement of Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]). The [[American Library Association]] presented her with its [[James Madison Award]], given to those who "championed, protected, and promoted public access to government information and the public’s right to know".&lt;ref name="The Paley Center for Media" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[American Library Association]] |url = http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/advocacy/federallegislation/govinfo/opengov/freedomofinfo/recipientsmadison.cfm |title = Recipients of the James Madison Award and the Eileen Cooke State and Local Madison Award |access-date = January 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also earned the [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] for investigative reporting.&lt;ref name="NPR biography"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101289 |title = Nina Totenberg; NPR Biography |date = September 25, 2007 |publisher = [[National Public Radio]] |access-date = January 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction and acclaim==
[[File:Nina Totenberg.jpg|thumb|Totenberg in 2013]]
In addition to awards mentioned above, and among her other awards, Totenberg has been honored seven times by the [[American Bar Association]] for excellence in legal reporting&lt;ref name="NPR biography" /&gt; and won the first-ever Toni House award presented by the [[American Judicature Society]] for a career body of work, and was the first radio journalist to be honored by the [[National Press Foundation]] as Broadcaster of the Year. She has written articles for the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (including tributes to Justices [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] and Lewis Powell when they retired&lt;ref name="HarvardLaw"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = A Tribute to Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. |journal = Harvard Law Review |volume = 104 |pages = 33–39 |date = November 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine; the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''; and numerous other legal and general circulation publications.&lt;ref name="NPR biography" /&gt; She also contributed to the Jewish Women's Archive's online exhibit ''Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution'' with regard to her reporting on Anita Hill's allegations against Clarence Thomas.&lt;ref name=JWATFR&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA071.htm |title = Nina Totenberg |access-date = September 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryMatters&gt;{{cite web |url = http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7658 |title = Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution |date = February 23, 2006 |access-date = September 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s Totenberg was a regular contributor to ABC's ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''.

Totenberg played the part of an election anchor in the film ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' (1992), and also appeared briefly as herself in the [[Kevin Kline]] film ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869304/ |title = Nina Totenberg |publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date = January 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her image has also been used for an item produced for NPR called "The Nina Totin' Bag"——a play on her name and the stereotypical [[tote bag]] offered as a thank-you gift for donating to a public broadcasting [[pledge drive]].&lt;ref name="NPR Shop"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://shop.npr.org/products/The-Nina-Totin-Bag |title = Nina Totin' Bag |publisher = NPR Shop |access-date = November 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
Totenberg has made friends with a number of politicians and lawyers in national politics, and her personal connections to these people have occasionally generated discussion. Allegations that Totenberg obtained her scoops by untoward means were prevalent early in her career, a fact [[Bill Kovach]], editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', attributed to [[sexism]] since she was one of the few women working in a predominantly male environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Ann Louise |last = Bardach |title = Nina Totenberg: Queen of the Leaks |journal = Vanity Fair |date = January 1992 |pages = 46–57 |url = http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/v_19920100.html |quote = It's astounding to me how Nina becomes a lightning rod for other journalists. She is one of the most knowledgeable and aggressive reporters in the business, but whenever she breaks a story, the first reaction in the Washington press corps is `What do you want? She's sleeping with a justice or someone else.' No one says these things about any male reporter, many of whom wouldn't think twice about sleeping with someone to get a story. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Totenberg was criticized by some commentators for hugging her friend [[Lani Guinier]] during a press conference announcing Guinier's nomination by [[Bill Clinton]] to the post of [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights]].&lt;ref name="Lift Every Voice"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guinier |first = Lani |title = Lift Every Voice |url = https://books.google.com/?id=bUEt9KwNWmAC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107 |access-date = August 11, 2009 |date = March 7, 2003 |publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn = 978-0-7432-5351-2 |page = 107 |quote = [The incident was] used by several commentators to question  [Totenberg's]  'objectivity'. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media critic [[Howard Kurtz]] reported that while Totenberg said she did not intend to give special treatment to Guinier in her reporting, she had hugged her because she had not seen her in some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Howard |last = Kurtz |title = First Lady's Press Picks; The Ins and Outs of Getting Interviews With Hillary |work = Washington Post |date = May 8, 1993 |quote = Totenberg dismissed suggestions that she might go easy on Guinier.... [saying] '[Guinier was] not a close friend.... I have lots of friends. Part of being in this business is knowing lots of people.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2000, some journalists expressed concern that Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]'s officiating at Totenberg's marriage&lt;ref name="Public Radio: Behind the Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last = Phillips |first = Lisa |title = Public Radio: Behind the Voices |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZfwD4XyXBhAC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52 |access-date = July 31, 2009 |date = May 9, 2006 |publisher = Vanguard Press |isbn = 978-1-59315-143-0 |page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; could be seen as a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="Groping for ethics in journalism"&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = Ron |title = Groping for ethics in journalism |url = https://books.google.com/?id=g6WTZbqZEBMC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;lpg=PA368 |access-date = August 4, 2009 |date = April 18, 2003 |publisher = Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0-8138-1088-1 |page = 368 |quote = I have known Ruth Ginsburg long before she was on the Supreme Court... I do not consider it a conflict of interest. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Totenberg responded she did not consider it a conflict of interest since her friendship with the jurist was established long before Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Groping for ethics in journalism"/&gt; She had made the same observation about her friendship with Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' editorialist [[Paul Gigot]] wrote in 1991 that Totenberg exhibits partisanship in her reporting.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{cite news |first = Ann Louise |last = Bardach |title = Nina Totenberg: Queen of the Leaks |work = Vanity Fair |date = January 1992 |quote = I think the thing that I would criticize Nina for is that she is simply a partisan. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Washington Post'' reporter [[Thomas Edsall]] said in 1995 that she was cited as an example of liberal bias in public broadcasting due to her reporting on two controversial Supreme Court nominations.&lt;ref name="WaPoEdsall"&gt;{{cite news |last = Edsall |first = Thomas B. |authorlink = Thomas Edsall |title = 'Defunding' Public Broadcasting: Conservative Goal Gains Audience |date = April 15, 1995 |work = [[The Washington Post]] |quote = Three of the most frequently cited examples of liberal bias are the "Frontline" series and Bill Moyers on public television; and NPR legal reporter Nina Totenberg, who is still criticized for her reporting on two controversial Republican nominees for the Supreme Court, Douglas H. Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, responding to conservative Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-N.C.), who characterized [[AIDS]] as a "disease transmitted by people deliberately engaging in unnatural acts" in his effort to cut government spending to combat it, Totenberg said: "I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the good Lord's mind, because if there's retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion or one of his grandchildren will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/williams-fires-back-npr-signs-expanded-role-fox/story?id=11954997 |title = Williams Fires Back at NPR, Signs Expanded Role at Fox News |publisher = ABC News|date = October 23, 2010 |access-date = December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-helms"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/26/130838719/totenberg-on-helms-remark-stupidest-thing-she-s-said-on-tv |title = Totenberg On Helms Comment: 'It Was A Stupid Remark' : The Two-Way |publisher = NPR |date = October 26, 2010 |access-date = December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senator Jesse Helms: Cut AIDS Funding [http://www.aegis.com/news/ap/1995/AP950702.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101114952/http://www.aegis.com/news/ap/1995/AP950702.html|date=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same show, conservative columnists [[Charles Krauthammer]] and [[Tony Snow]] also criticized Helms, with Krauthammer calling Helms's remarks "bigoted and cruel" and Snow accusing him of "hypocrisy".&lt;ref name="npr-helms"/&gt; Totenberg subsequently expressed regret for her choice of words, saying: "It was a stupid remark. I'll pay for it for the rest of my life."&lt;ref name="npr-helms"/&gt; Following his October 2010 firing from NPR for comments he made on [[FoxNews]], [[Juan Williams]] said the failure of NPR to discipline her for these statements was an example of NPR's double standard, a charge echoed by Fox News and conservative pundits.&lt;ref name="npr-helms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/22/national/main6983495.shtml |title = Juan Williams Talks Back on "O'Reilly Factor" |publisher = CBS News |date = October 22, 2010 |access-date = December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otesánek''' is a [[Czech literature|Czech]] fairy tale created by [[Karel Jaromír Erben]] in the 19th century which tells the story of a fearsome and constantly hungry, living log of wood. In the story there are elements of narrative that are similar to more famous fairy tales such as [[The Adventures of Pinocchio]] and [[Little Red Riding Hood]]; despite this, the themes present in Otesánek appear nonetheless to be quite different from most other European fairy tales, with a particularly ambiguous [[moral]] which leaves a lot of room to subjective interpretation.

==Plot==
The story begins with a couple that for a long time has been waiting for a child, which however does not seem to arrive. One day the husband finds in the nearby forest a log of wood (Otesánek) that strangely resembles a baby and decides to bring it home. To the joy of the couple, the wooden baby comes to life and asks to be fed. Initially the couple is enthusiastic that their wish of having a child has finally been granted, however the situation soon takes a turn for the worse as they find themselves having to deal with the insatiable appetite of the baby, who will keep growing and eating until he will start eating even people, including his parents. The log anticipates each meal with a nursery rhyme in which he lists every previous meal he has done. The story eventually concludes with the death of Otesánek at the hands of an elderly lady of the village who rips open his chest with a hoe, thus killing the monster and freeing all those who were eaten by him, including his parents.

==Film adaptation==
The film ''[[Little Otik]]'', directed by [[Jan Švankmajer]], was released in 2000 and is greatly inspired by this fairly tale.

'''Provincial Domain Dommelhof''' is an institution of the province [[Limburg (Belgium)]] in Belgium for culture, performing arts, and sports. Dommelhof was opened in 1967 in the municipality [[Neerpelt]]. The institution was the first cultural center in Flanders.

== History ==
In 1962, the [[Provincial council (Belgium)|Provincial Council]] of Belgian Limburg decided to set up Dommelhof. Second [[Minister of Culture]] [[Frans Van Mechelen]] decided to subsidize the construction of the cultural infrastructure. This infrastructure, designed by [[Alfons Hoppenbrouwers]], included a theater, education and residence building. In 1967 the first show of the theater was a fact. Until the 1980s, content was mainly devoted to [[social-cultural education]] and experimental programming in the theater. In 1979 the site was expanded with a sports center.
In the 1980s an international doll festival was launched and a summer festival for open air theater was launched. The puppet festival has disappeared and the festival for open air theater expanded in the following years to the international festival for outdoor, venue and circus theater on the Market. The platform for arthousecinema in Limburg, [[Zebracinema]], also originated in Dommelhof.

The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof is the biggest [[sound art]] collection in a public space in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others.

== Operation ==
The current activities of Dommelhof include:
* Theater op de Markt: Distribution and creation of circus and open-air theater through a summer festival and autumn festival, and a production cell for (inter)national creation assignments and residences&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenda.hbvl.be/agenda/a/theater-op-de-markt-provinciaal-domein-dommelhof/BF79E4C1-A052-7176-CAE2BF19A5DF0490 Article about Theater op de Markt] in [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* TAKT: support talent in performing arts
* Sports center: facilitating regional sports activities&lt;ref&gt;https://dommelhofsport.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/dommelhof-wordt-g-sportcentrum/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Residence building: facilitating multi-day training for the socio-cultural field

== Partners ==
Dommelhof works structurally with regional and Flemish cultural partners:
* Musica: Impulse Center for music, and manager of [[het Klankenbos]] (the sound forest) on the Dommelhof site
* Zebracinema: arthouse cinema in Belgian Limburg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/gec816v0 Article about Zebracinema] in [[De Standaard]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Circus Center: Flemish anchor point for circus art

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">A '''''répétiteur''''' (from [[French language|French]] [[verb]] ''répéter'' meaning "to repeat, to go over, to learn, to [[rehearsal|rehearse]]"&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;) is an accompanist, tutor or coach of ballet dancers or opera dancers.

== Opera ==
In [[opera]], a ''répétiteur'' is the person responsible for coaching singers and playing the [[piano]] for music and production rehearsals.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50203075?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=repetiteur&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, accessed 27 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coaching solo singers or choir members, the ''répétiteur'' will take on a number of the roles of a [[vocal coach]]: advising singers on how to improve their pitch and pronunciation, and correcting note or phrasing errors.

''Répétiteurs'' are skilled musicians who have strong [[sight-reading]] and score reading skills. In addition to being able to sight read piano parts, a ''répétiteur'' can play on the piano an orchestral score reducing it in real-time ([[orchestral reduction]]), by reading from a large open score of all of the instruments and voice parts. ''Répétiteurs'' are also skilled in following the directions of a conductor, in terms of changing the tempo, pausing, or adding other nuances.

== Ballet ==
In [[ballet]], a ''répétiteur'' teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Several late 20th-century choreographers, such as [[George Balanchine#External links|George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins#External links|Jerome Robbins]] and [[Twyla Tharp]], have established trusts and appointed conservators—hand-picked dancers who have intimate knowledge of particular ballets—as ''répétiteurs'' of their works.

Since 2012, Lancashire has earned extensive critical acclaim for her roles in the contemporary drama series ''[[Last Tango in Halifax]]'' (2012–2016) and ''[[Happy Valley (TV series)|Happy Valley]]'' (2014–present). Lancashire has also appeared in the feature films ''[[And When Did You Last See Your Father?]]'' (2007) and ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'' (2016), and [[West End theatre]] productions including ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]'' in 1990, ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' from 2005 to 2006 and ''[[Betty Blue Eyes]]'' in 2011.

At the age of 17, she started to suffer from [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/i-havent-slept-for-14-months-and-i-cant-1599731|title=I haven't slept for 14 month and I can't pack in Smoking.. but I love being a mum|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=4 June 2004|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancashire has stated she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status.&lt;ref name=HarshestCritic/&gt; Her background had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television.

After rejection from several [[repertory theatre]] companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the [[Manchester Central Library#Library Theatre|Manchester Library Theatre Company]], which provided her with an [[Equity Card]].&lt;ref name=firstjob&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/jun/12/careers.graduates6|title=My first boss|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=12 June 2004|accessdate=21 May 2014|last=Iziren|first=Adeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancashire performed two plays with the company, ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' and ''The Beauty Game'', which she states formed "the start of my career as an actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/11207791.Sarah_Lancashire_urges_local_people___Take_a_walk_to_your_theatre___please__/?ref=rss|title=Sarah Lancashire urges local people: "Take a walk to your theatre&amp;nbsp;— please!"|work=[[The Westmorland Gazette]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found her first professional acting experience "terrifying" as a result of the live audiences, recalling that, "because I wore a bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!"&lt;ref name=firstjob /&gt; She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career.&lt;ref name=firstjob /&gt; Her role as Denise in ''The Beauty Game'' earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the [[Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards]].&lt;ref name=ITMEN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independenttalent.com/actors/sarah-lancashire/|title=Sarah Lancashire|work=Independenttalent.com|publisher=[[Duncan Heath#Independent Talent Group|Independent Talent Group]]|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 22, Lancashire married her first serious boyfriend, Gary Hargreaves, a music lecturer 11 years her senior, whom she had met four years earlier.&lt;ref name=MumFirst/&gt;

Recalling the circumstances of her first marriage in 2001, Lancashire stated she only married because she became pregnant and possessed both a traditional outlook and a fear of the stigma of having a child out of wedlock.&lt;ref name=BloodyTricky/&gt; Thomas, her first child with Hargreaves, was born in 1987; a second son, Matthew, was born in 1989.&lt;ref name="RoyalFamily"/&gt;&lt;ref name=2hitshows/&gt; During her early career, Lancashire found herself with large breaks between theatre appearances.

Discussing Lancashire's time as a visiting lecturer in Acting and Characterisation, Professor Ron Cook, Head of the University's School of Media, Music and Performance, noted that Lancashire made a "significant impact" in the formative stages of the drama department at the University and had also directed student productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/actress-wins-degree-of-recognition-1167470|title=Actress wins degree of recognition|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=Manchester|date=13 March 2002|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Lancashire made a brief appearance in ''[[Coronation Street]]'' as Wendy Farmer, a prospective lodger of series regular [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]).&lt;ref name=McMullen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lancashire+hot+spots!%3B+ONCE+CORONATION+STREET'S+MOST+FAMOUS+BARMAID,...-a060807002|title=Lancashire hot spots!; Once Coronation Street's most famous barmaid, Sarah Lancashire is set to star in a gritty new drama for the BBC|work=[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|last=McMullen|first=Marion|date=22 January 2000|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, she also appeared in an episode of the [[children's television|children's]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Dramarama]]'',&lt;ref name=McMullen /&gt; and a single episode of the ITV sitcom ''[[Watching]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Joking|series=Watching|credits=Les Chatfield(director)|network=ITV|airdate=1 December 1989|number=1|seriesno=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2000, Lancashire returned to ''Coronation Street'' for a single episode in which Raquel asks Curly for a divorce.

He designed a two-part festival with a pre-festival of ideas [https://web.archive.org/web/20161231172823/https://sifa.sg/theopen/ The O.P.E.N]. (Open, Participate, Engage, Negotiate). The O.P.E.N. runs from June - July and thereafter followed by the main festival SIFA in August and September. Details on the new Singapore International Festival of Arts can be found at [http://www.sifa.sg www.sifa.sg].

== History ==
The Singapore Arts Festival started in 1977 as a national arts festival to celebrate local arts from the diverse communities in Singapore. Over the last three decades, the Festival has played a symbiotic and catalytic role in the development of the artistic and cultural life of Singapore. It has helped to transform the city’s cultural landscape, turning it into one of Asia’s major cultural capitals today. It has influenced local artists as well as increasing public awareness and demand for the arts, spawning new cultural platforms, events, and movements that help underpin the lively cultural scene in present Singapore.  It was formed in 1999 when the existing Festival of Asian Performing Arts and the Festival of Arts were merged as an annual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_474_2005-01-24.html | title=Singapore dance festivals | accessdate=March 31, 2011 | publisher=[[National Library Board]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091906/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_474_2005-01-24.html | archivedate=December 15, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Followspot operator.jpg|thumb|right|A spotlight operator working]]
The '''Spotlight operator''' or '''Followspot Operator''', is a [[theatrical technician]] who operates a specialized [[stage lighting instrument]] known as a [[followspot]]. A followspot is any lighting instrument manually controlled by an operator during a performance. Generally a followspot will be a dedicated, large lighting instrument designed to pan, change size, beam width, and color easily by hand.

==Followspot controls==
*Choppers – Cuts or shutters the top and bottom part of the beam.
*Douser – Controls intensity.
*Iris – Controls beam size.
*Trombone – Controls focal length.
*Color Frames – Changes the color of the light. May also known as a boomerang and/or a [[color magazine (lighting)|color magazine]]. Color magazines contain the [[color gel]]s, which are counted from the rear of the follow spot forward.

'''Standoff distance''' is a security term that refers to measures to prevent unscreened and potentially threatening people and vehicles from approaching within a certain distance of a [[building]], [[car]], or other [[shelter (building)|shelter]], roadblock or other location, or to a person such as a law enforcement officer or VIP, or to a friendly area / location.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/63316/army_seeks_safe_soldier_solutions_through_research T'Jae Gibson, Army Research Laboratory (August 15, 2011)  Army seeks safe Soldier solutions through research]
* See also Gen. [[David G. Perkins]] ''Win in a complex world'', and other TRADOC doctrine&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[Power projection]], [[Identification friend or foe]], [[Display behavior]]''

Standoff distance may be ensured using fixed physical barriers such as fences or bollards; temporary placement of items to block access (e.g., using law enforcement vehicles or police tape to block a road or bridge); physical features other than barriers (these may appear innocuous, such as the [[White House]] lawn or adding an ornamental pond); armed guards or positions (e.g., a police [[sniper]] in [[Overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]]); or deploying police officers with carbines such as an [[M4 carbine|M-4]], instead of just a service sidearm. When police officers have carbines the standoff distance is increased because an attacker who poses a threat can be fired upon from greater distances.

Standoff distance is used when a [[violence|violent]] [[criminal]] is in a fortified position, when [[hostage]]s are under armed threat from [[Kidnapping|kidnappers]], when a [[bomb]] is believed to have been placed, or when other unspecified dangers may be lurking. It is a measure of distance used by government, law enforcement, or military operatives handling the situation to protect their own agents and civilians from physical injury or death while the situation is resolved.

==Firearms==

When an armed and violent criminal is sheltered in a location not easily reachable by a [[tranquilizer]] round or [[disabling shot]] - or [[extreme prejudice]] ammunition, if authorized by mission leaders - police, military, and counterterrorism officers maintain distance (often out of the direct [[Sightline|line of sight]] and behind [[cover (military)|cover]]) while often using a [[megaphone]] to call for backup, the arrest of the subject, or to take him/her into custody.  [[Sniper]] coverage is used often in these situations, and standard procedure for officers or operatives (or citizens taking part in a [[citizen's arrest]]) is to call for heavily [[armor]]ed backup while maintaining cover themselves.  In the wake of active shooter scenarios, some law enforcement agencies have switched to moving in on the suspects, to prevent the gunmen from harming civilians. [[therapy|Therapeutic]] interventions or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] techniques may be used to [[talk down]] the suspects or identified threats and assailants.

==Hostage situations==

In a hostage situation, the primary goal is the safe recovery of the hostages, who are usually held under threat of [[violence]] or other prolonged physical harm ([[starvation]], [[poison]]ing, [[bleeding]], [[illness]]) from [[kidnapping|kidnappers]]. Thus the situation is treated similarly to situations with other armed attackers under cover, but with even more caution. [[sniper]]s are often employed to attempt to provide leverage against the hostage-takers or to fire at the hostage takers if an imminent risk of harm to the hostages is identified. 

Unless all kidnappers can be hit and killed by sniper gunfire almost simultaneously, generally [[extreme prejudice]] (e.g., shooting at gunmen)is not used as freely due to the danger of other kidnappers killing the hostages, as in the [[Munich massacre|1972 Munich]] example. 

This is not true in [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] situations, where the hostage taker is often shot by a snipers with armor-piercing or wall-piercing ammunition if talk or negotiation resolution is impossible.  In all situations the preferred method is to talk the kidnappers into releasing the hostages for [[ransom]] or otherwise talking them down using [[therapy|therapeutic]] or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] techniques, to protect the safety of the hostages and, ideally, have the suspect surrender peacefully.

==Bombs==
With bomb threats, the standoff distance used by law enforcement officers depends on the size and type of the bomb. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The smallest standoff distances, about 70 feet from the threat, are used for small [[pipe bomb]]s with about five pounds of explosives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A human suicide bomber with about 20 pounds of explosives strapped to his/her body has a standoff distance of 110 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A briefcase or suitcase bomb with about 50 pounds of explosives has a 150 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Larger car bombs or truck bombs have a much larger standoff distance, as the blast radius is bigger. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A car bomb with a 500 pound bomb has a 320 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A small delivery truck-based truck bomb with a 1,000 pound bomb has a 640 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A huge 18-wheeler truck-sized truck bomb with over 60,000 pounds of explosives has a 1,570 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Standoff distance is also intended to deter terrorists from using [[car bomb]]s by making it more difficult for them to cause catastrophic damage. In the wake of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], many high-risk federal buildings began enforcing standoff distances. It is based on the concept that a blast shock load is essentially a [[high-pressure front]] that moves out radially and decays very quickly&lt;ref&gt;http://govtsecurity.com/mag/blastresistant_facilities_even/&lt;/ref&gt; - because blast falloff is thus often more [[exponentiation|exponential]] than [[linear]] (indeed [[Vector (geometric)|radial]] - any given explosive must cover a circular-shaped area but blast power generally only increases linearly with explosive strength){{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, any standoff distance helps increases survival chances for passersby and minimizes danger, though [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] mitigates this effect if present.  

Hydraulic [[roadblock]]s (sometimes wedge-shaped), or [[bollard]]s can be raised to block approaching vehicles; these can be designed to prevent even a heavy, fast-moving truck from getting through. [[Jersey barrier]]s and concrete planters filled with dirt have also been used to maintain separation between screened and unscreened traffic. Certain infrastructure at risk of terrorist attack, such as bridges, may not be well-suited to standoff distances since their purpose is for traffic to travel along them.

'''Stitch 'n Bitch''' is a name that has been used to refer to social knitting groups since at least World War II.&lt;ref name="idle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Macdonald, Anne L. |title=No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=[New York |year=1988 |pages=302 |isbn=0-345-33906-1 |url=http://www.cogknition.org/stitchnbitchdb/reference.php?id=73_0_4_0_M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the slang term “Stitch ‘n Bitch” was used, groups of women in the 1940s would join to knit and talk in organized Stitch and Bitch clubs.  The term was further used in the 1980s as part of the book ''Social History of American Knitting'' by Anne Macdonald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brightman|first=Emilee|title=Crafty Ladies: Local knitting group not what you would expect|url=http://www.lakewoodobserver.com/read/2009/01/27/crafty-ladies-local-knitting-group-not|publisher=The Lakewood Observer|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly due to the book's success that the modern day Stitch n' Bitch knitting groups have emerged in cities around the world. The groups, mainly women, meet to knit, stitch and talk. Typically, attendees knit, though others crochet (they are called 'Happy Hookers'), and still others engage in cross-stitching, embroidery, and other needlecraft.  Nowadays, the groups have been analyzed by scholars as expressions of resistance to major political, social and technological change in Western societies. However, political discussion is not unusual at these events, and at least some participants are proponents of progressive, liberal, and/or leftist social and political change. Furthermore, the term Stitch ‘n' Bitch is now used by women from across the globe to connect with others in the virtual space seeing as the term has re-emerged in a world where the public sphere is the cyberspace.

With over 1460 registered Stitch ‘n Bitch groups in 289 cities worldwide, the social knitting movement has demarked itself as a popular social gathering for avid knitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stitch 'n Bitch|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Find a knitting group or start your own|url=http://stitchnbitch.org/|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting groups==
''Stitch 'n Bitch'' is a name used by knitting groups that meet on a weekly or monthly basis at locations throughout the world.  This use of the term originates as early as the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="idle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Elsworth | first = Catherine | title =  It's getting bitchy in knitting circles | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 2006-11-02 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/11/wknit11.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/02/11/ixworld.html | accessdate = 2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Debbie Stoller started a Stitch 'n Bitch group in NYC's East Village, which was open to anyone who wanted to come to knit along or learn to knit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In 2000, she wrote about her groups in ''BUST'' magazine, of which she is the editor-in-chief. Brenda Janish read the article and started the Chicago Stitch 'n Bitch group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} That article inspired Vickie Howell to start the Los Angeles Stitch 'n Bitch group and later the Austin Stitch 'n Bitch group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/20/news/wk-alt20 "Sisters of the Stitch", L.A. Times, Nov. 20, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Stoller's original group, today's Stitch 'n Bitch clubs are generally casual groups of knitters who meet in public spaces such as bars or cafes for socializing and sharing knitting advice.  These groups are free or small fee required memberships and open to the public, and are listed in a directory of worldwide knitting groups that was started by Janish and today is maintained by Stoller:  Official Home of Stitch 'n Bitch. As of 2010, the site lists over 700 such groups.

==Book series and legal actions==
[[File:Stitch 'n Bitch Book Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cover of the first book in the series of knitting books by Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook''.]]

A book series by Debbie Stoller, includes ''Stitch 'n Bitch" : The Knitter's Handbook'', ''Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker,'' and other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoller|first=Debbie|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker|year=2006|publisher=Workman Publishing Company, Inc.|location=New York|pages=1–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a [[trademark]] dispute. In June 2005, the company [[Sew Fast Sew Easy]] filed a trademark application for ''Stitch &amp; Bitch'' to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application was suspended.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B"&gt;{{cite journal |author=United States Patent and Trademark Office | title = Serial Number: 78641350 | publisher = Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System | date = November 28, 2007 | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78641350&amp;action=Request+Status |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2005, due to letters claiming [[trademark infringement]] from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with [[CafePress]] were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase "Stitch 'n Bitch". Local groups that communicated with each other through [[Yahoo! Groups]] were similarly forced to remove "Stitch 'n Bitch" from the name and description of their group.&lt;ref name="vogue"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petrovsky | first = Lesley | title = Tempest in a Tea Cozy | journal = Vogue Knitting | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/vogueknit.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB.&lt;ref name="knit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Krementz | first = Cheryl | title = Stitch &amp; Bitch Slap | journal = Knit.1 | date = Summer 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/knit1.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement in which Debbie Stoller retained the use of the mark in knitting while Sew Fast Sew Easy retains the use for sewing. Since then all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered. The Sew Fast Sew Easy store closed in 2012.

== Social implications ==
In recent years, the Stitch ‘n Bitch movement has been considered as a means of reclaiming women’s domestic work in feminist circles. Not only have groups officially been formed through website use, but groups of women on university campuses have also followed the trends in order to resist the taboo representation of the traditional woman.

Dr. Beth Ann Pentney, writing in Thirdspace journal, credited Stoller's publications with the rise of feminist knitting.  Stoller introduced this approach to feminism to merge political involvement with a women’s community-building activity set in a Do-It-Yourself culture.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pentney|first=Beth Ann|title=Feminism, Activism, and Knitting: Are the Fibre Arts a Viable Mode for Feminist Political Action?|journal=Third Space: a journal of feminist theory and culture|date=Summer 2008|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.thirdspace.ca/journal/article/viewArticle/pentney/210|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to Stoller, much scrutiny on the effectiveness of the reclamation of domestic arts as a political feminist act has been done. Some say that the reason of the reintroduction of knitting in modern social gatherings is mainly due to the increase in the search for individualism and the anti-consumerism attitude of our generation.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"/&gt; With this said, it is important to denote the implication of technologies in the emergence of a “fabriculture” based on the reclamation of domestic arts and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratich|first=Jack|author2=Brush, Heidi M. |title=Fabricating activism: Craft-Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Utopian Studies|date=27 November 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233–260|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=19 March 2013|doi=10.5325/utopianstudies.22.2.0233}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the internet accessibility of online information and tips and tricks for knitters and crocheters, the traditionally personal practice of knitting can now be shared easily among strangers, and is open to public discussion and new ideas. These webs of knitters worldwide find affinities via a very modern technology opposing the traditional DIY nature of knitting.

'''''Talking Threads''''' is a magazine-style programme targeted at the ever-increasing market for [[Textile arts|textile art]] that aims to inspire people to be creative with fabric.&lt;ref name="talkingthreads.co.uk"&gt;http://www.talkingthreads.co.uk/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Shown on The Country Channel, on [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]], Talking Threads has a potential audience of fifty million people, with a large percentage of these being UK-based.

== Series 1 ==
A [[Television pilot|pilot series]] of ten half-hour episodes will feature fabric artists giving demonstrations of the techniques which have made them accomplished artists. It was scheduled to be shown on October 14, 2009, on Sky Channel 171.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Talking-Threads/69645249996&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The Country Channel, ''Talking Threads'' is uniquely placed to attract a diverse audience:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vimeo.com/6261722&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world of textile art is one that appeals to a vast demographic range: in addition to the more traditional sewing audience this programme would target everyone from parents watching with young children to university students wanting ideas for customizing their clothes.

The craft industry is not only unaffected by the [[credit crunch]] but has attracted a larger following as people turn to repairing or restyling old clothes to avoid purchasing new ones. Talking Threads is ideally placed to take advantage of the influx of people approaching textile and fabric art for the first time, while allowing those more experienced in the practice to see their favourite artists and their work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Format ===
Each episode is based around the artistic stylings of an artist, featuring a demonstration of how to make a specific piece, an interview and an exclusive look into their portfolio.

In every episode viewers are taught simple fabric art techniques, such as embellishing or [[Custom fabric dyeing|fabric dyeing]], from which they can expand their creative horizons. They are also taken through a step by step process culminating in the creation of their own piece of textile art. The final episode is filmed at The Festival of Quilts, at the [[Birmingham NEC]].

The '''Teatro della Pergola''' is a historic opera house in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. It is located in the centre of the city on the Via della Pergola, from which the theatre takes its name. It was built in 1656 under the patronage of Cardinal [[Gian Carlo de' Medici]] to designs by the architect [[Ferdinando Tacca]], son of the sculptor [[Pietro Tacca]]; its inaugural production was the [[opera buffa]], ''[[Il potestà di Colognole]]'' by [[Jacopo Melani]].&lt;ref&gt;Spike Hughes , ''Great Opera Houses'', London, 1956; the [[libretto]] was by [[Giovanni Andrea Moniglia]] (James Leve, ed. ''Il potestà di Colognole'' (Yale University Collegium Musicum '''14''') 2005, "introduction".&lt;/ref&gt; The opera house, the first to be built with superposed tiers of boxes rather than raked semi-circular seating in the Roman fashion,&lt;ref&gt;As in the [[Teatro Olimpico]] of Vicenza, designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] in the previous century.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be the oldest in Italy, having occupied the same site for more than 350 years.

It has two auditoria, the '''Sala Grande''', with 1,500 seats, and the '''Saloncino''', a former ballroom located upstairs which has been used as a recital hall since 1804 and which seats 400.

[[File:Locandina macbeth a firenze, 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the premiere of Verdi's ''Macbeth'']]
Work on completing the interior was finished in 1661, in time for the celebration of the wedding of the future grand duke [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], with the court spectacle ''Ercole in Tebe'' by Giovanni Antonio Boretti. Primarily a court theatre used by the [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], it was only after 1718 that it was opened to the public. In this theatre the great operas of [[Mozart]] were heard for the first time in Italy, and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]’s ''[[Parisina (opera)|Parisina]]'' and ''[[Rosmonda d'Inghilterra]],'' [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]’s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (1847) and [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]’s ''[[I Rantzau]]'' were given their premiere productions.

By the nineteenth century, La Pergola was performing operas of the best-known composers of the day including [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. Verdi's ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' was given its premiere performance at the Pergola in 1847.

The Pergola's present appearance dates from an 1855-57 remodelling; it has the traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium with three rings of boxes and topped with a gallery.  It seats 1,000. It was declared a national monument in 1925 and has been restored at least twice since.

Today the theatre presents a broad range of about 250 drama performances each year, ranging from [[Molière]] to [[Neil Simon]]. Opera is only presented there during the annual ''[[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]]''.

'''''The Blind Girl''''' (1856) is a [[painting]] by [[John Everett Millais]] which depicts two itinerant beggars, presumed to be sisters, one of whom is a blind musician, her [[concertina]] on her lap. They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of [[Winchelsea]], visible in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/akim3.html The Victorian Web: Combining Details and Mood in The Blind Girl.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been interpreted as an [[allegory]] of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M. (1987), ''Engaging English art: Entering the Work in Two Centuries of English Painting and Poetry'', Alabama: University of Alabama Press&lt;/ref&gt; The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a blade of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at the unusual spectacle of a [[double rainbow]] that has just appeared. Some critics have interpreted the rainbow in Biblical terms, as the sign of God's [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:16.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, K. (2000), The Victorians and the Visual Imagination, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the painting was first exhibited in 1856 it was pointed out to Millais that in double rainbows the inner rainbow inverts the order of the colours. Millais had originally painted the colours in the same order in both rainbows. He altered it for scientific accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bright Earth: Art and the invention of color|first=Philip|last=Ball|authorlink=Philip Ball|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-226-03628-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Small Tortoiseshell|tortoiseshell butterfly]] rests on the blind girl's shawl, implying that she is holding herself extremely still. The sheet around her neck is captioned "Pity the Blind".

'''''The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries''''' is an 1812 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]]. It shows French Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in uniform in his study at the [[Tuileries Palace]]. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.&lt;ref name=NGA1&gt;"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46114&amp;detail=note The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Notes]". National Gallery of Art. Accessed 21 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, [[Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton]] in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at [[Hamilton Palace]], it was sold to [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]] in 1882, from whom it was bought by the [[Samuel Henry Kress#The Kress Foundation|Samuel H. Kress Foundation]] in 1954, which deposited it in Washington D.C.'s [[National Gallery of Art]], where it now hangs.&lt;ref name=NGA2&gt;"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46114&amp;detail=prov The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Provenance]". National Gallery of Art. Accessed 8 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Vertical in format, it shows Napoleon standing, three-quarters life size, wearing the uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wears his [[Légion d'honneur]] and [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, along with gold epaulettes, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. His face is turned towards the viewer and his right hand is in his jacket.

Piled on the desk are a pen, several books, dossiers and rolled papers. More rolled papers and a map are on the green carpet to the left of the desk - on these papers is the painter's signature ''LVD&lt;sup&gt;ci&lt;/sup&gt; DAVID OPVS 1812''. All this, along with Napoleon's unbuttoned cuffs, wrinkled stockings, disheveled hair, the flickering candles and the time on the clock (4.13am) are all meant to imply he has been up all night, writing laws such as the ''[[Code Napoléon]]'' - the word "Code" is prominent on the rolled papers on the desk. This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's ''[[Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker]]'') or military (as in David's own ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'') image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name=NGA1/&gt;

==Second version==
[[File:Napoleon-aux-tuileries.jpg|thumb|The second version]]
A second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green [[chasseurs à cheval|mounted chasseurs]] uniform, was formerly in [[Prince Napoleon]]'s{{who|date=June 2013}} collection and has since 1979 been in that of the [[Château de Versailles]].

== Development ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=May 2017}}
An analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture a complete story.

Brush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had
Napoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width
of the figure's torso.  These strong vertical elements would have created a
distraction from the central figure.

These columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's
left) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and
somewhat larger than the figure's face.  The clock was later repainted
with a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still
covering the underlying column brush strokes.

These revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the
painting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical
columns.  They successfully moved the viewer's focus to Napoleon's face and
expression and away from the presumably accurate stature and
middle-heavy build.

The change also allowed incorporating additional symbology, most notably
the time (4:13).

Other revisions were added symbols on the table items and lower section,
many painted over [[fleurs-de-lis]] which are conspicuously rare in the final image.

'''''The Men Who Stare at Goats''''' (2004) is a non-fiction work by [[Jon Ronson]] concerning the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s exploration of [[New Age]] concepts and the potential military applications of the [[paranormal]]. The title refers to attempts to kill [[goat]]s by staring at them and stopping their hearts. The book is companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on [[Channel 4]]—''Crazy Rulers of the World'' (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled "The Men Who Stare at Goats". The same title was used a third time for a loose [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|feature film adaptation]] in 2009.

==Content==

===Book synopsis===
The book's first five chapters examine the efforts of a handful of U.S. Army officers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to exploit [[paranormal]] phenomena, [[New Age]] philosophy, and elements of the [[human potential movement]] to enhance U.S. military intelligence-gathering capabilities as well as overall operational effectiveness. These include the ''[[First Earth Battalion|First Earth Battalion Operations Manual]]'' (1979) and a "psychic spy unit" established by Army Intelligence at [[Fort George G.

Friedman (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4-p5TIyoNMC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22stargate%22+%22Ronson%22+goat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QIlHwOOgGW&amp;sig=cx1XQux2TmMR7EK_lNPR-0o-r-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=osRLVdvQFsWggwTirYHQCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stargate%22%20%22Ronson%22%20goat&amp;f=false ''Debating Psychic Experience: Human Potential Or Human Illusion?''], Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger/Greenwood Publishing Group, pg 154: “The story of Stargate was recently featured in a film based on the book ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'', by British investigative journalist Jon Ronson (2004)”.&lt;/ref&gt; which the book never mentions by name.) Ronson is put on the historical trail of the "men who stare at goats"—[[U.S. Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldiers who supposedly experimented with psychic powers against [[de-bleated]] goats at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], at the now-decommissioned "Goat Lab" medical training facility. He examines, and dispenses with, several candidates for the legendary "master sergeant" (Chapter 2) who was reported to have killed a goat simply by staring at it, in the earliest days of the program. A martial arts instructor named Guy Savelli claims to be the one.

In the middle third of the book (Chapters 6-11), the author leaps to the present day—i.e., 2004, just after the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib abuse]] revelations—and attempts to make connections between the earlier (now terminated, and mostly discredited) military programs and the abuses resulting from the post-9/11 [[War on Terror]] (Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, psyops in Iraq, etc.). This includes the use of the children's song "[[Barney &amp; Friends]]" on Iraqi prisoners-of-war. A purported linking element is the alleged use of music and [[subliminal messaging]] at the 1993 [[Waco siege]] and other FBI operations. Another is the private business "franchises" and consultancies that retired members of the "psychic unit" later pursued as civilians. A connection is also proposed between these "privatized" psychics and the mass-suicide of members of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]] in 1997.

The final section of the book (Chapters 13-16) leaps backward to the 1950s and attempts to connect the Army psychic program, and later interrogation techniques, with the CIA's [[MK-ULTRA]] "mind control" research program and the notorious death of Army researcher [[Frank Olson]] in 1953. Ronson spends time with Olson's son Eric as he attempts to uncover the mystery of his father's death. The reason his father was terminated, as we discover, was not simply because he knew too much but, rather, that he was having a crisis of conscience and seriously entertaining the notion of going public with all that he knew. The narrative ends with the suggestion that the "psychic warriors" are now back in business working for the U.S. military again, possibly in support of assassinations.

==Reception==
Ronson's book was met with mostly positive, often glowing, reviews: the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' opined that it is "a hilarious and unsettling book.... Ronson comes off as an unusual cross between [[Comedy Central]]'s [[Jon Stewart]] and ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Seymour Hersh]]." ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Janet Maslin]] stated that "Ronson sets up his book perfectly. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity....".

Some critics, however, were skeptical of what they considered Ronson's shaky logic and some of his bolder assertions. [[Alex Heard]]'s review in ''[[U-T San Diego]]'' was subtitled "''Goats'' tries hard to link psychic-spy projects from the past to today's events, and mostly fails". In many instances, he wrote, "...there isn't a link. Instead there's a progression of occurrences that don't connect in a meaningful way. The result is a strange new blend: Conspiracy theory meets Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.... You're left feeling like you've been told a shaggy-goat story."&lt;ref&gt;Heard, ''[[Op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}
The 2004 series ''Crazy Rulers of the World'' was aired in three parts:

*Part 1: "The Men Who Stare at Goats"
*Part 2: "Funny Torture"
*Part 3: "The Psychic Footsoldiers"

It was broadcast in Britain on [[Channel 4]].

==Feature film adaptation==
{{Main article|The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)}}
A fictionalized feature film version of the book was released in 2009 under the same name. [[Grant Heslov]] directed from a script by [[Peter Straughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/01/entertainment/ca-bridges1 | title=Jeff Bridges, psychic warrior | work=LA Times | date=November 1, 2009 | author=Geoff Boucher}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in [[Iraq]], but was filmed in Comerío Street, [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]] and at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]]. The story centers on "Bob Wilton" ([[Ewan McGregor]])—the Ronson stand-in—a desperate reporter who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime. He meets "Lyn Cassady" ([[George Clooney]])—a composite character—who claims to be a former secret U.S. military psychic soldier re-activated post-[[9/11]]. [[Jeff Bridges]] plays "Bill Django"—clearly a version of [[Jim Channon]]—the founder of the psychic soldier program and Lyn's mentor. [[Kevin Spacey]] plays "Larry Hooper"—a wholly fictional character—who is a former psychic soldier now running a rogue [[Psychological Operations (United States)|PsyOps]] unit in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/48782-these-are-the-men-who-stare-at-goats | title=These are The Men Who Stare at Goats | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=September 12, 2008 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is prefaced with a title card stating "More of this is true than you would believe". The DVD release of ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' includes a bonus documentary featuring Ronson and many of the people who feature prominently in his book.

Coinciding with the release of the feature film in 2009, [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]], the producer of the TV series ''Crazy Rulers of the World'', accused Ronson of "airbrushing him out of the story". While Ronson dedicated his book to Sergeant and included an afterword commending his research and guidance, the feature film did not mention his contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-sergeant/how-i-was-airbrushed-out_b_362356.html |title=How My Involvement with The Men Who Stare at Goats Was Erased Entirely |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-12-01|accessdate=2010-03-29 |first=John |last=Sergeant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/clooney-caught-in-crossfire-as-war-breaks-out-over-latest-film-1813635.html |title=Clooney caught in crossfire as war breaks out over latest film – News, Films |publisher=The Independent |date= 2009-11-03|accessdate=2010-03-29 | location=London | first=Arifa | last=Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewon Shin (aka Se Won Shin/ Shin Sewon/ Shin Se-won) was a young innovative leader of a Korean religious foundation, who resigned from the spiritual leadership in order to introduce a new way of art called Trans-Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/ Artist official website], [http://www.transart.co/ Trans-Art official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

His art served as a spiritual basis for the reformation of the Korean traditional religion known as Hanol-gyo.&lt;ref name="vk"/&gt;

==Trans-Art==

In Part 1: Optical Awakening, the artist expressed the process of ‘spiritual awakening’ in his paintings based on his own experience.&lt;ref&gt;New Form of Art, New Way of Art, Tasting Art with the Trans-Artist &lt;Bar &amp; Dining&gt; December 2016 issue p. 88~92 (in Korean)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part 3: Mobile Art, he combined Technology with Art, using digital devices such as a smart-phone and applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shinsewon.com/en/transart.php?spnum=241&amp;tc=4 Trans-Art Part 3 Mobile Art &lt;shinsewon,gallery&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sewon Shin / Trans-Artist==
His father was the founder of the Hanol religion&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=560571&amp;cid=46651&amp;categoryId=46651 Shin Jeong-yil] Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt; - the re-establishment of the Korean traditional religion which foresaw the possibility of evolution in human consciousness from 'Ego-state' to 'Awakened-state' 5000 years ago.&lt;ref name="hanol"&gt;[http://www.hanol.org/hen/hanol.php Hanol-gyo official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Introduction to Trans-Art, “as the son of an unconventional religious leader, he had to experience unbearable religious upheaval as well as personal sacrifice of freedom from very early on in his childhood.“

Sewon became obsessive in painting, which was his only means to extricate himself from the mental suffering caused by his given reality of religious prejudice and discrimination. His compulsively acquired painting skill helped him to win a National art competition with a reward to study abroad ([[Georgetown Preparatory School]], the United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/on_Seoul/13587 High School Student Shin Displaying 50 Paintings] ''Korea Times'', August 21, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewon held two solo exhibitions in high school as a young talented artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/on_Seoul/13582 Boy’s imaginative oil painting hit gallery row. Shin Se-won, attending high school in U.S. shows talent at Seoul exhibit] ''Korea Herald'', August 26, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-known in his youth as a prodigious painter,&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt; until his failure to perform a new concept of installation art (Super-Individualism Art)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/on_Tokyo/13489 해외전시 신세원展 Overseas Exhibition - Se Won Shin Exhibit - Super Individual Art] Monthly Atelier August, 1992 issue Volume 17 p.68~69&lt;/ref&gt; discouraged him in such a way that he eventually gave up his art.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/historia “History”] Art of Enlightenment and Awakening official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instead of pursuing art, he majored in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University (B.A. and M.A. in PPE).&lt;ref name="n"/&gt;

However, after the sudden passing of his father, he was forced to make painful personal sacrifices again. He had to take on insurmountable financial liability and the responsibility of restructuring his father's legacy, which eventually led him to return to art, expressing the sacred teachings on spiritual transcendence, not only based on his father's teachings, but from his own self-confirmation of the spiritual awakening experience.&lt;ref name="vk"/&gt;

==Art of enlightenment and awakening==
Trans-Art can also be regarded as the (Non-religious) elaboration of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening' which he introduced as leader of the HANOL spiritual foundation.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/page_fZqu72 Introduction to Trans-Art 'Art of Transcendence']&lt;/ref&gt; His art became a driving force behind the structural evolution of the Hanol-religion.&lt;ref name="inno"&gt;[http://www.hanol.org/hen/innovation.php?spnum=401 Hanol Innovation] Hanol-gyo official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dangun]], the Founding Father of Korea,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica online Korea [http://premium.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?mtt_id=16170 "Dangun"]&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the 'Principles of Hanol Spirit' (the teachings on enlightenment and awakening) introducing the possibility of spiritual transcendence to its people - the evolution of human consciousness from the Ego-state to the Transcendental-state.&lt;ref name="hanol"/&gt;

After 5000 years, the Hanol principles were consolidated into a religious foundation by [[Shin Jeong Yil]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1204663&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=33385 Shin Jeong-yil ] Doosan Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1161378&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31603 Hanol-gyo] Doosan Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of the [[Hanol-gyo|Hanol religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://premium.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b24h2980a Encyclopædia Britannica online Korea - Hanol-gyo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=526382&amp;cid=46651&amp;categoryId=46651 Hanol-gyo] Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the sudden passing of the founder in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004568271 "Shin Jeong Yil, Founder of ‘Hanol-gyo’, Deceased"] ''Yonhap News'', April 6th, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; the legal descendent Sewon Shin inevitably took on the responsibility of leadership in an emergency, immediately after graduating from Oxford.&lt;ref name="vk"&gt;[http://www.powerkoream.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1102216 The 50th Anniversary of Hanolgyo, Spreading the Hanol spirit based on humanitarian aims] 『Power Korea』February 2015 issue, P. 71~77&lt;/ref&gt;

During his leadership, he expressed the essence of the transcendental philosophy of the 'Hanol Principle' in the 'Spiritual art of Enlightenment and Awakening' based on his own experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanol.org/en/hanart.php HAN Art &amp; HANOL Architecture] Hanol-gyo official website&lt;/ref&gt;

He attempted to transform the existing belief system by integrating ‘Art and Spirituality’. Sewon introduced the concept of 'Spiritual Audience' instead of the traditional notion of religious followers.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt;

After he successfully reformed the HANOL foundation, Sewon resigned from the leadership in order to introduce Trans-Art.&lt;ref name="hanol"/&gt;

Trans-Art can be considered the re-establishment of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening' in a pure art form (Non-religious form), and the elaboration of "Super-Individualism art (i.e. Trans-ego art)” which he introduced at the Tokyo exhibition. This is based on the self-confirmation of the sacred teachings on ‘Spiritual Transcendence’ that he acquired.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

== Trans-Art part 1: Optical Awakening==
The artist shows the dynamic process of the transformation in the creation of art with multi-dimensional perspectives that he acquired from his spiritual experience. Sewon attempts to “express the ‘enlightenment and awakening’ which is beyond ‘Form’, by using the ‘multi-dimensional method of expression’ based on the transformational perspective that he acquired from his own experience of enlightenment and awakening.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/page_fZqu72 Introduction to Trans-Art], [http://www.transart.co/ Trans-Art official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote frame|After the unexpected passing of his father, he experienced absolute despair. The inability to extricate himself from the inescapable quagmire of his religious destiny forced him to suffer a serious mental breakdown. It compelled him to reach a decision to commit suicide, which seemed to be inevitable and the only choice to him then. 
However, at the critical moment of self-extinction, he experienced '''Gyun-Sung'': a glimpse of enlightening and the following determination of unconditional surrender to the suchness of Life’, which was the beginning of the irreversible process of the ‘gradual awakening in his consciousness.’
|Trans-Art official website|A Brief history of Trans-Artist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transart.gallery/en/transart.php?spnum=121 A Brief history of Trans-Artist]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 'Optical Awakening series', he is expressing the process of ‘Ego dis-identification’ that he acquired from the suicidal experience which caused the separation of the ‘Ego-mind (artificial mental-algorithm of involuntarily constructed mind-structure)’ and ‘Consciousness (True-Nature)’, initiating the gradual awakening in his consciousness.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

From the enlightening experiences, he came to realize that art and spirituality share one and the same nature of showing the doorway into another dimension of consciousness where our true essence beyond ‘form’ is indwelling. He is expressing a glimpse of ‘enlightenment and awakening’ which is ‘beyond form’ by using the ‘form of Trans-art’.&lt;ref&gt;Trans-Art: past summary - Trans-Art official website&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the guidance to Trans-Art, Trans Art Part 1, the multi-dimensional expression of "Enlightenment and Awakening", can be regarded as an indirect experience of 'Spiritual Transcendence' and a 'Glimpse of Enlightenment' in the form of art – “the ‘Preview of the Ego dis-identification’ which entails the separation of Mind (Ego) &amp; Consciousness (True Nature).”&lt;ref&gt;Trans-Art part 1 - Trans-Art official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In his major work, the Trans-art part 1 ‘Optical Awakening series’, the Trans-artist shows the consecutive phases of the ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’ process which consists of: 'Awakening Dimensions', ‘Initiation of awakening’, ‘Awakening True-nature’, ‘Flash of Enlightening’, ‘Trans-perceiving Ego’, ‘Dark-side of Ego’, ‘Trans-Quantum physics of mind’, ‘Trans-perceiving mental synapse’, ‘Self-Liberation’, ‘Breaking Free’, ‘Quest for Immortality’, and ‘Trans-Perception’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transart.co/ Trans-Art official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans-Art can be considered as the re-establishment of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening: the quintessence of Transcendental philosophy' in the form of fine art, and the elaboration of "Super-Individualism art&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornzone.net/xe/on_Tokyo/13469 Super-Individualism Art] Art of Enlightenment and Awakening website&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. Trans-ego art)” which he introduced at the Tokyo exhibition.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

==Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art==
The ''Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art'' is a new way of experiencing religion without religious obligation or religious participation by integrating Art and Spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanol.org/hen/innovation.php Hanol Spiritual &amp; Cultural Movement of Art] &lt;Hanol-gyo official website&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to official guidance, Hanol-gyo is an unconventional religion as it encourages other religions and respects their way of pursuing Truth. This is due to its founding principle that regards ‘all proper religion as having the same root and the same destination, the Truth.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanol.org/hen/spirit.php?spnum=301 Hanol principle &lt;Hanol-gyo official website&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In commemoration of the 50th anniversary, Hanol-gyo officially agreed upon reformation at the general assembly, and endorsed the ''Hanol Spiritual &amp; Cultural Movement of Art'' for non-believers and the believers of other religions to experience the ''Hanol Principles'' without any religious obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekn.kr/news/article.html?no=304399|title=The prelude to spiritual singularity: Trans-Renaissance initiated by Trans-Art|publisher=www.ekn.kr|date=5 August 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the official request of Hanol-gyo, the artist provided his artworks [Optical Awakening], for the ''Hanol Spiritual &amp; Cultural Movement of Art''.&lt;ref name="KNS"/&gt;

''Optical Awakening'' is a direct expression of enlightenment and a catalyst for awakening in Art form, in which people can experience the quintessence of Hanol religion and its philosophy simply by appreciating the artworks, rather than participating in a conventional form of religious activity or becoming a spiritual seeker.&lt;ref name="kh"/&gt;

By using Tran-Art [Optical Awakening], as teaching material and as a learning device of Hanol Spiritual Art, the number of non-religious participants in Hanol-gyo has grown significantly. It presented a new possibility for the development of religious culture and structural evolution of religion by expanding the religious boundaries to include a wider perspective.&lt;ref name="N1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news1.kr/articles/?3066525|title= Optical Awakening, reinterpretation of The Gates of Hell, an incomplete masterpiece by Rodin 보고 깨닫는 미술 시각견성, 재해석된 로뎅의 미완 걸작 '지옥의 문' |date=2017-08-06|work=News 1|access-date=2018-04-25|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gates==
''The Gates'', which have been introduced as the signature artwork of ''Optical Awakening'' Trans-Art, is a sculpture depicting the ‘''Gates of Heaven(Nirvana)''’ inspired by ''la Porte de I'Enfer'' - ''The Gates of Hell'', the unfinished masterpiece sculpture by [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref name="kh"&gt;[http://v.media.daum.net/v/20170805085410057 시각견성, 종교미술의 진화로 '눈길'] Optical Awakening attracts attention as an evolution of religious art ''[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]'' (in Korean). 2017-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote frame|"While ''The Gates of Hell'' symbolize the beginning of endless suffering on the one side, it could also symbolize the end of suffering from the other side, if one could extricate himself from hell through that gate.
According to Buddha, Nirvana (ultimate transcendence, the absolute awakening) is simply the end of dukkha, the end of suffering. It means that ''the Gates of Hell'' could be the ''Gates of Nirvana'' at the same time, depending on which side of ''the gates'' that one is standing on.

According to the official introduction, “the artist projected what he had realized during the days of miserable agony after the sudden passing of his father. He was forced to be responsible for insurmountable amount of liability which he believed the only way out of his misery was to commit suicide. However, the painful experience helped the artist to realize the simple but profound truth which he depicted in his artwork, ''The Gates''.&lt;ref name="N1"/&gt;

The artist shows that the suchness of life and your perceived reality is a mirror that reflects you. “It is when you voluntarily accept the unacceptable aspects of life, instead of resenting or giving up in the face of unacceptable reality, that what you perceived to be ''the Gates to hell'' will show its true face and turn into ''the Gates'' through which you can discover your true nature that cannot be distorted by whatever happens in your life. By giving up what makes up your ego and leaving it behind the gates, you will be left with the immutable essence that cannot be altered by form and phenomena. That immutability is your True Nature that will shine even if you let go of your dark ego.” – interview with Korean Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hankyung.com/article/201708046387a |title=Art expressing religious principle, Optical Awakening presents the essence of the truth through art 시각견성, 진리의 본질을 미술로 나타내다|date=2017-08-05|work= Korea Economic Daily|access-date=2018-04-19|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gates'' face Hell on one side and Heaven on the other. It was made so that a rusty mirror, which has become damaged and discolored, reflects the viewers on the side toward Hell, and a clean and clear mirror reflects the viewers on the side toward Heaven. It has been explained that it is up to the viewers to decide on which side they want to stand to see the reflections of themselves and the world, and that this privilege to choose your own state is a true gift or blessing from God. The artist denotes that it is also the essence of free will that cannot be taken away by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailygrid.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=56643 종교문화의 새로운 패러다임, 정신과 미술의 결합 '시각견성'] A New paradigm in Religious culture, Optical Awakening ''Daily Grid'' (in Korean). 2017-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist indicates that Heaven and Hell may not refer to a certain location or place, but actually one’s inner state of consciousness. The question of what to have reflected on the gates and which side of ''the gates'' to open depends on the individual’s own volition and their present state of consciousness.&lt;ref name="KNS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kns.tv/news/articleView.html?idxno=338008|title=Awakening by art - a new possibility of spiritual culture in the face of intellectual singularity |date=2017-08-05|work=KNS News |access-date=2018-04-19|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasting-Art==
After the artist realized that Taste, as well as Vision, can be an effective means to show us a way into another dimension of consciousness where our true nature is indwelling, he attempted to integrate Art with Taste in order to express a glimpse of awakening by providing an extraordinary tasting experience only once for each participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hankyung.com/article/201611077418a?nv=o|title=Eating the Art?

[[File:Brozik, Vaclav - J.A. Komensky se louci s Karlem starsim ze Zerotina (1873).jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Amos Comenius|Comenius]] says goodbye to Karol the Elder of [[House of Zierotin|Zierotin]] (1873)]]

'''Václav Brožík''' ({{lang-fr|Vaclav de Brozik}} {{IPA-fr|vɑklav d(ə) bʁoziːk|pron}}; 6 March 1851, [[Třemošná]] - 15 April 1901 [[Paris]]) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] painter who worked in the [[Academic art|academic style]].

== Life ==
He came from a poor family, studying lithography and [[porcelain painting]] through apprenticeships.  Beginning in 1868, with financial assistance from a local landowner, he was able to attend the art academy in [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague|Prague]]. He made a trip to the Netherlands, where he studied the [[Old Masters]], then settled in Paris (despite not being able to speak French), where a letter of recommendation assured him the support of [[Jaroslav Čermák (painter)|Jaroslav Čermák]]. In 1879 he married Hermina Sedelmeyer, daughter of the wealthy Parisian art dealer [[Charles Sedelmeyer]].&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;[http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=1006 4 pictures and biography] at [[Art Renewal Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his life, he divided his time between Paris and Prague, where he became a Professor at the Art Academy in 1893.

He was named a member of the [[Institut de France]], partly through the influence of his father-in-law, who also suggested that he do a painting on the theme "Tu Felix Austria Nube" (from an old saying: "Let others wage war: thou, happy Austria, marry").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/stories/tu-felix-austria-nube|title=The World of the Habsburgs: Tu Felix Austria Nube in context.|work=Die Welt der Habsburger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result pleased Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]], who was involved in an unhappy marriage. As a result, Brožík was elevated to the nobility.&lt;ref name="AR" /&gt;

He also became a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], received the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'Honneur]]&lt;ref&gt;''Kdo byl kdo v našich dějinách do roku 1918'', by Pavel Augusta. Libri, Prague (1998) p.54 {{ISBN|80-8598-306-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed to the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Šlechtová, Alena and Levora, Josef: ''Členové České akademie věd a umění 1890–1952'', 2nd edition, Academia Prague (2004) {{ISBN|80-200-1066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, one of his paintings appeared on a United States postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batz-hausen.de/1stczech.htm|title=Gerhard Batz: Das erste Kunstwerk eines tschechischen Künstlers auf Briefmarken (United States postage stamp based on a painting by Brožík)|publisher=batz-hausen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health began to decline in 1894, but he threw himself into painting even more diligently. He died suddenly of heart failure in 1901 and was buried in [[Montmartre]].&lt;ref name="AR" /&gt; Appreciation of his work suffered a serious decline after his death, as it was considered old-fashioned, but a major retrospective in 2003 has created some renewed interest.
