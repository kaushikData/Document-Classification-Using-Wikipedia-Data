{{Years in film}}
The decade of the '''1950s in film''' involved many significant films.

==Events==

Films of the 1950s were of a wide variety. As a result of the introduction of television, the studios and companies sought to put audiences back in theaters. They used more techniques in presenting their films through widescreen and big-approach methods, such as [[Cinemascope]], [[VistaVision]], and [[Cinerama]], as well as gimmicks like [[3-D film]]. Big production and spectacle films perfect for this gained popularity, with the many historic and fantasy epics like ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953),''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958), and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). Other big-scoped films thrived internationally, too, such as Russian fantasy director [[Aleksandr Ptushko]]'s mythological epics ''[[Sadko]]'', ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', and ''[[Sampo]]'', and Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s historic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', and ''[[Rashomon]]''. [[Toshiro Mifune]], who starred in those Kurosawa films, also starred in the color spectacle ''[[Samurai Trilogy]]''.

This spectacle approach, coupled with [[Cold War]] paranoia, a renewed interest in science from the [[atomic bomb]], as well as increased interest in the mysteries of outer space and other [[forteana]], lent itself well to what this film decade is best known for, [[science fiction]]. The [[science fiction film|science fiction]] genre began its [[golden age]] during this decade with such notable films as ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953), ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'' (1953), ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954), ''[[Them!]]'' (1954), ''[[This Island Earth]]'' (1955), ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956). There were also Earth-based "sci-fi" subjects, such as ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954) and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]'' (1951). Companies such as [[American International Pictures]], Japan's [[Toho]], and Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] were created to solely produce films of the [[fantastique]] genres.

The decade was equally adept at both character and realistic films. The highly noted actors [[James Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Marlon Brando]] were at the peak of their popularity. Stewart, starring in ''[[Winchester '73 (1950 film)|Winchester '73]]'', and Wayne, starring in John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy and ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', revitalized the [[western film|western]]. Brando mastered versatile roles in films such as ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957).

Director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was at the peak of his craft, with films such as ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[To Catch a Thief (film)|To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), with [[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] starring in three each. The [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] Indian director [[Satyajit Ray]], who began his career in the 1950s, was also at the peak of his career during this decade, with films such as ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959), ''[[Jalsaghar]]'' (1958), and ''[[Parash Pathar]]'' (1958).

'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

'''Aleatoricism''' is the incorporation of [[randomness|chance]] into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. The word derives from the Latin word ''alea'', the rolling of [[dice]]. "Aleatory" should not be confused with either [[improvisation]] or [[indeterminacy in music|indeterminacy]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"&gt;Sabine Feisst, "Losing Control: Indeterminacy and Improvisation in Music Since 1950", ''New Music Box'' (1 March 2002): § [http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=35tp02 "Aleatory—Pierre Boulez"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book ''The Virtual Muse''.&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Aleatoric music}}
The term [[aleatoric music|aleatory music]] was first coined by [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is "determined in general but depends on chance in detail".&lt;ref&gt;Werner Meyer-Eppler. 1957. "Statistic and Psychologic Problems of Sound", translated by Alexander Goehr, ''Die Reihe'' 1 ("Electronic Music", 1957): 55–61; original German edition, 1955, as "Statistische und psychologische Klangprobleme", ''Die Reihe'' 1 ("Elektronische Musik", 1955): 22–28; the citation is on pp. 55 and 22, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German  noun ''Aleatorik'' as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, "aleatoric".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jacobs, "Admonitoric Note", ''The Musical Times'' 107, no. 1479 (May 1966): 414.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Boulez]] applied the term in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the [[indeterminate music]] of [[John Cage]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"/&gt; While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another prolific composer of aleatory music was [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox1950"/&gt;

Aleatoric techniques are sometimes used in contemporary film music. Examples can be found in [[John Williams]]'s scores as well as, for example, [[Mark Snow]]'s music for ''X-Files: Fight the Future''.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Karlin and Rayburn Wright, ''On the Track: A Guide to Contemporary Film Scoring'', second edition (New York: Routledge, 2004): 430–36. {{ISBN|0-415-94135-0}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-415-94136-9}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In film-making, there are several avant-garde examples;  one is Andy Voda's ''Chance Chants''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchceC3rV2k Andy Voda's film "Chance Chants"]&lt;/ref&gt; which features Allison Knowles' computer poem "House of Dust",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aknowles.com Alison Knowles website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fred Camper]]'s ''SN'' (1984, first screening 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Camper, [http://www.fredcamper.com/F/SN.html "''SN'', a film by Fred Camper"], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; uses coin-flipping for one section to determine which three of 16 possible reels to screen and what order they should go in (3360 permutations).

Film scholar [[Barry Salt]] directed the 1971 film ''Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|1053919|Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order (1971)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/50946 "Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order (1971)"], BFI Film &amp; TV Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis Sullivan circa 1895.jpg|thumb|Louis Sullivan circa 1895]]

The '''American Prize for Architecture''',&lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/american-architecture-prize.html&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the Louis H. Sullivan Award, is bestowed to an outstanding practitioner in the [[United States]] that has emblazoned a new direction in the history of [[Architecture of the United States|American Architecture]] with [[Aptitude|talent]], [[Foresight (psychology)|vision]], and commitment and has demonstrated consistent contributions to humanity through the built environment and through the art of [[architecture]].
 
The [[award]] periodically honors North and South American architects, as well as other global architects practicing on those continents, whose body of architectural work, over time, exemplifies superior design and humanist ideals.
 
==History==
Instituted in 1994 as The [[Louis H. Sullivan]] Award, The American Prize for Architecture honors the spirit of the founder of modernism, Louis Sullivan, and a subsequent generation of [[Chicago]] practitioners as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Daniel Burnham|Daniel H. Burnham]].
 
The American Prize for Architecture was founded in [[Chicago]] by The [[Chicago Athenaeum]]: Museum of Architecture and Design, and is organized jointly with The European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies as a way to broadcast globally the significant contributions of America’s rich and inspiring architecture practice and its legacy to the world at large.
 
The Director of the prize and President of The Chicago Athenaeum, [[Christian Narkiewicz-Laine]], is the curator of the Prize and the Museum solicits nominations from a range of people, including global practitioners, educators, people in business, and the general public. The American Prize for Architecture is a trademark of The Chicago Athenaeum.

'''''Arles: View from the Wheat Fields''''' (also known as ''Wheat Field with Sheaves and Arles in the Background'') was painted by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in June, 1888, among a number of paintings he made of wheat fields that summer. It is currently displayed at the [[Musee Rodin]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

==Arles==

Van Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France.  There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as ''Harvest at La Crau.''  The [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflower paintings]], some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time.  He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings.  This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.  He was confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Arts Entwined: Music and Painting in the Nineteenth Century | first1=M | last1=Morton | first2=P | last2=Schmunk |  publisher=Garland Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | isbn=0-8153-3156-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NP724mFE1MC&amp;pg=PA177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as [[Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]] and Japanese art (see [[Japonism]]) from his period in Paris the prior two years.  His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, [[impasto]] brush strokes.&lt;ref name="Honolulu"/&gt;

==Wheat fields==
The close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night | author=van Gogh, V | author2=van Heugten, S | author3=Pissarro, J | author4=Stolwijk, C  | publisher=Mercatorfonds with Van Gogh Museum and Museum of Modern Art | location=Brusells | year=2008 | pages=12, 25 | isbn=978-0-87070-736-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PipnXcXe5TQC&amp;pg=PA12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh saw plowing, sowing and harvesting symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature: "the sower and the wheat sheaf stood for eternity, and the reaper and his [[scythe]] for irrevocable death." The dark hours conducive to germination and regeneration are depicted in ''The Sower'' and wheat fields at sunset.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"/&gt;

In 1889 Van Gogh wrote of the way in which wheat was symbolic to him: "What can a person do when he thinks of all the things he cannot understand, but look at the fields of wheat... We, who live by bread, are we not ourselves very much like wheat... to be reaped when we are ripe."&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van |title=Landscape at Saint-Rémy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) |author= |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher= |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvest paintings==
During the last half of June he worked on a group of ten "Harvest" paintings,&lt;ref name=Honolulu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honoluluacademy.org/art/5394-wheat-fielda_z |title=Wheat Field |author= |year= |work=Collection | publisher=Honolulu Academy of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed him to experiment with color and technique. "I have now spent a week working hard in the wheatfields, under the blazing sun," Van Gogh wrote on 21 June 1888 to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].&lt;ref name="VGM WF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2595&amp;lang=en |title=Wheat Fields |author= |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the series of wheat fields as "…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping."&lt;ref name=NGASun&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |pages=18 | publisher=National Gallery of Art | location=Washington, D.C. | url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arts Council of Wales''' ('''ACW'''; {{lang-cy|Cyngor Celfyddydau Cymru}}) is a [[Welsh Government sponsored bodies|Welsh Government-sponsored body]], responsible for funding and developing the [[Welsh art|arts in Wales]].

[[File:Arts Council of Wales (WMC).JPG|thumb|upright|Arts Council of Wales at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in Cardiff]]

Established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1946, as the '''Welsh Arts Council''' ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Celfyddydau Cymru}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=1&amp;coll_id=78016&amp;expand=| title=National Library of Wales &gt; Welsh Arts Council Archives| publisher=Archives Wales| accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; its English name was changed to the '''Arts Council of Wales''' was established by Royal Charter on 30 March 1994 (the Welsh name remained the same), when it merged with the three Welsh regional arts associations. It became accountable to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] on 1 July 1999, when responsibility was transferred from the [[Secretary of State for Wales]]. The [[Welsh Government]] provides ACW with money to fund the arts in Wales. ACW also distributes [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding for the arts in Wales, allocated by the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS).

As a registered charity, the Arts Council of Wales has a board of trustees who meet six times a year, chaired by Phil George, Apart from the Chair, Council members are not paid; they are appointed by the Welsh Government. The Arts Council of Wales has offices in [[Colwyn Bay]], [[Carmarthen]] and [[Cardiff]]. Nick Capaldi has been its chief executive since 2008.

The Arts Council partners with the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] to produce its annual '[[Y Lle Celf]]' exhibition of Welsh art, craft and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesarts/2010/07/y_lle_celf_basement_art_gallery_national_eisteddfod.html |title=Y Lle Celf goes underground for 2010 Eisteddfod |publisher=BBC Wales Arts |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=2018-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:bachgesell.gif|thumb|200px|A page from the Bach-Gesellschaft edition of J. S. Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', BWV 244, as published in 1856]]

The German '''Bach-Gesellschaft''' (Bach Society) was a society formed in 1850 for the express purpose of publishing the complete works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] without editorial additions. The collected works are known as the '''Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe'''. On completion of the project, the Society dissolved itself.

The nineteenth-century society needs to be distinguished from its successor, the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] (New Bach Society), founded in 1900.

==Origins of the Bach-Gesellschaft==

The founders of the society were [[Moritz Hauptmann]], cantor of the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]], (and thus a successor of Bach); [[Otto Jahn]], author of a noted biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]; [[Carl Ferdinand Becker (organist)|Carl Ferdinand Becker]], teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory; and the composer [[Robert Schumann]].&lt;ref name="nbr"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David &amp; Arthur Mendel, eds. | title = The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents | edition = (Revised and expanded by Christoph Wolff) | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-393-31956-3 | pages = 503–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

The Bach-Gesellschaft began publishing Bach's works in 1851 with a volume that started with [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 1, the cantata ''[[Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1]]''.&lt;ref name="ngbf1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Christoph Wolff | title = The New Grove Bach Family | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1983 | isbn = 0-393-30088-9 | page = 178 |display-authors=etal}} (Worklist for J.S. Bach).&lt;/ref&gt; It completed publication in 1900 with its forty-sixth volume.&lt;ref name="nbrx"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David &amp; Arthur Mendel, eds. | title = The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents | edition = (Revised and expanded by Christoph Wolff) | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-393-31956-3 | page = 504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the edition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' by [[Wolfgang Graeser]], published in 1926, is sometimes counted as "Volume 47"&lt;ref name="aof"&gt;{{cite book | author = Johann Sebastian Bach | title = The Art of the Fugue and A Musical Offering | location = New York | publisher = Dover | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-486-27006-8 | nopp = true | page = title page verso and "Publisher's Note" on unnumbered page }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was issued as a supplement to the Bach-Gesellschaft publication by [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], publishers of the original series.&lt;ref name="tunni"&gt;{{citenews | first=Stephen | last=Tunnicliffe | title= Wolfgang Graeser (1906-28): A forgotten genius |date=Spring 2000 | publisher= | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3870/is_200004/ai_n8899522/pg_1 | work=The Musical Times | accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Vol. 45, part 1 includes a revised edition ("Neue berichtige Ausgabe")&lt;ref name="bg45"&gt;{{cite book | author = Ernst Naumann, ed. | title = Joh. Seb. Bach's Clavierwerke | edition = Zweiter Band. Neue berichtige Ausgabe. | location = Leipzig | publisher = Herausgegeben von der Bach-Gesellschaft | year = 1895 | id = | nopp = true| page = title page }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[English Suites, BWV 806-811|English Suites]] and [[French Suites, BWV 812-817|French Suites]] that had previously been published in Vol. 13.

Among the editors was [[Alfred Dörffel]]. [[Brahms]] was one of the subscribers to the project and also served on the [[editorial board]]. A list of subscribers was printed in each volume.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]] via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of the edition==

The volumes varied somewhat in editorial quality and accuracy; Bach scholar Hans T. David particularly criticized Vol. 31's presentation of ''[[The Musical Offering]]'' for numerous incorrect readings,&lt;ref name="david"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David | title = J. S. Bach's Musical Offering. History, Interpretation, and Analysis | location = New York | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1972 | edition = (reprint of orig. ed. by G. Schirmer) | origyear = 1945 | isbn = 0-486-22768-5 | page = 102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] calls the edition as a whole "of very unequal merit."&lt;ref name="ref1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bach, Johann Sebastian |volume=3 |page=130 |first=Donald Francis |last=Tovey}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Britannica'' both lauds the editing of [[Wilhelm Rust]] for the edition and notes a deterioration of standards after his death, including a volume in which "the bass and violin are a bar apart for a whole line" (apparently a reference to sloppy editing).&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; In his edition of the ''[[Goldberg Variations]],'' [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]] also calls attention to several "mistakes of the Bachgesellschaft edition" that he has corrected, particularly with regard to the presentation of [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite book | author = Ralph Kirkpatrick, ed. | title = J. S. Bach, The "Goldberg" Variations, Piano or Harpsichord | location = New York | publisher = G. Schirmer Inc. | year = 1938 | edition = | origyear = | isbn = 0-7935-2245-5 | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is worth noting that the Bach-Gesellschaft volume containing the ''Goldbergs'' was one of the first to be published—Vol. 3, which appeared in 1853.)

Nevertheless, the Bach-Gesellschaft's volumes were a groundbreaking achievement and contributed greatly to the study and appreciation of Bach's music. They remained the standard edition of Bach's complete works until the publication of the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]] by [[Bärenreiter]] and the Deutscher Verlag für Musik (1954-2007).&lt;ref name="ngbf2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Christoph Wolff | year = 1983 | title = The New Grove Bach Family | page = 172 |display-authors=etal}} (section of J.S. Bach article re: "Bach Revival").&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bad Moms''''' is a 2016 American [[comedy film]] directed and written by [[Jon Lucas]] and [[Scott Moore (screenwriter)|Scott Moore]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Mila Kunis]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Kristen Bell]], [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Annie Mumolo]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], and [[J. J. Watt]] .

[[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2016, in [[New Orleans]]. The film premiered on July 19, 2016, in [[New York City]] and was theatrically released on July 29, 2016, by [[STXfilms]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $183 million worldwide, becoming the first film from STX to gross $100 million domestically.

A sequel, titled ''[[A Bad Moms Christmas]]'', was released on November 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/bad-moms-christmas-trailer-susan-sarandon-justin-hartley-1202162573/|title='A Bad Moms Christmas' Trailer: Santa Lap Dancing, Susan Sarandon &amp; Naked Justin Hartley|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Amy Mitchell ([[Mila Kunis]]) is a married woman in the [[Chicago]] [[suburbs]] with two children, Jane ([[Oona Laurence]]) and Dylan ([[Emjay Anthony]]), who feels overworked and overcommitted. She works as a sales rep for a "hip" coffee company, prepares healthful, hand-packed lunches for her children, does most of their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in her school's [[Parent-Teacher Association#PTA|PTA]], run by the domineering Gwendolyn James ([[Christina Applegate]]) and her cronies, Stacy ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) and Vicky ([[Annie Mumolo]]). When she catches her husband Mike ([[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]]) cheating on her with a [[camgirl]], Amy kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together.

After a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA in response to Gwendolyn's overzealous bake sale plans. At a nearby bar, Amy meets Carla ([[Kathryn Hahn]]), a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki ([[Kristen Bell]]), a stay-at-home mom of four who adores Amy's dissent from Gwendolyn. Amy and Carla are irritated to discover that Kiki's husband is domineering and expects her to take care of all the kids and the house with no assistance whatsoever, while Amy and Kiki are disturbed at Carla's very hands-off approach to parenting. The trio embark on an all-night bender that inspires Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mike's classic car, gets them lunch from [[Arby's]], forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself decides to start dating but finds herself inexperienced due to her early marriage and motherhood. She ultimately ends up striking a connection with Jessie ([[Jay Hernandez]]), a handsome widower at the school who's had a crush on her.

After Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Amy is angered, and decides to run for PTA president in opposition to Gwendolyn. A meet-and-greet at Amy's home draws only one visitor, who informs them that Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by [[Martha Stewart]]. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyn's party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amy's house.

Gwendolyn responds by putting drugs in Jane's locker, framing her, which gets her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce) in response to what they see as Amy's failure as a mom. Amy loses her job because her boss refuses to understand her reasons for taking time off.

A despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is roused into action by Carla and Kiki, who finally stands up to her husband and orders him to deal with everything alone until the meeting is over. At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the moms are overworked and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.

Some weeks later, Amy's approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is actually applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with taking care of their kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie. Gwendolyn invites Amy, Carla, and Kiki for a day of fun on her husband's private jet.

The ending credits play over the cast interviewing their real-life moms.

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Bad Moms'' boasts a terrific cast and a welcome twist on domestic comedy -- and they're often enough to compensate for the movie's unfortunate inability to take full advantage of its assets."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bad_moms/ |title=Bad Moms (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bad-moms |title=Bad Moms reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IGN]]'' gave the film 7/10, saying, "[t]he uneven ''Bad Moms'' is an entry in the slobs versus snobs genre that never quite realizes its full comedic potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/28/bad-moms-review |last=Lasser |first=Josh |title=A week in the life of a suburban parent. |work=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2016 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it an A-, writing: "beneath all of its hard-R partying, rebellious debauchery, and profanity, it taps into something very real and insidious in the zeitgeist. It's one of the funniest movies of the year-and one of the most necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/28/bad-moms-ew-review |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |title=Bad Moms: EW review |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 28, 2016 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] and [[Kyle Smith]] both gave 2½ stars out of 4, with Travers saying: "the movie cops out by going soft in the end, but it's still hardcore hilarity for stressed moms looking for a girls night out",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/bad-moms-review-w430928 |last=Travers|first=Peter |title='Bad Moms' Review: A 'Hangover' for Stressed Mothers |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 28, 2016 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith saying: "''Bad Moms'' is like ''[[Sex and the City]]: The Sneakers-and-Minivan Years,'' a good-natured girl-power comedy that balances a bland sitcom structure with some weird and hilarious moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/07/28/bad-moms-good-laughs/ |last=Smith |first=Kyle |title='Bad Moms', good laughs |work=[[New York Post]] |date=July 28, 2016 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Jesse Hassenger opined that ''Bad Moms'' "sells its characters' struggle short by shuffling their kids off screen whenever it's convenient, and not even in the name of comical neglect; there always seems to be time and money to get a sitter. [...] [This] at times turns the movie into a referendum on unhelpful husbands of well-off moms, rather than the absurdities of Perfect Mom culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hassenger|first1=Jesse|title=Bad Moms alternates satire with easy answers|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/bad-moms-alternates-satire-easy-answers-240203|website=[[The A.V.

'''''Bears''''' is a 2014 [[nature documentary]] film about a family of [[brown bear]]s living in the coastal mountain ranges of [[Alaska]]. Directed by [[Alastair Fothergill]] and [[Keith Scholey]] and narrated by [[John C. Reilly]], ''Bears'' was released theatrically by [[Disneynature]] on April 18, 2014, the seventh nature documentary released under that label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check out a Fun Featurette for Disneynature’s Bears|url=http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2013/04/check-out-a-fun-featurette-for-disneynatures-bears/|publisher=Disney D23|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An [[Alaska]]n [[brown bear]] mother named Sky gives birth to two cubs named Scout and Amber in her den on a mountain slope. When April comes the bears will be ready to leave the den. As the bears leave the oncoming summer brings with it a threat of [[avalanche]]s. The bears are able to avoid disaster. Upon reaching the lush valley below, the cubs meet the other bears, some of which pose a threat to the cubs; among these bears are Magnus, a big healthy male, and Chinook, an older male. The family works together to survive the spring, with Sky keeping the cubs safe from Tikaani, a pesky lone [[Yukon wolf|wolf]]. The cubs get to know how to defend themselves in encounters with Tikaani. Also the family must stay clear of the frequent dominance fights between Magnus and Chinook.

As the spring wears on, the cubs learn about how to catch food. Sky leads the cubs to the mudflats to dig up [[clam]]s hiding under the mud. The family has a good time until the tide turns. In the chaos, Scout gets stranded on a sandbar. Unable to do much, Sky can only look on as the cub tries to free himself. He finally comes to his senses and swims over to Sky. The family heads to higher ground, where, after another encounter with Magnus, Chinook attacks again. As Sky fights off the male bear, Amber and Scout hide in a nearby log. After Chinook is driven away, Amber reappears from the log, but Scout is nowhere to be seen. Sky looks for him all day, but he's nowhere to be seen. Eventually, just as Sky and Amber are about to give up searching, Scout comes right back out of the log—he'd been hiding there the whole time.

When summer comes, so does the yearly [[salmon run]]. Dozens of bears gather along salmon streams on the coast to get the best of the run before it ends. This also leads in an increase in dominance fights between Magnus and Chinook. Sky, meanwhile, is looking for a different place to find food. A [[common raven|raven]] leads Sky and her two cubs to the golden pond just in time to save the brown bear family from their starvation. She and her cubs leave [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] and head north to [[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve]], where a pool filled with salmon supposedly awaits. When the bears arrive, however, they find that the salmon are not there yet. They wait and wait, and the situation gets worse by the hour. When it seems that their journey was for nothing, the salmon arrive. After the family fill themselves on the riches of the feast, they head back to Katmai as winter approaches. When the first snow arrives, all the bears head back up the mountains to their dens to sleep out the harsh cold winter. The cubs have learned a lot from their first year which will greatly help them for the rest of their lives.

==Production==
The central brown bear family was filmed at [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disneynature - Filmmakers to Explore Alaska's Grizzly Bears|url=http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/news/1102|publisher=The Walt Disney Studios|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105000727/http://www.waltdisneystudios.com/corp/news/1102|archive-date=2012-11-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fothergill and Scholey previously directed ''[[African Cats]]'' together.

[[Olivia Holt]] sang her song "Carry On" for the movie.

==Release==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20364">'''Book design''' is the art of incorporating the content, style, [[Word processor|format]], [[design]], and sequence of the various components and elements of a [[book]] into a coherent unit. In the words of the renowned typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] (1902–1974), book design, "though largely forgotten today, [relies upon] methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, [and which] have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Tschichold|Tschichold, Jan]], ''The Form of the Book'' (1991), Hartley &amp; Marks, {{ISBN|0-88179-116-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject", and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means.&lt;ref&gt;Hendel, Richard, ''On Book Design'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07570-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Modern books are paginated consecutively, and all pages are counted in the pagination whether or not the numbers appear. The page number, or [[folio]], is most commonly found at the top of the page, flush left verso, flush right recto. The folio may also be printed at the bottom of the page, and in that location it is called a drop folio. Drop folios usually appear either centered on each page or flush left verso and flush right recto.&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"&gt;University of Chicago Press. (2003). ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition. {{ISBN|978-0226104201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front matter===
Front matter (or preliminaries; shortened to "prelims") comprises the first section of a book, and is usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages. Front-matter pages are traditionally numbered in lower-case [[Roman numerals]] (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.), which prevents renumbering the remainder of a book when front-matter content is added at the last moment, such as a dedication page or additional acknowledgments. Page number is omitted on blank pages and display pages (i.e., such stand-alone pages as those for the half title, frontispiece, title page, colophon, dedication, and epigraph), and it is either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each section of the front matter (e.g., table of contents, foreword, preface).&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"/&gt; Front matter generally appears only in the first of a multi-volume work, although some elements (such as a table of contents or index) may appear in each volume.

The following table defines some common types of front matter, and the "voice" (or point of view) in which each can be said to be given:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Voice !! Purpose
|-
| [[Half title]] || Publisher || Usually a single line in capital letters, precedes the title page, and only contains the title (as opposed to the author, publisher etc. found on the full title page) with a blank [[verso]].
|-
| [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] || Author or publisher || A decorative illustration on the verso facing the title page. It may be related to the book's subject, or be a portrait of the author.
|-
| [[Title page]] || Publisher || Repeats the title and author as printed on the cover or spine.
|-
| [[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] || Printer || Technical information such as edition dates, copyrights, typefaces and the name and address of the printer. In modern books usually on the verso of the title page, but in some books placed at the end (see Back matter). Also known as the [[Edition notice]] or [[Copyright page]].
|-
| [[Dedication (publishing)|Dedication]] || Author || A dedication page is a page in a book that precedes the text, in which the author names the person or people for whom he/she has written the book.
|-
| [[Epigraph (literature)|Epigraph]] || Author || A phrase, quotation, or poem. The epigraph may serve as a preface, as a summary, as a counter-example, or to link the work to a wider [[Canon (fiction)|literary canon]], either to invite comparison, or to enlist a conventional context.
|-
| [[Table of contents]] || Publisher || This is a list of chapter headings, and nested subheadings, together with their respective page numbers. This includes all front-matter items listed below, together with chapters in the body matter and back matter. The number of levels of subheadings shown should be limited, so as to keep the contents list short, ideally one page, or possibly a double-page spread. Technical books may include a list of figures and a list of tables.
|-
| [[Foreword]] || Some person other than the author || Often, a foreword will tell of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the story or the writer of the story. A foreword to later editions of a work often explains in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.
|-
| [[Preface]] || Author || A preface generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or how the idea for the book was developed. This is often followed by thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.
|-
| [[Acknowledgment (creative arts)|Acknowledgments]] || Author || Often part of the preface, rather than a separate section in its own right, it acknowledges those who contributed to the creation of the book.
|-
| [[Introduction (essay)|Introduction]] || Author || A beginning section which states the purpose and goals of the following writing.
|-
| [[Prologue]] || Narrator (or a character in the book) || A prologue is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. As such, it is generally considered part of the body in modern book organization (cf. [[Chicago Manual of Style]]).
|}

===Body matter===
[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|[[Initial]] on the opening page of a book printed by the [[Kelmscott Press]]]]{{Main|Body text}}
The structure of a work—and especially of its body matter—is often described hierarchically.

* Volumes
*: A volume is a set of leaves bound together. Thus each work is either a volume, or is divided into volumes.
* Books and parts
*: Single-volume works account for most of the non-academic consumer market in books. A single volume may embody either a part of a book or the whole of a book&lt;!-- Is a book or part ever divided between volumes?  --&gt;; in some works, parts encompass multiple books, while in others, books may consist of multiple parts.
* Chapters and sections
*: A chapter or section may be contained within a part or a book. When both chapters and sections are used in the same work, the sections are more often contained within chapters than the reverse.
*Modules and units
*:In some books the chapters are grouped into bigger parts, sometimes called modules. The numbering of the chapters can begin again at the start of every module. In educational books, especially, the chapters are often called units.

The first page of the actual text of a book is the opening page, which often incorporates special design features, such as [[initial]]s. Arabic numbering starts at this first page. If the text is introduced by a second half title or opens with a part title, the half title or part title counts as page one. As in the front matter, page numbers are omitted on blank pages, and are either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each part and chapter. On pages containing only illustrations or tables, page numbers are usually omitted, except in the case of a long sequence of figures or tables.&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"/&gt;

The following are two instructive examples:
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has three parts (either in one volume each, or in a single volume), with each part containing two books, each containing, in turn, multiple chapters.
* The [[Christianity|Christian]] ''[[Bible]]'' (usually bound as a single volume) is divided into two "testaments" (which might more typically be described as "parts", and differ in length by a factor of three or four), each containing dozens of books, each in turn containing multiple chapters, which are most often divided (for purposes of [[citation]]) into "[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]]" each containing roughly one [[independent clause]].

===Back matter (end matter)===
{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with [[endpaper]]s.}}
The back matter, also known as end matter, if used, normally consists of one or more of the following components:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Voice !! Purpose
|-
| [[Epilogue]] || The narrator (or a character in the book) || This piece of writing at the end of a work of literature or drama is usually used to bring closure to the work.
|-
| [[:wikt:outro|Extro or Outro]] || || The conclusion to a piece of work; this is considered the opposite of the intro. These terms are more commonly used in music.
|-
| [[Afterword]] || The author, or some other real person || An afterword generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or of how the idea for the book was developed.
|-
| [[:wikt:conclusion|Conclusion]] || Author ||
|-
| [[Postscript]] || ||
|-
| [[Addendum|Appendix or Addendum]] || Author || This supplemental addition to a given main work may correct errors, explain inconsistencies or otherwise detail or update the information found in the main work.
|-
| [[Glossary]] || Author || The glossary consists of a set of definitions of words of importance to the work. They are normally alphabetized. The entries may consist of places and characters, which is common for longer works of fiction.
|-
| [[Bibliography]] || Author || This cites other works consulted when writing the body. It is most common in non-fiction books or research papers.
|-
| [[Index (publishing)|Index]] || Publisher || This list of terms used in the text contains references, often page numbers, to where the terms can be found in the text. Most common in non-fiction books.
|-
| [[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] || Publisher || This brief description may be located at the end of a book or on the verso of the title page. It describes production notes relevant to the edition and may include a printer's mark or logotype.
|-
| [[Postface]] || ||
|}

Arabic numbering continues for the back matter.

==Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket==
[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Spine (bookbinding)|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In a book store, it is often the details on the spine that attract the attention first.]]

The [[front cover]] is the front of the book, and is marked appropriately by text or graphics in order to identify it as such (namely as the very beginning of the book). The front cover usually contains at least the [[title]] or [[author]], with possibly an appropriate [[illustration]].

On the inside of the cover page, extending to the facing page is the front [[endpaper]] sometimes referred as FEP. The free half of the end paper is called a ''flyleaf''. Traditionally, in hand-bound books, the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book. In modern [[publishing]] it can be either plain, as in many text-oriented books, or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as [[picture book]]s, other children's literature, some [[handicraft|arts and craft]] and hobbyist books, novelty/gift-market and [[coffee table book]]s, and [[graphic novel]]s. These books have an audience and traditions of their own where the [[graphic design]] and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important.

The [[spine (bookbinding)|spine]] is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a [[bookshelf]]. It is customary for it to have printed text on it. In texts published or printed in the United States and the United Kingdom, the spine text, when vertical, runs from the top to the bottom, such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top. In books from continental Europe, vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up, though this convention has been changing lately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book on the Bookshelf | author = Petroski, Henry | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf Inc | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-375-40649-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spine usually contains all, or some, of four elements (besides decoration, if any), and in the following order: (1) author, editor, or compiler; (2) title; (3) publisher; and (4) publisher logo.

On the inside of the back cover page, extending from the facing page before it, is the endpaper. Its design matches the front endpaper and, in accordance with it, contains either plain paper or pattern, image etc.

The back cover often contains biographical matter about the author or editor, and quotes from other sources praising the book. It may also contain a summary or description of the book

==Binding==
{{Main article|Book binding}}
Books are classified under two categories according to the physical nature of their binding. The designation [[hardcover]] (or hardback) refers to books with [[Stiffness|stiff]] covers, as opposed to [[Flexibility|flexible]] ones. The binding of a hardcover book usually includes boards (often made of [[paperboard]]) covered in cloth, leather, or other materials. The binding is usually sewn to the pages using string stitching.

A less expensive binding method is that used for [[paperback]] books (sometimes called softback or softcover). Most paperbacks are bound with paper or light cardboard, though other materials (such as plastic) are used. The covers are flexible and usually bound to the pages using glue (perfect binding). Some small paperback books are sub-classified as pocketbooks. These paperbacks are smaller than usual—small enough to barely fit into a pocket (especially the back pocket of one's trousers). However, this capacity to fit into a pocket diminishes with increasing number of pages and increasing thickness of the book. Such a book may still be designated as a pocketbook.

==Other items==
Some books such as Bibles or dictionaries may have a [[thumb index]] to help find material quickly. Gold leaf may also be applied to the edges of the pages, so that when closed, the side, top, and bottom of the book have a golden color. On some books, a design may be printed on the edges, or marbling or a simple colour applied. Some [[artist's book]]s go even further, by using [[fore-edge painting]]. [[Pop-up book|Pop-up]] elements and fold-out pages may be used to add dimensions to the page in different ways. Children's books commonly incorporate a wide array of design features built into the fabric of the book. Some books for preschoolers include textured fabric, plastic on other materials. Die-cut techniques in the work of [[Eric Carle]] are one example. Clear or reflective surfaces, flaps, textiles and [[scratch-and-sniff]] are other possible features.

==Page spread==
{{See also|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|right|300px|Page spread with [[canons of page construction|J. A. van de Graaf's construction]] of classical text area (''print space'') and margin proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Graaf, J. A.. ''Nieuwe berekening voor de vormgeving.'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A basic unit in book design is the page spread. The left page (called ''[[verso]]'') and right page (called ''[[recto]]'') are of the same size and aspect ratio, and are centered on the gutter where they are bound together at the [[Bookbinding|spine]].

The design of each individual page, on the other hand, is governed by the [[canons of page construction]].

The possible layout of the sets of letters of the alphabet, or words, on a page is determined by the so-called print space, and is also an element in the design of the page of the book. Clearly, there must be sufficient space, at the [[Spine (bookbinding)|spine]] of the book, if the text is to be visible. On the other hand, the other three [[Margin (typography)|margins]] of the page, which frame the book, are made of the appropriate size for both practical and [[aesthetic]] reasons.

===Print space===
The print space (German ''Satzspiegel'') is a typographic term and determines the effective area on the paper of a book, journal or other press work. The print space is limited by the surrounding borders, or in other words the gutters outside the printed area.

The German term comes originally from [[hot metal typesetting|hot-metal typesetting]]: above the desktop was a mirror (German: ''Spiegel'') where the typesetter could read the inverted letters.

'''''Cat Ballou''''' is a 1965 American [[Western (genre)|western]] [[musical film|musical comedy film]] starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lee Marvin]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his [[evil twin|dual role]]. The story involves a woman who hires a notorious gunman to protect her father's ranch, and later to avenge his murder, but finds that the gunman is not what she expected. The supporting cast features [[Tom Nardini]], [[Michael Callan]], [[Dwayne Hickman]], and singers [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Stubby Kaye]], who together perform the movie's theme song, onscreen, throughout the film.

The film was directed by [[Elliot Silverstein]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]] and [[Frank Pierson]] from the novel ''The Ballad of Cat Ballou'' by Roy Chanslor. Chanslor's novel was a serious Western, and though it was turned into a comedy for the movie, the filmmakers retained some darker elements. The film references many classic Western films, notably ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''.

==Plot==
Catherine "Cat" Ballou, who wants to be a schoolteacher, is returning home from boarding school by train to (fictional) Wolf City, [[Wyoming]], to the ranch of her father, Frankie Ballou. On the way, she unwittingly helps accused cattle rustler Clay Boone elude his captor, Sheriff Maledon, when Boone's Uncle Jed, a drunkard disguised as a preacher, distracts the lawman.

Arriving home, Cat learns that the Wolf City Development Corporation is scheming to take the ranch from her father, whose sole defender is his ranch hand, educated Native American Jackson Two-Bears.  Clay and Jed appear and reluctantly offer to help Catherine, and she hires legendary gunfighter Kid Shelleen to help protect her father from gunslinger Tim Strawn, the hired killer who is threatening him.

Shelleen arrives, and proves to be a drunken bum whose pants fall down when he draws his gun, and who is unable to hit a barn when he shoots.  Strawn kills Frankie, and when the townspeople refuse to bring Strawn to justice, Catherine becomes a revenge-seeking outlaw known as Cat Ballou.  She and her gang rob a train carrying the Wolf City payroll, then take refuge in "[[Hole-in-the-Wall]]", where desperados go to hide from the law, but are thrown out when it is learned what they have done, since Hole-in-the-Wall can only continue to exist on the sufferance of Wolf City.  Shelleen, inspired by his caring affection for Cat, works himself into shape, dresses up in his finest gunfighting outfit, and goes into town to kill Strawn, casually revealing later that Strawn is his brother.

Cat poses as a prostitute and confronts Sir Harry Percival, the head of the Wolf City Development Corporation.  A struggle ensues, Sir Harry is killed, and Cat is sentenced to be hanged.  With Sir Harry dead, there's no hope for Wolf City's future, and the townspeople have no mercy for Cat.  As the noose is placed around her neck, Uncle Jed appears, again dressed as a preacher, and cuts the rope just as the trapdoor is opened. Cat falls through and onto a wagon and her gang spirits her away in a daring rescue.

Cole and Kaye, billed simply as "Shouters", act as a [[Greek chorus]], intermittently appearing onscreen to narrate the story through ongoing verses of "The Ballad of Cat Ballou", one of the songs written by [[Mack David]] and [[Jerry Livingston]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4484/Cat-Ballou/music.html "Music"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
*The film was director [[Elliot Silverstein]]'s second feature film, and his relationship with producer [[Harold Hecht]] while filming was not smooth.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;
*[[Ann-Margret]] was the first choice for the title role but her manager turned it down without letting the actress know. Ann-Margret wrote in her autobiography that she would have wanted the part.&lt;ref&gt;Passafiume, Andrea (ed.) [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4484/Cat-Ballou/articles.html "Cat Ballou"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Among others, [[Kirk Douglas]] allegedly turned down the role of Shelleen.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt; Years later he played a similar double role in ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]''.
*Nat King Cole was ill with [[lung cancer]] during the filming of ''Cat Ballou''. A [[chain smoking|chain smoker]], Cole died four months before the film was released.
*The film was shot in 28 days.&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;[[Robert Osborne|Osborne, Robert]]. Outro to [[Turner Classic Movies]] presentation of ''Cat Ballou'' (May 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Noted make-up artist [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]] created the prosthetic nose worn by Lee Marvin as Strawn in the film.&lt;ref name=guardian01&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary:John Chambers: Make-up master responsible for Hollywood's finest space-age creatures|author=Pendreigh, Brian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/07/guardianobituaries.filmnews |publisher=The Guardian |date=7 September 2001  |accessdate=Feb 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A former [[Great Western Railway of Colorado]] [[2-8-0]] Consolidation steam locomotive, number 51, owned by Boulder Scientific Company of [[Boulder, Colorado]], was used in the film, with scenes shot at [[Canon City]], Colorado, in September 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"Steam! News Photos, ''Trains'', Kalmbach Publishing Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, February 1965, Volume 25, Number 4, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film was well received by critics and was popular with moviegoers and earned over $20.6 million in ticket sales in 1965, making it one of the [[1965 in film|top ten moneymaking movies that year]].&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "a breezy little film" which "does have flashes of good satiric wit. But, under Elliott Silverstein's direction, it is mostly just juvenile lampoon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther |date=June 25, 1965 |title=The Screen: 'Cat Ballou' |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "emerges middlingly successful, sparked by an amusing way-out approach and some sparkling performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 12, 1965 |title=Cat Ballou |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film as a "springy satire," adding, "What makes this fun is the style. Forming a mighty cool duo, Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye sing their way in and out of the plot with folk songs which Cole '[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]' Porter would have relished. The format is novel and stylishly delivered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coe |first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard L. Coe |date=June 24, 1965 |title='Cat Ballou' Is Zingy Spoof |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=D20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' called it "lumpen, coy, and obvious, a self-consciously cute movie," adding that "mainly it is full of sort-of-funny and trying-to-be-funny ''ideas;'' and a movie is not just ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kael |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Kael |date=Fall 1965 |title=Cat Ballou |url= |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip K. Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "I'm in the minority, apparently. 'Cat Ballou,' which is being hailed as a cowboy '[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]' or something of the sort, seems to me about as funny as a soundtrack burp."&lt;ref&gt;Scheuer, Philip K. (June 19, 1965). "Why the Hullabaloo About 'Cat Ballou?'" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, "The jokes in ''Cat Ballou'' are uneven, but the mood behind the film is happily consistent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1965 |title=Cat Ballou |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=32 |issue=380 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a score of 100% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 21 reviews, with an average grade of 7.4 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cat_ballou/ |title=Cat Ballou |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=November 18, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Oscar acceptance speech, Lee Marvin concluded by saying, "I think, though, that half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in [[San Fernando Valley]]," a reference to the horse Kid Shelleen rode, which appeared to be as drunk as Shelleen was.&lt;ref name=osborne /&gt;

==In popular culture==
*''Cat Ballou'' is the favorite film of comedy directors [[The Farrelly Brothers|Bobby and Peter Farrelly]], as stated in The [[American Film Institute|AFI]] ''100 Years, 100 Laughs'' television special. The Balladeers from their film, ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', are inspired by similar characters in ''Cat Ballou''.
*Imagery from the hanging scene of [[Jane Fonda]] was spoofed advocating her [[execution]] for [[treason]] following her 1972 visit to [[Hanoi]]. A brief shot from that scene was used as part of [[Alex DeLarge]]'s sadistic reverie in the movie ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.
*"Cat Ballou" is a card in the [[spaghetti western]] [[board game]] ''[[Bang! (card game)|Bang!]]''.
*In a 2014 interview on [[NPR]], actor [[Bryan Cranston]] called ''Cat Ballou'' the "movie that had the most impact" on him when he was growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Gross|Gross, Terry]].

'''{{lang|gd|Clach an Tiompain}}''' (in [[English language|English]], the "Sounding Stone") or '''The Eagle Stone''' is a small Class I [[Pictish stones|Pictish stone]]&lt;ref name="RCAHMS" /&gt; located on a hill on the northern outskirts of [[Strathpeffer]] in [[Easter Ross]], [[Scotland]].

==Description==
The stone is made of blue [[gneiss]] and is {{convert|32|in|cm}} high, {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide, and {{convert|10|in|cm}} thick.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;{{citation | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/12458/ | title=Site Record for Strathpeffer, Clach An Tiompain, Strathpeffer, The Eaglestone | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland   }}. Has some nice pictures, including drawings of the images&lt;/ref&gt; Carved on the southeast side are two images, a [[horse shoe]]-like [[arc (geometry)|arc]] symbol above an [[eagle]]. 

==History==
The stone was originally located further down the hill, towards Dingwall, but was moved to its current site in 1411.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Douglas, ''The Stones of the Pictish Peninsulas'', (Hilton Trust, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; One old tradition is that the stone marks the site of a [[Scottish clan]] battle that took place in 1411 between the [[Clan Munro]] and a branch of the [[Clan Donald|Clan MacDonald]], and that the stone commemorates a Munro victory as it is marked with their symbol, an eagle.&lt;ref&gt;Gracie, James. "the Munros". Published by Lang Syne Publishers Ltd, 1997, 2007. Chapter 2. Pages 18 - 19. {{ISBN|978-1-85217-080-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone is associated with the prophecies of the 16th century [[Brahan Seer]] ({{lang-gd|Coinneach Odhar}}). He predicted that if the stone fell three times, the surrounding valley would be flooded, and the stone used as an anchor.

It has since fallen twice, and is now set in concrete.

'''Critical making''' refers to the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society.
It was invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiSalvo, C|title=Design and the Construction of Publics|journal=Design Issues|year=2009|volume=25|series=1|page=48|doi=10.1162/desi.2009.25.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of critical making resides in the learning extracted from the process of making rather than the experience derived from the finished output. The term "critical making" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/critical-making-matt-ratto/&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as way "to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ratto, M. |author2=Ree, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Materializing information: 3D printing and social change.|journal=First Monday|year=2012|volume=17|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Critical making", as defined by practitioners like Matt Ratto and Stephen Hockema, "is an elision of two typically disconnected modes of engagement in the world — "critical thinking," often considered as abstract, explicit, linguistically based, internal and cognitively individualistic; and "making," typically understood as tacit, embodied, external, and community-oriented."

==History of Critical Making==
=== Matt Ratto and Critical Making ===
Matt Ratto coined the term in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Ratto, Matt. "Flwr Pwr: Tending the Walled Garden." 2-day Critical Making Workshop for the Walled Garden conference, Virtueel Platform, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, November 20–22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards [[Critical design|creating]] and/or making things within a technological context.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Critical Making: Conceptual and Material Studies in technology and Social Life|journal=The Information Society|year=2011|volume=27|pages=252|doi=10.1080/01972243.2011.583819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto claims that his goal was to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to materialized activities. By situating himself within the area of "design-oriented research" rather than "research-oriented research," Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues.&lt;ref name="CriticalMaking"/&gt; However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical "making" process, regardless of quality of the final material production.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratto|first=Matt|title=Open Design and Critical Making|journal=Open Design Now: Why Design Cannot Remain Exclusive|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical "making". Specifically, experts in technology lack a knowledge of art, and vice versa. However it is very important that technology be embedded in a context rather than being left in isolation, especially when it comes to critical making.

The Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making. The mission of the lab is to enhance collaboration, communication, and the practice-based engagement in critical making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Lab|url=http://criticalmaking.com/about/|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of critical making is open design.&lt;ref name="OpenDesignCriticalMaking"/&gt;Open design develops a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices and norms of society, reconnecting materiality and morality. Matt Ratto introduces Critical Making as processes of material and conceptual exploration and creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves. Critical Making includes digital software and hardware. Software usually refers to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Hardware refers to a computer, or any other device that facilitates an operation.

=== Garnet Hertz and Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[Garnet Hertz]] adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled "Critical Making" published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/ &lt;/ref&gt; It explores how hands-on productive work ‐ making ‐ can supplement and extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including [[Norman White]], [[Julian Bleecker]], [[Dunne &amp; Raby]], [[Daniel Charny]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Golan Levin]], [[Matt Ratto]], [[Natalie Jeremijenko]], [[McKenzie Wark]], [[Paul Dourish]], [[Mitch Altman]], [[Dale Dougherty]], [[Mark Pauline]], [[Scott Snibbe]], [[Reed Ghazala]] and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as "things to think with".&lt;ref&gt;http://futureeverything.org/events/critical-making/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertz initially set out to make a zine of about 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create "makerspaces" for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.

In 2014, Hertz founded "The Studio for Critical Making" at [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] as [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[Design]] and [[Media Arts]]. The facility "explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed or usability with more complex cultural, social and human-oriented values. The end result is technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged and personalized." &lt;ref&gt;http://research.ecuad.ca/criticalmaking/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses of Critical Making ===
In 2012, [[John Maeda]] began using the term while at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled "The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice" published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118517865.html &lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include [[Amaranth Borsuk]] ([[University of Washington]]-Bothell), Jentery Sayers ([[University of Victoria]]), Roger Whitson ([[Washington State University]]), Kari Kraus ([[University of Maryland]]), Amy Papaelias ([[SUNY-New Paltz]]), and Jessica Barness ([[Kent State University]]).

== Concepts Related to Critical Making ==

=== DIY and Critical Making ===
Traditional DIY is criticized due to its costs and standards. DIY products are difficult to spread in lower-income areas where issues of cost and ease are more commonly cited (William, 276).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice? Evaluating the motives of do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers. I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=276|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, TET increases the technological standard of DIY,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kuznetsov, S. |author2= Paulos, E. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Rise of the expert amateur: DIY projects, communities, and cultures.|journal=In Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries|year=2010|pages=295–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhance the modernity of it, and open up a more practical and advanced area for DIY projects to develop. It is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blikstein, P.|title=Gears of our childhood: constructionist toolkits, robotics, and physical computing, past and future|journal=In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children|year=2013|pages=173–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; "DIY activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and/or self-employed individuals. Instead, and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies, their explanation for engagement in DIY is firmly grounded in human agency" (Williams, 273).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Colin C.|title=A lifestye choice? Evaluating the motives of do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers. I|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4/5|page=273|doi=10.1108/09590550410534613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speculative Design and Critical Making ===
According to DiSalvo and Lukens, "Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting, that is "unreal" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lukens, J. |author2= DiSalvo, C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Speculative Design and Technological Fluency|journal=International Journal of Learning|year=2011|volume=3|series=4|pages=23–40|doi=10.1162/ijlm_a_00080}}{{Dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.

=== [[3D printing|3D Printing]] and Critical Making ===
3D Printing allows for the relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects. There are two types of industrial manufacturing. The first is subtractive manufacturing, which involves shaping a material through a process of chipping / removing some of its substance (think whittling a figure out of wood). The second is additive manufacturing, which is created by adding material into a product. The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design: design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website (like Thingiverse, for example), press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design. 3D printers use layerization to create objects. 3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects, including plastic, metal and nylon (Flemming, What is 3D printing?). The Makerbot, for example, uses polylactic acid (PLA), a substance derived from corn. The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder, causing the PLA to melt. This melted material forms the model's layers, which is applied in approximately .02 - 1 millimeter layers. The model is built up until it is finished.

[[File:Carbon lattice diamond.png|thumb|The [[Diamond cubic|diamond crystal structure]] belongs to the face-centered [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]], with a repeated two-atom pattern.]]
In [[crystallography]], the terms '''crystal system''', '''crystal family''', and '''lattice system''' each refer to one of several classes of [[space group]]s, [[Bravais lattice|lattice]]s, [[point group]]s, or [[crystal]]s. Informally, two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries, although there are many exceptions to this.

Crystal systems, crystal families and lattice systems are similar but slightly different, and there is widespread confusion between them: in particular the [[trigonal crystal system]] is often confused with the [[rhombohedral lattice system]], and the term "crystal system" is sometimes used to mean "lattice system" or "crystal family".

Space groups and crystals are divided into seven crystal systems according to their point groups, and into seven lattice systems according to their [[Bravais lattice]]s. Five of the crystal systems are essentially the same as five of the lattice systems, but the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems differ from the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems. The six crystal families are formed by combining the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems into one [[hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal family]], in order to eliminate this confusion.

==Overview==
[[File:Hanksite.JPG|thumb|Hexagonal [[hanksite]] crystal, with threefold ''c''-axis symmetry]]
A '''lattice system''' is a class of lattices with the same set of lattice [[Point groups in three dimensions|point groups]], which are subgroups of the [[Space group|arithmetic crystal classes]]. The 14 [[Bravais lattice]]s are grouped into seven lattice systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic.

In a '''crystal system''', a set of point groups and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case both the crystal and lattice systems have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system. In total there are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

A '''crystal family''' is determined by lattices and point groups. It is formed by combining crystal systems which have space groups assigned to a common lattice system. In three dimensions, the crystal families and  systems are identical, except the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems, which are combined into one hexagonal crystal family. In total there are six crystal families: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

Spaces with less than three dimensions have the same number of crystal systems, crystal families and lattice systems. In one-dimensional space, there is one crystal system. In 2D space, there are four crystal systems: oblique, rectangular, square, and hexagonal.

The relation between three-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems and lattice systems is shown in the following table:

Point symmetry can be thought of in the following fashion: consider the coordinates which make up the structure, and project them all through a single point, so that (''x'',''y'',''z'') becomes (−''x'',−''y'',−''z''). This is the 'inverted structure'. If the original structure and inverted structure are identical, then the structure is ''centrosymmetric''. Otherwise it is ''non-centrosymmetric''. Still, even for non-centrosymmetric case, inverted structure in some cases can be rotated to align with the original structure. This is the case of non-centrosymmetric achiral structure. If the inverted structure cannot be rotated to align with the original structure, then the structure is chiral (enantiomorphic) and its symmetry group is ''enantiomorphic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Howard D.|last=Flack|year=2003|title=Chiral and Achiral Crystal Structures|journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta|volume=86|issue=4|pages= 905–921|doi=10.1002/hlca.200390109|citeseerx=10.1.1.537.266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A direction (meaning a line without an arrow) is called ''polar'' if its two directional senses are geometrically or physically different. A polar symmetry{{clarify|date=October 2014}} direction of a crystal is called a polar axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hahn|2002|p=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups containing a polar axis are called ''[[polar point group|polar]]''. A polar crystal possess a "unique" axis (found in no other directions) such that some geometrical or physical property is different at the two ends of this axis. It may develop a [[Polarization density|dielectric polarization]], e.g. in [[Pyroelectricity|pyroelectric crystals]]. A polar axis can occur only in non-centrosymmetric structures. There should also not be a mirror plane or twofold axis perpendicular to the polar axis, because they will make both directions of the axis equivalent.

The [[crystal structure]]s of chiral biological molecules (such as [[protein]] structures) can only occur in the 65 [[Chirality (chemistry)|enantiomorphic]] space groups (biological molecules are usually [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]). 
&lt;!--The protein assemblies themselves may have symmetries other than those given above, because they are not intrinsically restricted by the [[Crystallographic restriction theorem]]. For example the [[Rad52]] DNA binding protein has an 11-fold rotational symmetry (in human), however, it must form crystals in one of the 65 [[Chirality (chemistry)|enantiomorphic]] space groups given above. --&gt;

{{Clear}}

In [[geometry]] and [[crystallography]], a '''Bravais lattice''' is a category of [[symmetry group]]s for [[translational symmetry]] in three directions, or correspondingly, a category of translation [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s.

Such symmetry groups consist of translations by vectors of the form

:'''R''' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[integer]]s and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are three non-coplanar vectors, called ''primitive vectors''.

These lattices are classified by [[space group]] of the translation lattice itself; there are 14 Bravais lattices in three dimensions; each can apply in one lattice system only. They represent the maximum symmetry a structure with the translational symmetry concerned can have.

All crystalline materials must, by definition fit in one of these arrangements (not including [[quasicrystal]]s).

For convenience a Bravais lattice is depicted by a unit cell which is a factor 1, 2, 3 or 4 larger than the [[primitive cell]]. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal or other pattern, the [[fundamental domain]] is again smaller, up to a factor 48.

The Bravais lattices were studied by [[Moritz Ludwig Frankenheim]] in 1842, who found that there were 15 Bravais lattices. This was corrected to 14 by [[Auguste Bravais|A. Bravais]] in 1848&lt;!-- or 1849 or 1850, Britannica has two different years--&gt;.

==In four-dimensional space==

‌The four-dimensional unit cell is defined by four edge lengths (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') and six interaxial angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ'', ''ε'', ''ζ''). The following conditions for the lattice parameters define 23 crystal families

The names here are given according to Whittaker.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. J. W.|last=Whittaker|title=An Atlas of Hyperstereograms of the Four-Dimensional Crystal Classes|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford &amp; New York|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost the same as in Brown ''et al'',&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|first1=H.|last1=Brown|first2=R.|last2=Bülow|first3=J.|last3=Neubüser|first4=H.|last4=Wondratschek|first5=H.|last5=Zassenhaus|title=Crystallographic Groups of Four-Dimensional Space|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exception for names of the crystal families 9, 13, and 22. The names for these three families according to Brown ''et al'' are given in parenthesis.

The relation between four-dimensional crystal families, crystal systems, and lattice systems is shown in the following table.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Enantiomorphic systems are marked with an asterisk. The number of enantiomorphic pairs are given in parentheses. Here the term "enantiomorphic" has a different meaning than in the table for three-dimensional crystal classes. The latter means, that enantiomorphic point groups describe chiral (enantiomorphic) structures. In the current table, "enantiomorphic" means that a group  itself (considered as a geometric object) is enantiomorphic, like enantiomorphic pairs of three-dimensional space groups P3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;22 and P4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;22. Starting from four-dimensional space, point groups also can be enantiomorphic in this sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''Culinary names''', '''menu names''', or '''kitchen names''' are names of foods used in the preparation or selling of food, as opposed to their names in [[agriculture]] or in scientific [[nomenclature]]. The menu name may even be different from the kitchen name. For example, from the 19th until the mid-20th century, many restaurant menus were written in [[French language|French]] and not in the local language.

Examples include [[veal]] ([[calf]]), [[calamari]] ([[squid]]), and [[sweetbread]]s ([[pancreas]] or [[thymus gland]]). Culinary names are especially common for fish and seafood, where multiple species are marketed under a single familiar name.

Foods may come to have distinct culinary names for a variety of reasons:

* [[Euphemism]]: the idea of eating some foods may disgust or offend some eaters regardless of their actual taste
** [[Testicle]]s: [[Rocky Mountain oysters]], Prairie oysters, lamb fries, or [[animelles]]
** Fish [[Milt]]:  soft roe or white roe to disguise that is actually sperm not eggs
** Thymus gland and pancreas gland: [[sweetbreads]]
** [[Kangaroo meat]]:  "Australus" has been proposed as a euphemism{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Attractiveness: the traditional name may be considered dull, undistinctive, or unattractive
** [[Kiwifruit]]:  a rename of the Chinese gooseberry, which references its fuzzy brown skin, and has now become its standard name
** Mahi-Mahi:  the [[Coryphaenidae|dolphinfish]] is often referred to with this name to avoid confusion with [[dolphin]] (the mammal) meat
** The [[Patagonian toothfish]] is marketed as the Chilean sea bass
** The African Cichlid found in many [[aquarium|aquaria]] is presented as [[Tilapia]]
** The spinal [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of veal and [[beef]] is called ''amourettes''&lt;ref&gt;from a Provencal word for roosters' testicles, but homonymous with 'puppy love' [[Le petit Robert]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='simon'&gt;Andre Simon, ''A concise encyclopedia of gastronomy'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grouping of a variety of sources under a single name
** [[Tuna]] includes several different species
* Evocation of more prestigious, rarer, and more expensive foods for which they are a substitute
** [[Cyclopterus lumpus|Lumpsucker]] (or lumpfish) [[roe]] is named lumpfish [[caviar]]
** [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|Cassia]] bark is called [[cinnamon]]
** [[Langostino]] is sometimes called [[lobster]] or "langostino lobster"
** In North America, many [[flounder]] species are called [[Sole (fish)|soles]], ''e.g.'' [[Microstomus pacificus]] is named "Dover sole"
* Evocation of a specific culinary tradition
** Shrimp in Italian-American contexts is often called scampi
** Florentine refers to dishes that include spinach
** Squid is often called by its Italian name, calamari, on menus&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gisslen, ''Professional Cooking'', p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social differences
** The words beef, veal, [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[venison]] and [[poultry]] are derived from the words used by the French-speaking lords in post-[[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] England{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* Other
** In French, [[chestnut]]s are called ''châtaignes'' on the tree, but ''marrons'' in the kitchen
** [[Laver (seaweed)|Laver]] is a culinary name for certain edible algae&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Her professional career, international in scope, albeit centered in France, spanned more than sixty years.&lt;ref&gt;Francis de Coninck, ''Françoise Adret: Soixante Années de Danse'' (Paris: Centre National de la Danse, 2007).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt; This work contains complete biographical and professional information.&lt;/ref&gt; She was recognized as one of the most innovative creators of contemporary dance in western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Julien, "Entretien: Françoise Adret", ''Les Saisons de la Danse'' (Paris), no. 228 (October 1991), pp. 19–20.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette Boris, "French Choreographers Creating New Worlds," ''Ballett International'' (Berlin), vol. 12 (November 1989), pp. 28-31.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and career==
{{moresources|section|date=April 2018}}
Born in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], Adret began her dance training at an early age. In the 1930s she studied with the leading Franco-Russian teachers in Paris, including [[Victor Gsovsky]] and [[Serge Lifar]]. In the late 1940s, following World War II, she had a modest career with the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], making a notable appearance at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in 1948 in a principal role in Lifar's production of ''Le Pas d'Acier'' ("The Steel Step"), a modern ballet about Soviet factory workers set to a score in ''le style mécanique'' by [[Prokofiev]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

From Lifar, director of the Paris Opera Ballet from 1930-44, and from 1947-58, she learned much about company administration and direction. Under his guidance, she made her first choreography, entitled ''La Conjuration'' ("The Conspiracy"), in 1948. Based on a poem by [[René Char]], it was set to music by Jacques Porte and had décor by [[Georges Braque]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Later that year, Adret left the Paris Opera Ballet and beame ballet mistress of [[Roland Petit]]'s Ballets de Paris, touring with the company in western Europe. In 1951 she succeeded Darja Collin as director of the Ballet of the [[Netherlands Opera]] in Amsterdam while continuing to work with Petit's company,&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Utrecht, "Netherlands: Theatrical Dance since 1945", ''International Encyclopedia of Dance''(New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, pg. 591.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; raising the technical level of the dancers in both companies. Working in Amsterdam until 1958, she also expanded the repertory of the Dutch company with classical ballets and a number of original choreographic works.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In 1960, she became ballet mistress of the Ballet de l'[[Opéra de Nice]] and remained with that company until 1963, staging opera divertissements and modern ballets. She then spent a few years as an international guest choreographer, staging works for Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas in Paris, PACT/TRUK Ballet in Johannesburg, the Warsaw Opera Ballet, the [[Zagreb Opera]] Ballet, and the [[Harkness Ballet]] in New York City. While residing in [[Panama]], she created the Ballet Nacional de Panamá.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Returning to France, Adret joined [[Jean-Albert Cartier]] in 1968 in the creation of the Ballet Théâtre Contemporain, the first national choreographic center, established in [[Amiens]]. She was choreographic director of the repertory, and for it she created some of her most notable works, including ''Aquathémes'' and ''Requiem''.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Babsky, "Ballet-Théâtre Contemporain," in ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'' (1998), vol. 1, pp. 349–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the company moved from Amiens to [[Angers]] and   embarked on its first tour of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Kisselgoff, "Ballet Théâtre Contemporain: French troupe starts first tour in Brooklyn," ''New York Times'' (10 November 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

Adret remained with Ballet Théâtre Contemporain for ten years, until 1978, when it was subsumed by the activities of the newly established [[Centre National de Danse Contemporaine]]. She was then appointed inspector general for dance projects in the Ministry of Culture, a post she retained until 1985, when she was invited by Louis Erlo, director of the [[Lyon Opera]], to create a new ballet company committed to contemporary choreographers. During her seven years there, until 1992, Adret put the company in the forefront of contemporary dance in France.&lt;ref&gt;Ginger Danto, "Lyon Opéra Ballet: Cinderella Story", ''Dance Magazine'' (September 1992), pp. 48–51.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Adret next became artistic director and chief choreographer of the Ballet du Nord in [[Roubaix]], where in 1994 she mounted two new versions of ''Symphonie de Psaumes'' and ''Le Tricorne''. From 1995 to 1998 the Association Française d'Action Artistique sent her on three overseas missions, during which she taught dance classes and choreographed works in Seoul, South Korea, in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Asunción, Paraguay. She then returned to France, working again with Roland Petit, serving as ballet mistress of his [[Ballet National de Marseille]] in 1997 and 1998.{{cn|date=April 2018}} 

On 1 July 1999  she accepted a temporary appointment as artistic director of the Ballet de Lorraine, replacing [[Pierre Lacotte]], who had returned to the Paris Opera Ballet. Nearing her eightieth birthday, she served in that post for an interim period of one year.&lt;ref&gt;Phillippe Noissette, "Invité Françoise Adret: 'Je n'ai pas peur de l'échec,'" interview, ''Danser'' (Paris), no. 188 (May 2000), pp. 8–10, 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2000, she has remained actively interested in the contemporary dance scene in France.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Awards and honors==
For her work as inspector general of dance projects in the Ministry of Culture, Adret was made a ''commandeur'' in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1983. In recognition of her role in developing contemporary dance in France, she received the Grand Prix National de la Danse in 1987, and in 1994 she was named as a ''chevalier'' in the Ordre National de la Légion d'Honneur.

==Legacy==
A small, energetic woman with a sparkling wit, Adret was generally acknowledged as a ''figure incontournable'' ("indispensable person") in twentieth-century French dance. She was praised for her work as a pedagogue and greatly admired for her unique artistic vision, which allowed her to reconcile her dance works on the cutting edge of modernity with the classic ballet repertory of yesteryear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dansemavie.free.fr/danse/Francoise_Adret.html "Françoise Adret"], ''Danse Ma Vie''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georges Antoine Rochegrosse''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ ɑ̃twan ʁɔʃɡʁɔs|lang}}; 1859&amp;ndash;1938) was a French [[history painting|historical]] and decorative painter.

==Life and career==
[[File:Marie Rochegrosse dans la Salle à Manger by Georges Rochegrosse.jpg|thumb|left|Marie Rochegrosse dans la Salle à Manger. Dated 1904]]
[[File:Le Chevalier aux Fleurs 2560x1600.png|thumb|300px|''Le Chevalier aux Fleurs (The Knight of Flowers)'']]
[[File:Georges Rochegrosse's poster for Jules Massenet's Don Quichotte.jpg|thumb|left|1910 poster for [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Don Quichotte]]'']]
He was born at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and studied in [[Paris]] with [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]] and [[Gustave Boulanger|Gustave Clarence Rodolphe Boulanger]]. &lt;ref&gt;Waller, S. (ed.), ''Foreign Artists and Communities in Modern Paris, 1870&amp;ndash;1914: Strangers in Paradise,'' Routledge, 2017, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; His themes are generally historical, and he treated them on a colossal scale and in an emotional naturalistic style, with a distinct revelling in horrible subjects and details.  He made his [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] début in 1882 with ''Vitellis traîné dans les rues de Rome par la populace (Vitellius dragged through the streets of Rome by the people)'' (1882; Sens). He followed this the year afterwards with ''Andromaque'' (1882–83; [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]]), which won that year's prestigious Prix du Salon. There followed ''La Jacquerie'' (1885; Untraced), ''Le mort de Babylone (The fall of Babylon)'' (1891; Untraced), ''The death of the Emperor Geta'' (1899; [[Musée de Picardie|Musée de Picardie, Amiens]]), and ''Barbarian ambassadors at the Court of Justinian'' (1907; Untraced), all of which exemplify his strong and spirited but sensational and often brutal painting. In quite another style and beautiful in color is his ''[[:File:Le Chevalier aux Fleurs 2560x1600.png|Le Chevalier aux Fleurs (The Knight of Flowers)]]'' (1894; [[Musée d'Orsay|Musée d’Orsay, Paris]]; RF 898).  

He was elected an [[Legion of Honour|Officer of the Legion of Honor]] in 1892 and received the medal of honor in 1906 for ''The Red Delight''.  Rochegrosse also illustrated several books. Some of the drawings for these illustrations are in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, London. He lived his final years in Algeria, but returned to Paris where he died and is buried in [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. His wife, Marie Rochegrosse (née Leblond), had died in 1920.

'''''In a Persian Market''''' is a piece of [[Light music|light classical music]] for orchestra with optional chorus by [[Albert Ketèlbey]] who composed it in 1920. Subtitled ''Intermezzo Scene'', it was published by Bosworth in 1921. It evokes exotic images of camel-drivers, jugglers, and snake-charmers. When it was first published in a version for piano, it was advertised as an "educational novelty".

== Theme and music ==
A synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions a [[Camel train|caravan]] arriving, beggars, a princess carried by servants, jugglers, snake-charmers, and a caliph.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; After the princess and the caliph have left, a [[muezzin]] calls to prayer from a minaret. The caravan continues its journey, and the market becomes silent.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; The duration is around six minutes.&lt;ref name="Recording" /&gt;

An opening march shares "exotic" [[Interval (music)|intervals]], A – B-flat – E, with the composer's [[Orientalism#In music|oriental]] intermezzo ''Wonga'', used for the play ''Ye Gods'' in 1916.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt; A chorus of beggars sings: "[[Baksheesh]], baksheesh [[Allah]]"; passers-by sing "Empshi" ("get away").&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; A romantic [[Theme (music)|theme]] portrays the princess, similar to Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]''.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt; Trumpets announce the caliph.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; The concluding section "Call to prayer" of 22 measures was added later.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt;

== Publishing and reception ==
The music was first announced in ''Musical Opinion'' in January 1921 as a piano piece, in a section "Educational novelties”.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCanna" /&gt; Half a year later, Bosworth printed the orchestral version.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt;

''In a Persian Market'' has been regarded as a work of orchestral [[Impressionism in music|impressionism]]. The work has been used as theatre music for comic oriental scenes,&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt; used in sketches by [[Morecambe and Wise]], and by [[The Two Ronnies]],&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; and also in schools as theatrical repertory.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt;

== Selected recordings ==
''In a Persian Market'' was recorded completely, with chorus, in 1999 by the New London Light Opera Chorus and the [[New London Orchestra]], conducted by [[Ronald Corp]].&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; It is part of a 2002 recording of the same name, an anthology of historic recordings of works by Ketèlbey performed by different ensembles and conductors (including the composer) made between 1917 and 1939.&lt;ref name="Recording" /&gt;
Also music was used in "My Lady Heroine" by French singer serge Gainsbourg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3594">The '''Institute of Conservation''' ('''Icon''') is a charity and the professional body for [[Conservator-restorer|conservators and restorers]] in the United Kingdom. It has over three thousand members, including [[Conservator-restorer|professional conservators]] working with heritage objects and [[Architectural conservation|buildings]]. 

==Background==
Icon was formed in 2005 as a result of a merger between five smaller bodies: The United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, The Institute of Paper Conservation, The Scottish Society for Conservation and Restoration, the Photographic Materials Conservation Group and the Care of Collections Forum. These five organisations were known collectively as the 'Vanguard Bodies' of the National Council for Conservation-Restoration (NCCR). In 2006 a sixth organisation, the Institute of Conservation Science, which had not been part of the NCCR, merged into Icon.

Seven other bodies which were also members of the NCCR opted not to merge into Icon in 2005.  These were:
* The British Antique Furniture Restorer's Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafra.org.uk|title=Home - British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association|work=British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The British Association of Paintings Conservator-Restorers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapcr.org.uk|title=BAPCR Home|work=bapcr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two Irish bodies, the Irish Professional Conservators &amp; Restorers Association (IPCRA) and The Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works in Ireland (ICHAWI) - which merged in 2013 into the Institute of Conservators-Restorers in Ireland (ICRI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icriconservation.ie/about-us/background|title=Home - Institute of Conservator-Restorers in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three 'hybrid' bodies, combining conservators and non-conservators in their membership - [[Natural Sciences Collections Association|NatSCA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/|title=Natural Sciences Collections Association|work=natsca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BHI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/|title=British Horological Institute|work=bhi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Archivists]] which merged into the [[Archives and Records Association]] in 2010.

==Activities==
* Icon is a member of the National Heritage Science Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/member-institutions.php|title=National Heritage Science Forum - Home|work=heritagescienceforum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Icon operates a professional  [[accreditation]] scheme for suitably trained and qualified professionals in [[conservation and restoration]] called PACR (Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers.) 
* Icon operates the Conservation register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationregister.com|title=The Conservation Register|work=conservationregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of practices with an accredited employee in the UK or Ireland
* Icon was formerly a member of the [[European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organisations]], but withdrew in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiconservation.org/archive/www.iiconservation.org/news/index153d.html?p=106|title=International Conservation News  » Blog Archive   » Icon withdraws from ECCO|work=iiconservation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Davis''' (born '''Josephine Davis''', June 29, 1912 – May 22, 1961) was an American [[Comedy|comedic]] actress whose career spanned [[vaudeville]], [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]].  Remembered best for the 1950s television comedy ''[[I Married Joan]]'', Davis had a successful earlier career as a [[B-movie]] actress and a leading star of 1940s radio comedy.

Born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], she was the only child of LeRoy Davis and Nina Mae (née Sinks) Davis, who were married in St. Paul on November 23, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Joan was born in St. Paul, Minnesota on  June 29, 1912. Joan’s birth certificate is interesting in that it was altered some 32 years after it was originally filed. It has been stamped with a notation along the bottom edge reading, “Amended by State Registrar pursuant to affidavit filed on _____,” with the date 2-11-44 written by hand. Asterisks indicate three areas of the document that were amended. The birth date, originally recorded as July 4, 1912, was crossed out by hand and changed to June 29. No middle name had been recorded on the original document; “Donna” was subsequently written between the first and last names, with a caret to indicate its placement. The spelling of Joan’s mother’s maiden name was also corrected. The original document was filled out by Rose Labon, who delivered baby Josephine at the family’s residence at 275 Bates Avenue."&lt;br&gt;''Joan Davis: America's Queen of Film, Radio and Television Comedy'' by David C. Tucker (Biography, pg. 3), McFarland (March 24, 2014),ASIN B00JH2B0ZG, {{ISBN|978-0786477845}}/{{ISBN|0786477849}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis had been a performer since childhood. She appeared with her husband Si Wills in vaudeville.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt;

==Career==
===Films===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Davis' first film was a short subject for [[Educational Pictures]] called ''[[Way Up Thar]]'' (1935), featuring a then-unknown [[Roy Rogers]]. Educational's distribution company, [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], signed Davis for feature films. Tall and lanky, with a comically flat speaking voice, she became known as one of the few female physical clowns of her time. Perhaps best known for her co-starring turn with [[Bud Abbott]] and [[Lou Costello]] in ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941), she had a reputation for flawless [[physical comedy]].

Her pantomime sequence in ''[[Beautiful But Broke]]'' (1944) was a slapstick construction-site episode. She also featured in ''[[Tail Spin]]'' (1939) as a supporting actor, for the women's Bendix Air Race circuit. She co-starred with [[Eddie Cantor]] in two features, ''[[Show Business (1944 film)|Show Business]]'' (1944) and ''[[If You Knew Susie (film)|If You Knew Susie]]'' (1948).

===Radio===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Joan Davis entered radio with an August 28, 1941, appearance on ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour|The Rudy Vallee Show]]'' and became a regular on that show four months later.
[[File:Joan davis swan soap 1945.jpg|thumb|200px|Swan Soap ad featuring Davis' radio show, 1945]]

Davis then began a series of shows that established her as a top star of radio situation comedy throughout the 1940s. When Vallee left for the Coast Guard in 1943, Davis and [[Jack Haley]] became the co-hosts of the show. With a title change to ''The [[Sealtest Dairy|Sealtest]] Village Store'', Davis was the owner-operator of the store from July 8, 1943, to June 28, 1945, when she left to do ''Joanie's Tea Room'' on CBS from September 3, 1945, to June 23, 1947.&lt;ref name=Tucker2007/&gt; Sponsored by [[Lever Brothers]] on behalf of [[Swan Soap]], the premise had Davis running a tea shop in the little community of Smallville. The supporting cast featured [[Verna Felton]]. [[Harry von Zell]] was the announcer, and her head writer was [[Abe Burrows]], formerly the head writer (and co-creator) of ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]'' and eventually a legendary Broadway playwright.

The tea shop setting continued in ''Joan Davis Time'', a CBS Saturday-night series from October 11, 1947, to July 3, 1948. With [[Lionel Stander]] as the tea shop manager, the cast also included [[Hans Conried]], [[Mary Jane Croft]], [[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]], the Choraliers quintet, and John Rarig and his Orchestra. ''Leave It to Joan'' ran from July 4 to August 22, 1949, as a summer replacement for ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' and continued from September 9, 1949, to March 3, 1950. She was also heard on CBS July 3 through August 28, 1950. She was a frequent and popular performer on [[Tallulah Bankhead]]'s legendary radio variety show, ''[[The Big Show (radio show)|The Big Show]]'' (1950–52).&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt; Davis was also a regular on Eddie Cantor's ''Time to Smile'' program.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;Terrace, Vincent (1999). ''Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows'', pg. 335. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4513-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Davis was the star of the unsold pilot ''[[Let's Join Joanie]]'', which was recorded in 1950. The proposed series was a television adaptation of ''Leave It to Joan''. When ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' premiered in October 1951 on [[CBS Television]] and became a top-rated TV series, sponsors wanted more of the same with another actress who was not afraid of strenuous physical comedy.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

''[[I Married Joan]]'' premiered in 1952 on [[NBC]], casting Davis as the manic wife of a mild-mannered community judge ([[Jim Backus]]), who got her husband into wacky jams with or without the help of a younger sister, played by her real-life daughter, [[Beverly Wills]]. ''I Married Joan'' did not achieve the ratings success enjoyed by ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', but during its first two years, it received moderately successful ratings, even cracking the top 25 for the 1953–1954 season. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, by the start of its third year, not only were the ratings beginning to slip, but Davis began experiencing heart trouble. As a result, the series was canceled in the spring of 1955.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt; ''I Married Joan'' experienced greater success in off-network [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]; it was one of the earliest series to take advantage of that avenue.

After Davis's death in the spring of 1961, ''I Married Joan'' was pulled from syndication until litigation over her estate---including her residuals from the show's syndicated reruns---could be settled in court (an issue complicated by the deaths of all of her next of kin in 1963), according to the ''Los Angeles Times''.

In 1956, a year after ''I Married Joan'' had ended its primetime run, Davis was approached by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to star in ''The Joan Davis Show''. The premise of this proposed series had Davis playing a musical comedy entertainer who had raised a daughter on her own. Davis used her real name as the lead character. Veteran character actress [[Hope Summers]] was cast as Joan's housekeeper, and Wills was signed to play Joan's daughter, also named Beverly. Ray Ferrell was cast as Joan's grandson Stevie. In the pilot, Joan was introduced to her five-year-old grandson for the first time and was trying to convince Beverly, despite her hectic show-business schedule and her somewhat zany personality, that she was a loving and responsible grandmother. The pilot did not sell as a series for ABC. It was forgotten among Davis' television work until many years later when the [[Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]] in New York discovered the program and added it to its collection.&lt;ref name=Paley/&gt;

==Death==
On May 22, 1961, Davis died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 48 at her home in [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She was interred in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] mausoleum in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref name=Tucker2007/&gt; On October 24, 1963, Davis' mother, daughter Beverly Wills, and two grandchildren were all killed in a house fire in Palm Springs.&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt;

Joan Davis has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], one for her contribution to the motion picture industry at 1501 [[Vine Street]] and one for radio in the 1700 block of Vine.&lt;ref name=Starwalk/&gt;

'''Latin American art''' is the combined artistic expression of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and [[Mexican art|Mexico]], as well as Latin Americans living in other regions.

The art has roots in the many different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] that inhabited the Americas before European colonization in the 16th century. The indigenous cultures each developed sophisticated artistic disciplines, which were highly influenced by religious and spiritual concerns. Their work is collectively known and referred to as [[Pre-columbian art]]. The blending of Native American, African and European cultures has resulted in a unique mestizo tradition.

==Colonial period==
[[File:Warriorangel.jpg|thumb|left|''Archangel Uranus'', anonymous, [[Cuzco School]] 18th century]]
[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Single canvas depiction of the [[casta]] system of racial hierarchy in eighteenth-century Mexico, by Ignacio María Barreda. Most sets of casta paintings were individual canvases showing only one family.]]
During the colonial period, a mixture of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] traditions and European influences (mainly due to the Christian teachings of [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) produced a very particular Christian art known as [[Indochristian art]]. In addition to [[Native American art|indigenous art]], the development of Latin American visual art was significantly influenced by Spanish, [[Portugal|Portuguese]],  and French and Dutch [[Baroque painting]]. In turn Baroque painting was often influenced by the [[Italian masters]].

They were doubtless entranced by the grat adventure, by the opportunity to interpret exotic themes, either on the spot or after sketches made in these foreign parts and  vicariously used after their return a patria "
(Lit.: Some seventeen-century paintings of Brazil," The Connoisseur, October 1970, page. 130) oil on canvas., 119 x 99&amp;nbsp;cm

The [[Cuzco School]] is viewed as the first center of European-style painting in the Americas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish art instructors taught [[Quechua people|Quechua]] artists to paint religious imagery based on classical and [[Renaissance]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museuhistoriconacional.com.br/ingles/mh-e-104.htm The "Cusquenha" Art.] Museu Histórico Nacional. (retrieved 30 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In eighteenth-century [[New Spain]], Mexican artists along with a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as [[casta]] paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a  secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, [[Luis de Mena]], combines castas with Mexico's [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of single canvas paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, ''Casta Painting'', New Haven: Yale University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century, The Netherlands had captured the rich sugar-producing area of the Portuguese colony of Brazil (1630–1654). During that period, Dutch artist [[Albert Eckhout]] painted a number of important depictions of social types in Brazil. These depictions included images of indigenous men and women, as well as still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ades, "Nature, Science, and the Picturesque" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820–1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific expeditions approved by the Spanish crown began exploring Spanish America where its flora and fauna were recorded. Spaniard [[José Celestino Mutis]], a medical doctor and horticulturalist and follower of Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]], led an expedition starting in 1784 to northern South America, the expedition is known as the ''Expedición Botánica de Nueva Granada''. Local artists were Ecuadorean Indians, who  produced five thousand color drawings of nature, all being published. The crown chartered expedition whose purpose was scientific recording of the natural beauty and wealth of Nature, was a departure from the long traditional religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Catlin, "Traveller-Reporter Artists and the Empirical tradition in Post Independence Latin American Art" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, pp. 43-45, color plate 3.2 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important scientific expedition was that of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and French botantist [[Aimé Bonpland]]. They traveled for five years throughout Spanish America (1799-1804), exploring and recording scientific information as well as the attire and lifestyles local populations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland, Première Partie; Relation Historique: Atlas Pittoresque: 'Vues de Cordillères et monuments de peuples indigènes de l'Amérique', Paris 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humboldt's work became an inspiration and template for continuing scientific work in the nineteenth century, as well as traveller reporters who recorded the scenes of everyday life.

===Historiography of colonial art and architecture===
The history of Latin American art has generally been written by those with training in art history departments. However, the concept of "visual culture" has now brought scholars trained in other disciplines to write the histories of art. As with the history of indigenous peoples, for many years there was a focus on either the pre-Columbian period (Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca) art production, then a leap to the twentieth century. More recently, the colonial era and the nineteenth century have developed as fields of focus. Visual culture as a field increasingly crosses disciplinary boundaries. Colonial architecture has been the subject of a number of important studies.&lt;ref&gt;George Kubler, ''Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century''. 2 vols. New Haven: Yale University Press 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McAndrew, ''The Open-Air Churches of Sixteenth-Century Mexico: Atrios, Posas, Open Chapels, and Other Studies''.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wethey, ''Colonial Architecture and Sculpture in Peru''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial art has a long tradition, especially in Mexico, with there being publications of Manuel Toussaint.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Toussaint, ''Arte colonial en México''.  Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, 1948. 5th edition 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on colonial art, with some useful overviews being published in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Bayon and Murrillo Marx, ''History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture''. New York: Rizzoli 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Burke, ''Treasures of Mexican Colonial Painting''.

==Modernism==
[[File:Cristobal Rojas 01.JPG|thumb|''La Muerte de Girardot en Bárbula'', by Venezuelan painter [[Cristóbal Rojas (artist)|Cristóbal Rojas]], oil, 1883]]
[[Modernism]], a Western art movement typified by the rejection of traditional classical styles. This movement holds an ambivalent position in Latin American art. Not all countries developed modernized urban centers at the same time, so Modernism's appearance in Latin America is difficult to date. While Modernism was welcomed by some, others rejected it. Generally speaking, the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] were more open to foreign influence, while countries with a stronger indigenous presence such as Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were resistant to European culture.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. Latin American Art of the 20th Century. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark event for Modernism in the region was, the ''Semana de Arte Moderna'' or [[Modern Art Week]], a festival that took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1922, marking the beginning of Brazil's Modernismo movement. "[T]hough a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the Week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large."

==Constructivist movement==
[[File:Discovery of the Land1.jpg|left|thumb|Brazilian artist [[Candido Portinari]],Study for ''Discovery of the Land'' mural at the [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]
In general, the artistic [[Eurocentrism]] associated with the colonial period began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge their unique identity and started to follow their own path.

From the early twentieth century onward, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It quickly spread from Russia to Europe, and then into Latin America. [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement from Europe, to Latin America.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

After a long and successful career in Europe and the United States, Joaquín Torres-García, returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, where he heavily promoted Constructivism. Attracting a circle of experienced peers and young artists as followers in Montevideo, in 1935 he founded the Asociación de Arte Constructivo as an art center and exhibition space for his circle. The venue was closed in 1940 due to a lack of funding. In 1943, he opened the Taller Torres-García, a workshop and training center that operated until 1962.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"&gt;Barnitz, Jacqueline. ''Twentieth Century Art of Latin America''. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muralism==
{{See also|Mexican muralism}}
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|[[José Clemente Orozco]], Mural ''Omniciencia'', 1925]]Muralism or Muralismo is an important artistic movement generated in Latin America. It is popularly represented by the [[Mexican muralism]] movement of [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. In [[Art of Chile|Chile]], [[José Venturelli]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] were influential muralists. [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] championed muralism in [[Colombia]], as did Gabriel Bracho in Venezuela. In the Dominican Republic, Spanish exile [[José Vela Zanetti]] was a prolific muralist, painting over 100 murals in the country. The Ecuadorian artist [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] (a student of Orozco), the Brazilian [[Candido Portinari]], and Bolivian [[Miguel Alandia Pantoja]] are also noteworthy. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Mexican Muralism "enjoyed a type of prestige and influence in other countries that no other American art movement had ever experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Edward. ''Latin American Art.'' London: Phaidon Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-3980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Muralism, artists in Latin America found a distinctive art form that provided for political and cultural expression, often focusing on issues of social justice related to their indigenous roots.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==''Generación de la Ruptura''==
''[[Generación de la Ruptura]],'' or "Rupture Generation," (sometimes simply known as "Ruptura") is the name given to an art movement in Mexico in 1960s in which younger artists broke away from the established national style of Muralismo. Born out of the desire of younger artists for greater freedom of style in art, this movement is marked by expressionistic and figurative styles. Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas is credited with initiating the ''Ruptura''. In 1958, Cuevas published a paper called ''La Cortina del Nopal'' ("The Cactus Curtain"), which condemned Mexican muralism as overly political, calling it "cheap journalism and harangue" rather than art.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Representative artists include [[José Luis Cuevas]], Alberto Gironella, and Rafael Coronel.
                                                                                            [[File:A.Reveron.png|thumb|A.Reveron]]
===Nueva Presencia===
''Nueva Presencia'' ("new presence") was an artist group founded by artists Arnold Belkin and Fancisco Icaza in the early 1960s. In response to WWII atrocities such as the [[Holocaust]] and the atomic bomb, the artists of Nueva Presencia shared an anti-aesthetic rejection of contemporary trends in art and believed that the artist had a social responsibility. Their beliefs were outlined in the Nueva Presencia manifesto, which was published in the first issue of the poster review of the same name. "No one, especially the artist, has the right to be indifferent to the social order."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; Members of the group included Francisco
Corzas (b. 1936), Emilio Ortiz (b. 1936), Leonel Góngora (b.1933), Artemio Sepúlveda (b. 1936), and José Muñoz, Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio "Nacho" López.

===Otra Figuración===
&lt;!-- [[Otra Figuración]] redirects to this heading. --&gt;
''Otra Figuración'' (Other Figuration) was an Argentine artist group and commune formed in 1961, and disbanded in 1966. Members [[Rómulo Macció]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], and [[Luis Felipe Noé]] lived together and shared a studio in Buenos Aires. Artists of Otra Figuración worked in an expressionistic abstract figurative style featuring vivid colors and collage. Although Otra Figuración were contemporaries of Nueva Presencia, there was no direct contact between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; People who are sometimes associated with the group are [[Raquel Forner]], [[Antonio Berni]], Alberto Heredia, and [[Antonio Seguí]].

==Surrealism==
The French poet and founder of Surrealism, [[André Breton]], after visiting Mexico in 1938, proclaimed it to be "the surrealist country par excellence."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; [[Surrealism]], an artistic movement originating in post-World War I Europe, strongly impacted the art of Latin America. This is where the mestizo culture, the legacy of European conquer over indigenous peoples, embodies contradiction, a central value of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"&gt;Baddeley, Oriana &amp; Fraser, Valerie. Drawing the Line: Art and Cultural Identity in Contemporary Latin America. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely known Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] painted self-portraits and depictions of traditional Mexican culture in a style that combines [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Although, Kahlo did not commend this label, once saying, "They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/9000295/Frida-Kahlo-Surrealist-Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings, and the second-highest for any female artist.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Tai. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/Frieda-9545.html Saint Frida.] ''MetroActive: Books.'' 9 Nov 2005 (retrieved 18 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other female Mexican Surrealists include [[Leonora Carrington]] (a British woman who relocated to Mexico) and [[Remedios Varo]] (a Spanish exile). Mexican artist [[Alberto Gironella]], Chilean artists [[Roberto Matta]], [[Mario Carreño Morales]], and [[Nemesio Antúnez]], Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]], and Argentinean artist [[Roberto Aizenberg]] have also been classified as Surrealists.

European classical art styles have made a long-lasting impression on the art of Latin America. Into the twentieth century, many Latin American artists continued to be schooled in the traditional 19th-century style, resulting in a continued emphasis on figurative work. Due to the far reach of figuration, the work often spans upon a number of different styles such as [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Pop art]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Surrealism]], only naming a few. While these artists confront issues that range from the personal to the political, many have a shared interest in indigenous issues and the heritage of European cultural imperialism.

===Parody and sociopolitical critique===

Art in Latin America has often been used as a means of social and political critique. Mexican graphic artist [[José Guadalupe Posada]] drew harsh images of Mexican elites as skeletons, [[calavera]]s. This was done prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]], strongly influencing later artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]].

A common practice among Latin American figurative artists is to parody Old Master paintings, especially those of the Spanish court produced by [[Diego Velázquez]] in the 17th century. These parodies serve a dual purpose, referring to the artistic and cultural history of Latin America, and critiquing the legacy of European cultural imperialism in Latin American nations. Two notable artists who frequently employed this technique are [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Alberto Gironella]].

Colombian figurative artist [[Fernando Botero]], whose work features unique "puffy" figures in various situations addressing themes of power, war, and social issues, has used this technique to draw parallels between current governing bodies and the Spanish monarchy. His 1967 painting ''The Presidential Family'', is an early example. The painting, echoing [[Diego Velázquez]]'s 1656 Spanish court painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (The Maids of Honor), contains a self-portrait of Botero standing behind a large canvas. The thick, "puffy" presidential family, decked out in fashionable finery and staring blandly out of the canvas, appear socially superior, drawing attention to social inequality.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"/&gt; According to Botero, his "puffy" figures are not meant to be satirical. He painted a powerful series of canvases, which are based on photos of torture by the U.S. military of Iraqi prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.
&lt;!-- [[File:Abughraib.jpg|thumb|Fernando Botero, ''Abu Ghraib,'' 2005, oil on canvas. Botero painted the abuses of [[Abu Ghraib]] between 2004 and 2005 as a permanent accusation]] --&gt;.
: ''The deformation you see is the result of my involvement with painting. The monumental and, in my eyes, sensually provocative volumes stem from this. Whether they appear fat or not does not interest me. It has hardly any meaning for my painting. My concern is with formal fullness, abundance. And that is something entirely different.''&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Mexican painter and collagist [[Alberto Gironella]], whose style mixes elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[Pop art]], also produced parodies of official Spanish court paintings. He completed dozens of versions of Velásquez's ''Queen Mariana'' from 1652. Gironella's parodies critique the Spanish rule of Mexico by incorporating subversive imagery. ‘’La Reina de los Yugos’’ or "The Queen of Yokes" (1975–81) depicts Mariana with a skirt made of upside-down ox yokes, signifying both Spanish dominance over Mexico's indigenous peoples, and those people's subversion of Spanish rule. The yokes are rendered useless by being upturned. "[Gironella's] hallmark was the use of particular Spanish Grocery cans (sardines, mussels, etc.) in his works, and soda bottle caps nailed or glued around the rim of his paintings."

==Photography==

Photographers captured on film, indigenous peoples as well as distinct social types, such as the [[gaucho]]s of Argentina. A number of Latin Americans have made significant contributions to modern photography. [[Guillermo Kahlo]] photographed Mexican colonial buildings and infrastructure, such as the railway bridge at Metlac. [[Agustín Casasola]] himself took many images of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and compiled an extensive archive of Mexican photos. Other photographers include indigenous Peruvian [[Martín Chambi]], Mexican [[Graciela Iturbide]], and Cuban [[Alberto Korda]], famous for his iconic image of [[Che Guevara]]. [[Mario Testino]] is a noted fashion photographer. In addition, a number of non-Latin American photographers have focused on the area, including [[Tina Modotti]] and [[Edward Weston]] in Mexico. Guatemalan national [[María Cristina Orive]] has worked in Argentina with [[Sara Facio]]. Ecuadoran [[Hugo Cifuentes]] has garnered attention.

[[File:LettersToMalcolm.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Geoffrey Bles]])]]

'''''Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer''''' is a book by [[C.S. Lewis]] posthumously published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis. ''Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer'', Harvest Books, 1973  {{ISBN|0-15-650880-X}} {{ISBN|0-15-650880-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; The book takes the form of a series of letters to a fictional friend, "Malcolm", in which Lewis meditates on prayer as an intimate dialogue between man and God. Beginning with a discussion of "corporate prayer" and the liturgical service, Lewis goes on to consider practical and metaphysical aspects of private prayer, such as when to pray and where, ready-made prayer, petitionary prayer, prayer as worship, penitential prayer, and prayer for the dead. The concluding letter discusses "liberal" Christians, the soul and resurrection.

''Letters to Malcolm'' is generally thought to be one of Lewis's less successful books and differs from his other books on Christianity in that it poses a number of questions which Lewis does not attempt to answer.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jacobs, ''The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C.S.Lewis'', HarperSanFancisco {{ISBN|978-0-06-087269-4}} {{ISBN|0-06-087269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis moreover shows a reluctance to be as critical of radical theologians such as [[Alec Vidler]] and [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]] as his imaginary friend Malcolm wants him to be.

'''Lucy Lippard''' (born April 14, 1937) is an American writer, [[art critic]], [[activist]] and [[curator]]. Lippard was among the first writers to recognize the "[[Dematerialisation (art)|dematerialization]]" at work in [[conceptual art]] and was an early champion of [[feminist art]].  She is the author of 21 books on [[contemporary art]] and has received numerous awards and accolades from literary critics and art associations.

== Early life and education ==
Lucy Lippard was born in New York City and lived in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], before enrolling at [[Abbot Academy]] in 1952. She attended [[Smith College]] and earned a B.A. in 1958. In 1962, she earned an M.A. degree in art history from the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="OTIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/press-release/pioneering-author-activist-critic-curator-lucy-lippard-to-receive-honorary-degree|title=Pioneering Author, Activist, Critic, and Curator Lucy Lippard to Receive Honorary Degree|website=OTIS College of Art and Design|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just out of college, Lippard began working in the library at the Museum of Modern Art in 1958 where, in addition to reshelving the library after a fire, she was "farmed out" to do research for curators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Curating|last=Obrist|first=Hans Ulrich|publisher=JRP Ringier|year=2008|isbn=9783905829556|location=Zurich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She credits these years of working at MoMA paging, filing and researching as preparing her "well for the archival, informational aspect of conceptual art."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At MoMA she worked with curators such as Bill Lieberman, Bill Seitz and Peter Selz.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1966, she had curated two traveling exhibitions for MoMA, one on "soft sculpture" and one on Max Ernst, as well as worked with Kynaston McShine on ''Primary Structures'' before he was hired by the Jewish Museum, taking the show with him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was at MoMA that Lippard met Sol LeWitt who was working the night desk; John Button, Dan Flavin, Al Held, and Robert Ryman all held positions at the museum during this time as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Since 1966, Lippard has published 20 books—including one novel—on feminism, art, politics and place.&lt;ref name="OTIS" /&gt; She has received numerous awards and accolades from literary critics and art associations.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} A 2012 exhibition on her seminal book, ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object'' at the Brooklyn Museum, titled ''"Six Years": Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art"'', cites Lippard's scholarship as its point of entry into a discussion about conceptual art during its era of emergence, demonstrating her crucial role in the contemporary understanding of this period of art production and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/six_years/ "Six Years": Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art"]''&lt;/ref&gt; Her research on the move toward [[Dematerialization (art)|Dematerialization]] in art making has formed a cornerstone of contemporary art scholarship and discourse.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Lucy Lippard was a member of the populist political artist group known as the [[Art Workers' Coalition|Art Workers Coalition]], or AWC. Her involvement in the AWC as well as a trip she took to Argentina—such trips bolstered the political motivations of many feminists of the time—influenced a change in the focus of her criticism, from formalist subjects to more feministic ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Art Workers : Radical Practice in the Vietnam War Era |last=Bryan-Wilson |first=Julia |publisher=University of California Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder of [[Printed Matter, Inc]] (an art bookstore in New York City centered on [[artist's books]]), the [[Heresies Collective]], [[Political Art Documentation/Distribution (PAD/D)]], Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America, and other artists' organizations, she has also curated over 50 exhibitions, done performances, comics, [[guerrilla theater]], and edited several independent publications the latest of which is the decidedly local ''La Puente de Galisteo'' in her home community in [[Galisteo, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/lucy-r-lippard-papers-7895/more Finding Aid to the Lucy R. Lippard Papers, 1940s-2006], Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved 4 Nov 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She has infused [[aesthetics]] with politics, and disdained disinterestedness for ethical activism.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Selected honors and awards ===
Lippard holds nine honorary doctorates of fine arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewpress.com/authors/lucy-r-lippard|title=Lucy R. Lippard {{!}} The New Press|work=The New Press|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which some are listed below.

'''Hammerstein's Roof Garden''' (1899 – 1915) was the official name the semi-outdoor [[vaudeville]] venue that theatre magnate, [[Oscar Hammerstein I]], built atop the [[Victoria Theater (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theatre]] and the neighboring [[Theatre Republic]], commonly known then as the Belasco Theatre. Unlike Hammerstein’s first roof garden theatre, which crowned his failed [[Olympia Theatre (New York City)|Olympia Theatre]], the '''Paradise Roof Garden''' was able to rise to prominence and contend with its rivals for the better parts of two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogstraten, Nicholas. Lost Broadway Theatres. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1997, 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[New York City]] theatre-goers, the name ''Hammerstein’s'' grew to encompass both the Victoria and its roof garden.&lt;ref&gt;“Rialto Theatre to Close Tonight,” New York Times, 15 May 1935, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1904 to 1914 it was run by [[Willie Hammerstein]], who put on highly popular vaudeville acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu3nNSmRjZ0C&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=2014-05-18 |year=2012|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The construction of the Victoria suffered from an anemic budget, and as a result, its roof garden developed incrementally. It opened in 1899 as the Venetian Terrace Roof Garden and featured a “‘grand promenade’ in the style of [[Monte Carlo]].”&lt;ref&gt;“The Roof Garden Season,” New York Times, 25 June 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle of its three tiers consisted of boxes; the third, an open-air café. In compliance with the city’s building code, Hammerstein added eight exits and two elevators to his “solid steel and concrete construction” before summer season of 1902 commenced.&lt;ref&gt;“For Playgoing People,” New York Times, 25 May 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained permission to install a roof that could open or close to accommodate the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the theatre rested over the Victoria, leaving the roof of the Belasco free for novelty features, including a pond, a Dutch-style dairy farm, and a windmill. The “Mute Revue” consisted of garden displays that paid tribute to the theatrical hits of the closing season.&lt;ref&gt;“Hammerstein’s Roof Opens,” New York Times, 4 June 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just in time for the opening of the summer season of 1907, the entire venue was upgraded: the house was repainted in white and blue with splashes of red, and the boxes were remodeled and decked with geraniums.

==Variety and vaudeville==
In addition to entertainment, the open-air Paradise Roof Garden offered patrons escape from the city’s oppressive summer heat.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477.&lt;/ref&gt; The table-and-chair seating configuration encouraged conversation in a house that was vulnerable to sunlight and outside noise; simple, wordless variety entertainment was well suited to such conditions. Some of the “dumb acts” that played on the roof included Barnold’s Dog and Monkey Pantomime Company,&lt;ref&gt;“Hammerstein’s Roof Opens,” New York Times, 4 June 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; and wire-walker [[Bird Millman]];&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Stephen Burge. The Roof Gardens of Broadway Theaters, 1883-1942. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press, 1985, 89, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, [[William Glackens]]’s painting, titled simply ''Hammerstein’s Roof Garden'', depicts such an act.&lt;ref&gt;Glackens, William J., Hammerstein’s Roof Garden. Oil on Canvas, circa 1901. Whitney Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
As advancements in air-conditioning were rendering New York’s roof garden theatres obsolete, silent movies were luring patrons out of vaudeville theatres. With the selling of the Victoria in 1915, the roof garden closed as well.&lt;ref&gt;“Oscar in Three Reels,” New York Times, 5 April 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering''''' is an undergraduate philosophy textbook, originally published in 1973, authored by James L. Christian. It takes a unique synoptic approach: the author believes that philosophy is critical thinking about the "Big Picture". The goal of the book is not merely to introduce the history of formal thinking in western culture, but also to provide students with practical approaches and tools for dealing with some of the enduring questions as they manifest in everyday life. Thus the book focuses on this "big picture" and the interdisciplinary origins of philosophical thinking. He thus addresses the concerns that most people "wonder" about:  Does life have meaning? Does God exist? How do you know right from wrong? and so on. The presentation is interwoven with cartoons, quotations, and related findings from the social and physical sciences that ensure central philosophical concepts are accessible. New learning objectives in this edition further strengthen the book's reader-friendly approach. An eclectic range of topics reinforces the author's presentation of philosophy as the individual's attempt to unify disparate world views, with interspersed biographies that provide glimpses into the lives of great thinkers who have molded the Western philosophical tradition and largely influenced how society thinks today.

It has many editions published from 1973-2008.

'''''Portrait of a German Officer''''' is an early 20th century [[portrait]] by American modernist painter [[Marsden Hartley]]. Done in oil on canvas, the portrait depicts the abstract figure of an [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German officer]] as being composed entirely of [[Military awards and decorations|military decorations]] and badges of rank. The painting is currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== Description ==

=== Background ===
''Portrait of a German Officer'' was painted by American painter Marsden Hartley in late 1914 while he was living in the German imperial capital of [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Hartley was greatly effected by the pageantry and discipline of the German army, with this interest eventually manifesting itself in some of his works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/hartley-officer/|title=Marsden Hartley, Portrait of a German Officer - Smarthistory|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hartley-marsden-artworks.htm|title=Marsden Hartley Most Important Art {{!}} TheArtStory|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portrait of a German Officer'' was intended to honor Karl von Freyburg, a German [[lieutenant]] who had died during the first few months of the [[World War I|First World War]]. It has been posited that Hartley's correspondence with Freyburg indicates that the former was romantically interested in the German officer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/488486|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Painting ===
Hartley's painting is highly sequential, symbolic, and heavily influenced by [[cubism]] and the school of [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]]. The black, white, and red flag of the German Empire is placed in a prominent position in the bottom central portion of the image, while the [[Iron Cross]] (a decoration which Freyburg was awarded) is prominently featured in the top-center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The blue and white checkered flag of Freyburg's home state of [[Bavaria]] is also shown, as is an officer's white-striped [[Epaulette|epaulet]]. Hartly also included more personal details in the portrait; the number ''24'' represents Freyburg's age when he died, Freyburg's initials (K.v.F) are seen in gold-on-red, Freyburg's regimental number (4) can be seen in center of the portrait, and a [[spur]] (representing Freyburg's service as a cavalry officer) can be seen in the bottom right of the image. Hartfield also represented Germany's enemies during the war through his inclusion of the [[Saint George's Cross|English Cross of St. George]] and the [[Belgian tricolour|Belgian Tricolor]], both seen at the bottom of the portrait.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''"Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung"''' was a 1971 essay by [[Lester Bangs]], later collected in a [[Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock 'n' Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock 'n' Roll|book of the same name]] ({{ISBN|0-679-72045-6}}). The essay, which talks about what is today called [[garage rock]], contains the phrase, "...punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the [[Yardbirds]]' sound." This is believed to be one of the first uses of the word "[[punk rock|punk]]" to refer to a type of [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] (ed. [[Greil Marcus]]) (1987, 2003). ''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung.'' Anchor Books (a division of Random House). New York.  {{ISBN|0-679-72045-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large section of the essay is concerned with the imagined longer career of the garage band the [[Count Five]], after their hit "[[Psychotic Reaction]]".  The band split after one album, but Bangs' discussion of the imagined subsequent records is entirely fanciful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] (ed. [[Greil Marcus]]) (1987, 2003).

==Plot==
Martha Farnsworth runs a [[single-sex education|girls school]] in [[Virginia]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. By 1864, almost all of the students, teachers, and slaves have left; only five students and one teacher, Edwina Morrow, remain. While out in the woods searching for mushrooms, Amy, a pupil, comes across John McBurney, a corporal in the [[Union Army]] who was wounded in the leg during battle, and has since [[Desertion|deserted]]. Amy brings McBurney to the school where he falls unconscious. The women lock McBurney in one of the rooms while Miss Farnsworth tends to his wounds. All the women and girls in the school are immediately fascinated by the handsome man.

Initially, some of the school's residents want McBurney to be delivered as a [[prisoner of war]] to the [[Confederate Army]], but Miss Farnsworth decides that they will let his leg heal before they decide what they will do with him. When Confederate soldiers arrive at the school, Miss Farnsworth does not tell them that a Union soldier is on the premises. While McBurney is recovering, the women and girls fight for his affection by giving him presents, wearing jewelery, and preparing a lavish dinner for him. He returns the affection, concentrating especially on Miss Morrow and Miss Farnsworth. When he is able to move again, he begins to help in the garden. It becomes clear that he fears returning to battle.

When Miss Farnsworth indicates that McBurney is healthy enough and will have to leave the school in a few days, he tries to convince her to let him stay as a gardener, and tells Miss Morrow that he has fallen in love with her. One night, he tells Miss Morrow to await him in her room. When he does not appear and she hears strange noises, she investigates and finds him in bed with Alicia, a teenage pupil. McBurney tries to calm Miss Morrow down, but she pushes him away, causing him to fall down the stairs and badly break his already injured leg. Miss Farnsworth decides that the only way to stop him from dying is to amputate the leg.

When he awakes the next day and realizes he has lost his leg, McBurney is devastated and furious, accusing the women (and especially Miss Farnsworth) of having punished him for not choosing their rooms instead of Alicia's. He is locked up in his room but threatens Alicia, who gets him the room key. He then breaks out, steals a gun, and threatens the women before storming off. Miss Morrow follows him to his room, where they have passionate sex.

Meanwhile Miss Farnsworth tries to find a solution. One of the students suggests killing McBurney by preparing him a dinner of [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]], to which Miss Farnsworth agrees. During the dinner, Miss Morrow, who is not informed of the plan, is deterred by the others at the last minute from putting the mushrooms on her own plate. McBurney's suspicions are not aroused; he eats the mushrooms. Seconds later, he falls to the floor, in the throes of death. While the others are sewing McBurney's body into a [[shroud]], Miss Morrow looks on, devastated. The film ends with the women dragging McBurney's body to the road so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by.

Coppola had initially expressed an aversion to a remake, but after watching the 1971 version at the urging of production designer Anne Rose, she was left contemplating ways she could update the film.&lt;ref name="EWTacky"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sollosi|first1=Mary|title=The Beguiled: Sofia Coppola on how she made the remake her own|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/16/the-beguiled-sofia-coppola-la-film-festival/|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, she became interested in showing the story from the women's point of view, as opposed to the man's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Kristen|title=In Conversation with Sofia Coppola|date=May 19, 2017|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/interview-director-sofia-coppola-beguiled/|website=Film School Rejects|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material came to Coppola at a time when she wanted to make a more optimistic film than 2013's ''[[The Bling Ring]]'', stating that she wanted to "cleanse myself" from what she terms was "such a tacky, ugly world".&lt;ref name="EWTacky"/&gt;

==Allegations of whitewashing==
The 1966 novel had a black female slave as a supporting character, whom director Sofia Coppola removed from the film, and for a biracial character from the novel, she cast white actress [[Kirsten Dunst]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' said Coppola was criticized for engaging in [[whitewashing in film|whitewashing]], to which the director said she made the changes so as "not [to] brush over such an important topic in a light way," and that "[y]oung girls watch my films and this was not the depiction of an African American character I would want to show them."&lt;ref&gt;Whitewashing citations:

'''The Falcon''' is a [[public house]] in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England. It stands on the west side of Lower Bridge Street at its junction with Grosvenor Road.  The Falcon is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376292|desc= Falcon Inn, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building formerly incorporated part of [[Chester Rows]], but it was the first building to have its portion of the row enclosed in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

==History==

The building originated as a house in about 1200 and was later extended to the south along Lower Bridge Street, with a great hall running parallel to the street.  During the 13th&amp;nbsp;century it was rebuilt to incorporate its portion of the row.  It was rebuilt again during the late 16th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The house was bought in 1602 by [[Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grosvenor]] who extensively altered it some 40 years later to make it his [[Townhouse|town house]].  During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he moved his family here from his country home, [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]].  In 1643 Sir Richard petitioned the City Assembly for leave to enlarge his house by enclosing the portion of the row which passed through his property. This was successful and it set a precedent for other residents of Lower Bridge Street to enclose their portion of the rows, or to build new structures which did not incorporate the rows.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=19 | title = The Falcon | accessdate = 17 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century the building ceased to be the town house of the Grosvenor family.  It continued to be owned by them, and between 1778 and 1878 it was licensed as ''The Falcon Inn''.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In about 1879 alterations were made by [[John Douglas (architect)|John Douglas]]. At this time it was known as ''The Falcon Cocoa House''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard | title =The Work of John Douglas |edition= | publisher =[[The Victorian Society]] | year =1991 | location =London | page = 250| isbn =0-901657-16-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was re-opened as a [[Temperance movement|temperance house]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In 1886 [[George Enoch Grayson|Grayson]] and [[Edward Ould|Ould]] carried out a restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| page = 262| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1970s the building had become virtually derelict.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morriss| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton| pages = | page = 23| id = | isbn = 0-7509-0255-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the Falcon Trust was established, and the building was donated to the trust by the [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor Estate]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  Between 1979 and 1982 the building was restored and in 1983 it won a [[Europa Nostra]] award.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;  The building was donated to the Falcon Trust by the [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor Estate]], and was reopened by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = 64–65| page = | format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east face of The Falcon is on Lower Bridge Street and the north face on Grosvenor Road.  The east face has two storeys on a [[sandstone]] plinth with two [[gable]]s.  Most of the sandstone is [[Stucco|rendered]].  To the left is a staircase of nine steps leading from the street to the lower storey, which is the level of the enclosed row.  The lower storey has [[Close studding|close timber studding]] and an eleven-light leaded window.  Above this is a row of twelve [[quatrefoil]] panels which slope slightly outwards over which is a continuous 34-light leaded window.  The two gables are carried on brackets which curve outwards, and have herringbone [[strut]]s, [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[bargeboard]]s and shaped [[finial]]s.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The north face give the appearance of two buildings.  The older part is to the left (east) and the newer right (west) part was possibly added by Sir Richard Grosvenor in 1626.  The eastern portion is a continuation of the east front.  The street level and the lower storey are in sandstone, partly rendered, some of which has been replaced by brick.  The upper storey has a window of six lights, which are continuous with those on the east face and two quatrefoils above.  To the right of these is timber framing and a window.  Above is a grey slate roof and a lateral shaped chimney in brick.  The western portion has a rendered [[plinth]] with timber framing above.  On the lower storey is a door and two windows, one with seven lights and the other with four.  The upper storey has similar windows, plus a one-light window over the door.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The medieval undercroft is used as the beer cellar.  It was originally a single three-bay chamber but has been divided by a [[Brick|brick wall]] into a two-bay north chamber and a single-bay south chamber.  In the cellar are two octagonal stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and a massive central east-west oak beam.  On the level of the row is a room along the east side, which is the enclosed portion of the row, and two rooms behind, with a further room in the west wing.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''The Source''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La Source'''}}) is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painter [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]].

==Description==
The painting depicts a [[Depictions of nudity|nude]] standing upright between an opening in the rocks and holding in her hands a [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]], from which water flows.

==Theme==
[[Art historians]] Frances Fowle and Richard Thomson suggest that there is a "symbolic unity of woman and nature" in ''The Source'', where the flowering plants and water serve as a background which Ingres fills with woman's "secondary attributes".&lt;ref name="FowleThomson2003"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fowle, Francis |author2=Thomson, Richard |title=Soil and stone: impressionism, urbanism, environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udT3p5pusY8C&amp;pg=PA23 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7546-3685-4 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state assumed title to the painting in 1878 and it passed to the [[Musée du Louvre]].

The model for the painting was the young daughter of Ingres' [[concierge]].&lt;ref name="Macfall2004"/&gt; In his ''[[Confessions of a Young Man]]'', Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] wrote, with relation to the [[Art and morality|morality of artistic production]], "What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maid was the price for Ingres' ''La Source''? That the model died of drink and disease in the hospital is nothing when compared with the essential that I should have ''La Source'', that exquisite dream of innocence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/430264 |title=The Morality of Artistic Production |author=Barrett, Cyril |journal=[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=1982 |volume=41 |number=2 |pages=137–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution''''' is a treatise by [[Austrian School|Austrian school]] economist and philosopher [[Ludwig von Mises]]. It can be thought of as a continuation in the development of the Misesian system of social science. In particular, it provides further [[epistemology|epistemological]] support for his earlier works, esp. [[Human Action]]. Most notably, Mises elaborates on [[methodological dualism]], develops the concept of [[thymology]] – a historical branch of the sciences of human action – and presents his critique of Marxist [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]].

Furthermore, Mises puts forward a theory of knowledge and value. He later explores and critically analyzes paradigms of thought like [[determinism]], [[materialism]], [[dialectic materialism]], [[historicism]], [[scientism]], [[positivism]], [[behaviorism]] and [[psychology]]. He argues that these schools of thought – some politically motivated,&lt;ref&gt;Mises. (1957). ''Theory and history'', pp. 26, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; others blinded by dogmatism&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 30, 77, 111, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; – have committed epistemological and methodological blunders and are not conducive to a scientific understanding of human behavior.

Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] considered ''Theory and History'' to be Mises's most overlooked work.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. xi-xix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Mises presents the book in four parts.

'''Introduction and Part One – Value:'''

The first part sets the overall theme of the book with Mises introducing the concept of [[methodological dualism]]. He then expounds a theory of value that is central throughout. Regarding his view on science – as systematic body of knowledge, of both natural and social phenomena – as a means to successful action in the world, Mises argues that in order to properly understand human behavior we must attribute – as a methodological resort – [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[Teleology|purpose]] to human behaviour. Mises considers this the epistemological and methodological basis of the sciences of human action. The branch that deals with the logical implications of action as such is called [[praxeology]].

'''Part Two – Determinism and Materialism:'''

In the second part, Mises weighs in on the [[free will]] vs. [[determinism]] controversy and comments that the long historical debates did little to settle the problems at hand. He argues that while the natural sciences, in discovering scientific laws, must presuppose a strict regularity in the occurrence of causes and effects, i.e. determinism, such a presupposition cannot be held in the case of human action. He argues further that the social sciences must take [[thought]]s, [[idea]]s, and [[value judgment|judgments of value]] as ultimately given in the analysis of human action. Our ignorance of the origins and causes of these phenomena, Mises argues, forces us – at least for the time being – to adopt a dualistic approach. He contends that attempts to find the origins and causes of these phenomena are vain, as is the task of all varieties of materialism.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Mises then turns his attention to the doctrine of materialism, more specifically, that of Marxist dialectical materialism.

'''Part Three – Epistemological Problems of History:'''

The third part deals with the logical and epistemological problems of historical analysis. Mises explains the individualistic character of historical human events. He argues that the historian must ultimately face – when tracing back the causal factors behind past human action – a point at which no further reduction is possible, i.e. the ideas and actions of individuals. This, he claims, is the "ultimate given of history".&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 183–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the individuality of historical events, Mises still insists there are general laws of human behaviour but that they are praxeological laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], not historical laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]. However, [[historicism]], according to Mises, claimed there were no general laws – especially economic laws – of human behavior. Mises then enters into a critique of historicism.

Mises also addresses the challenges of scientism in the context of social science, namely the application of positivism and behaviorism in the realm of human action. However, more noteworthy is Mises's presentation of [[thymology]], a historical branch of the sciences of human action. Mises argues that thymology is what everybody resorts to when trying to [[Verstehen|''understand'']] and anticipate the historical and future actions of their fellow men, and is particularly useful to the historian. He then expounds the scope of thymology and its relation to praxeology.

'''Part Four – The Course of History:'''

In the final part of his treatise, Mises dissects and critiques various speculations and interpretations of history, including a common interpretation of modern [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He also comments on his observation regarding society's move away from [[classical liberalism]], freedom, and capitalism towards socialism and totalitarianism. Moreover, Mises notes the rising ideology of wealth and income equality and speculates on its origins. He argues that rising anti-capitalistic ideology is fostering a present trend toward the impoverishment of society. He criticizes the notion of society's inevitable "trend toward progress",&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 367-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that the evolution of society and civilization is predicated – not on an automatic and inevitable path – but on the underlying ideology which can, at any time, change. To this point, Mises closes with some remarks on the uncertainty of the future and the neglect of ideological factors that can give rise to civilization but also stamp it out.

'''''Uz Maršala Tita''''' ({{lang-sh|Uz Maršala Tita}}, {{lang-en|With Marshall Tito}}) is a [[Yugoslav Partisan]] anthem about Marshal and president of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] [[Josip Broz Tito]], written by [[Vladimir Nazor]] and composed by [[Oskar Danon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=118576&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the [[Ustaše]] regime in German-sponsored [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) claimed origins from [[Goths]] (i.e., [[Ostrogoths]], see also [[Origin hypotheses of the Croats|theories about origin of Croats]]), instead of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Malcolm]], Bosnia: A Short History (1994), Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; which would make them "[[Aryan race|Aryans]]", and closer to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. The middle stanza of this song addresses that by outright refutal of Gothic theory and by reaffirming the Slavic origins of all [[South Slavs]].

nas neće ni pakao smest'.&lt;br&gt;
Mi dižemo čelo, mi kročimo smjelo&lt;br&gt;
i čvrsto stiskamo pest.

Slavenstva smo drevnoga čest.&lt;br&gt;
Ko drukčije kaže, kleveće i laže,&lt;br&gt;
Našu će osjetit' pest.

With Marshall Tito, the heroic son&lt;br&gt;
not even Hell shall stop us.&lt;br&gt;
We raise our foreheads, we walk boldly&lt;br&gt;

Of an ancient kindred we are, but Goths we are not&lt;br&gt;
Part of ancient Slavdom are we.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever says otherwise slanders and lies,&lt;br&gt;
will feel our fist.

All the fingers upon our hands, through misery and suffering&lt;br&gt;
The Partisans awareness has created.&lt;br&gt;
And now when we should, to the sun, to the sky,&lt;br&gt;
We raise our fists high.

With great Marshall Tito, our land's bravest hero,&lt;br&gt;
We'll be even stronger than [[Hell]]!&lt;br&gt;
We raise our heads bravely, and not hung down gravely,&lt;br&gt;
And clench our fists hard as well.

We're from an ancient tribe, but [[Goths]] we don't ascribe,&lt;br&gt;
As we're children of ancient [[Slavs]].&lt;br&gt;
He who says otherwise merely slanders and lies,&lt;br&gt;
And surely will face our wrath.

All fingers on our hands will fight to save our lands,&lt;br&gt;
As the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisans]] are always spry.&lt;br&gt;
When we die we don't cry to the sun or the sky,&lt;br&gt;
We just raise our fists on high.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

==Modern pioneers==
Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''.

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol''].

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W. Caulkings in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arch.uiuc.edu/organizations/wia/timeline/bethunelouise.html "Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913)"], ''Women in Architecture (University of Illinois)''.

Another early practicing architect in the United States was [[Emily Williams (architect)|Emily Williams]] (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to [[San Francisco]] where she studied drafting at the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|California High School of Mechanical Arts]]. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[http://www.womenarchitectsca.com/sample-biographies/emily-williams/ Inge S.

[[Theodate Pope Riddle]] (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''.

A notable pioneer of the early days was [[Josephine Wright Chapman]] (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of [[Tuckerman Hall]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuckermanhall.org/chapmanfull.pdf "Josephine Wright Chapman and Tuckerman Hall"], ''Tuckermanhall.org''.

Romanian architect [[Virginia Andreescu Haret]] (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in [[Italy]]. 
She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park. She often used Native American motifs (and artisans) while blending the regional [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] and [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Pueblo Revival Style]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=6694&amp;AT=1 A.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=3438 "Lönn, Wivi (1872 - 1966)"], ''Biografiakeskus''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Hongell]] (1867–1952), from Finland's [[Åland Islands]], became a special student at Helsinki Industrial School in 1891 at a time when only men could attend the institution. Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a "master builder" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the [[Mariehamn]] district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariehamn.ax/Kulturforvaltningen/Stadens_historia/Hilda_Hongell_ "Hilda Hongell"], ''Mariehamns stad''. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907. Retrieved 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Morgan]] (1872–1957) was more successful as she was the first woman to receive a degree in architecture from the École des Beaux-Arts. She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman architect licensed in California. [[Mary Rockwell Hook]] (1877–1978) from [[Kansas]] also traveled to study architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts where she suffered from discrimination against women after sitting for examinations.  She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in [[Kentucky]] as well as a number of buildings in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html "Mary Rockwell Hook"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''.

[[Esther Hill|Esther Marjorie Hill]] was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.

==European developments==
After Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In [[Norway]], the first female architect was [[Lilla Hansen]] (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (''Den Kongelige Tegneskole'') in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lilla_Hansen/utdypning "Lilla Hansen"], ''Store Norske Leksikon''. {{no icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to run an architecture practice in [[Germany]] was [[Emilie Winkelmann]] (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the [[University of Hanover|College of Technology]] in [[Hanover]] (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war. One of her most notable buildings is the Tribüne theatre in [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], originally a girls school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/bezirk/winkelmann.html "Emilie Winkelmann, Architektin"], Lexikon: Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf von A bis Z, ''Berlin.de''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to become an engineer in [[Germany]] was Serbian architect [[Jovanka Bončić-Katerinić]]. She received her degree from the [[Technical University of Darmstadt]] in 1913. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/2013/38/erste-ingenieurin-frauen-karriere|title=Ingenieurswissenschaften: Fräulein Diplom-Ingenieur|work=ZEIT ONLINE|access-date=2018-05-25|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Serbia]], [[Jelisaveta Načić]] (1878–1955) studied architecture at the [[University of Belgrade]] at a time when it was felt that women should not enter the profession. At the age of 22, she was the first woman to graduate from the Faculty of Engineering. As a woman, she was unable to obtain the ministerial post she sought but gained employment with the [[Belgrade|Municipality of Belgrade]] where she became chief architect. Among her notable achievements are the well-proportioned Kralj Petar I (King Peter I) elementary school (1906) and the Moravian-styled Alexander Nevsky Church (1929), both in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajkaca.blogspot.com/2009/01/alexander-nevsky-church-in-belgrade_12.html "Alexander Nevsky Church in Belgrade"], Nothing Against Serbia.

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings. And when doing competitions we used to take trips, like long train journeys, because we found that changing your environment affects your thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20080424/breaking-the-modernist-mold David Sokol, "Breaking the Modernist Mold: Raili Pietilä reflects on a life of design with her husband, Reima, and the new exhibition that examines the Pietilä legacy"], ''Metropolismag.com'', 24 April 2008.

* French architect and designer [[Charlotte Perriand]] (1903–1999) established a partnership with an icon of [[modern architecture]], [[Le Corbusier]], contributing to the development of functional living spaces, especially by designing interiors and furniture for his buildings. She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

In addition to designs of her own including many streamlined private homes, it was Elizabeth who ran the firm in her husband's absence during the Second World War and while he was busy constructing the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. The architectural historian Jane King Hession remarked: "By her example she inspired many women in architecture, myself included, but she didn't want to be known as a woman architect — just as an architect who happened to be a woman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2010/08/then-and-now-old-gray-heads-part-two.html "Then and Now: 'Old Gray Heads,' part two -- Elizabeth Close"], ''University of Minnesota Press''.

She worked for various architectural firms in [[Australia]] (1931-1936) and the UK (1937), and traveled Europe meeting many key Modernist architects. After working for others again in Australia (1938), she formed an architectural firm, Romberg &amp; Shaw, with the Modernist architect [[Frederick Romberg]]. The firm operated from 1939 to 1942.

*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's influence==

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony in Helen Tierney (ed.), ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Vol. 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 104–108.

Routledge, 2003. pp. xiv–xv. {{ISBN|9780415284493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annmarie Adams]], Peta Tancred. ''Designing Women: Gender and the Architectural Profession'', University of Toronto Press, 2000,, pp. 3–5. {{ISBN|9780802082190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Australia 
A study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in [[Queensland]] to 18.2% in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
More recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'half-life' of women architects - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/the-half-life-of-women-architects/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|publisher = |last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|last2 = Clark|first2 = Justine|authorlink2 = Justine_Clark|date = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 1: at school - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-at-school/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 2: at work - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-2-at-work/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 3: Institute membership - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-3-institute-membership/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;South Africa
In 2016 only 21% of the architectural professionals registered in [[South Africa]] were women. A survey by the [[South African Institute of Architects|SA Institute of Architects]] Eastern Cape institute showed that in 2014 only 29% of architecture students graduating from [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Only 21% of SA architects are women - what can be done? |url =https://www.property24.com/articles/only-21-of-sa-architects-are-women-what-can-be-done/24574 |publisher = Property24 |accessdate = 2018-10-01 |date=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United Kingdom 
A United Kingdom survey in 2000 stated that 13% of practising architects were women although women comprised 38% of students and 22% of teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectureau.com/articles/women-in-architecture/ Karen Burns, "Women in architecture"], ''ArchitectureAU''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the Fees Bureau in November 2010 showed, however, that only 19% of professional architects were women, a drop of 5% since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructingequality.co.uk/faq-s/news/u%E2%80%98alarm%E2%80%99asnumberofwomenarchitectsfallsforfirsttimeinnearlyadecadentitledpost Chrissi McCarthy, "Alarm as number of women architects falls for first time in nearly a decade"], ''Constructing Equality'', 11 November 2010. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
In the United States, the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] reported in 2009 that 41% of architecture graduates were women while the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] National Associates Committee Report from 2004 gives the percentage of licensed female architects as 20%. In 2003, an AIA Women in Architecture study found that women accounted for 27% of staff in U.S. architecture firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aia.org/aiarchitect/2009/11/calling_all_women_finding_the.html Alexis Gregory, "Calling All Women: Finding the Forgotten Architect"], ''AIArchitect'', November 12, 2009.
